ANNO DO. M.D.LXXII.

TO THE MAY NOBILL AND WORTHY Lord, Iohne Earl of Mar, Lord Erskin, and
Regent to the Kingis Majesty, his Realm and liegis, zour humbill subject
David Fergusson, wischis the favor and lufe of God throuch Christ our Savior,
togidder with prosperous Gouernament and all felicity.
ALBEIT my mind nor purpois was not (richt Nobill and worthy Lord) to have
publischit this sermon at any time, zit because it did not fructify as I
supposit it should have done, being (as sayis Ezechiel) like a tone or pleasant
sang to the heirers for a season, their hartis in the mean time still going
after their covetousness, prouokit also be the malicious toungis of su^, and
eirnestly requeistit be vtheris. At lenth I was compellit (for farther
instructioun of the negligent heireris, the stopping of the mouthis of evil
speikeris, and the satisfactioun of the incessant requeistis of good and godly
men) to bestow and spend sum time and travel, to put it in that same form and
ordour, that it was spokin and preichit in befoir zour Grace. Quhilk quhe^ I
had faithfully performit (as all they that hard it, quhen they sall reid it
agane I trow will testify) distrusting mine awin judgment I presentit it to
the Kirk now laitly assemblit in Perth the sext of August that they quha (for
the may part) were heireris of it micht judge asweil of the soundnes of the
doctrine contenit into it, as of my sincerity in the writing thairof, and sa
micht allow, or disallow it, as it meritit, unto the quhilk besines the Kirk
appointit Iohne Erskin of Dun Superintendent of Angus, M. Iohne Douglas Bischop
of Sanctandrois, M. Iohne Winram Superintendent of Stratherne, M. Knox Minister
of Edinburgh, and Williame Christison Minister of Dundie, quha diligently red
and approuit the same, subscriuing it with their handis, in the Name of the
haill Kirk, as a Sermon consonant and aggreabill to Goddis word. Quhairof I
have takin bauldnes to publische it and that, under zour Graces name (to quhome
the patrocinie and defense of godlynes and vertew belangis) to ye end it may be
the mair acceptabil to good me^, Romans 13.
and that wickit men may be the mair affrayit to calumniate or defame it, not
that I greitlie regaird the judgment of men, having the testimony of a good
conscience for my warrant, 2. Cor. 4.
bot that I judge it profitabill to seik all ordinary meanis that be lawful to
mantene the treuth and promot Goddis glory.

Zour humanity and gentilnes, quhairof not only I, bot almaist all other men,
have experience, muifis me to be sa hamely as to offer and dedicate sa small a
wark unto zour Grace, douting nathing but that ze will accept and regaird it
rather according to the quality and substance thairof nor according to the
quantity of it or ye person of the writer: quhilk quhen I sall understand it
will provoke and encourage me to present zour Grace sum day with a greiter wark
and a larger Volume as a perpetual monument of my vnfenzeit lufe and affection
to zour Grace. The Lord Jesus preserve ye Kingis Majesty, comfort and assist
zow yt ze may be a bill to execute zour charge to the glory of God and the
commodity of this pure Realm. Amen. From Dunfermlyne the 20. day of August.
Anno 1572. Be zour Graces humbil subject and daily Orator.

THE TEXT.
FROM the dayis of zour Fatheris, Verse. 7.
ze ar gone away from mine ordinances, and have not keipit the^: return unto
me, and I will return unto zow, says ye Lord of hosts: but ze said, quhairin
sal we return? Will a man spoil his Godis? 8.
Zit have ze spoiled me: But ze say, quhairin have we spoiled thee? In teindis
and offeringis. Ze ar cursed with a curse: 9.
for ze have spoiled me, euin this whole Natioun.

Bring ze all the teindis into the stoirhous, 10.
that their may be meat in mine house, and prove me now heir with, says the
Lord of Hosts, if I will not oppin the windows of heuin unto zow, and power
zow out a blyssing without measure.

11.
And I will rebuke the deuourer for zour sakes, and he sall not distroy the
fruit of zour ground nether sall zour wine be barren in the field, says the
Lord of Hosts.

12.
And all Nation is sall call zow blissed: for ze salbe a plesand land says the
Lord of Hosts.

THE ARGUMENT.
LIKE as the wise and trusty Medecineris, or the faithful and true
Chirurgianis do not luke sa mekle (in ministratioun of their Phisik or in
applicatioun of their Salues and Plaisteris) unto the present pleasure or pane
of their patientis, as unto their profit, sa intend I this day nouther sa
mekle to avoid or seik any of their two, as to profit the body of Christ
(quhilk is his Kirk) tuiching that maledie and sair, Ephesians. 1.
quhilk in my Judgment, at this present may chiefly vexis and anoyis it, not
that I count my self abill or sufficient sa to do, but that being callit to
occupy this place, in traveling to do it, I may schaw my good will and frelie
utter my mind, in this matter unto zow all, Proverb 16.
according to gods word, leuing the incres to him that wirkis all thingis to
his glory and the commodity of them that lufe him, Romans ^.
and thairfoir that I may the mair co^modiously perform my purpois I have
chosin this Text of Scripture, now red in zour audience, preichit of auld be
the Prophet Malachie unto the Kirk of God, The ordour or diuisioun of this text.
in the like stait that we now ar in, the principal partis quhairof ar their,
first he perswadis the^ to repentance with

From the dayis of zour Fatheris, ze ar

The purpois of our Prophet is, first of all (as I have said) to persuade his
brethren the Iewis to repentance and conuersioun to God, of quhais grace and
mercy only it was, that their name and natioun was to be found in eirth,
vnrutit out and co^sumit, as they ar taucht in the verse precedant, but because
it is but lost laubour to crave repentance of them that think not them
selfis guilty, acknawledges na fault co^mittit, nor estemis that they have any
neid of amendment, Thairfoir he dois let them understand their estait and
that they of all other men, had may neid of repentance and amendment of
life, because they were not only transgressouris of Goddis Law them selfis, but
also, that both they and their Fatheris befoir them, had unto that day
departit from the haly ordinances and Lawis of the Lord, sa that this was na
uncouth or new thing that happinnit unto the^, but ane inueterat and auld evil
quhilk from age to age they were inclynit and naturally geuin unto, in the
quhilk they did euin then still continue, following in that case their
progenitouris, quhome they in their maneris na les viuely resemblit then gif
they had remanit them selfis alive unto that hour, forasmekle as in the^
planelie appeirit that same stifneckitnes and vncircumcisioun of hartis and
earis, quhair with their Fatheris (as sayis the constant Martyr Steuin) alwayis
resistit the haly Gaist, Act. 7.
we se then brethren that the Prophetis purpois is not only to convict them of
defectioun from God, but also to let them understand that it was als natural
for them to rebel aganis God, as to be their fathers sonnis, for, as we use
to say, they had it be kind and coft it not, and zit sa far absent were they
from acknawledgeing of this, yt they almaist, culd never be brocht to grant it,
no not then, quhen it was euin bound, as it were, on their backis. Of this we
leirne, that lang custom to sin, is a thing may pernicious, for it makis
that thing, quhilk of the self, is may abominable to appeir nathing to them
that are hantit thairwith, specially if God defer punischment any quhyle, for
then beginnis man to flatter him self, to abuse the patience of God, and to
wrap him self in that cairles and may perrillous perswasioun, that God
regairdis not his doingis, nor is thairwith sa heichly offendit as the
Scripture beiris, and sa procedis to heap sin upon sin until ye day of
wraith, zea, thairof cu^mis it (as sayis Solomon) that the hartis of men, ar
fully set in them to do evil because sentence aganis ane evil wark is not
speedily execute, Romans 2.
for this cause, Ecclesi. 8.
the Prophet first trauellis to walkin up their pepill from this wickit
perswasioun that his exhortatioun to repentance micht tak the better effect.

Unto the exhortatioun to repentance, quhairin the Lord desyris the^ to return
to him, is addit a promeis, to wit, that he will return unto them, that they
thairby may be assurit that their repentance sall not be unprofitable, for as
it is, but lost laubour and a vane purpois, to persuade men to repent that
acknawledgis na fault (as we have said befoir) sa na les vane is it to exhort
to repentance, albeit the sin were gra^tit, quhair their is na hope nor
assurance of mercy, for quhair na certitude of forgiveness is, bot only a bair
knawledge and horror of sin, the myndis of men ar rather thairby dreuin to
disperatioun nor to repentance, Genesis 3. 1. Sam. 26. and 31. 2. Sam 17. Math. 27.
as appeiris in Cain, Saull, Ahitophell, Judas and diueris vtheris. Thairfoir
amangis the chief articklis of our faith that are utterly necessar to be beleuit
unto saluatiou^ this ane amang the rest is cou^tit, namely, to believe, the
remissiou^ of sinnis. Of this place then, we leirne quhat is richt and true
repentance, to wit, conuersioun unto God, quhilk as it is the richt definitioun
of repentance, sa seruis it to confute ye conuersioun to creatures, and all the
vain theatricall toyis prescribit in papistrie to penitentis, quhair of I
mind not at this present particularly to speik, seeing that it is a co^moun
place continually taucht unto zow in the Catechism, and also because I purpois
to intreit ane other matter co^tenit in this Text mair at lenth.

Nouther is it to be pretermittit that the Prophet vpbraidis the pepill of his
time with the wickitnes and rebellioun of their foir fatheris, quhilk suppois
it appeir at the first to be discourteously and unjustly done, zit gif we
considder quhat manner of men he had to do with, we fall se that he was justly
mouit sa to do, for first the pepill yt he dealt with, were Hypocrites that
boistit and gloryit of the Richteousnes of their Fatheris, and under the
pretense thairof leuit may licentiously and wickitly, thinking it aneuch that
they were discendit of haly and verteous Fatheris. Thairfoir he is compellit to
lat them se quhat manner of men their Fatheris were, to the end that they micht
the mair eirnestly prepair the^ selfis to repentance, quhill they should se ye
cloik takin away quhilk they supposit yai had under the tytill of their
foirbearis. And in this sens do not only the Prophetis in the auld Testament,
Psalm. 78. Isai. 1. Ierem. 9. Zachary. 1. Mat. 3. and 23. John. 8. Act. 7.
frequentlie cast the faultis of the Fatheris, in the teith of the Iewis, bot
also Iohne ye Baptist, Christ and his Apostillis do the same in the new
Testament as in their sermonis and doctrine evidently appeiris. Secundly, their
pepill followit the futesteppis of their Fatheris in doing of evil, or ellis
the prophet wald not have dealt sa rigorously with them, for thocht a wickit man
(as sayis Ezechiell) beget a sone, Ezechi. 1^,
zit gif he fear and commit na sic wickitnes, his Fatheris impiety sall not
be laid to his charge, bot gif he follow his Fatheris evil exampill then will
the Lord visit the iniquity of the Father upon the sone. Exodus 10.
Thairfoir may justly (say I) ar their pepilis wickit Fatheris castin in their
teith because they ar found in ye like wickitnes.

Mairouer we have heirof to observe how vane a thing it is to boist of our
progenitouris, seeing that their ar nane of all our Fatheris, quhais lives being
straightly examinit but that their salbe found in them matter a neuch to their
co^dempnatioun, and also occasioun a neuch to abate that pride quhilk we are
wount fulischelie to consaue of their halynes, it teachis us also how far forth
we may without danger follow the^ yt have passit befoir us, to wit, sa far
forth as they obey God and his word, vtherwayis their exampill will not serve
to excuse us, because the langer that wickitnes continue, and the ma that do
commit it, it is the mair abhominabill in Goddis sicht, and the neirer unto
vengeance. And this mekle being spokin for the first part let us proceid to the
secund.

But ze said quhairin sall we return? etc. their wickitnes never attemptit)
namely sacrilege, in that they outher fraudule^tly retenit that quhilk was
sanctify it and dedicatit to God and to his worschip, or elis conuertit and
turnit the same to other vsis nor was appointit. Quhairin albeit they
monyfauldlie offendit, zit dois ye Prophet comprehend all under the name of
teindis and oblatiounis, because they specially were evil payit and withaldin
from Godis Ministeris the Preistis and Leuitis, Nam. 18.
to quhome the teindis, oblatiounis, and first frutis appertenit be the Law of
God, beside all other thingis that the Lord appointit unto them asweil for the
Sacrifices, Deuteronomy. 14. Deuteronomy. 18. Joshua. 13. Ezechi. 44.
their a win sustentatioun, as for the releif of the pure. And thairfoir had
they na other inheritance in Israel, then to defraud them thairof it was nane
other thing bot to spuilze them of that quhilk God had geuin them as ane
heritage for their service qubairwith they seruit him in the Tabernackle of the
Congregatioun, quhairunto they had als good richt as any man in Israel had to
his field or Wynezaird.

Notwithstanding the pepill, vnmyndefull of their dewtie, after their returning
out of Babylon, dealt sa vnmercyfullie with the pure and sa nigardlie and
fraudule^tlie with the Preistis, that the pure were compellit to lay their
Winezairdis and their housis in wed for corn to eit in their necessity, Nehe.
5.
and sum also maid bondmen and slaves of their sonnis and douchteris for money
to pay the Kingis tribute, zea, and the Levites for laik of their portiounis
left their offices, sa that the house of God was forsakin as it is writtin in
the buik of Nehemiah. Nehe. 13.
Of this fraud, negligence, and cauldnes, I dout not bot the pepill had their
excusis, as the poverty that they were brocht to in their banischment, the
greit expensis maid in reedefying the town and Tempill, togidder with the
continual warris, incursiounis and hostility yt they sustenit of their
nichtbouris to their greit and importabill charges, zea, and that the (...) to
quhome chiefly their thingis did belang, were unworthy of them, being negligent
in their offices and of corrupt conuersatiounis, as appeirit in their marriages
with the Heathen and familiarity with them to the greit hinderance of ye wark
of God. Ezra. 10.
Their excusis, Nehe. 6. and 13
I say, thocht the pepill micht have pretendit zit dois the Lord admit nane of
the^, but may schairplie rebukis and conuictis them of ye horribill crime of
sacrilege, quhilk also be dois aggrauat be a comparisoun, quhairin he
co^ferris him self with the Idolis of the Natiounis, and the ingrate behavior
of Israel to him with the observance and fidelity of the Gentiles to their
falls Godis. Will a man (sayis he) spoil his Godis? Zit ze have spoylit me: In
this sens also dois ye Prophet Jeremy, Ierem. 1.
aggrage, the inco^stancie and defectiou^ of their fatheris from God, in their
wordis. Go ze to the Isles of Ch^^^im and behauld, and send unto Kedar and tak
diligent heid, and se quhidder their be sie thingis. Hes any Natioun cha^geit
their Godis? quhilk zit are na Godis, Bot my pepill have changeit their glory
for that quhilk dois na profit. etc. Sum thinkis that the word, Godis,
signifyis in this place Iudgeis or Magistratis, unto quhome the Lord compairis
him self, ressoning with ye pepill after this sort. What man is sa schameles or
sulehardie that dar be sa bauld as to spoil his Judge, King or Magistrate?
quhilk zit ar bot men (suppois, be ressoun of their office, Psalm. 82.
I have communicate my Name to them calling the^ Godis and Children of the
may heich) And zit sa greit is zour monstrous audacitie, that ze dar spuilze
me quhilk am zour Lord Eternal and only true God. This interpretatioun is not
altogidder to be reiectit, forasmekle as it hes na inconvenience nor absurdity
in it, zit dois the first (in my Judgment) better expres the prophetis mind,
and mekle mair dois aggrauat the pepillis crime. For was it not a horribill
thing to se the Heathen Idolateris mair deuoit, reverent, and faithful to
their Idolis and falls Godis nor the Jews were, to him that only is the verray
true God? Cicero de natura deorum
And zit sa it was, for as their is na Natioun sa barbarous or beistly, that
hes not this perswasioun, that their is a God, sa quhat sa ever they anis set
up to them selfis for God, that they obstinatlie hauld still in reverence and
estimatioun, using nouther fraud nor gyle, nor zit spairing any expe^sis about
ye thingis that they have dedicate to their honor, bot Israel that knew God
or (as the Apostle sayis) rather were knawin of God, Gala. 4.
and understood their dewtie toward him be the reuelatioun of his will co^tenit
in his word, defraudit him of his honor, and spuilzeit him of ye thingis
appointit to his worschip. And because they wald not be estemit sic me^ they
quer ell still with the Prophet na les proudly nor they had done befoir,
demanding of him zit anis agane quhat their offense was, Quhairin (say they)
have we spoylit the? Thairfoir without any parable he planely pronunces them
guilty of sacrilege in yt they had spuilzeit the Lord in teindis and
offeringis.

Heirof then Brethren we observe that God countis him self spuilzeit of yt
quhilk was with haldin from the Preistis and Leuitis, Act, 17.
not that their cu^mis any utility unto him thairof (for he neidis na thing of
ouris, nouther eitis he the flesche nor drinkis ye blude of Bullis nor Goatis
as sayis the Psalmest) bot because the Lord had ordanit that the Preistis and
the pure should live of the teindis, Psalm. 50.
and that the first frutis of all thingis should be offerit unto him in
remembrance that all thingis were ressauit of him, thairfoir justly callis he
the teindis and oblatiou^is his, Leuit 27.
specially being now sanctifyit unto him and appointit to his worschip, of the
quhilk also he is spuilzeit, quhe^saeuer yai ar with haldin or applyit to any
other use. Nouther culd their pepill excuse their fraud be the unworthiness of
the Preistis, for gif they had only thairwith been offe^dit, doutles they wald
have eirnestly socht for reformatioun, quhilk thing they did not, quhairof it
appeiris that all this abuse procedit of their a win private, auaritious, and
corrupt affectiounis, quhilk maid the^ in this ane sin monyfauldlie to
tra^sgres. For first, they schew them selfis to have Exodus 25.
in that they were cauld, slaw, and negligent to make any coist to mantene those
thingis quhairby God seillit up his presence and habitatioun amang them.
Leuit. 7.
Secu^dly, they manifestly brak Godis Law Number. 18.
faith fully to pay their thingis to the preistis and Leuitis. Thridly, they were
ingrate and unthankful Dut. 2^.
Fourtly, their auaritious impiety is evident in this, vnmercyfulnes,
defrauding the pure of their sustentatioun appointit unto them of God. (...).
14.


Bot ane micht think, quhat neidis all their wordis quha knawis not yt the
teindis and oblatiounis were ordanit be God to sustene the Preistis and Leuitis
in the auld Testament, and that their pepill were worthily rebukit of the Prophet
for withhalding of them, bot quhat belangis that to us? I answer, that as we
subscriue the Prophetis doctrine and with him this day co^depne their pepil, sa
gif we will examine our selfis, we sal find their schooe (as we use to say) meit
aneuch for our fute, and our tra^sgressioun in this point to be nathing
inferior unto thairis. For suppois the Leuiticall Preistheid be abrogatit zit
hes ye Lord a Kirk for quhais edificatioun he hes ordanit Ministeris, Heb. 7.
and 8.
Pastouris, and Teicheris, quha aucht, Ephesians. 2.
be the ordinance of Christ him self to have their reward for their labor,
Math. 10
quhairunto the Apostle wrytand to the Corinthianis aggreis, Luke 10.
affirming, (...) Lord hes ordanit, that they quhilk preich the Gospel should
live of the Gospel. ^ Cor. 9.
And as for the pure, Deuteronomy. ^5.
both Moses and our Master do witness that we fall never want them, quhome
also we are bound to sustene and charitabillie to provide for. Math. 2^. John.
12.
How cairfullie, the Primative and first Kirk under the Gospel, prouydit for
their Ministeris and the pure, Act. 2.4.5.^. and 14.
the Actis of ye Apostillis and paulis Epistillis do testify, quhairin we se
every Congregatioun not only cairful for their a win pure, Romans 15. 1. Cor. 16.
bot also reddy to releif ye necessity of the pure sanctis that dwellit far
from them. 2. Cor. 8 and 9 1. Cor. 9. 1. Timo. ^.
Their Ministeris also with their famileis were honorabilly sustenit in all
thingis necessary, thocht sum of zow have spokin in derisioun, that suppois ze
be bound to sustene the Minister, quhat to do have ze with his wife and
children? Brethren for my part I wald ze had Angelis to zour Ministeris gif ze
were worthy of them, or that it were the will of God, bot seeing that God willis
not so, bot that ze salbe seruit be the Ministry of men, it behouis zow to
tak them as they ar, with all thingis yt of necessity belangis unto them or
lawfully dependis on them, 1. Timo. 3.
sie as are wyfes, children and family, quhilk not only must be honestly
reulit and the children haldin under obedience with all honesty (as Paul
teichis) bot also must be prouydit for hospitality, Titus. 2.
quhilk all men knawis requyris both foirsicht and expensis. Ze se then that
the Ministeris of the primative Kirk (that leuit befoir Princes were Christianes
and nurischers of the Kirk as it was Prophesyit) were na beggeris, Esaias. 40.
suppois they were no Lordis yt abou^dit in superfluous wealth as the Papis
Bishoppis did, bot had sufficient, as weill for the necessity of their a win
famileis, Act. 21.
as for the help of other Christianes, that now and then, as occasiounis seruit
repairit to their housis. Efterward quhen the time come foirspokin be David
that Kingis and Empreouris and their Kingdoms should serve the Lord and bring
giftis unto him, Psalm. ^^. and ^2.
they prouydit for ye kirk. Not as the Heathen Idolateris did for their
Preistis, bot as the Eternal God of auld under the law prouydit for his
Ministeris, Romans 16.
to wit, that they should be mantenit with yt teindis, sa following his exampil
that only is wise, they ordanit be their authority yt the Teindis sulde serve
to the same use in the time of the Gospel, adding also of their a win
substance diueris vtheris rentis and possessiounis, making them yt taucht
them in the word of God, (according to the doctrine of the Apostle) pertakeris
of all their gudis. Gala. ^.
After this sort I say did the godly and christian Empreouris and Kingis
provide for the preicheris of the Euangell, the scuilis, the pure, the Kirkis,
and quhatsaeuer ellis belangit to the external worschip and service of God,
quhairupon all the substance befoir mentionit alwayis was spe^dit sa lang as
outher purity of doctrine, or the ancient severity of discipline remanit in
the visibill Kirk. Bot how sone that ever superstitioun enterit in and the
discipline decayit, the Kirk rentis also began to be mispendit, for sum were
sauld, sum set in few, sum reft be Tyrannis and wickit men, and the remane^t
was deuorit be the Locustis that come out of the smoke of ye bottomless pit,
Apoc. ^.
quhais Impiety albeit god hes reuelit, and banischit be the preiching of his
word from amang us, zit is not that substance quhilk they abusit restoirit
agane to the richt use, bot als profanely and wickitly spendit this day in
Scotland as ever it was.

Then the same accusatiounis and complaintis that God vsit, of auld, be his
Prophet aganis the Jews, serve this day aganis them that are like the Jews in
transgressioun, zea, they serve aganis us: For this day Christ is spuilzeit
amang us, quhil yt quhilk aucht to mantene the Ministry of the Kirk and the
pure, is geuin to profane men, The miserabill estait of the Kirk of Scotland.
flattereris in Court, Ruffianes and Hyrelingis. The pure in the mean time
oppressit with hounger, the Kirkis and Tempilis decaying for laik of Ministeris
and vphalding, and the schuilis utterly neglectit and ouersene. The pure and
sehuilis neglectit.
Are not their thingis so? Behald the wayis and streitis and ze sall se them (to
the greit dishonor of Christ and decay of the commoun wealth) replenischit with
beggeris and vnbrydilit zouth, Act. ^. and 4.
albeit na man amang us, that may not, nor can not sustene them selfis, should
be sufferit to laik. Our zouth also aucht to be nurischit and ma^tenit at the

ordinarlie laubourit with their handis. I speik to prudent men that may
understand and judge quhat I say: The Te^pilis decayit.
Bot now to speik of zour Te^pilis quhair the word of god should be preichit and
the Sacramentis Ministerit all me^ seis to quhat miserabill rewyne and decay
they ar cum, 1. Cor. 4.
zea, they ar sa prophanit, that in my conscience, gif I had been brocht up in
Germany or in any other country, quhair Christ is trewly preichit, and all
thingis done decently and in ordour according to Goddis word, and had hard of
that purity of Religioun that is amang zow, and for the lufe thairof, had
takin travel to visit this land, and then should have seen the foull deformity
and desolatioun of zour Kirkis and Tempilis, quhilk ar mair like to scheip
cottis then the housis of God. I culd not have iudgeit that their had been any
feir of God or richt Religioun in the may part of this realm? The Ministeris
neglectit and contempnit.
And as for the ministers of the word they ar utterly neglectit and cu^ in
manifest cotempt amang zow, ze Raill upon them at zour pleasure, of their
doctrine (gif it serve not zour turn and aggre not with zour appetytis) ze ar
becum impatient, and to be schort, we are now maid zour Tabill talk quhome ze
mock in zour mirrines, and threatin in zour anger. I am compellit to speik
this, thocht I be als plane as pleasant, and appeir to zow as the greitest fule
of yt rest to stand up heir to utter that quhilk other men thinkis, weil, let
me be cou^zit a fule for speiking the treuth, I regaird not, nouther may I
spair to speik it, thocht I should be Iudgeit, in our awin cause, to be carry it
away with particular affectiou^, following heirin the exampil of our Prophet
Malachie, Hieronimus in proemio super Malachia^ ad minerisi and Alexa^dru^
monachos, and in expositione Capitis. 3.
quha (gif credit may be geuin to Hierom) was Ezra the Priest, the staits of
quhais time, gif we mark his buik diligently, properly aggreis with this
prophecy. And zit thocht he was a priest, he sparit not, freely, at the
commandment of god, to rebuik them that defraudit the preistis of the teindis
and oblatiou^is appointit unto them. This is it that muisis me, let men judge
as they list, to lay out befoir zour eyis the miserabill estait of the pure
Kirk of Scotland, that thairby ze may be prouokit to pity it, and to restoir
the thingis, that iniustly ze spuilzie it of, leist the Lord require at zour
handis the blude of them that perische in default of the richt dispensatioun
of their thingis. I speik not this to provoke any private man to retene in his
hand that quhilk he is bound to pay to the possessouris of the beneficis,
because they mispend it, no, bot rather exhortis them faithfully to pay their
dewteis, and commit the punischement of the abuse to God that behaldis the
doingis of all men, Romans ^.
and will rewaird every man according to his warkis, Apoc. 22.
as appeiris in the wordis of the Text quhilk follow.

Ze ar Cursit with a Curse: for ze have spoylit me, euin this haill Natioun.
Because their pepill acknawledgeit nor felt not the gravity of their sin as they
aucht. The prophet puttis them in mind of the punischement that hidderto they
had sustenit thairfoir, namely, that they were cursit with a curse, signifying
that they were al manner of wayis miserabill and unhappy, and quhy? because not a
few of them, bot that haill Natioun had spuilzeit the Lord. How miserabill
their pepill were after their returning from Babell, Ezra. 4. and 5. Neha. 4.5.
and 6.
the bukis and prophesies of Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggay and Zechariah do witness,
Hagg. 1. and 2. Zechariah. 3
to wit, that they were only hatit and inuyit, of all the Natiounis adjacent,
quha continually socht their distructiou^ both be secreit dissaitis and oppin
Hostility, bot also were oppressit with Famine, derth and scarcity of all
thingis, quhilk maid them to complane, grudge, and murmr aganis God, as
thocht ye cause of their infelicitie had procedit of him. Quhairunto the Lord
heir answeris, as it were in their wordis, ze complane of zour misery bot ze
persaue not the cause, I grant that ze ar miserabill, zea, that ze ar cursit
and unhappy ma wayis then ane, bot the cause is in zour selfis that hes
spuilzeit me of that quhilk was dedicat to my honor, and thairfoir ze can not
be blyssit quhylo ze defraud me of yt quhilk is mine. That their pepill were
justly plaguit we all co^fes, bot wald God that we culd considder our a win
estait, apply this to our selfis and make our fruit thairof: For thocht all men
meruell at the cruel weiris, unfruitful seasounis, strange diseasis, derth,
famine, and other incommoditeis quhairwith ye world is oppressit. Zit they
considder not, that the may part of men ar sa inobedient and unthankful unto
God, that they deserve to be na better intreatit bot rather vorse. And to pas
by other Natiounis let us try our selfis, we profes Religioun, zit ar we
barrane of the frutis thairof: for euin they thingis without the quhilk
Religioun can not stand ar scarce to be found amang us, sic as ar faith,
innocence, purity of life, charity and Inuocatiou^ of Goddis name. And as
for the teindis and rentis of the Kirk, the almous of the pure, and sic thingis
as we are bound to bestow upon ye mantenance of Goddis honor and richt
Religioun (thocht we be prodigal in other thingis) zit in them ar we
negligent, called, fraudulent, gredie and nigard. For as sumtyme Kingis, Prencis,
Lordis and other potent me^ liberally inrichit the Kirk, sa now be the contrair
all their travel is to satiate their gredynes with the spuilze thairof. Can
the world then luik for any prosperity, happynes, tranquillity, or
benedictiou^ from God, quhyle they thus neglect his honor? Na surely, Ze
meruel, I dout not, quhy ze have not preuailit aganis zone throtcutteris and
unnatural murthereris within the Town and Castle of Edinburgh, specially ze
having a may just actioun, being ma in number and mair vailzeant men, and
nathing inferior to them in wisdom, circumspectioun, or any good qualiteis
outher of body or of mind, bot ceis to meruell: for the cause quhy that ze have
not preuailit aganis them lang or now, ama^g money other zour sinnis quhair
with ze ar defylit, is this, that the spuilze of the pure is in zour housis,
Esaias. 3.
ze inuaid the possessioun of that quhilk appertenis not unto zow, and that
quhilk our foirbearis gave of gudezeill to Goddis honor and the commou^ wealth
of the Kirk, ze spuilze to zour a win private vsis without outher ryme or
ressoun, nouther will ze be controllit. This, this, I say, is the chief cause yt
nathing prosperis in zour ha^dis, gif thairfoir ze wald yt ever God should decoir
zow with that honor to be his instrumentis to clenge this land from the
innocent blude quhairwith it is pollutit, and the fylthie murthereris
quhairwith it is infamit and defylit: Clenge then zour handis of all impiety,
specially of sacrilege quhairby ze spuilze the pure, the schuilis, the
Tempilis, and Ministeris of Goddis word, zea, Christ him self, I grant that our
Fatheris of Immoderat zeill (beside the teindis and necessary rentis of the
Kirk) gave thairunto superfluously, and mair nor aneuch, Quhat then is to be
done? Bot that the Preicheris of Goddis word be ressonabillie sustenit, seeing
that their is aneuch and over mekle to do it, the schuillis and the pure be
weill prouydit as they aucht, and the Tempilis honestly and reverently
repairit, that the pepill without injury of wynd or wedder may sit and heir
Goddis word, and participat of his haly Sacrame^tis. And gif their restis any
thing vnspendit quhen this is done (as na dout their will) in the name of God
let it be bestowit on the nixt necessary affairis of the commoun wealth, and
not to any mannis private commodity. Except ze ^o this God will not be with
zow, nouther can ze have any prosperity, bot the end of a cummer salbe the
beginning of ane other, bot gif ze will be obedient to his voice he will be
with zow, and blys all the warkis of zour handis, Leuit. ^6. Deuteronomy. 2^.
as he hes promysit in his word, quhairof we fall have better occasioun to
speik in the third heid of our Text unto the quhilk let us now proceid: weary
not I pray zow, suppois the time be almaist spendit for I sall not be lang.

be sufficient also for all other thingis that he had appointit in his Law to
be done, quhairof we have spokin at lenth afoir. This is it that the Lord
requyris of their pepill, and exhortis them to prove him heir withal. Quhidder
gif he will not oppin unto them the wyndois of heuin. etc. Behald deir Brethren
the bountifulnes and familiarity of our God toward us, yt this way subiectis
his fidelity to our trial, binding him self be promeis to reco^pance and that
largely, quhatsaeuer is bestow it on his service, thocht he be detter to no
man, nor zit hes any commodity of our oblatiou^is (as we have said afoir) for
nouther dwellis he in Tempilis maid with ha^dis, Act. 7. and 17.
nor zit hes he any neid that our gudis be spendit on him, Psalm. 10.
bot all the external worschipping is ordanit be him for the nurischement of
our faith, quha be eirthlie thingis mon be taucht piece and piece to understand
heuinly thingis that thairunto be them, we may be led, as it were, be the hand.
For us then, I say, is the external exercise of Religioun, and all the
expensis that is maid thairupon ordanit, and not for him, and zit
notwithstanding in exhorting us to be liberal in that quhilk cu^mis altogidder
to our a win profit, he speiks als submissiuely as it were a borower making
requeist to a lenner, that wald say, len me, I pray zow, sic a sum of money
or samekle victual to sic a day and prove my credit thairwith, quhidder gif I
will not thankfully pay zow agane and yt with profit. O the meruellous and
vnspeikabill cair that the Lord hes over us and our Saluatioun.

Bot let us heir with quhat benefitis he promysis to recompance them gif they
will do their dewtie. First, he promysis to oppin the wyndowis of heuin unto
them, he sayis not that he will oppin a wyndow, bot in the plural number
wyndowis, signifying, that he will cause all thingis that they have neid of
thairoutof to flow unto them in all abundance. Secundly, that the blyssingis
quhilk he will power out of heuin upon them, sall produce and bring forth
fruit out of the eirth (not simply to satisfy their neid) bot mekle mair,
zea, it salbe bezond measure. Thridly, he promysis that not only sall the heuin
and the eirth mutually aggre togidder, (as sayis ye Prophet Hosea) to produce
all thingis abundantly unto them, Hosea. 2.
bot also quhen they ar producit he sall preserve them from all thingis that
may hinder them from cumming to maturitie and perfectioun, quhidder it be
noysum beistis or vnseasonabill wedder. Finally, he promysis sa to deill with
them that the profane and godles Natiounis salbe compellit to acknawledge
them for a happy and a blyssit pepill in quhome Goddis liberal blyssingis and
benefitis sa sall abound, that the plesandnes, fertility and fruitfulnes of
their land sall allure all men to lufe it and to desire to dwell in it.

Of this we note from quhence cummis abundance of victual, incres of frutis,
and all other prosperity to man, certanely not from the elementis abuse, nor
from the earth beneth, nor zit from ma^nis laubour, (for the heuinis as sayis
Jeremy can give na schouris, Jeremiah. 14
and then of force it mon follow that the earth salbe barrane and ma^nis
laubour loist) from nane of their thingis then procedis ma^nis happynes, bot
from God only in quhais hand is the brydill yt moderatis all thingis, quha also
(quhen man is obedient to him) makis all his creaturis to serve him, Job. 5.
zea, the stanis of the field (as sayis Job) to be in league with him, and the
beistis of the field to be at peace with him. And be the contrary quhe^ men ar
inobedient to God they ar cursit in all that ever they put their hand unto,
Deuteronomy. 28.
and all the creaturis of God ar enemeis unto them, zea, the heuin geuis them
nouther dew nor rain, nor the earth any fruit mair nor they were maid of Iron
and brass. Leuit. 26.
Let us then brethren feir God, reverence and worsship him as he hes commandit
and be zealous to mantene his honor with all our poweris and substance, and sa
sal he prosper our interprysis to his glory and our comfort, bot gif we be
disobedient to him, cairles and negligent of his honor, his plagues can not
depart from us, for he will honor them that honor him, and power contempt
upon them yt lichtly him. 1. Samuel. 2.
Langer at this present, seeing that the time faillis me I will not hald zow,
bot beseikis zow all, and principally zow may Nobill and worthy Personages
to pre^t their thingis in zour myndis to zour profit, to suffer the wordis of
exhortatiou^ patiently, H^^os. 13.
and tak in good worth yt quhilk is spokin, albeit it have been sumquhat rudely
and schairply vtterit, considdering that it procedit from the heart of him that
luifis and fauouris both zow and zour cause, remembering the saying of Solomon,
oppin rebuke is better then secreit lufe, Proverb. 26.
and the woundis of a lufer mair faithful then the kissis of ane enemy thocht
they be plesa^t. God grant that the wordis quhilk ze have hard with zour outward
eiris may be sa fixit in zour hartis, yt the fruit thairof may heir after
appeir to the glory of God, and ye commodity of his Kirk, quhilk he hes
redemit to him self be ye precious blude of his only and weilbelovit Sone Jesus
Christ our Lord and only Savior, to quho^e with the father and the haly Gaist
be perpetual praise, glory, and honor both now and for ever. Amen
