The Co^playnte of a lovers life

depiction of two people and tree

IN may when flora the fresshe lusty queen
The soil has clad in grene read and whyght
And phoebus began to shede his stremes shene
Amyd the bole with all the bemes bright
And lucyfer to chase away the night
Against the morrow our oryson has take
To bid out of her sleep awake
And hertes heavy for to reconforte
From sluggerdy and heavy nyghtes sorrow
Nature bad them rise and dysporte
Against the glad gray morrow
And hope also with saint Johan to borowe
Bad in dyspyte of danger and dyspayre
For to take the wholesome lusty air
And with a syghe I began for to abrayde
Out of my stombre and suddenly out sterte
As he alas that nyghe for sorrow did
My sykenesse sat aye so nyghe mine heart
But for to find socoure smerte
Or at the leest some release of pain
That me full sore held in every vain
I rose me up and thought I will anon
Unto the wood to here the birds sing
When that the mysty vapoure was agone
And clear and fair was the morning
The dew also lyenge like silver in shynynge
Upon the leaves as any bawme sweet
Till fyry tytan with his persaunt hete
Had dried up the lusty lycoure new
Upon the herbs in every grene mede
And that the flowers of many diverse hew
Upon their stalks began for to sprede
And for to splaye out their leaves on bread
Against the son gold borned in his spear
That down to them cast his bemes clear
And by a river forth I began costey
Of water clear as berell or crystal
Till at the last I found a little way
Toward a park enclosed with a wall
In compass round and by a gate small
Who so would freely might gone
In to this park walled with grene stone
And in I went to here the birds song
Which on the branches both in plain and vale
So loud song that all the world ronge
Like as it should shyuer in pieces small
And as me thought that the nyghtyngale
With so great might her voice began out wrest
Right as her hette for love would breast
The soil was plain smothe and wonder soft.
All over spredde with tapetis that nature
Had made herself colored eke alofte
With bows grene the flowers for to cure
That in her beauty they may not long endure
Fro all assaute of phoebus fervent fere
Which in his spear so hot is and so clear
The air attempre and the smothe wind
Of zephyrus among the blossoms white
So wholesome was and so nourysshynge by kind
That small buddes and round blomes lyte
In manner began of her brethe delight
To give us hope the air fruit shall take
Against autompne ready for to shake
I saw there daphene closed under rynde
Grene laurere and the wholesome pyne
The myrre also that wepeth ever of kind
The cedrys high as vpryght as a line
The phylberde eke that low does enclyne
Her bows grene to the earth down
Unto her knight I called demophowne
There saw I eke the fresshe hawthorne
In white moteley that so sweet does smell
Asshe / fyrre / and oak / with many a young acorne
And many a tree mo than I can tell
And me before I saw a little well
That had his course as I can behold
Under an hill with quycke stremes cold
The gravel gold the water pure as glass
The banks round the well enuyronnynge
And soft as velvet the young grass
That thereupon lustely began spring
The suit of trees about compassynge
Their shadow cast closing the well round
And all the herbs growing on the ground
The water was so wholesome and so vertuus
Thrughe might of herbs growing beside
That like the well where as nareyus
Slain was thrughe vengeance of cupyde
Where so couertely he did hyde
The grennes of death upon each brynke
That death might follow who that ever drink
Ne like the pytte of the pegate
Under pernase where poets slepte
Nor like the well of chastyte
Which dyane with her uymphes kept
When she naked in to the water lepte
That slew Acteon with his hands fell
Only for he came so nyghe the well
But this well that I here rehearse
So wholesome was that it would aswage
Swollen hertes and the venym perysshe
Of pensy shede with all the cruel rage
And evermore refresshe the vysage
Of them that were in any weryuesse
Of great labor or fall^n in dystresse
And I yt had thrughe danger and dysdayne
So dry a thyrste thought I would assaye
To taste a draught of this well or twain
My bitter langoure if it might alaye
And on che bank anon down I lay
And with mine heed in to the well I raught
And of the water I drank a good draught
Whereof me thought I was refresshed well
Of the brennynge that sat so nyghe my heart
That verily anon I began to ^ele
An huge part released of my smarte
And therwithall anon up I sterte
And thought I would walk and se more
yet forth in the Park and in the holtes hoar
And thrughe a launde as I yede apace A lovers life.
I began about fast to behold
I found anon a delectable place
That was beset with trees young and old
Whose names here for me shall not be told
Amyd of which stood an herber grene
That benched was with turues new and clean
This herber was full of flowers rynde
In to the which as I behold began
Between an ^^^re and a woodbynde
As I was ware I saw where lay a man
In black and white coulre pale and wan
And wonder deely also his hew
Of hurtes grene and fresshe wounds new
And evermore destreyned with sykenesse
Beside as this he was greuosly
For upon him he had a hot access
That day by day him shoke full pyteously
So that for constreynynge of his malady
And hertely woe thus lyenge all alone
It was a death for to se him groan
Whereof astonyed my foot I began withdraw
Gretely wonderynge what it might be
That he so lay and had no felawe
Ne that I could no wight with him se
Whereof I had ^^uth and eke pity
I began anon so softely as I could
Among the busshes me preuely to shroude
if that I might in any wise espy
What was the cause of his deedly woe
Or why that he so pyteously began cry
On his fortune and on his fever also
With all my might I laid mine ere to
Every word to mark what he said
Out of his swowne among as he brayde
But first if I shall make mencyon
Of his person and plainly him dyscryue
He was in sothe without any excepcyon
To speak of manhood one of the best alive
There may no man against troth strive
For of his time and of his age also
He proved was there men should have ado
For one of the best there of bread and length
So well made by good proporcyon
if he had be in his deliver strength
But thought and sykenesse were occasyon
That he thus lay in lamentacyon
Grouelynge on the grouude in place desolate
Sole by himself awaked and mate
And for me seems that it is sitting
His words all to put in remembrance
To me that herd all his complaining
And all the ground of his woeful chance
if there withal I may do pleasaunce
I will to you so as I can anon
Like as he said rehearse euerychone
But who shall help me now to complain
Or who shall now my style guide or led
Of Niobe let now the teres rain
In to my pen and eke help in this need
Thou woeful myrre that felest my heart blede
Of pyteous we and my hand eke quake
When that I write for this man's sake
For unto woe accords complaining
And doleful chere unto heaviness
To sorrow also syghynge and weeping
And pyteous mourning unto drerynesse
And who that shall write of dystresse
In party ^e^eth to know felyngely
Cause and rote of all such malady
But I alas that am of wit but dull
And have no knowing of such matere
For to dyscryue and write at the full
The woeful complaynte which that ye shall here
But even like as does a skryuenere
That can no more what that he shall write
But as his master beside does endyte
Right so fare I that of no sentemente
Say right naught as in conclusyowne
But as I herd when I was present
This man complained with a pyteons sown
For even like without addycyowne
Or dysencrease either more or less
For to rehearse anon I will me dress
And if that any now be in this place
That feel in love brennynge or feruence
Or hyndred were to his ladies grace
With false tongues that with pestylence
Sle true men that never did offense
In word ne deed ne in their entente
Yfony such be here now present
Let him of reuth lay to audyence
With doleful chere and sobre countenance
To here this man by full sentence
His mortal woe and his perturbaunce
Complaining now lyenge in a trance
With look up cast and rewfull chere
The fytte of which was as ye shall here
The thought oppressed with inward syghes sore
The paynfull life the body languysshynge
The woeful ghost the heart rent and and tore
The pyteous chere pale in complaining
The deedly face like ashes in shynynge
The salteteeres that fro mine eyes shall
Percell declare ground of my pains all
Whose heart is ground to blede on heaviness
The thought receyte of woe and of complaynte
The breast is chest of dole and drerynesse
The body eke so feeble and so feynte
With hot and cold mine acces is so meynte
That now I shyuer for defaute of hete
And hot as glede now suddenly I sweet
Now hot as fire now cold as ashes deed
Now hot for cold for hete again
Now cold as yse now as coals read
For hete I brenne and thus between twain
I passed am and all forcast in pain
So that my cold plainly as I feel
Of grievous cold is cause euerydele
This is the cold of inward high dysdeyne
Cold of dyspyte and cold of cruel hate
This is the cold that ever does busy pain
Against troth to fight and make debate
This is the cold that would the fire abate
Of true menynge alas the hard while
This is the cold that will me begyle
For ever the better the troth I mente
With all my might faithfully to serve
With heart and all to be dylygente
The less thank alas I began deserve
Thus for my truth danger does me sterue
For one that should my death of mercy let
Has made dyspyte now his sword to whet
Against me and his arowes to fyle
To take vengeance of wylfull cruelte
And tongues false thrughe their slyghty whyl*
Has begone a war that will not stynted be
And false envy of wrath and eunyte
Have conspyred ayenste all rygh and law
Of their malice that troth shall be slawe
And male bousche began first the tale tell
To selaunder truth of indygnacyon
And false report so loud range the bell
That mysbeleue and false suspeccyon
Have troth brought to his dampcyon
So that alas wrongefully he dies
And falsnes his place occupyeth
And entered is in to trouthes loud
And has thereof the full possessyon
O ryghtfull god that first the troth found
How may thou suffer such oppressyon
That falshede have iurysdyccyon
In trouthes right to sle him gylteles
In his fraunchyse he may not live in pes
Falsely accused and of his fone foriuged
Without answer while he was absente
He dampened was and may not be excused
For cruelte sat in judgment
Of hastynes without aduysemente
And bad dysdayne do execute anon
His Jugemente in presence of his fone
Attorney none ne may admytted been
To excuse truth a word to speak
To faith or oath the judge lust not to seen
There is no gain but he will be wreke
O lord of troth to the I call and clepe
How may thou se this in thy presence
Without mercy murdered innocence
Now god that art of troth sovereign
And see how I lie for truth bound
So sore I knytte in loves fyry chain
Even at ye death thrughe gyrte with many a wound*
That lykely am never for to sound
And for my truth am dampened to the death
And naught abide but draw alonge the breath*
Consider and se in thine eternal sight
How that my heart professed whylom was
For to be true with all my full might
Only to one the which now alas
Of volunte without more trespass
Mine accusers has taken unto grace
And cherysshed him my death for to purchase
What m^^eth this what is this wonder ^re
Of puruey aunce if I shall it call
Of god of love that false him so assure
And true alas adowne of the whele befall
And yet in sothe this is the (...)r^^e of all
That falshede wrongefully of troth has ye name
And troth ayenward us fa^^^ede bears ye blame
This blind chance this stormy adventure
In love has his most experyence
For who that does with troth most his cure
Shall for his mede find most offense
That serves love with all his dylygence
For who can feyne under louelyhede
Ne fails not to find grace and speed
For I loved one full long sith agone
With all my heart body and full might
And to be deed my heart can not gone
From his hest but hold that he has hight
Though I be banysshed out of her sight
And by her mouth dampened that I shall dye
Unto my behest yet ever obey will I
For ever sith that the world began
Who so list to look and in story read
He shall aye find that the true man
Was put abacke where as the falshede
Furthered was for love takes none head
To sle the true and has of him no charge
Where as the false goes freely at their large
I take record of Palamydes
The true man the noble worthy knight
That ever loved and of his pain no ^eles
Not withstanding his manhood and his might
None unto him did full great unright
For aye the better he did in cheualrye
The more he was hyndred by envy
And aye the better he did in every place
Thrughe his hye knyghthode and busy pain
The ferther was he fro his ladies grace
For to her mercy might he never attain
And to his death he could it not refrain
For to danger but aye obey and serve
As he best could plainly till he sterue
What was the fine also of Hercules
For all his conquest and worthynes
That was of strength alone pereles
For like as books list of him express
He set pyllers thrughe his hye prowess
Always at gades for to sygnyfye
That no man might him pass in cheualrye
The which pyles ben far be yonde ynde
Be set of gold for a rembraunce
And for all that was he set behind
With them that love lust febly to auaunce
For him set last upon a dance
Against whom help may not strife
For all his truth he lost his life
Phoebus also for all his persaunte light
When that he went here in earth low
Unto the earth with venus sight
I wounded was thrughe cupydes bow
And yet his lady list him not to know
Though for her love his heart did blede
She let him go and took of him none head
What shall I say of young Pryamus
Of true Trystram for all his high renown
Of achylles or of antonyus
Of arcyte of him palamowne
What was the end of their passyowne
But after sorrow death and than their grave
Lo here the guardon that lovers have
But false Jason with his doubleness
That was untrue at colcos to mede
And Terens rote of unkindness
And with these two eke the false Ene
Lo thus the false aye in one degree
Had in love their lust and all their will
And save falshede their was none other skyll
Of thebes eke the false arcyte
And demophon eke for his sloth
They had their lust and all that might delight
For all their falshede and great untruth
Thus ener love alas and that is ruth
His false legis furthereth what he may
And sleeth the true ungoodly day by day
For true Adone was slain with the bore
Amyd the forest in the grene shadow
For venus love he felt all the sore
But vulcanus with her no mercy made
The foul chorle and many nyghtes gladi
Where m^rs her knight and her man
To find mercy conforte none he can
Also the young fresshe Ipomones
So lusty fre and of his courage
That for to serve with all his heart he chese
Athalans so fair of her vysage
But love alas quyt him so his wage
With cruel danger plainly at the last
That with the death guardonles he past
Lo here the fine of lovers seruyse
Lo how love can his servants quyte
Lo how he can his faithful men despise
To slay the true man and false to respyte
Lo how he does the sword of sorrow byte
In hertes such as must his lust obey
To save the false and do the true to dey
For faith nor oath word ne assurance
True menynge awayte or bulynesse
Still port ne faithful attendaunce
Manhood ne might in arms worthynesse
Pursuyte of worship nor high prowess
In strange land riding ne trauayll
Full little or noght in love does avail
Peril of death neither in see nor land
Hunger ne thrust sorrow ne sykenesse
Ne great empryses for to take on hand
Shedynge of blood ne manfull hardynesse
Nor often woundynge at sawtes by dystresse
Nor in partynge of life and death also
All is for naught love takes no head thereto
But lesynges with her false flaterye
Thrughe her falshede and with her doubleness
With tales new and many feyned lie
By false semblaunce and counterfeit humblesse
Under color depeynte with steadfastness
With fraud covered under a pyteous face
Accept ben now rathest unto grace
And can themself now magnyfye
With feyned port and presumpcyon
They change her cause with false surquedrye
Under menynge of double entencyon
To think one in their opinion
And say another to set themself alofte
And hinder truth as it is seen full often
The which thing I bye now all to dear
Thanked be venus and the god cupyde
As it is seen by mine oppressed chere
And by his arowes that stycken in my side
Save only the death I nothing abide
Fro day to day alas the hard while
When ever his darte that him list to fyle
My woeful heart for to ryue a two
For fault of mercy and lack of pity
Of her that causes all my pain and woe
And lust not ones of grace for to se
Unto my truth thrughe her cruelte
And most of all I me complain
That she has Joye to laughe at my pain
And wylfully has my death sworn
All gyltles and wot no cause why
Saufe for the (...) that I (...) before
To her alone to (...) faithfully
O god of love (...) the (...)
And to thy blind double deyte
Of this great wrong I complain me
And to thy stormy wylfull va^yaunce
Ymeynte with change and great unstableness
Now up now down so ^ennynge (...) thy chance
That the to trust may be no (...)
I wit it nothing but thy (...)
And who that is an archer and is blind
Marketh nothing but shoteth by (...)enynge
And for that he has no dyscrecyon
Without advise he lets his (...)
For lack of sight and also of reason
In his shotynge it happeth often so
To hurt his friend rather than his fo
So does this god with his sharp (...)one
The true sleeth and lets the false gone
And of his woundynge this is the worst of all
When he hurts he does so cruel wreche
And makes the seek for to cry and call
Unto his foo for to be his leche
And hard it is for a man to seche
Upon the point of death in Ieoperdye
Unto his foo to find remedy
Thus fares it now even by me
That to my foo that gave my heart a wound
Must ask grace mercy and pity
And namely there none may be found
For now my sore my leche will confound
And god of kind so has (...) my (...)
My lives foo to have my wound(...) cure
Alas the while now that I was borne
Or that I ever saw the bright son
For now I se that full long aforne
Or I was borne my desteny was s(...)nne
By per^as susten to sle me if they conne
For they my death shap ^n ere my sherte
Only for (...) I may it not after^e
The mighty gods also of nature
That under god has the governance
Of worldely things committed to her cure
Dysposed has thrughe her purueyaunce
To give my lady so much (...)ysaunce
Of all virtues and therwithall puruyde
To murdre troth has taken danger to guide
if for bounte beauty shape and semelyhede
Prudence wit passyngely fayrnesse
Benygne port glad chere with lowlyhede
Of womanhede right plenteous and largess
Nature in her fully did empress
when she her wrought and all their last dysdayne
To hinder troth she made her chaumberlayne
When mystrust also and false suspeccyon
With mys^yleue she made for to be
Chief of counseyll to this conclusyon
For to exyle troth and eke pity
But of her court to make mercy fle
So that dyspyte now holleth forth her reyne
Thrughe hasty believe of tales that men feyne
And thus I am for my truth alas
Murdered and slain with words sharp and kene
Gylteles god wot of all trespass
And lie and blede upon this cold grene
Now mercy sweet mercy my lives queen
And to your grace of mercy yet I prey
In your service that your man may dey
But and so be that I shall dye algate
And that I shall none other mercy have
Yet of my death let this be the date*
That by your will I was brought to my grave
Or hastily if that yelyste me save
My sharp wounds that ache so and blede
Of mercy charity and also of womanhede
For other manner plainly is there none
But only mercy to help in this case
For though my wound blede ever in one
My life my death stondeth in your grace
And though my gylte be nothing alas
I ask mercy in all my best entente
Ready to dye if that ye assente
For there against shall I never strive
In word ne work plainly I ne may
For lever I have than to be alive
To dye sothely and it be to her pay
ye though it be this each same day
Or when that ever her list to deuyse
Suffyseth me to dye in your seruyse
And god yt know ye thought of every wight
Right as it is in every thing thou may se
Yet or I dye with all my full might
Lowly I pray to grant unto me
That ye goodly fair fresshe and fre
Which sle me only for defaute of ruthe
Or that I dye may know my truth
For that in sothe suffyseth me
And she it know in every cyrcumstaunce
And after I am well apayed that she
If that her ^u^^ of death to do vengeance
Unto me that am under her legeaunce
It sytte me not her dome to dysobeye
But at her lust wyfully to deye
Without grutchynge or rebellyon
In will or word hotely I assente
Or any manner contradyccyon
Fully to be at her commandment
And if I dye in my testamente
My heart I send and my spyryte also
What someuer she lust with them to do
And alder last to her womanhede
And to her mercy me I recommaunde
That lie now here between hope and dread
Abiding plainly what shelyst command
For utterly this is no demand
Welcome to me while me lasts breath
Right at her choyle whether it be life or death
In this matere more what might I said
Sith in her hand and in her will is all
Both life and death my Joye and all my pain
And finally my heart hold I shall
Till by my spyryte by destenye fatal
When that her lust fro my body wend
Have here my truth and thus I make an end.
Nota perseuera^tiam. Amantis.
And with that word he can syghe as sore
Like as his heart would ryue a twain
And held his peace and spoke not a word more
But for to se his woe and mortal pain
The teeres began fro mine eyes rain
Full pyteously for very inward ruthe
That I him saw so languysshe for his truth
And all this while my self I kept close
Among the bows and my self began hyde
Till at the last the woeful man arose
And to a lodge went there beside
Where all the may his custom was to abide
Sole to complain of his pains kene
Fro year to year under the bows grene
And for because that it drew to the night
And that the son his arc dyurnall
Passed was so that his persaunt light
His bright bemes and his stremes all
Were in the wawas of the water fall
Under the bordure of our occyan
His chare of gold his course so swyftely ran
And while the twylyght and rewes read
Of phoebus light were dyaurate a lyte
A pen I took and began me fast speed
The woeful playnte of this man to write
Word by word as he did endyte
Like as I herd and could him tho report
I have here set your hertes to dysporte
if ought be amysse lay the fault in me
For I am worthy for to bear the blame
if any thing amysse reported be
To make this dytte for to feyue lame
Through mine vnku^ny^ge but for to seyne ye same
Like as this man his complaynte did express
I axe mercy and forgyuenesse
And as I wrote me thought I saw a far
Far in the west lustely appear
Esperus the goodly bright sterre
So glad so fair so persaunt eke of chere
I mean venus with her bemes clear
That heavy hertes only to releue
Is wont of custom for to show at eve
And I as fast fell down on my kne
And even thus to her I began to prey
O lady venus so fair upon to se
Let not this man for his truth dey
For that Joye thou had when thou lay
With mars thy knight whom vulcanus found
And with a reyne vnuysybly you bound
Together both two in the same while
That all the court about celestyall
At your shame began laughe and smyle
O fair lady well willing found at all
Conforte to careful o goddess immortal
Be helping now and do thy dylygence
To let the stremes of thine influence
Dessende down in furtherynge of the truth
Namely of them that lie in sorrow bound
Show now thy might and on their woe have ruthe
Their false danger sle them and confound
And specially let thy might be found
For to socoure what so that thou may
The true man that in the herber lay
And all true forther for his sake
O glad sterre o lady venus mine
And cause his lady him to grace take
Her heart of stele to mercy so enclyne
Or that thy bemes go up to declyne
And or that thou now go fro us adowne
For that love thou had to down
And when she was gone to her rest
I rose anon and home to bed went
For very weary me thought it for the best
Praynge thus in all my best entente
That all true lovers that be with danger shente
With mercy may in releas of her pain
Recured be or may come efte again
And for that I may no longer wake
Farewell ye lovers all that be true
Prayenge to god and thus my live I take
That or the son tomorowe be risen new
And or he have again his rosen hew
That each of you may have such a grace
His own lady in arms to enbrace
I mean thus that in all honest
Without more ye may together speak
What so you list at good lyberte
That ce^^ may to other their heart break
On Jelousy only to be wreke
That has so long of malice and envy
Warred troth with his tyranny
Lenuoy.
Pryncesse pleafeth it your benygnyte
This little dytte to have in mind
Of woman head also for to se
your true man may mercy find
And pity eke that long has been behind
Let again be provoked to grace
For by my truth it is against kind
False danger to occupy his place
Lenuoy du quayer
Golytell quayre go unto my lives queen
And my very hertes sovereign
And be right glad for she shall the seen
Such is thy grace but I alas in pain
Am left behind but not to whom to complain
For mercy truth grace and eke pity
Exyled be / that I may not attain
Recure to find of mine aduersyte
