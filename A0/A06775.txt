(...)wen:
Triumphantly by worthy Peers
whose famous deeds were known.
Amids which troop was chose, Mal^erophus the fair:
Which sight to see, brave beauties Ni^phes,
like Angels did prepare.
But one among the crewe,
was Sillerae unkind:
Whom to requite with severe doom,
the Gods a way did find.
So he who scorned love,
had like for like ordaind:
The Knights on Steedes, with staff in hand,
to Just and sport attaind.
O cruel fate, and cursed state:
Preparde, fast snarde,
For such a scornful mate.
Her Sampler (...) (...)out her cast:
She hied, time spied,
To wear her sorrows past.
Upon a green willowe, there hanged this Lady:
A Tragical ending, believe me as may be.
Malmerophus missing the sight of his Lover,
went wandering hither and thither:
And thought if he met her, with fair words to prove her,
he did so, they met both together:
With sprite all appalled, and color clean changed,
he cut down his Lady in vayn:
And found in the Sampler, the words which she feigned,
that bread this great dolor and pain.
H^ made no more to do:
But there he ended too.
Her Sampler off he took:
And so his life forsook.
FINIS.
