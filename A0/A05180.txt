Luke in to this Mirror, and thou sall cleirlie ken
All faithful true Christianes, from falls disse^blit me^.
To the faithful Reder
Their Uearse ar sweit, and rycht delicius,
Unto the heart, of Godly men I ken:
Bot to the weked, tha ar rycht odius,
And comptit folly, with all unfaithful men.
For of the Godly, tha schew the trade and way
How tha them selfs, heir upon earth dois gyde:
And of the weked, their vice and grit decay,
Quhilk manassing, tha can no wayis abide.
Humbly heirfore, I walde ilk man exhort,
Them self to cry out, be this subsequent
Gyf vice or virtew, dois may in them resort,
Quha finds him gyltie, God grant he may repent.
So be it.
Begynnis the Conferrence.
THe chosin children, of God and sons elect,
Reiosis cheiflie, to heir his blissit wourd:
The sons of satan, quhilkes ar from God reject
Abhorris yt same, more nor ane two edgit swourd.
The Godly will, with patience Embrace,
Dew Admonitioun, for their vice and Sin:
The wekit can nocht, in the contrair case,
Sustene reproach, syne bide their wits within.
The godly will, in to good pairt sustene,
Dew chaistisment, for their Sin, and offense:
Punysche the wekit, tha will alwayis complene,
As give tha were, oppressed be violence.
The godly men, with piety ar oppressed,
To see their Brethren in necessity:
The Hypocreites, ar never at ease nor rest,
Bot quhen the faithful, sustenis misery.
The Godly men, will do no man bakbyte:
Nowthair in patent, nor in to pryuie place:
In blasphemy, the wekit dois delight,
And from Injury, his tongue can never cease.
The Godly man, will use no mokkerie,
And will no wayis, with sic vain matters mell:
The Hypocreit, will skorne contynewallie,
And never can find, ane falt in to him sell.
The Godly men, will use no fraud nor gylis,
And will be laith, to suit men to the law:
The Hypocreites, ar ever breding wylis,
And passing how, their brother to ourthraw.
The Godly men, ar full of gentilnes,
Of Lawtie, Love, and liberality:
The Hypocreites, ar full of gredines,
Of Aueryce, and Pegeralitie.
The Godly men, tha do support the pure,
And geuis them glaidlie, of their geir and good:
The Hypocreites, dois take more thocht and cure
How tha may reaue, from them their daily fude.
The Godly men, Elykewise ar content,
Als weill in neid, as in prosperity:
The Hypoccreites, quhe^ geir is from them went,
Tha blaspheme God, in their adversity.
The Godly men, detestes all vice, and Sin,
And all transgressoures, and their company:
The Hypocreites, tha do delight thairin,
Leading their lives, in all Impiety.
The Godly men, no brybs, nor buds will take,
To hurt the ane pairt, nor to help the other:
The Hypocreit, will think no schame nor lak,
Buds to receive, and tha were fra his brother.
The Godly men, will serve ane God allone,
Quhilk maker is, of Heauin the earth and seye:
The Hypocretes, makes gods money one,
With quhome tha do, commit Idolatry.
The Godly men, in all their wayis ar plain,
And cheiflie ever, onto their faithful brother:
The Hypocreites, ar feneit falls and vain,
Will say ane thing, and syne will do ane other.
The Godly ar, repleit with lawlynes,
With loving kyndnes, and humelytie:
The Hypocreites, thocht tha it nocht expres,
At full of hicht dispyte and tyranny.
The Godly labors, for unity and peace,
For concord, kyndnes, and tranquilytie:
The Hypocreites, dois never stanche nor ceace,
To raise discord, and Innanymitie.
The Godly luffis, their Pastors, for their cure
And will be sorry, to se them want or wrangt:
The Hypocreites, regairds nocht, we are sure,
Thocht all the preachours, on ye earth were hangt.
The Godly men, will still cleue to Gods wourd
Thocht tha to death, for it should be persewit:
The Hypocreit, sa sone as cu^mis the swourd,
Will it deny, and sweir he never knewit.
The Godly men, setts God before all things,
Before their lives, their guds geir or lands:
The Hypocreites, before God puts their kings,
Dispysing God, his lawis, and his commands.
The Godly men, at knawin be their merks,
Rycht as the day, is tryit be the lycht:
Euin so the wekit, be their vicius werks,
At so espyit, as derknes schewis the nycht.
For as no wayis, the fire it can be knawin,
To be ane fire, withouttin heit, or lycht:
No more ye faithful, except good werks be schawin
Can notit be, for to be Christianes rycht. Luc. x.

The priest, and Leueit, ye quhilk did nocht support,
The woundit man, in to his grief and pain:
Could nocht be comptit, faithful in no sort, Luc. xvi.

As was the helpful true Samaritaine.
Nor it the Gluttoun, quha fed delicius,
Could nocht be said, to have fidelytie:
That petijt nocht, the pure Lazarus,
Quhen Dogs did schew in him more cherytie.
Qhairthrow ye Gluttoun, unto the hell was send
That had no reuth, nor piety on the pure:
All Hypocreitts, that likewise dois offend,
With him in Hell, sall harbreit be most sure.
Thus thocht we boist, Christianes to be,
Except good werks, proceid out of our spreits:
We at bot membris, of Iniquytie,
And at nocht else, bot verray Hypocreits.
Lat ws heirfore, schew forth with all our mycht,
Our godly werks, of mercy and of love:
Quhairthrow we may, be kend of every wycht,
The faithful seruands, of God that rings above.
Lat lewd affectionis, and all Impieteis,
Be mortefijt, in to our membris all:
That tha may nocht, quhilks ar our Inymeis,
No other thing, bot Christianes ws call.
Godly heirfore, Rejoice that hes their sings,
e may be sure, that God hes ow elect:
Be waill e weked, that in sick vicis rings,
But e repent, the Lord hes ow reject.
All e heirfore, that hes Gods wourd professed,
And maid with God, and man that blyssit band
Stand ferme and stable, gyf e wald cum to rest,
For now the Fan, approchis fast at hand.
Se that no riches, nor wardlie pomp nor glore,
Make ws schrink bak, now from the verity:
And quho so dois, to their grit schame but more,
God will disclose, their vile Hypocresie.
Eternal God, thy faithful flok defend,
Preserve them Lord, for now and ever more:
And grace, and peace, unto thy subjects send,
That seiks nocht else, bot to set forth thy glore.

HOwbeit thou war, of portrature preclaie,
And war indewit with prignant virteuis seir
And thocht i knawledge, you had no compair
That thou culd teach all scientis perqueir,
And thocht of blude thou war ane prencis peir,

And thou Layk substance of thy awin and geir
Thou will be Lytill regardit in this Land.
Bot thocht thou be ane Ideote, or ane fule
Ane maykles monstour, withoutin wit, or air
Ane Blunt bubo, that never had been at scule,
And sik as Is, of every virtew bair,

Thoucht thou be weked, I put the out of dout
And thocht thou war, to sathane, Sone, and air,

Allace heir is, ane Cairfull Misery,
That virtewis men, but geir at of no price,
And Beasts for bags, at in Authorytie,
I think this change, is wonderus strange and nyce,
The cause heirof, Is only Couattyse,
That blinds so man, that he can no wayis se,
To cheryse, virtew, And ay chaistyce vice,
Allace heir is, ane cairfull misere.
