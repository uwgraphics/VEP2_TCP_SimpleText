The Epistle to the Reader.
COurteous Reader, lo here I offer unto thee the second time, the Brief of my
larger Tract. Thou have been once abused by the temeritie and indiscretion of
the Stationer, offering thee the English Teacher; a title none of mine, and an
imperfect confused Chaos of Questions and Answers, whereof I was much ashamed.
To amend this fault, and to satisfy the longing desire of many, I have done
that which here thou see. And I do now assure thee of a perfect Catechism,
containing the substance both of Text and Comment complete, wherein is both
milk for Babes, and stronger meat for such as have attained more growth in
knowledge. The milk is in a greater Character, which if you please, may be
first learned through: the stronger meat is in a character somewhat lesser.
Read, consider, and use all according to thy discretion, but be sure to use it,
or some like unto it for the common good of Uniformity and Order; and the God
of Order grant, that we may so lay the foundation of the light of truth here,
as that we may attain the light of glory hereafter.

A Prayer to be used before the reading of Books of Piety, or Instruction.
O God that art the Father of Lights, enlighten my darkened understanding, that
I may see into the wonders contained in the Law. Dispell in me the mistie
clouds of ignorance, expel the love of darkness, and repel the rebellious
Law of sin. Sanctify my wit, that I may be able to retain, and rectify my
will, that I may obediently submit my self to thy good will in all things.
Thou which art the Master Builder of thine own house, settle me as one of thy
living stones upon the right foundation, Jesus Christ; in whom I may daily grow
up, till that all the building, coupled together, grows to an holy Temple in
the Lord. And this I crave in the name of thy dear Son, my most blessed
Savior and Redeemer. Amen.

MAYERS CATECHISM ABRIDGED, OR The A. B. C. Enlarged.
Question.

WHat is your name?

Answer.

F. or E.

Q. Why does the Catechism begin with this question touching your name?

A. Because the name does serve to put us in mind of our Christian profession,
to which we betake our selves in Baptism.

Q. Who gave you this name?

A. My godfathers, and my godmothers in my Baptism, wherein I was made a
member of Christ a child of God, and an inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven.

Q. Is Baptism of that virtue, that by the outward washing thereof, eueryone
is made a member of Christ, the child of God and inheritor of the Kingdom of
Heaven?

A. Ioh. 3.5.
No, for unless a man be borne again of water, and the holy Ghost, he cannot
enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.

Q. Why then say thou, that by Baptism thou art made a member of Christ?

A. Because baptism is the Sacrament of regeneration, and therefore we may
rightly say, that we are thereby Sacramentally made the members of Christ, and
the children of God, and in the judgment of Charity hold the same touching all
others, that are baptized

Q. What did your godfathers and godmothers then for you?

A. They did promise and vow, three things in my name. First, that I should
forsake the Devil, and all his works, and pomps, the vanities of this wicked
world, and all the sinful lusts of the flesh. Secondly, that I should believe
all the articles of the Christian faith: And thirdly, that I should keep gods
holy Will and Commandments, and walk in the same all the days of my life.

Q. What need is there, that any should stand thus to promise for children in
their Baptism?

A. There is great need for the more assurance of the Church, into which the
child is by baptism admitted.

Q. How is the Church the more assured thus?

A. Because he is not only bound in duty now, but also by vow solemnly made
before all the congregation.

Q. Do thou think then, that thou art bound to do, as thy godfathers and
godmothers promised for thee?

A. Yes verily: and by Gods help so I will. And I heartily thank our heavenly
Father, that he has called me to this state of salvation, through Jesus Christ
our Savior. And I pray God to give me his grace, that I may continue in the
same unto my lives end.

Q. Thou saydst that thou were bound by vow in baptism to believe all the
Articles of the Christian faith, let me therefore hear thee rehearse these
Articles?

A. I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth. And in
Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord, which was conceived by the holy Ghost,
borne of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Ponce Pilate: was crucified, dead, and
buried: he descended into hell: The third day he rose again from the dead: He
ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of God the Father Almighty:
From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the
holy Ghost: The holy Catholic Church: The communion of Saints: the
forgiveness of sins: The resurrection of the body: And the life everlasting,
Amen.

Q. What do thou chiefly learn in these Articles of thy belief?

A. First, I learn to believe in God the Father, who has made me and all the
world. Secondly, in God the Son who has redeemed me and all mankind.
Thirdly, in God the holy Ghost, who sanctifies me, and all the elect people
of God.

Q. How know thou that there is a God?

A. Many ways: Romans 2.15. 1. Cor. 2.11.
but chiefly by mine own conscience, accusing me for secret sins.

Q. How does this prove that there is a God?

A. It proves an infinite wisdom, that knows the most secret thoughts of the
heart, such as is neither man, devil, nor Angel, but God alone.

Q. How many Gods be there? 1. Cor. 8.6. Deuteronomy. 4.39.


A. But one only true God, the rest are Idols set up by man.

Q. What is God?

A. God is a Spirit, Exodus 3.14. Ioh. 2.24. Ier. 2.24. Psalm. 139.8.
infinite, most holy, only wise, most merciful, just, and Almighty, of whose
days there is no beginning nor end.

Q. Into how many Persons is the Godhead destinguished?

A. Into three, the Father, Son, and holy Ghost.

Q. If in the Godhead there be three persons, and every one be God, how say
you then that there is but one God?

A. 1. Ioh. 5.7.
There is but one only Essence, one Infinite power and one Eternity.

Q. In which words learn you to believe in God the Father?

A. In these words; I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and
earth.

Q. Declare more fully the faith comprehended in this Article.

A. Iam. 1.18. 1. Ioh. 3.9. Genesis 17.1. Reu. 1.8. Psalm. 104. Job 39. c. 40
I learn to believe, that God is my Father, able to do al things; the Creator
of the whole world, and the Lord and Governor of the same.

Q. Thou said that thou did learn to believe in God the Son, which
redeemed thee and all mankind, what did God the Son for the redemption of
mankind?

A. Two things: first, he was humbled: secondly, he was exalted.

Q. wherein stands his humiliation?

A. In three degrees.

Q. Which is the first degree?

A. First, he was made man, Math. 1. Luke 1.2. Esa. 7.14.
for he was conceived by the holy Ghost, and borne of the Virgin Mary.

Q. How can this be, that God should be made man?

A. Not by turning the Godhead into the nature of man, but by taking man's
nature unto the Godhead, that so one person might be both God and Man.

Q. Which is the second degree?

A. He suffered the death of the Cross for my sins: for he suffered under
Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried.

Q. What need was there, that the Son of God should thus abase himself for
us?

A. Great need on our part, who could not be delivered by Angels, 1 John 1.7. 1
Pet. 1.8.
or by earthly Treasures, but only by his blood.

Q. Does sin deserve so ill, that we could not by other means be delivered
here from, but by the death of the Son of God?

A. Yes, it deserves the infinite curse of the Law, Deu. 27.28 Romans 6.23.
that is, all judgments in this world, and everlasting damnation in the world
to come.

Q. If he must needs be made fit to bear the curse, why did he not take some
other nature more excellent unto him?

A. Man only had sinned, and it was most agreeable to the Justice of God to
receive the payment of the debt of sin in the same nature which committed it.

Q. How came it to be thus with us men? were we made sinners?

A. Genesis 1.27. Eccles. 7.31. Genes. 3. Romans 5.
No, God at the first made man righteous, but by yielding to the devils
temptation, he made himself a sinner.

Q. Wherein did man yield to the temptation of the devil?

A. In eating of the forbidden fruit, and not contenting himself with all
other fruits, of which the Lord had allowed him to eat.

Q. Was God so angry that he would curse man for eating an apple, or fig, or
such like?

A. That was not the matter of Gods anger, but his unthankfulness, pride,
disobedience, and crediting rather the devil, then God.

Q. But though one man did thus, yet all did not, are we all then sinners, and
under the curse?

A. We were all in his loins, and so whatsoever he did, and what estate he
fell into, it is Common to us all.

Q. It seems then, that we are sinners so soon as we are borne, before that
we have actually done either good or evil?

A. Yes verily, the child that is but newborn, yea, but conceived, Psalm.
51.5. Romans 5.12.
and living in his Mothers womb, is a sinner, and needs Gods grace.

Q. But as we are all sinners, are we all again delivered without exception,
because thou say, that he has redeemed all mankind?

A. He has paid a price sufficient to redeem all, neither does he exclude
any from the benefit thereof, but only such as exclude themselves.

Q. Who are they?

A. All unbelievers, or such, as though they bear themselves upon their faith,
live according to the flesh, and not according the Spirit.

Q. Which is the third degree of his humiliation?

A. Ephesians. 4.9. 1. Pet. 3.19. Psalm. 16 30.
He descended into hell that I might be delivered from hell, and everlasting
death.

Q. Js this all the humiliation of the Son of God for our redemption, did he
no way else abase himself for us?

A. Yes, he became obedient to the Law also, Gal. 4.4. 1. Cor. 1 30. Romans 8.3.
that by his obedience and righteousness we might stand perfectly righteous
in the sight of God.

Q. Wherein stands his exaltation?

Ans. In four degrees.

Question Which is the first degree?

A. First, the third day he rose again from the dead.

Q. Which is the second?

A. Secondly, he ascended up into heaven.

Q. Which is the third?

Ans. Thirdly, he sits on the right hand of God the Father Allmighty.

Q. What is meant by this?

A. That he has all honor, power, and authority in heaven and in earth
together with God the Father.

Quest. Which is the fourth degree?

Answ. Fourthly, from thence he shall come to Judge the quick and the dead.

Q. Thou saydst, that thou did chiefly learn in the Articles of thy faith,
to believe in God the Father, so that it seems there is somewhat more, yet to
he learned by these Articles, what is that?

A. I believe the holy Catholic Church, the communion of Saints, the
forgiveness of sinner, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.

Q. What is this Church?

A. The whole company of the faithful, called out from the rest of the world
by the preaching of the Gospel.

Q. Why is this Church called Holy?

A. Romans 1.7. 1. Pet. 3.9. Ephesians. 2.19. 1. Ioh. 3.3. Phil. 3.14, 15
Because it is sanctified, and washed by water and the holy Ghost; strives
against all sin, and to be holy, as God is holy.

Q. Why is it called Catholic?

A. Pro. 7. Acts 2.5. 1. Tim. 2.1.
Because it consists of persons of all sorts, scattered all over the world
and of al times and ages.

Qu. How may a man certainly know, where this Church of God is?

A. Acts 2.41.47. Esaias 8.20.
By these two special marks, holiness taught and professed, and antiquity,
when they go together.

Q. Is not the Church of Rome then the true Church of God, seeing it exceeds in
holiness, and is most ancient?

A. No: it was a true Church indeed in the Apostles times, and many years
after; but now it is neither holy, for great uncleanness is there maintained;
nor ancient, for the ancient Religion is defaced with gross errors, and
superstitions.

Q. Where then may we find the true Church?

A. In England, and in all other places where these corruptions are done away,
and Religion is restored to the first purity.

Q. How can this be, seeing the Religion here professed is but as it were of
yesterday, and never heard of before Luther and Calvin?

A. This is a mere slander; for there was never any age since the Apostles,
wherein there have not been some standing to the maintenance hereof, against
Romish corruptions.

Q. How happened it then, that the Church of Rome still prevailed, and was
generally accounted for Christ's true Church, and those oppugners were never of
any esteem?

A. By the greatness and tyranny of the Roman Bishops, whose chief care it
has been almost, ever since Constantines time, to magnify their own Church,
and themselves, and to suppress their adversaries.

Q. But is it possible, that the Roman Church being once a true Church should
fall, seeing God has promised his Spirit to his Church to be always present,
leading it into all truth?

A. The Lord tyeth not his Spirit to any place, for then the famous Churches in
Asia should still have been true Churches; but the Spirit is always present
to the faithful in all places of the world.

Q. Having found out the true Church, are we to believe in it, as in God.

A. No, for then we should sometime believe errors, seeing the best men, which
are the Church, may err.

Q. What is it then to believe the Church?

A. To believe the doctrine of the Church, wherein it follows Christ, the
Prophets, and Apostles, the only sure pillars and ground of truth.

Q. What is that which follows in these Articles, viz. The communion of
Saints, the forgiveness of sins, etc.

A. They be certain special benesits belonging to the Church, and to every
member thereof.

Q. What is the Communion of Saints?

A. Ephesians. 4. John 15. Gal. 3.28. Revel. 6.11. Heb. 10.24.
That holy and sweet followship which all the members of Christ's Church have
one with another, in forrowing, rejoicing, praying, and praising God, for, and
with one another.

Q. What is the forgiveness of sins?

A. That wonderful grace of God in Jesus Christ, whereby he passes over our
transgressions, as if they had never been committed, and releaseth the
punishment due to them.

Q What is the Resurrection of the body?

A. The raising of the body again at the last day by Gods power, Math. 22.31.
Dan. 12.2. Job 19.25. 1 Cor. 15.
that being joined to the soul, it may stand before Gods judgment Seat, to
give account of all that it has done, whether good or evil, and be rewarded
accordingly.

Q. What manner of bodies shall we have in the Resurrection?

A. The very same which now we have, only whereas they be now natural, 1 Cor.
15. and 35 43. Job 19.25.
they shall rise again spiritual, not subject to death any more, nor
sustained by natural means, of meats and drinks, and sleep, and the like.

Q. Among those that die, some are crooked through age, some tender infants,
some blind, and some lame, shall their bodies at the resurrection then be the
same?

A. No, for all these are weaknesses, which shall be done away to the
faithful; and strength, perfection, and comeliness shall be to every one of
them

Q. What is the Life everlasting?

A. Psalm. 16.11 Esaias 6.1. Revel. 21. Esaias 66.23. 1 Cor. 2.9.
All that ever enduring happiness, and all those joys which the Lord imparteth
to al his elect in the world to come, which are so great, as that the eye has
not seen, nor the ear heard, neither can the heart conceive thoroughly.

Q. Thou saydst that thou were bound by vow in thy Baptism to keep Gods holy
will and Commandments: tell me therefore how many Commandments are there?

A. Ten. God spoke these words, and said, I am the Lord thy God, which have
brought thee out of the ^and of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shall
have none other Gods but me.

Thou shall not make to thy self any graven Image, nor the likeness of any
thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the water under
the earth: Thou shall not vow down to them, nor worship them: for I the Lord
thy God am a jealous God, and visit the sins of the Fathers upon the
Children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and show
mercy unto thousands in them that love me and keep my Commandments.

Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will
not hold him guiltles that takes his name in vain.

Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day: Six days thou shall labor,
and do all that thou have to do: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the
Lord thy God. In it thou shall do no manner of work, thou, and thy son, and
thy daughter, thy manseruant, and thy maidsernant, thy cattle, and the
stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and
earth the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore
the Lord blessed the seventh, day, and hallowed it.

Honor thy Father and Mother, that thy days may be long in the land, which
the Lord thy God gives thee.

Thou shall do no murder.

Thou shall not commit adultery.

Thou shall not steal.

Thou shall not bear false witesse against thy neighbor.

wife, nor his servant, nor ^^s maid, nor his ox, nor his ass, or any thing
that is his.

call upon him: to ^^nour his holy name, and his word, ^^d to serve him truly
all the days (...) my life.

Q. What is thy duty toward thy neighbor?

A. My duty toward my neighbor is, to love him as my self, an^ to do to
all men, as I would the should do to me: to love, honor, an^ succor my father
and mother: (...) honor and obey the King and hi^ Ministers: to submit my
self to a^^ my Governors, Teachers, spirit^all Pastors, and Masters: to orde^
my self lowly, and reverently to a^^ my betters: To hurt no body b^ word nor
deed: to be true and just i^ all my dealings: to bear no malic^ nor hatred in
my heart: to keep m^ hands from picking and stealing, an^ my tongue from evil
speaking, l^^ing, and flaundering: to keep m^ body in temperance, soberness,
an^ chastity: not to covet nor desire ^ther men's goods, but learn and l^bour
truly to get mine own liuin^ and to do my duty in that state (...) life,
unto the which is shall plea^^ God to call me.

Q. What avails it then, whether ^he Sabbath begin in the morning or
evening?

A. Yes, it avails much to know the beginning of the Sabbath rightly that we
be not entangled with any wordly business upon it.

Q. Is this all that we are bound unto, to keep the Sabbath our selves, ^n
ceasing from labor, and doing the ^uties thereof?

A. No, but who so has son or laughter, man-seruant, or maid, Exo. 12.21.
Josh. 24.15. 1. Tim. 3.15. Ephesians. 6.5.
cat^ell or stranger within his gates, is ^like bound to provide as much as ^n
him lies, that they all observe ^his day in their kind, both man and beast.

Q. Does the Lord only take care for he right spending of this day, and leave
^s to our selves upon the six days?

A. No doubtless, but it is his will and commandment also, Ephesians. 3.28. 2.
These. 3.10.12.
that we should upon the six days abstain from idleness, and diligently
labor in the works of our callings.

Q Is it not lawful then to forbear working, to attend upon God and his
worship, upon the six days?

A. 1 These. 5.17 2 Timothy 1. Deuteronomy. 6 7. Dan. 6.
Yes. It is not only lawful, but necessary for every one to do the duties of
Gods worship every day of the week, in private and in public, when just
occasion is offered.

Q. How can this stand with the command of working upon the six days?

A. Yes, very well; because that howsoever God is to be served upon the six
days, yet they are for the most part to be spent in the works of our
callings.

Q. Which is the first?

week, as Saints days, and days of thanksgiving?

A. Ester 9.21. Mal. 4.59. John 10.22.23. Leuit. 23.
All this may lawfully be done, and is commendable by Gods word, and therefore
we are reverently to conform our selves to the ordinance of authority herein.

Answ, All profaning of the Sabbath day.

Q. How is the Sabbath profaned?

Sernants to their own liberties upon this day.

Q. What be the reasons of this Commandment?

A. They are partly infolded in the Commandment, and partly expressed in these
words: For in six^ days the Lord made heaven and earth, the, sea, and all that
therein is, and rested the senenth day, wherefore the Lord blessed the seventh
day and hollowed it.

Q. What, and how many are the reasons infolded in this Commandment?

A. Three.

Q. Which is the first?

A. Because the Law of the Sabbath is ancient, and was in force in Paradise,
before man's fall.

Q. Which is the second?

A. Because it is most equal, the Lord allowing us six days for our worldly
affairs, and requiring but one of seven for the work of his worship.

we cannot any way profane it.

Q. What are the reasons expressed?

A. Two.

Q Which is the first?

A. From the Lords own example, who rested upon the seventh day from all his
works of creation.

Q. Which is the second?

he which keeps it holy, shall find it to his comfort unto him a blessed day.

special manner they bear, Parents, Magistrates, Ministers, and Governors for
their authority, the Ancient, and other Superiors for their wisdom,
experience, and dignity.

Q. Is it our duty also to cherish and maintain them?

A. It is our duty to give maintenance to the Magistrate and Minister, Romans

who spend their whole time in doing public Service, and to Parents, and aged
persons being in want.

A. 1. Ioh. 3.4. Rom 7.7. Romans 5.18. Iam. 2.10.

it makes a man subject to Gods eternal curse.

three special reasons.

Q. Which is the first?

A. Because it is a duty that we owe unto God.

Q. Which is the second?

A. To renew our assurance of the pardon of sin daily renewed through our
great weakness, and to increase our love, patience and humility.

The time of trouble and adversity, when we ought more often and instantly to
pray.

prayer, according to that of the Apostle, Pray continually. 1 These. 5.17


Q. If we observe these times of prayer, shall we be saved from all our sins?

A. Yes undoubtedly, Acts 2.21.
for whosoever calls upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved.

Q. Is there nothing else required then unto salvation, but to pray?

A. Yes, for we must be endued with these properties which the Lord requires
in those that pray, or else we shall pray in vain

Q. How many are those properties?

A. Three.

Q. Which is the first?

A. Obedience: for not every one that says, Lord, Lord, Math. 7.21.
shall enter into heaven, but he that does the will of my Father which is in
heaven.

Q. Which is the second?

A. Humility: Iam. 4.6.
for God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble.

Q. Which is the third?

A. Iam. 5 16.
Feruency, for the prayer of the righteous preuay leth much if it be fervent.

Q. What more particular direction is there to be followed in praying?

A. That most excellent prayer, which Christ himself framed for us, rightly
therefore called the Lords Prayer.

Q. Rehearse the Lords Prayer.

A. Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name: Thy kingdom come:
Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven: Give us this day our daily bread:
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us:
And lead us not into temptation: But deliver us from evil. Amen.

Q. Is this the only Prayer which we are to use in calling upon God?

A. No, but we must be guided by it, as by a rule, both for manner and matter
in all our prayers.

Q. May we not use it then as a Prayer?

A. Yes doubtless, we may, and ought to use it most often, as the chief of
all prayers, but with great deliberation, not placing confidence in the words,
but in the sense understood, and affected in the saying thereof.

Q. It seems then that a set prayer is lawful.

A. It is not only lawful, Number. 10.36 Psalm. 92
but most expedient, that there should be a set form of praying in the
Congregation, and to help the devotion of the ignorant in private.

Q. What is to be thought of conceived prayer? may any man use that?

A. The Spirit of God is not tied to words and phrases, but does at times
suddenly minister matter to the servants of God, so that they can and do pray
effectually without a set form, both publicly and privately.

Q. In what manner ought we to pray, according to this rule of the Lords
prayer?

A. First, Math. 67.
to pray in this manner is, briefly and pithily.

Q. What secondly?

A. Propounding Gods glory, as the mark whereat we aim, in all our praying,
Mat. 6.5.
and not our own vain glory.

Q. What thirdly?

A. First, and chiefly seeking after heavenly things, Mat. 6.33.
then after earthly.

Q. What fourthly?

A. In all things submitting our wills, Mat. 26.39.
and desires to the will of God.

Q. What be the parts of this prayer?

A. Three: the Preface; Our Father which are in heaven: the Petitions; Hollowed
be thy name, etc. and the Conclusion; For thine is the Kingdom, etc.

Q. In the Preface, why call you God, Father?

A. Luke 11.11. Heb. 4.16. Genesis 3^.26.
Because he is ready as a loving Father to hear me, calling upon his name;
wherefore I learn with boldness, and confidence to come unto him in prayer.

Q. But may every man come before God, as his Father?

A. No wicked man that goes on impenitently in sin can call God Father, Ioh.
8.44. Romans 6.16.
because he is the devils child, and not Gods.

Q. Cannot a wicked man pray then?

A. No, Prou. 15.8. Esa. 1.12.
he cannot pray with any comfort, for the prayer of the wicked is abomination
to the Lord.

Q. Why do you say, Our Father, and not my Father?

A. 1 Timothy 2.2. Matthew. 5.44.
Because I ought to pray for all other the children of God, as well as for my
self.

Q. Why add you in the preface, Which art in heaven?

A. Not for that I believe God to be in heaven only, for he is every where.

Q Why then?

A. 1 Kin. 8.27, Psalm. 19.1. Luke 18. Luke 1.53. Esaias 66.2.
Because to be in heaven is an Argument of great glory: therefore I learn
with reverence to pray unto him, being my Father most glorious.

Q. What do thou ask of God in this prayer?

A. I desire my Lord God our heavenly Father, who is the giver of all
goodness, to send his grace unto me and to all people, that we may worship
him, serve him, and obey him, as we ought to do. And I pray unto God, that
he will send us all things that he needful both for our souls and bodies:
and that he will be merciful unto us, and forgive us our sins: And that it
will please him to save and defend us from all dangers, ghostly and bodily: and
that he will keep us from all sin and wickedness, and from our ghostly
enemy, and from everlasting death. And this I trust he will do of his mercy
and goodness, through our Lord Jesus Christ. And therefore I say, Amen. So be
it.

Q. Tell me more particularly, how many be the Petitions of this prayer?

A. Six, whereof the three former concern Gods glory, the three latter
concern our selves.

Q. Which he those three concer-Gods glory?

A. First, Hallowed by thy name: secondly, thy Kingdom come: thirdly, thy will
be done on earth, as it is in heaven.

Q. In the first of these what desire you?

A. Prou. 16.1. 1. Cor. 10.31 Romans 11.36
That the name of God may be glorified in the use of his titles, word, and all
his works.

Q. In the second petition, what desire you?

A. Psalm. 48.2 Psalm. 93.1. Mat. 13.^. Mat. 9.38. Ephesians. 6.19.
That the number of true believers may be daily increased, that Gods Kingdom
of Grace being enlarged, his Kingdom of glory may be hastened.

Q. What pray you for in the third petition?

A. Ps. 119.34. 1. These. 4.3. Ephesians. 4.24. Ephesians. 1.16, 17
That I and all the people of God upon earth may as readily obey Gods will, as
the Angels and Saints in heaven.

Q. Which be the three petitions concerning our selves?

A. The first; Give us this day, our daily bread: secondly, forgive us our
trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us; thirdly, Lead us not
into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

Q What pray you for in the first of these Petitions?

A. For all things necessary for this present life, Prou. 20.8. Genesis 28.20.
Mat. 6.34.
and therefore we ask but for bread, and but for this day.

Q. What pray you for in the second of these Petitions?

A. That God would forgive us all our sins, Mat 18.26. Luke 18.10 Psalm. 39.8.
Mat 5.23.
as we do from our hearts forgive the offenses of men against us.

Q. What pray you for in the third of these Petitions?

A. That the Lord would not suffer us to be carried away by the temptations of
the world, flesh, or devil, 2. Cor. 12.8. Ephesians. 6.18. Mat. 26.21.
to the committing of sin, but that he would deliver us from the evil of all
temptation, both sin and damnation.

Q. Wherefore serves the conclusion, For thine is the Kingdom, etc.

A. It is added as a reason of all the Petitions, to strengthen our faith.

Q. What is this reason?

A. Math 6.8. Mark. 9.23. Psalm. 19.1 Ephesians. 1.6.
That God being both able and willing, does certainly yield to those our
requests, therefore we add a note of confidence, and say, Amen.

Q. Has the Lord made any certain promise to hear us, that we may with so
great confidence expect a grant of our petitions?

A. He has both promised, Psalm. 50.14. Math. 7.7, 9
and brgeth us to believe from the example of an earthly Father.

Q. But God is in heaven, and invisible, neither can we see or hear him
speaking unto us: what visible and sensible means therefore has he given us,
whereby we may be assured of his promise?

A. John 20.31. Mar. 16.16 1 Cor. 10.16.
He has given us his written word, wherein his promises are set forth, and
the holy Sacraments as seals for our further assurance.

Q. What is the word of God?

A. 2 Timothy 3.16 Gal. 1.8.
All the Books of the Old and New Testament, and not any other books or
Writings whatsoever.

Q. How many, and which are these Books?

A. The Books of the Old Testament are seven and twenty; Genesis, Exodus,
Leuiticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, the first and second of
Samuel, the first and second of Kings, the first and second of the Chronicles,
Ezra, Nehemiah, Ester, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles, Esaias,
Jeremiah, Ezechiel, Daniel, and the 12. small Prophets. The Books of the new
Testament are seven and twenty; Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, the Acts of the
Apostles, the Epistle to the Romans, first and second to the Corinthians,
Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, two to the Thessalonians, and
two to Timothy, to Titus, to Philemon, to the Hebrews, the Epistle of James,
and two of Peter, three of John, of Jude, and the Revelation of John.

Q. Are not the Apocryphal Books part of the word of God?

A. They are not, neither have bin ever so accounted in the Church of God, but
are annexed, as being full of good Instructions, and Histories declaring Gods
wonderful providence over his people Israel.

Q. How is it proved, that these Testaments are the word of God?

A. It is proved by their Antiquity, some of them being before all other
books, 2 Timothy 3.16. 2 Pet. 1.20. 1 These. 2.13.
sundry times oppugned and sought to be burnt up by persecutors, and yet
wonderfully preserved, and by miracle from heaven confirmed, which shows, that
they came from heaven, and are not of man's invention.

Q. Are the Books of the Old and New Testament sufficient to salvation without
any other?

A. Yes doubtless, and it is dangerous to add any other as necessary to be
likewise received: Reu. 22.18 Deuteronomy. 4.2.
for to do thus, is to incur the danger of Gods curse.

Q. Having this Word written, is it not sufficient for our salvation, without
any help by preaching?

A. It is not sufficient, 1 Cor. 1.18.
but it must also be set forth by preaching, that the hard places may be
rightly understood, Romans 10.14 2 Timothy 4.2 Acts 8.31
we may be kept from errors, and have our dull hearts stirred up to embrace it.

Q. How many be the Sacraments of the New Testament?

A. Two only, as generally necessary to salvation: that is to say, Baptism,
and the Supper of the Lord.

Q. What meanest thou by this word Sacrament?

A. I mean an outward and visible sign, of an inward and sprituall grace
given unto us, ordained by Christ himself as a means, whereby we receive the
same, and as a pledge to assure us thereof.

Q. How many parts be there in a Sacrament?

A. Two: the outward visible sign, and the inward spiritual grace.

Q. What is the outward visible sign, or form in Baptism?

A. Water, wherein the person baptized is dipped, or sprinkled with it, In the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy ghost.

Q. What is the inward and spiritual grace?

A. A death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness: for, being by nature
borne in sin, and the children of wrath, we are hereby made the children of
Grace.

Q. What is required of persons to be baptized?

A. Repentance, whereby they forsake sin: and Faith, whereby they steadfastly
believe the promises of God made to them in that Sacrament.

Q. Why then are Infants baptized, when by reason of their tender age they
cannot perform them.

A. Yes: they do perform them by their sureties, who promise and vow the^
both in their names: which when they come to age, themselves are bound to
perform.

Q. Why was the Sacrament of the Lords Supper ordained?

A. For the continual remembrance of the Sacrifice of the death of Christ, and
the benefits which we receive thereby.

Q. What is the outward part, or sign of the Lords Supper?

A. Bread and Wine, which the Lord has commanded to be received.

Q. What is the inward part or thing signified?

A. The Body and Blood of Christ, which are verily and indeed taken and
received of the faithful in the Lords Supper.

Q. What are the benefits, whereof we are partakers thereby?

A. The strengthening and refreshing of our souls by the Body and Blood of
Christ, as our bodies are by the Bread and Wine.

Q. What is required of them which come to the Lords Supper?

A. To examine themselves whether they repent them truly of their former
sins, steadfastly purposing to lead a new life, have a lively faith in Gods
mercy through Christ, with a thankful remembrance of his death, and be in
charity with all men.

Q. Wherein stands true Repentance?

A. In three things; First, in knowledge and acknowledgement of our sins
past: Secondly, Prou. 28.19 Iere. 3.25. Luke 13. Psalm. 51.17 Math. 5.4. 2 Cor.
7.11.
in godly sorrow and grief of heart for them: Thirdly, in a godly purpose to
forsake all sin, and to lead a new life for all time to come.

Q. What is faith?

A. Hebr. 11.1. Romans 8.30. John 6.47. Romans 16.14 Acts 16.14.
It is a certain persuasion of the heart, wrought by the spirit of God,
grounded upon his promises, that all my sins are forgiven me in Christ Jesus.

Q. Wherein stands true Christian love?

A. In affection, when it is the same toward our neighbor, Math. 19.19 1 John
3 17. Iam. 2.15, 16
that it is toward our selves void of malice, hatred, and envy, and desirous
of his good, as of our own. And in action, when we are ready to do good unto
others, as unto our selves, and to keep away hurt as from our selves.

Q. What shall he do, that after examination finds not these things in
himself.

A. He may not keep away from the Lords Supper, for this were a pronoking of
God to wrath, neither can he come unto it, Mat. 22.
without offending in a higher degree.

Q. What may a man do then in this case?

A. He must humbly sue unto God for the pardon of his sins, Mat. 5.24.
to strike his hard heart, that he may melt into tears for them, and
constantly cleave to his Commandments; and if there be any dissension, he
must go and be reconciled to his brother.

Q. What ought a man to do at the Lords Supper?

A. 1 Cor. 11.23
He ought thankefully to remember the inward graces of God toward him, by
seeing the outward signs.

Q. What are these graces?

A. They are three.

Q. Which is the first?

A. The Lords giving of his Son Jesus Christ to death for us, set forth by the
Ministers taking of the Bread and Wine, Ioh 3.16.
breaking and pouring out, and offering them to us all.

Q. Which is the second?

A. Ephesians. 5.30.
Our near union unto Christ, and how we have all our spiritual food from him,
set forth by our taking, eating, and inward digesting the Bread and Wine that
become nourishment unto us, and are united to the substance of our bodies.

Q. Which is the third?

A. The near union that God has made by Christ betwixt all the faithful, set
forth by the same Bread, Romans 12.5. Gal. 3.28.
being made of many grains of corn, and by the same Wine made of many grapes.

Q. What is to be done after the receiving?

A. We must meditate of the covenant of new obedience, renewed by this
Sacrament, that we may more carefully perform it, and fly sin and vice all
the days of our life.

Godly Prayers.
A Morning Prayer for a private Family.
MOst merciful God, and heavenly Father, we give thee hearty thanks, for the
sweet sleep and comfortable rest which thou have given us this night past, and
for that thou have commanded by thy holy Word, that no man should be idle,
but always occupied in godly and virtuous exercises, every man according to
his calling; we most humbly beseech thee, that thine eyes may attend upon us,
daily defend us, cherish, comfort, and govern us and all our counsels,
studies, and labors in such wise, that we may spend and bestow this day, and
the residue of our whole life according to thy most blessed will and pleasure,
setting thee always before our eyes, living in thy fear, and working that
that may be found acceptable in thy sight, hating wrong and loving justice.
Also we beseech thee most merciful God, to strengthen and keep us in the faith
of thy Catholic Church, and kindle in us the love and light of thy holy
spirit, that we may walk godly and virtuously in this life, die in the truth
of thy word, and live with thee in everlasting glory: grant this most merciful
Father, for thy dear Son Jesus Christ his sake, in whose name we further pray
as he has taught us, saying, Our Father which art, etc.

An Evening prayer for a private Family.
Almighty and everliving God, we give thee most humble and hearty thanks,
that of thy free mercies thou have preserved us this day from all hurts and
dangers: vouchsafe also we most humbly beseech thee, to keep us this night and
ever hereafter, to save us from all our enemies both bodily and ghostly: give
our bodies quietness and sleep, but let our minds and souls continually
watch unto thee, think on thee and thy holy Law, that when the cheerful
light of the day shall appear, we being whole in body and soul, may joyfully
rise again, be thankful unto thee, and diligently walk in our vocations, to
our comforts, and the glory of thy blessed name, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.

A Prayer before the receiving of the holy Communion.
O Most merciful God, and heavenly Father, I miserable and wretched sinner,
acknowledge and confess, that I am not worthy the least of all thy mercies,
and most unworthy to receive thee under the roof of my soul, by participating
of thy most blessed body and blood, for horrible and infinite are the sins
wherewith I am defiled: therefore the very entrals of my heart are troubled, and
my bones do shake, because I find my soul a most unworthy ghest, for so
heavenly a supper. But thou camst not to call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance: and I know, and do constantly believe, that notwithstanding my
sins, thou can make me clean and worthy, and forgive me my sins: and through
thy power and mercy, I beseech thee, grant thy grace unto me a sinner, that I
may worthily approach to this heavenly Sacrament. Give me grace, before I
presume to come to the receiving hereof, I may examine my self, call my sins
to mind, and by unfeigned and hearty repentance return unto thee my Lord: make
me with heavy sobs to confess my sins, and pardon all my offenses: accept
me into thy favor, cleanse me from my wickedness, and forgive me all my sins.
Also grant, that receiving this thy Sacrament, I may put off the old man,
which is corruption, according to the lusts of error, and be renewed in the
spirit of my mind; and put on the new man, which after God is created in
righteousness and holiness of truth: and though by nature I cannot live without
spots of sin, yet so bless me, that I may never willingly offend thee, but
altogether depend upon thy goodness: and as a true penitent sinner, repenting of
my sins, I may approach to thy heavenly Supper. Grant (merciful Father) that
I may always worthily receive this blessed Sacrament and memorial of thy
death, according to thy holy ordinance, that it may increase in me all goodness.
Be thou the buckler, and perpetual defense of my soul and body, that I may
come unto thy kingdom, where I shall behold thee face to face; whither Lord
for thy mercies sake bring me. Amen.

A Thanksgiving after the receiving of the holy Communion.
ALmighty God, which have vouchsafed spiritually to give me these holy
mysteries of thy body and blood; mortify whatsoever is evil in me, and garnish
me with thy graces and virtues: renew my spirit, my soul and my body with thy
excellent grace: frame me after thy own hearts desire, and grant that I may
think, speak, do, and desire all things that may please thee: purge my
conscience from dead works, to serve thee the living God I thank thee with all
reverence of mind for bidding me a miserable sinner, unto the participation of
thy holy Supper, and the receiving of all celestial riches, whereby thou
bestowest on me particularly all the merits and good things which by thy death
thou have purchased for me, that I may be a partaker and fellow heir of
eternal blessedness. Raise up in me by this blessed Sacrament, a continual
remembrance of thy bitter passion: make me retain it in my mind, as a
sufficien ransom of my Redemption; let me never doubt of the forgiveness of
my sins; and as often as Satan assayleth me with his deadly temptations, give
me grace to run to this Sanctuary, as to a strong armor of defense; so that no
tribulation, anguish, persecution, life nor death, separate me from Christ my
Head, whereupon being made fast by thy holy Sacrament received, I (as a living
member) depend: and let me know that I am fed and refreshed by thy body, and
precious blood, that washed therewith, I give not my self hereafter to carnal
pleasures, but live in all sincerity and truth, as it becomes those that eat
af the immaculat Paschall Lamb. Give me grace, that laying aside all
maliciousness and envy, I may forgive every one as thou have forgiven me: give
me grace, that participating of the bread of eternal life, I may be
replenished with the fruition of thy blessed sight in thy celestial Paradise
for ever: and at my resurrection from death, appoint me a place, O merciful
Lord, at thy heavenly Table, where I may taste the new wine in the kingdom of
thy Father, abiding with thine elect Angels, and blessed Saints for evermore.
Amen.

Grace before Meat.
O Lord, bless unto our use thy Creatures, at this time provided for our
sustenance, that being preserved hereby, and comforted, we may do thee more
laudible service unto thy glory, who art the Author of all good unto us,
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Grace after Meat.
Continual praise be unto thee, O Lord, who do continually provide so
graciously for the feeding of our feeble bodies. Lead us hereby to a taste of
our spiritual food; so that by the help of both we may grow up in thy
service, both in body and soul, till at the last we attain thy heavenly
kingdom, and be for ever glorified both in soul and body, through Christ our
Lord Amen.

Grace before Meat.
O GOD, who have justly cursed the earth, and all things therein for the sin
of man, pardon our sins, turn away thy curse, and vouchsafe thy blessing
upon these thy gifts, which we are now to receive, that we using them with
temperance and thankfulness, may obtain by them refreshing and nourishment,
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Grace after Meat.
Merciful Father, who never ceasest to do good unto us, though we never cease
offending thee, and now more especially have renewed thy bounty, in feeding us
with thy blessings. Let not the common fruition of thy benefits make us
commonly, or lightly to esteem of them; neither when we are fed, let us wax
wanton against thee, abusing our strength to the service of sin. But let thy
perseverance in goodness, work in us perseverance in all dutiful obedience
to our lives end, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

FINIS.
