A godly letter sent too the fayethfull in London / Newcastell / Barwyke / and
to all other within the realm off England / that love the coming of our
LORD Jesus by Ihon Knox.

Math. 10. He that continues unto the end / shall be saved. Imprinted in
Rome, before the Castle of s. Aungel / at the sign of saint Peter. In the
month of July / in the year of our Lord. 1554. (?)

Ihon Knox To the faithful in London / Newcastell / Barwyke / and to all
others / within the Realm of England / that leuith the coming of our Lord
Jesus / Wissheth continuance in godliness too the end With a declaration of
prayer / annexeth to the same.
When I remember the fearthfull threathninges of God / pro^oficed against
Realms / Leuit. xx Matthew. x.
and nations / to whom the light of Gods word has been offered / and
contemptiously by them refused / as my heart unfeignedly / morneth for your
present estate / dearly beloved in our savior Ihesus Christ / so does the hole
powers / of body and soul / trymble and shake / for the plagues that are to
come. But that Gods true word has been offered to the realm of England can
none deny / except such as by the dyuel holden in bondage (God justly so
punishing their proud inobediens) has neither eyes to se / Timo. ij.
nor understanding to dycerne good from bad / nor darkness from light. Against
whom no otherwise will I contend at this present / then did the Prephete
Jeremy / against the styffe necked and stubborn people of Judah / saying:
Ierem. xxiii
The wrath off the Lord shall not be turned away, till he have fulfilled the
thoughts of his heart. And thus leave I them (as of whose repe^tau^ce there is
small hope) to the hands of him that shall not forget their horrible
blasphemis spoken in dispitte of Christ's truth / and of his true minister^
And with you that unfeignedly morneth for the great shipwrake of gods true
relygion / purpose I to communicate such counsailer / and admonicious / now by
my writing / as sometimes it pleased God / I did proclaim in your cares. The
end of which my admonicion is / that euin as that you purpose / and entend to
avoid Gods vengeance / both in this life / and in the life to come / that so
ye avoid and flee (as well in body as in sprete) al fellowship / and societye
with Idolaters in their Idolatrye. You shrynke (I know) euin at the first. But
if an orator / had the matter in ha^dlinge / he would prove it honest /
profitable / easy / and necessary to be done / and in every one point were
store enough / for a long oration. But as I never labored to persuade any man
in matters of religion (God I take to record in my conscience) except by the
very simplicity and plain infallable truth of Gods word. No more mind I in
this behaulfe. But this I affirm / that to fle from idolatrye / is so
profitable and so necessary to a Christian / that onles he so do / all worldly
profyth turns to his perpetual disprofeit / and condemnacion. Profijt
aperteyning / either to the bodies / or to the souls / of our selves / and our
posterity / corporal commodities consists in such things as man chiefly
couetith for the body / as riches / estimacion / long life / health and
quietness in earth. The only comfort and joy of the soul is God by his word
expelling ingoraunce / sin / and death / and in the place of those / planting
true knowledge of him self / and with the same justice and life / by Christ his
son. If any off these forsaide move us / then of necessity it is / that we
avoid Idolatry / for plain it is / that the soul has neither life nor
comfort / but by God alone / with whom Idolatours / 1. Cor. vl.
has no other participacion ^hen has the devils / and albeit that abominable
Idolatours / for a moment ^rysiphe yet approaches the hour / when Gods
vengeance shall stryke / not only their souls / but euin their vile
carcasies / shall be plagued / as God before has threatened. Leui. xxv
Their cities shall be burned / their land shall be laid wast / their enemies
shall dwell in their strong holds / their wives and daughters shall be defyted
their children shall fall in the edge of the swerd / mercy shall they find
none / because they have refused the God of all mercy / when lovingly and
long he called upon the^ / you would know the time / and what certitude I have
here off. To God will I appoint no time / but that these and mo plagues / shall
fall upon England (and that ere it he long) I am so sure / as that I am that my
God lives. This my affirmacion / shall displease many / and shall content few
/ God knowith the secrets of all hearts / knows that also / it displeases
myself / and yet like as before I have been compelled to speak in your presens
(and in presens of others) such things / as were not pleasable to the ears
of men / whereof (alas) a great part this day are come to pass / so I am
compelled now to write with the tears of my eyes / I know to your displeasur.
But dear brethren / be subject unto God / and give place unto his wrath / that
ye may escape his everlasting vengeance. My pen I trust / shall now be no
more vehement / then my tongue has been after then ones / not only before you
/ but also before the chief of the Realm. What was said in Newcastel and
Barwyke before the sweat. I trust yet some in those places bears in mind /
What upon the day of all Saints / ^et New^^stel wit^^es.
the year that the duke of Somerset was last apprehended. What before him /
that then was duke of Northumberland / in the town of Newcastell / and other
places moo: What before the kings majesty at Wynsore / Hamptoncourt / and
Westmynster / and finally what was spoken in London / in moo places then one /
when fyers of joy and ryotous bankettinge were made at the Proclamacion of
Mary your queen. If men will not speak / the stones and timber of those places
/ shall cry in fire / and bear record that the truth was spoken / and shall
absolve me / in that behalf in the day of the Lord.

Suspect not brethren / that I delight in your calamities / or in the plagues
that shall fall upon that unthankful nation. No / God I take to record / that
my heart mourns within me / and that I am crucyet for remembrance of your
troubles / but if that I should cease / then did I against my conscience /
as also against my knowledge / Eze. xxxiij
and so should be gyltie of the blood of those that peryshed for lack of
admonicions / and yet shall the plague not a moment the longer be delayed / for
the Lord has appointed the day of his vengeance / before the which he
sends trompettes and messingers / that his elect / watchynge with prayers /
and sobriety / may be his mercy esscape the vengeance that shall come. But
now you would know the grounds of my certitude / God graundt that hearing
them / you may understand / and stedfastlye believe the same. My assurances
are / not the maruailes of Marlynge / neither yet the dark sentences of
prophaine Prophets / but the plain Deu. xxvii Ierem v. Amos. iij.
His immutable justice must require the same. The ordenarye punishments and
plagues shows examples / What men then having understanding / can cease
to prophecye?

The word of God plainly speaks / Deuteronomy ^9.
that if a man shall hear the curses of Gods law / and yet in his heart shall
promys to him self / felicity and good luck / thinckinge / he shall have
peace / albeit he walcke after the Imaginacions of his own will and heart. To
such a man the Lord will not be merciful / but his wrath shall be kyndled
against him / and he shall destroy his name from under the heaven / how the
Lord threathneth plagues after plague / and ever the last to be the first /
whill finally / he will consume realms / and nations / if they repent not /
read the.26. Chapter off Leuiticus / which chapter / often I have willed you to
mark / as yet I do unfeignedly / anh think not / it apreta^neth to the Jews
only / No brethern. The Prophets are the interparatours of the law / and they
make the plagues off God common to all offendore / the punishment ever
beginning at the household of God. The wicked protestation of the late duke off
Northuberla^d / at the hour of his death / against his own conscience in hope
off ^yfe.

Esai. xiij.xv.xviij.cvij.xix. Ieremi. l lj. Ezech. xxv xxvi. ^7.


And here I must touch a poinct off that deuillishe confession made (a late)
by that miserable man / whose name for sorrow I can not recyte. This argument he
uses to prove the doctrine of late years done / taught amongst you / to be
wicked / Trobles and plagues (says he) has followed the same / not only here
in England / but also in Germany / as he wills you to mark. This fragill /
and vain argument at this time / no otherwise will I labor / to confute / then
by plain scriptures declaring / that plagues apertayneth to all inobedient /
beginning first / where Gods mercies has been offered / and obstinatly
refused / and that may answer the blind rage of ignorau^ces.

The Prophets Esai, Ieremi, Ezechieli, after they had proclaimed plagues to
fall upon the people off Israel / and upon the house of Judah / prophecyeth
particularlye against certain nations and cities / not only adiace^t in
circute about Jerusalem / but also against such / as were far distant / as
against Moah, Ammon, Palestina, Aegipt, Tirus, Damascus, and Babilone. And in
conclusion general prophesies / are spoken against all inobedient / and
sinful nations / as in the.24. chapter off Esaye plainly apeareth / Ierem. xxv
as also the Lord commanding Ieremye / to give the cup off his wrath / to al
nations / one after another / who should drink off the same / although they
refused it of his hand / That is albeit / they would not believe the voice off
the prophet / yet should they not escape. Ierem. ^.
The plagues that he spoke. For every nation like unto this / shall I punisshe
says the Lord of hosts / with the same agrees Amos saing: Amos. ix.
The eyes of the Lord are upon every sinful nation, to root it out of the
earth. These and many mo places evidently proves that plagues spoke in the
law of God / apertaineth to every rebellions people / be they Jew / or be they
Gentile / Christians intytel / or Turks in profession / And the ground off
the Prophets / was the same / The justice of God
which before I have rehearsed for my assuraunces / that England shall be
plagued / which is Gods immutable and inviolable justice / which can not
spare in one Realm and nation / those offenses that most severally he has
punisshed in another / for so were he in equal and made differe^s / as
touching execution off his just judgments / betwixt parson and parson /
which is most contrarious to the integrity off his justice / for thus he
speaks by Jeremy his prophet: Behold, Ierem. xxv
I have bego^ne to punisshe in the house where my name is incalled / and shall
I spare the rest, as the Lord would say / how can my justice permit those
crimes unpunished in proud contemptnors / that neither regards me / nor yet
my law / seeing I have not spared my own people / that externally bears some
reuere^s to my name.

England sinful.
That God has punished other realms and nations / men of small understanding /
will easly confess. But whether that like crimes has been / and yet are
committed within the realm of England / as were before the last plagues of
God among those nations / that is to be inquyred / in this case can nothing
better instruct us then Gods plain word / rebuking the vices / which
reigned in those days / And omitting all such as prophesied before / it shall
suffice for this time / to rehearse some places of Ieremye. The time of whose
prophecy well considered / shall make the matter more sensible. He begins in
the.13. year of the reign of king Josias and contine with till after the
destruccio^ of Jerusalem / which came in the.11. year of Zedechias / Long
preached this godly man to wite.39. years and six months / before the
uttermost of the plagues apprehended this stubborn nation and that he did with
much troble and injury sustained / as in his prophesyes / is to be seen. Be
all lykelyhold then / there were some Cob Carles / that were not pleased with
the proffit / neither yet with his preachinges. And yet plaine^t is / that no
King so truly turned unto God with all his heart / with all his soul / and with
all his strength / according to all the law of Moses / as did Josias / and
yet as said is. The prophet of God was trobled / not by no small number / for I
find him complain / universally and generally upon the peoples iniquity / for
thus judges he Gods speakinge. My people have committed dubble iniquity.
Ierem. ij.
They have forsaken me / the fountain of lyning water / and have dug to
the^ selfs Sestornes / that can hold no water. Why will thou iustefye
thyselfe? Under thy wings is found the blood of the souls of the poor
innocents / whom thou found not in corners / and yet thou say / I am
innocent. Ierem. iij.
Thou have gotten a whores forehead / thou can not think shame / my people is
folish / they know me not / Ierem. iiij. Ierem i.ix.
they are folysh children / and have no wysdo^ / wise they are to commit
mischief / but to do good they are all together ignorant. Every man may beware
of his neyghbor / and no man assuredly may trust in his brother / for every
man is beco^me dis^eatfull / they have practesed their tou^ges to lies / and
guyle. They have lef^ my law (says the Lord) and have followed the wicked
imaginacio^s of their own hearts / they have followed after Baalam / whom
their fathers taught them. The offenses of Judah before the captivity.
Of this and of many moo places like apeareth the general offenses / off that
people to have been defectio^ from God / shedding of innocent blood / Iustifiyng
of the^ selfs / and defense of their iniquity / while yet they abeu^ded in
reaf / murder / oppression / lies / craft / practice / deceat / and manifest
idolatrye / following the trade of their fathers / who under Manasses, and Ammo^
/ of whom the one in the beginning / the other all his life mantaineth Idolatry
/ had been the ringleders of all abhominacion.

The prophets off God wo^dering at so manifest iniquity judged that such
ingnorauncy and inobedie^ce was only among the rascals sort off men / and
therefore he says: Ierem. v.
These be but poor ones / they are folisshe / they know not the way of the
Lord / nor the judgment off their God / I will goo to the nobils and I will
talk with them / for they know the way off their Lord / and the judgments
of their God. But what finds he among them / he declared in these words,
Ierem. v.
They have all broken the yocke, they have heaped sin upon sin / and one
misschefe upon another / from the least unto the most / all are bent upon
auaryce / and gape for lucre / from the priest to the prophet / every man
dealth deceatfully. Ierem. vi.
Behold / their ears be incircu^cised / they can not aduert / The word of God
is a rebuke unto them / they delight not in it. They have committed abominable
misschiefe / What this abomination was / God shows to Ezechiel / E^^^k viii.
all had forsaken God in their hearts / in so much that a great number openly
/ had turned their backs unto God / and made sacrifice to the sun / every
man in his own secret closet. Yea / women mourned for that they were not
permitted to commit open abomination / is it not to be wondered that al
estates were so corrupt under so godly a prince. Ierem. v.
But our prophet Jeremy proceadith in his complainte / sayings / they can not
repent / neither yet think shame. They have denied the Lord / and said it is
not he / we shall neither se sweard nor hunger. You hear the obediens that the
prophet found among the princes off Judah / and yet I say / it is not to be
wondered that the vineyarde / which was so well mannured / brought forth no
better grapes. Harken England.
They had a king most godly minded / they had prophets (for Jeremy was not
alone) most faithful and fervent. They were admonisshed by diverse plagues / and
always the prophets called for repentance / and yet followed nothing / but
open contempt off God / and of his messingers. Osel. vl.
Their repentance were like the morning dew / it remained not / although they
cold say in their mouth / the Lord lives / yet were their oaths nothing but
lies. Ierem. v^
Find me one man / that does equity and justice etc. to him will I be
merciful says the Lord. Here was narow and sharp inquisition among so
great a multitude be like / there has not been very many / when he that
knows the secret thoughts searches so diligently. But before we proceade
further in this matter / it shall be profitable / to se how these procedi^ges
does agree with our estate and time. Comparyson betwixt England and Judah
before the destruction. King Edward the sixte.
And first that we had not Gods word offered unto us / will none (except
arrant papist) allege. We had a king off so godly disposition toward vertew
/ and chiefly toward Gods truth / that none from the beginning passed him /
and to my knowledge / none of his year did ever match him in that behalf /
if he might have been lord of his own will. In this mean time / if sins
did abound / let every man accuse his own conscience for here I am not minded
to specefie all that I know / neither yet is it necessary / seeing some
crimes were so manifest and so heighnous that the earth cold not hid the
innocent blood / nor yet could the heavens without shame / behold the craft /
the deceat / the violence and wrong / that openly was wroughte. And in the
mean ceason / the hand off God was busye over us / and his true messingers is
kept not silence. You know that the realm off England was visited with
strange plagues and whether that it was ever prophesied / that the worse
plagues were to follow / I appeal to the testemony of your own conscience / but
what ensewed here upon? Alas I am ashamed to rehearse it / universal contempt of
all godly admonitions / hatered of those that rebuked their vices: Autoresing
of such / as cold inuente most vylanye against the preachers of God. Witness
certain ballates.
In this matter I may be admitted for a sufficient witness / for I hard and saw
/ I understood and knew / with the sorrow of my heart / the manifest contempt and
the crafty devices of the devil against those most godly and learned preachers,
that this last Lent / Anno. 1553. were appointed to preach before the Kings
majesty / as also against all others / whose tou^ges were not tempered by the
holy water of the court too speak it plainlye / who flatteringe against
their own conscience / could not say / all was well / and nothing neded
reformacion.

What reverence and audience was given unto preachers / this last Lent / by
such as then were in authority / their own countinaunces declared assuredly /
even such as was given to Ieremye / they hated such / as rebuked their vice /
and stubbernlye they said: We will not amend / and yet how boldly their
sins were rebuked / such as were present / can witness with me / almost
there was none / who did not prophesye and plainly spoke the plagues that are
begone / and assuredly shall end. Master Grindall plainlye spoke the death
of the Kings majesty / Master Grindal.
complayninge upon his household servants / who / neither feared to rail
against the word off God / and against the true preachers of the same.

That godly and fervent man master Lever / plainly spoke the desolacion off
this common wealth. Master Lever. Master Bradford
And master Bradforde (whom God for Christ's his son sack comfort to the
end) spared not the proudest of them / but boldly declared / that Gods
vengeance shortly should strycke / those that then were in authority /
because they lothed and abhorred the true word of the everlasting God / and
willed the^ to take example by a noble man / who became so cold in hearing
Gods word / that the year before his death / he would not disease him self to
hear a sermon / God punisshed him (said that godly preacher) and shall he
spare you that be dubble more wicked? No / ye shall say / will ye / or will ye
not / ye shall drink of the cup of the Lords wrath / Iudicium domini,
Iudiciu^ domini. Master Haddon.
The judgment of the Lord / the judgment of the Lord / cried he with a
lamentable voice / and weaping tears. Master Haddon / most lernedly opened the
causes of the byepassed plagues / and assured them / that the worse was after
to come / If repentance shortly were not found. Much more I hard of these
four / and of others / which now I may not rehearce / and that (which is to
be noted) after that the hole counsel had said they would hear no mo of their
sermons / they were indiscreet fellows / yea / and pratynge knaves / but I will
not speak all / for if God contynew me in this troble. I purpose to prepare a
dysshe / forsuche as then led the ryng / yea / who but they^ but now they
have been at the skoole of Placebo / and there they have learned amongst ladies
to daunse as the devil list to pype. Against those / whom God has stryken /
seeing now rests to them no place of repentance / nothing mind I to speak.
But such as live to this dai / would be admonisshed that he that has punished
the one / will not spare the rest But to our matter. This presidents I judge
sufficient to prove this our age to have been / and yet to remain like wicked
(if it be not worse) with the time of Ieremye. Now let us search what followed
in Judah? Mischefe upon mischefe / notwithsta^dinge the continual and long
cryeng of the prophets / whil finally God in his anger took away good king
Josias / liij. Regum xxllj.
because he was determened to destroy Judah / as before he had destroyed
Israel. After the death of this godly King / great was the troble / diverse and
sundry were the alteracions in that comme^ wealth. Three kings taken prisoners
/ one after other in short space / what other were the miseries of that
stubbern nation. O God, for thy great mercies sake, let never thy small and
troubled flock / within the realm of England / learn in experiens. But in
all those trobles / no repentance appeared / as by the prophet ye may learn /
for thus he cries: Ierem. v. ^ Esai. 1.
Thou haste stryken them o Lord / but they have not mourned / thou have
destroyed them / but they have not received discipline. Ieremi. xij.
They have hardened their faces harder then stones / they will not convert: The
hole la^d is wasted / but no man will wyn / Ierem. xiij.
ponder and consider / the cause. This people will not hear my word / They
walk in the wicked invention of their own hearts: They go after other gods
to worship and serve them and of the prophets natural friends of the men of
Anathotes / some plainly said. Speak no more to us in the name of the Lord /
least thou dye in our hands / belyke these men had small fantasye to Gods
prophet. But yet shall a sermon (and that which ensewid the same) made in the
beginning of the reign of Iehoiakim / son to Josias / make evident / and
better known / how much the people were bent to Idolatrye / and to hear
false prophets / after the death of their good king. The prophet is commanded
by God to stand in the court or entres of the Lords house / and to speak to
all cities of Judah / that then came to worship / in the house of the Lord /
and is commanded to keep no word back / if peradventure (says the Lord)
they will harken and turn every man from his wicked way. The tenor of his
sermon / is this / Thus faith the Lord: Iere. xxvi.
if ye will not obey me to walk in my laws / which I have given you / and to
hear the words of my servants the prophets whom I sent unto you / rising
up betymes and still sending / if ye will not hear the^ (I said) then will I do
to this house / as I did unto Silo / and will make this city / to be abhorred
of all the people in the earth. Hear not the words of the prophets / that
said unto you / you shall not serve the king of Babylon / Iere. 27.
I have not sent them (says the Lord) howbeit / they are bold to prophesye
lies in my name / if you give ear unto them / both you and your false
prophets shall perish: Deny vvil I nothing except Idolators. But the li^e
was done in England.
Here is first to be noted / that the people was already entered in to iniquity
/ and especially straighte after the death of their king / into Idolatry / from
which the Lord by his prophet labored to call them back / threatening unto
them desolation / if they proceed to rebel. Such false prophets at this
present are much esteemed in England.
Secondarely / it is to be observed / that amongst them were false prophets /
not that they were so known / and holde^ of the people / no / they were holde^
and esteemed for so they boasted them selfs to be. The true church of God that
cold not err / for how should the law perish from the mouth of the preasts.
Ierem. 18
These false prophets were mayntaynors of Idolatry / and yet boldelye
promised to the people prosperity and good luck. Wherewith the people were so
abused and blinded / that the words of Ieremye / did rather harde^ their
hearts / then provoke any to repentance / as the consequentes declared / for
his sermon ended / the priests / prophets / and the hole people apprehended
Ieremye / and with one voice cried / he is worthy of the death. Great was the
uproar against the poor prophet / Ierem. 26
in which appearinglye / he could not have escaped the death. If the princes
of Judah / had not hastelye comme from the kings house / in to the temple / and
had taken upon them / the hearing of the cause / in which after much debate
(while some defendid and some accused the prophet most vehemently) the text
says / that the hand of Ahikan the son of Saphan, In England the true
prechers are cast into prison, and no cause known whi.
was with Ieremye / that he should not be given into the hands off the people
/ to be killed. Hereof you may easlye consider (beloved brethren) what were the
ma^nours of that wicked generation immediately / after the death of their good
king / and how they were encoraged to Idolatrye by false prophets / but in
all this time / the prophet cease not most faithfully / to execute his
office / for albeit after this he might not enter in the temple (for he was
forbidden to preach) Ier^. 36.
yet at Gods commandment / he writing his sermons / and causing them to be
openly read in the temple (alas I fear we lack Baruck) and after they come
to the ears of the counsel / and last to the king. And albeit in dispyte
they were ones brent / Yet is Jeremy commanded to writ again / and boldly
to say: Iehoiakim shall have no sede, that ever shall sit upon the seat of
David. Their carrion shall be casten to the heat of the day / and to the fr^st
in the night / and I shall viset says the Lord the iniquity of him / of his
sede and of his seruasites / and I shall bring upon them / upon the dwellers in
Jerusalem and upon all Judah / all the calamities that I have spoken against
them.

Albeit / when these words were spoken and written / so they were contempned /
that they d^^st cry / Let the counsel of the holy one of Israel come, Iere.
xviij.
we will follow the devises of our own hearts / yet no word of his
threatninges were spoken in vain / for after many plagues sustained by the
misschefes father / the wicked and miserable son in the third month of his
reign was led prisoner to Babylon. iiij. Regum xxiiij.
But now when the time of their desolation approaches / There are to many off
such preachers, now in England.
God styred above the^ such a king / such prophets and priests / as their
own hearts wished / even such as should without repugnaunce / lead them to
their vomet again / that they who never delyted in the truth / might fill
their bellyes with horrible lies. Jeremy. xxx viii.
Zedechias was king / and such as long had resisted poor Ieremye / had now
gotten in their hand / the fearful whippe of correction Paschar / and his
companyons led the king as they lift / un goith Topeth (a place of
Idolatry) the hill Aulters smoketh with incense: Aduertie England / th^s did
Judah.
Ba^l and his bellye G^ddes / before the vengeance of God / was poured upon
them / and upon them whom they deceauid / gettet the day their long looked
for. Inconclusion / so horrible were the abominations that newly were erected
/ As Pas^^^^ ruled the King than at his pleasur, so does the B. of Winchester
rule the queen now, and does what him lusts in England. O vviccednes
intolerable, Iere. xi.
that the Lord cries to his sore trobled flock / what has my well-beloved too
do in my house (meaning in the temple of Jerusalem) seeing the multitude
commits such abhominatio^ / they have provoked me to anger / burninge
incense unto Baal.

Which great abominations / when God had shewin / not only to Jeremy / who
then was in Jerusalem / but also to Ezechiel being prisoner in Babylon. Their
bodies being separated / in prophecy they did both agree / that hole Israel
and Judah should be destroyed. Thus writes Ezechiel / Ah / upon all the
abominations of the house of Israel / they shall fall by the swearde / by
pestilence and hunger / he that is far of shall dye of the plagues / he that is
^ye / shall fall by the swearde / he that is left / and is beseaged / shall dye
by hunger / and I shall co^plet my wrath upon them. And Jeremy says: Behold /
I will give this city in the hands of the Caldees / in the hand of
Nabuchod^^ser / king of Babylon / who shall take it. Jeremy xxxij.
The Caldees verily shall enter in to it / and they shall burn i^ with fire / and
the houses in which they burnt incense to Baal. etc. The children of Israel
and the children of Judah had done nothing from their youth / but wickedness
and that before my eyes to provoke me to anger / They have turned unto me their
backs / and not their faces: They / their kings / their princes / All the
glystering ceremonies off the papists are very donge^ and abhominacion before
God.
their prophets / their priests / hole Judah and all the city of Jerusalem /
they would not hear / and be reformed. They have set up their do^ge (so
terms he their Idols) in the place that is consecrate to my name. And where
the king of Babylon was lyeng about the city / he says to the messyngers of
Zedechias (who were sent to demand of the prophet / what should become of
the city). Ierem^e. xxxvij.
The Caldees shall take this city and shall burn it with fire: Yea / if you
had killed all the host of the Caldees that besageth you / Who would not have
called the prophet a traitor Iere. 38.
and if they killed / me^ were left / every man should rise in his tent / and
should burn this city with fire / he that abides in this city shall dye /
either by sweard / by hunger / or by pestile^s / but he that shall go furthe to
the Caldees / shall live / and shall win his soul for a pray / And to the
king in secret askinge his counsel / he boldly says / if suddenly thou
shall go forth to the princes of the Babylonians. Thy soul shall live / and
this city shall not be brent with fire / but and if thou go not forth to the
captains of the Babylonians / this city shall be given over into the hands of
the Caldees / who shall burn it with fire / neither shalt thou escape their
hands. Thus did these two prophets (as also did others) before them plainlye
speak the desolation of that place / for such offenses / as before has be^
rehearsed. But how pleases such messaige the city of Jerusalem? the priests
/ princes and people of Judah? and what reward receaueth Jeremy for his long
travail and painful preachinge. The crimes laid against Jeremy Iere, 9.23

he was unfriendly to the faith, that Passhur taught the people: To weke / the
faith of their forefathers / who always rebelled against God. And therefore he
was reputed a heretycke / accused of sedicion / and dampened of treason. Plain
preachinges were made against all that he had spoken / and such felicity was
promised / that within two years should the yocke of Nabuchonosor be broken
from the necks of all people and the vessels of the lords house (together
with all prisoners) should be brought again to Jerusalem. Iere. 13.
Habo^dau^ce came before the destruction. Iere. 38.
Now did this habound with wine and oil / O pleasing and blessed amongst the

the king / but also the hole multitude so blinded / that boldly they durst

hunger. The king of Babylon shall never come against this land. Iere. 27
In the midst of these stormy trobles / no other comfort had the prophet /
then to complayn to his God / at whose commandment he had spoken. And in this
his complaint he is so kyndled against their Idolatry / and great
unthankfulness that he cries / as in a raige. O thou Lord of hosts, Iere. ^0.

Consider (dear brethern) if all things / as appertayninge to iniquity be a
like betwixt England and Judah / before the destruction thereof / yea / If
England be worse then Judea was in those days / seeing God spared not them /
shall we think that the Lords vengeance shall sleep / man's iniquity being so
ripe? No dear brethren: Iere. ix.
He that has understanding must know the contrary, And he to whom the
Lords mouth has spoken / must show the causes / why the land shall be waste.

It may offend you / that I call England worse / then was unthankful Judea /
but if good and evident reasones advised may take place / then I fear not
judgment. Wherein Judea was better then England is now.
From Jerusalem / many passed at admonition of the prophets / leaving all that
they had / rather then they would abide the danger of Gods plagues that were
threatened. Gods prophets has cried. but I hear not of many that prepares
to fly / God grant they repent not. In Jerusalem were princes / and noble
men who defended Jeremy, and also that did absolve him / when wrongfully he was
accused by the priests. But how many now of the nobility within England
boldly speaks in in the defense of Gods messinger is easy too be told.
Amongst them had Gods prophet lyberty / to speak in maintenance of his
doctrine. How such as seeks a trial of their doctrine / has been and are
entreated amongst you / it is hard of in strange countries. In Jerusalem was
Abdemelech / why when the prophet was cast in pryso^ (as worthy of death)
boldly past to the king / and defending the innocence of the innocent /
obtayneth his liberty / but in England I hear of none (God stur some) that dare
be so bold / as to put their hands betwixt the Lions / and their pray / the
poor saints of God / and those cruel murderers. In Jerusalem / Jeremy
being dampened to prison / was fed of the kings charges / and that when great
hunger and scante of bread was in the hole city: In London where all plenty
haboundes / are Gods messingers permitted to hunger. Yea / (O horrable to be
hard) and aunciente fathers / are so cruelly entreated / that like extremetye
has seldom been used upon thieves and murderers. In this behalf do I not blame
you (beloved brethren) for I assuredly know your hearts to mourn for the
trobles of your brethren / and faithful preachers, and that you seek all
means possible / how they may be comforted and releaued / but these things
to the end that you mayese / that more abhominacion / and less fear of God /
more in just dealing / and lose shame more cruel persecucion against Gods
messengers / and less mercy and gentleness / is now amongst your chief rulars

As it is most profitable for body and soul to avoid Idolatry / so is it so
necessary / that onles we so do / we refuse to be in leage with God. What we
do when we ioyn our selfs with idolaters Exo. xx.
We declare ourself to have no faith / and we ^enye to be Gods witness / and so
must he of this justice expressed in his word deny us to apertaine to him or
to his kingdom. And then (alas) what restith for us / but perpetual death
ordained for those that will not continue in leage with God. The leage between
God and us conteyneth these conditions / that God shall be our God / and we
shall be his people / he shall communicate with us / of his graces and goodness we
shall serve him in body and soul / he shall be our sauegarde from death and
damnacion / we shall stick too him / and fle from all strange Gods. This is
the leage in making whereof we swear solempnedly / never to have fellowship with
any religion / except with that which God has auctoris^d by his manifest
word. If by Gods scriptures these presydents be so plain / that reasonably no
man can de^ye any point thereof. Then have I good hope that ye will admit it to
be necessary / that you avoid Idolatry / if the leage between God and you
shall be kept sure. And first it is to be observed / that Gods justice / being
infinite in matters of religion / requires like obediens of al those that be
within his leage at all times / that he requires of any one nation / or
particular man in any one age / for all that bide with i^ his leage / Deu. 29.
are one body (as Moses does witness) recompting men / women / children /
servants / princes / priests / officers / and strangers within the
covenant of the Lord. Then what God requires of one (as touching this leage)
he requires of all / for his justice is immutable / and what he dampneth in
any one that he must dampne in others / for he is righteous without
parcialitie. Then let us consider what God has required of such as has been
in leage with him / and what he pronounces dampnable. Deu. xiij
Moses the mouth of God to his people of Israel speaks as follows: If thy
brother the son of thy mother / or the wife of thy own bosom / or thy
neighbor / whom thou love as thy own life / shall privily solyst the / Sayng
let us go and serve other Gods, whom thou have not known. etc. Obey him not
/ hear him not / neither yet let thy eye spare him / be not merciful unto him /
nor hyde him not / but kill him / let thy hand be the first upon him / that
such a one may be killed / and then the hands of the holy people stone him
with stones / until he dye. And likewise commands he to be done with a hole
city / if the indwellers thereof turn back to Idolatry / addinge also / that
the city and the whole spoil thereof shall be brent. That no portion shall be
saved / nor yet that the city shall be builded forever again because it is
accursed of God.

Here is a plain declaracion / what God requires of them that will continue in
leage with him / and what he has dampened by his expressed words. And do we
esteem (beloved brethren) that the immutable God will wincke at our Idolatry /
as that he saw it not: seeing he commands judgment to be executed so seuerly
against Idolators / and against such as only provoked or solisted others to
Idolatry / that neither should blood nor affinity neither multitude nor
riches / save such as offends / neither yet that we should cou^sayll their
offenses / but that we should be the first that should accuse brother / son /
daughter / or wife / and why? because he entendeth (says Moses) to bring the
from the Lord thy God / Who led thy forth from the land of Egipte / and
therefore let him dye / that all Israel hearing / may fear / and presumed not
after too commit the like abomination. Let nothing apertayninge to such a man
or city / cleave unto thy hand / that the Lord may turn from the furor of his
wrath and be moved over thy with most tender mercy and affeccion / and that he
may multiplye thy / as he has sworn unto thy fathers.

Vvliij Idolatry is too be eschevved. and the mainteners thereof.
In these words most evidently is expressed unto us / why God will that we
avoid all fellowship with Idolatry / and with the maintainers of the same: In
which are three things chiefly to be noted / first that the holy Ghost
instruct us / that maintaynours of Idolatry / and prouokers to the same /
inte^deth to draw us from God / and therefore he commands us / that we shall
not cou^sail their i^pietie / but that we shall make it known / and that we
shall punish it / if we will have the leage betwixt us and God too stand
sure. And here is the firmamente of my first cause / why / it is necessary to
avoid Idolatry / because that otherwise we declare our selfs litell to
regard / yea / to have broken / and plai^ly denied that holy leage / which is
between us and God / through Christ Jesus. Seco^darely it is to be noted / that
Idolatry so kindles the wrath of God / that it is never quenched / until the
offenders / and all that they poses / be destroyed from the earth / and that by
fire. It may appear that this is seueare and rygorous judgment / but let the
cause be considered / and the^ shall we understand / that in the same / God
shows unto us his most singular love / declaring him self enemy unto our
enemies / for all those that would draw us from God (be the kings or queen's)
being of the devils nature / Dravvers of men from God are of the devils nature.
are enemies unto God / and therefore will God that in such cases / we declare
our selfs enemies unto them. And last it is to be noted / that obedie^s given
unto God / in taking ve^geau^ce upon Idolatours / by such means / as God has
appointed / is a cause why God shows his mercy / why he multiplieth us / and
enbraseth us with brotherly love / where contrary wise / by co^sentinge with
Idolatrye / are the mercies of God shut up from us / and are cutted of the
body of Christ / to wyther and root / as trees without moisture. But now
shall some demand / what then? shall we go too / and kill all Idolatours.
Question Answer
That were the office and duty of every ciuell magistrate within his realm
and Iurisdiccion. But of you is required only to avoid participacion and
company of that abhominacion / as well in body as in soul / as David and Paul
plainly teaches. Psalm. xvi
David in his exile / in the mids of Idolatours says: I will not offer their
drink offeringes of blood, neither yet will I take their name into my mouth,
and Paul says: 1. Cor. x.
You may not be partakers of the Lords table, and of the table of devils, you
may not drink the Lords cup / and the cup of devils. As these two places / of
scriptur plainly resolves the former question / so do they confirm that which
is before said. That the leag betwixt us and God requires / auoydinge off all
Idolatrye. 1. Regu^. xxvij.
First plain it is / that in Gathe and in Corinthus / were no small number off
Idolatours / when David was there in exile / and when Paul wrote his Epistle /
yet neither says David / that he will kyl any in that place because he was
their magistrate / neither gives Paul any such commandment / but in one
thing they both agree / that such as has socitie and leage with God / must so
abhor Idolatrye / that no part of the body be defiled therewith. For David
says: I will not take their names in my mouth. As he would say / so odious
are the names of false and vain Gods / that the mention of them is
righteouslye compared to stinckinge donge / and vile carrion / which neither
can be eaten / neither yet smellid without displeasur of such that has not
lost the judgment of their senses / and therefore says David / I will not
defyle me mouth with the^ / that is / I will never speak one favorable word of
them. I think much less / would he have croched and kneled before them for
any man's pleasure. Aduert brethren / Shyfte makers are double dissemblers.
that David inspyred with the holy Ghost knew no such sheftes / as worldly
wise men imagyn now a days: That they may kept their hearts pure and clean
to God / howbeit / their body dau^se with the devil: Not so dear brethren, not
so, The temple of God has nothing to do with Idols. The cause expresses David
in their words: The Lord him self is my portion and my enheritaunce. Great
is the cause / if it be deaply considered. David illuminated by the holy Ghost
seyth eue^ the self same thing / which before we have aleaged of the Apostles
words / that God will not part spoil with the devil / promitting him to have
the servant of the body / and he too stand content with the soul / heart
and mind. No brethren / David marketh this / the fundament and reason / why /
he will neither offer sacrefice to Idols / neither yet defyle his mouth with
their names / because (says he) the Lord is my portion, What the leage
between us and God requires.
as he would say / such is the co^dicio^ of the leage between me and my God /
that as he is my tower of defense against my enemies / preserving and norishing
both the body and soul / so must I be hole his in body and soul / for my
God is of that nature / that he will suffer no portion of his glory to be given
to another. In confirmation of this says Esaias / Esai. 57.
after he had rebuked their Idols and vain inuecinons. These are thy portion,
and Jeremy likewise, in mockinge of the^ says / let thy bedfellowes deliver
thy / call upon them / and let them hear thy / thou have committed fornicacion
and whordome with stock and stone. Ierem. 3.
The prophets meaning thereby / that Idolators can have no leage nor covenant
with God / in so far / that their hearts be alyenated from him / which the
service of their bodies does testefye / and therefore renounceth God such leage
/ and bound as was before offered for Esaias would say / even such as thou
have chosen / such shall be the portion. And Ieremye would say / thou put thy
trust to them / which he means / by the lye^g with the^ in bed / and therefore
let them show their power in thy deliverance / and thus he sends them as it
were to suck water from hot burninge coals. Note well
It shall nothing excuse / to say we trust not in Idols / for so will every
Idolatour allege / but if either you or they in Gods honor / do any thing
contrary to Gods word / you show your self to put your trust / in somewhat
else besides God / and so are you Idolatours. Mark brethren / Trusting in man's
vvisdome is Idolatry.
that many makes an Idol of their own wisdom or fantasye / more trusting to
that / which they think good / nor unto God / who plainly says not that
thing / which seameth good in thy eyes / do unto thy God / but what thy Lord
God has commanded them. But of this some other time / God willing / more
shall be spoken hereof / I suppose it be plain / that like as God is immutable /
who / by his law / has not only forbidden all fellowship with Idolators in
their Idolatry / but also has commanded that vengeance / and punishment be
taken upon the^. And as the saints of God were inspired with the holy ghost
/ who would not so much as ones fauourablye speak of Idols / Mark.
and last as the scriptures be infallable / which promises that God may not
abide / that our bodies serve the devil / in joining our bodies with Idolatry
/ so is it off more necessity / that both in body and soul / we abstain
from the same / if we will have the leage between God and us to stand sure. I
will not troble this time with au^swering to any such objections / as men
sekinge to leave as they list / does now a days invent / seeing that partly
in another letter: I have au^swered the same / and if God shall grant any rest
in this wicked world / I purpose by the grace of God / as occasion shall be
offered fully to answer what can be said for their defense / which in very
deed / when all is said that they can / they have said nothing that God will
admit. By frequentin of Idolalatrie, men show them self to have no faith.


Now restith to show that in haunting Idolatry / we declare our selfs too be
without faith / and does deny to bear witness unto God / but that faith
purges the heart / I trust none of you will deny. But whether that inward
faith requires an eternal confession / and if a man may not have faith / and
yet do in ceremonies of the Church / as the world does / herein perchance
you doubt. As too the first the Apostle answers in these words / Romans 10.
in the heart it is believed unto Justice / but by the mouth is confession unto
salvation.

And David says: I have believed / and therefore I have spoken / but I was sore
trobled / as David would say / I would not counsel the confession of my
faith / howbeit / troble did ensew the same. Thus the holy Ghost joins faith
and confession / as things that be inseparable the one from the other / and
therefore dare I not take upon me to disceauer them / but must say / that
where true faith is / there is also confession of the same / Note well
when time and necessity requires / and that where confession is not found
that their faith is a sleep / if we be not from home.

Now is it to be considered / if this time requires the confession of our
faith. Whether this time requires confession of our faith.
Christ and his Euangile are oppugned / his holy sacraments are profaned.
Christ's messengers are some exiled / some cruelly tormented in prison / our
adversaries has gotten the vpperhande / and an execrable Idol / the mass
erected up in confirmation of all iniquity. What now shall I do? that am
assured that all this is abhominacio^ / here Christ is in battle / shall I do
as the multitude / or as Christ's enemies does / what confession give I then?
Assuredly even such as the rest does / for neither does foot / hand / eye /
nor mouth witness the contrary. Note.
The feet carries the body to serve an Idol. The eye beholds it with a
certain reverence. The mouth dare not whisper what the heart thi^keth / yea /
the hands are extended / and gives significacion of humble obedience. Have I
not now iustefied the deuell / and damned Christ? it can not be denied. But
let me have no credit / onelesse the same be yet proved by most plain
demonstrations of Gods sacred scripture. The Lord by his prophet Esaye /
says his people of Israel / and this is answer also to the second question /
if I may not do as the world does / and yet have faith / You are my
witnesses, Esai 44.
whether there be any God but I alone / is there any creator that I should not
know him These words were spoken / as it were making an entresse too rebuke
all Idolatry and the vain inue^tours of the same / as the Lord would say.
Thou house of Jacob / and your natural children / discending from Abraham. You
are my people / whom peculiarly I have chosen to show in you the greatness of my
name / and for that end have I spoken unto you / hid things from the
beginning / that you may understand and know that there is no knowledge but in
me alone / that you persuaded of my infinet wisdom / power and goodness may
testefye / and bear witness of the same / too such as has not then like
understanding with you. Hereof it is plain / that of such as to whom God
gives knowledge / he requires a confession to provoke the ignorance to
embrace God and his word / or at least that by the understanding man / the
vanity of the folishe should be rebuked. So zealous is God over his gifts /
that if we labor not to employe them to the glory of God / and to proffit of
others his creatours / he will according to the threatening of Christ / take the
talent from us / and will give it to such as will labor there upon. Some
perchance would gladly labo^ / but theyse not what fruit shall succeed / and
therefore judge they better to cease. Even as God could bring forth no fruit /
except he make us first of counsel. God is to be obeyed in his
commandments / and the success is to be committed to him / whose wisdom
is unsearchable / he commands us refrain Idolatry / to let other me^ see
that they do wrong. Why we should abstain from Idolatry.
This ought we obey / albeit the present death should follow / for we are called
as witness between God and the blind world / as is beforesaid: Israel thou art
my witness. The world asks / Note.
is the man's Gods service / or is it Idolatry? God has opened to us / that it
is abominable Idolatry / but when that we for fear of our vile carkases /
The mass is abominable Idolatry.
do as the blind world does. What witness bear we? Assuredly false witness
against God / for that we iustefye and mayntaine that with our presence / which
God condemns against our neighbor / for that we confirm him in error to
both our condemnacions. But when we abstaye from all fellowship of Idolatry /
what ever ensewe there upon / we do our duties unto Gods glory. Let no man
think that I am more seuear then necessity requires. No brethren / I always
contein my affirmations / within the bounds of Gods scriptures / and that shall
Jeremy the prophet witness / who writing to the Jews / being prisoners in
Babylon / after he had forbidden them to follow the vain relygion of that
people / amongst whom they wexe then conversant by many reasons / prouinge
that their Idols were no Gods / at last he says / you shall say to them:
Ierem. 10
The Gods that made neither heaven neither earth, shall perish from the
earth / and from under the heaven. Here is to be observed / as Ihon Calvin /
that singular instrumente off God most diligently notes.

That the rest of the prophets work was written in the Hebrew tongue / The
prophet co^straineth the Jews, to declare their confession against Idols and
that chau^ginge their natural to^g.
which then was peculiar to the Jews / but these verses and words above
rehearsed / were written in the Caldee tongue / in the tongue of that people /
when the Jews were then in thraldom as that the prophet would constrein them
to change their natural tongue / and in plain words declare the hatered
and alienation / which they had from all worshippynge off Idols. I beseech you
brethren / mark the words of the prophet / he says not / you may think
in your hearts / that they are vain / and that they shall perish / but you
shall say it / and that not preuely / but to them / who put their trust in
such vanity / as that the three children openly spoke / denyenge to give the
reverence of their bodies before an Idol. And Daniel that would not keep
secret the confession of his faith only thyrty days / as in my former letter
more plainly is express^d / hereof it is plain that requyringe that you
prophaine not your bodies with Idolatry. I require no more then Gods
scriptures by plain precepts and examples teaches. Neither yet require I of
every man / and at all times so much. For I constrai^ne no man to go to
Idolators / in the time of their Idolatry / and to say that all that they do /
is abominable and naught. But only that we keep our own bodies (called of
the Apostle the temples of the holy Ghost) 1. Cor. 5.
clean from all such diabolical conuencions / which that we do is most
profitable / and also necessary to the preservation of our selfs / and of our
posterity / of whom somewhat (now at the end) must I speak.

Every man that is not degenerated too the nature of a brute beast / will
appear to bear such love to his children / that to leave them rich / in
rest / and in good state / he pacie^tly will suffer troubles / and without
grudge will do many things / that otherwise are contrary to his own
pleasure. And with my heart I wish to God / that the perfection of this were
more deaply grounded in man's heart / I mean very love / 1. Cor. 13
and not fond folishnes / which under the name of love / procures
destruction of body and soul / where contrariwise / true love most carefully
labors for salvation of both / if this love I say / toward our children
/ which every man pretends to have / be in us. Then of necessity it is /
that for these causes we shall aduoid all society of those filthy
abominations. This my affeccion may apeare strange but if it be with
indifferencye perceived / it shall be very easy to be understand.

unthankful unto god. Neither yet I would that you should flatter your selfs
/ thinking that such a tro^pet shall be blown to your posterity / as has
been blown unto you. Let the reader understand.
If all come to so close silence / as che Lords messengers fond the beginning
of this our age. When this hole realm of England was drouned in so deadly a
sleep / that the sound of the Lords trompet was not understand / while
first the most part of the blowers gave their blood in a testimony / that
their doctrine was the same / which began with blood / was planted and kept in
mind by the same / and by blood increased / and did fructefye / will the Lord
have his messengers to fight alone? Note.
will he bestow such abundaunce off blood upon your children / to encorage
them / as that he did upon you / for your instruction and encoragement / if
that ye all so traytorously fle from him / in the day of this his battle.
The contrary is greatly to be feared. Often reuoluinge how God has used my
tongue (my tongue I say / being most wretched of others) plainly to speak the
trobles that are perfet. There occurreth to my mind a certain admonicion /
that God would / I commonly should use in all congregations. The admonition
was this / that the last trompet was in blowynge within the realm of England
/ and therefore ought every man to prepare him for battle / for if the trompet
should cease / and be put too silence / then should it never again blow with
like force in England / till the coming of the Lord Jesus. O dear brethren
/ how sore these threatninges perseth my own heart this day / only God
knows / and in what agonye of heart I write this same / God shall declare /
when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed. I wyshe my self to be
accursed of God / as touching all earthly pleasure or comfort for one year of
that time / which (alas) neither you nor I did righteously esteem / when all
abounded with us. I sob and groan / I call and I pray / that in that point I
may be deceived. But I am commanded to stand content / for it is God him self
/ that perfourmeth the words of his true messengers / his justice and order
can not be perverted. The sun keeps his ordenary course / and leapeth not
back from the West to the South / but when it goith down we lack the light
of it till it rise the next day toward the East again. And so is it with the
light of the gospel / which has his day appointed by God / Ioh. 12.
as witnesses Christ saying while ye have the light / believe in the light /
that darkness apprehe^d you not. Romans 13. Heb. 3.
And Paul / the night is passed / and the day is come (meani^g of the gospel)
and also this day / if you hear his voice harden not your hearts. And albeit
that this day be all time from Christ's incarnacion / till his last coming
again. Note.
Yet evident it is / that all nations has not had at one siene the light of
gods word. But by the contrary most evident it is / that where the light of
the gospel for ma^s unthankfulness / has been taken away / there is it not to
this day yet restored again / witness hole Israel / and all the congregatio^s of
the gentylles where Christ was first preached by thapostels. What is in Asya?
ignorance of God / what in Affrika? Examples of gods vengeance: against
vntha^kefulnes.
abnegation of Christ / what in those most notable Churches of the Grecia^s /
where Christ was planted by Paul and long after / uttered by others? Mahomet
and his false sect / Yea / what is in Rome? the most Idol of all others / that
adversary to Christ / that man of sin extolled above all that is called God.
Has God punisshed those nations before us / not only the first offenders /
but even their posterity to this day / and shall he spare us? if we be like
unthankful as they were / yea / if we be worse then they were? for of them no
small number suffered persecution / banishment / sclaunder / pouertye / and
finally the death for the profession of Christ / who having only this knowledge
/ that Idols were odious before God / could neither for lose of temporal goods
/ for honors offered if they would obey / nor yet for most cruel torments
suffered in resisting ones be persuaded to bow before Idols. And (alas) shall
we after so many graces that God has offered unto us for pleasure / or for
vain threatening of those / whom your hearts knows / and your mouths has
confessed to be odious Idolatours / run back to Idolatry / to the perdicion
of your selfs / and of your posterity to come. Shall gods holy precepts
work no greater obedience in you? shall nature no otherwise mollifye your
hearts? shall not fatherly pity overcome that cruelnes. O behold your chyldern
/ and consider the end of their creation / great cruelty it were to save your
selfs / and to dampne them. But o more then cruelty and madness / that can not
be expressed / if for the pleasure of a momente / you deprived your self / and
your posterity of that eternal joy / that is ordained for those that
continues in confession of Christ's name / and truth to the end / which
assuredly you do / if without resistaunce al together / you return to
Idolatry again. Note.
Alas / then the trompet has lost the sound / the sun is gone down / and
the light vanished / but and if that God shall strengthen you / boldly to
withstand all such impiety / the^ is their but a dark mystie cloud
ouerspred the sun for a moment / which shortly shall vanishe / so that the
beams of the sun / afterward shall be seue^folde more bright and amyable then
they were before. Your patience and constauncie shall be the lowdar trompet to
your posterity / god grant you may understand.
then were all the voices of the prophets that cried unto you / and therefore
for the tender mercy of God. Arm your self to stand with Christ / Fly from
that abominable Idol. The mayntaynors thereof shall not escape the vengeance
of God. Let it be known to your posterity / that you were Christians / and no
Idolatours / and so is not the trompet ceased so long as any boldly resists
Idolatry. The obseccion of the flesh. Answer.
These precepts are sharp and hard to be observed will some object. And yet
again I affirm that / compared with the plagues / which assuredly shall fall
upon the co^tempnours / they shall be found easy and light for avoiding
Idolatry / Note this Antithesis, and consider it well.
it may chance that you be contempned in the world / but obeyers of Idolatry
/ as before God they are abominable / so shall they be compelled body and
soul to burn in hell / for avoiding of Idolatry / your worldly substance
shall be spoiled / but for obeyng Idolatry / heavenly riches shall be lost for
avoiding Idolatry / you may fall in the hands of earthly tyrauntes / but
obeyers / consenters and mayntaynors of Idolatry shall not escape the hands
of the living God / for avoiding Idolatry / your chyldern shall be deprived of
father / friends / riches / and earthly rest / but by obeyeng Idolatry / they
shall be left without God without the knowledge of his word / and without the
hope of his kingdom.

Consider dear brethren / that how much more dolerous it is to be tormented
in hell / then to suffer troble in earth / to be deprived of heavenly joy /
then to be robbed of transitory riches. To fall in the hands of the living God
/ then to abide man's vain / and uncertain displeasure. So much more fearful
and dangerous it is / to obey Idolatry or disse^bling to consent too that
abomination / then auoydinge the same / to suffer what inconuenie^s may follow
thereupon by man's tyranny. O be not like to Esau / that sold and lost his
byrthright for a mease of potage. I am not prejudicial too Gods mercies / as
that such as after shall repent / shall not find grace. God forbid / for
here in am I most assuredly persuaded. That in what so ever hour a sinner
shall repent / God shall not remember one of his iniquities / but albeit / his
offenses were as red as Skarlette / they shall be made as white as snow. ze.
18.33
And albeit in multitude they passed number / yet so shall they be blotted out
/ that none of the^ shall appear to the da^nacion of the very repe^tant / for
his promises be infallible / Esai. 1.
that such as truly believe in Christ / shall never enter in to judgment / for
the blood of Christ Jesus / Ioh. 3.5
purges them from all sin / so that how far the heaven is dystant from the
earth / so far does he remove the sins from the penitent. But consider
dearly beloved brethren, 1. Ioh. 1.
that these and like promisies are made to penitent sinners / and does nothing
apertaininge to prophaine parsons / Idolatours / The confutable promises of God
are made to penitent sinners only.
nor too fearful shrinkers from the truth / for fear of worldly troble. And
if any allege / God may call them to repentance / how wicked that any man be.
I answer that I acknowledge / and does censes Gods omnipotensye / to be so
free / that he may do what pleases his wysedom / but yet is he not bound to
do / all that our fantesie requires. Note.
And likewise I know that God is so loving and so kind / to such as fears
him / that he will perform their wills and pleasures / although kings and
princes had sworn to the contrary. But herein stands the doubt whether that
such as for pleasure of men / or for auoydinge tempo all punishment / defyleth
them selfs with Idolatry. Fears God / and whether they with all their lives
/ denies Christ by consentinge to Idolatry / shall at the last hour / be
called to repentance. No such promese have we within the scriptures of god
but rather the expressed contrary. And therefore God is not to be tempted / but
is too be hard / feared and obeyed.

When thus earnestly he calls and threatens not without cause. Apoc. 18.
Pass from the midst of her / o my people (says the Lord) that you be not
partakers of her plagues / and that is meant of that abominable whore / and of
her abomination. 3. Reg 18 1. Cor. 10 Math. 10
How long will you halte on both parts, you may not both be partakers of
the cup of the Lord / and of the cup of the deuel. He that denies me before
men / I will deny him before my father / he that refuses not him self / and
takes up his cross and follow me / is not worthy of me. No man putting his
hand to the plough / and lokinge backwarde is worthy of the kingdom of God.
And Paul to the Hebrews only means of this sin / where he says: heb.
6.10
who willinglye synneth after the knowledge of the truth / cannot be renewed
to repentance. O dear brethren / remember the dignity of your vocation / you
have followed Christ / you have proclaimed war against Idolatry / you have
laid hand upon the truth / and has communicate at the Lords table. Will you
now suddenly slide back? will ye refuse Christ and his truth? and make paccion
with the dyuell and with his deceauable doctrine? Will ye tread the precious
blood of his testament under your fete / and set up an Idol before the people
/ which things assuredly you do / as often as ever you present your bodies
amongst Idolatours / before that blasphemous Idol. God the father of all
mercies for Christ his sons sake preserve you from that sore temptation /
whose dolours and dangers / very sorrow will not suffer me to express. Alas
brethren / it is to be feared / that if you fall once a sleep / you lie to long
before you be wakened. Note.
Yet some shall object / Peter the Denyar obtained mercy. A comparion between
Peter and our dissembling gospelers.
To whom I answer particular examples / makes no common law / neither yet is
there any resemblance or lykelyhodde between the fall of Peter / and our daily
Idolatry. Peter upon a sodayn / without any former purpose / thus denied
Christ within the space of a hour or two. We upon determined purpose / and
advised mind daily deny Christ. Peter had Christ's assurance and promise /
that after his denial he should be converted. We have Christ's threatninges /
that if we deny we shall be denied. Peter in the bishops hall / and amongst
wicked men of war / committed his offense for fear of life. We in our city
and household / only for the loose of the wicked Mammon / does no less.
Peter at the warninge of the Cock / and at Christ's look / left that company
/ that provoked his sin. We after Christ's admonitions yea / after gentle
exhortations / and fearful threatninges / will continue in the midst of
Idolatours / and for their pleasures will crocke and knele / as the deuel
commands / what lykelyhode is here / let every man judge. But much I wonder
/ that men that can espy so narow thiftes / as to hyde them selfs from the
presens of God / behind a busshe with Adam their father / can not also espy
that Judas was an Apostle in presens of men / of no les authority then Peter
was / that Cayn was the first borne in the world. 1. Reg. 10
That Saul was the first anointed king by Gods commandment / and by his
prophet / and that Achitophel was a man of most singular wysedom / and yet
none of these found place of repentance. 2. Reg. 16
Have we any other assuraunces and particular warrantes within the scriptures
of God / then they had that all our life we may be in leage with the deuell /
Note.
and then at our pleasure that we may lay hand upon Christ / and clothe
us with his justice: Joel. 2. Romans 10. 2. timo. 2
Be not deceived brethren, for albeit most / true it is / that who so ever
incalleth the name of the Lord / shall be saved / Yet like true it is / that
whosoever incalleth the name of the Lord / shall avoid and esschewe all
iniquity / and that whosoever contine with in open iniquity / the same man
incalleth not the name of the Lord / neither has God any respect to his
prayer / Ioh. 9. Ioh. 38. The mass the deuels sacrament and seal.
and greater iniquity was never from the beginning of the world / then is
contained in that abominable Idol / for it is the seal off that leage /
which the deuell has made with the pestilent sons of Antechriste / and is
the very chief cause / why the blood of the saints of God / has been shed
nere the space of a thousand year / for so long almost has it been in
devising / and in deckinge with that whorishe garment / The long parching of
the popisshe ^^asse.
wherein it now triumphs / against Christ / against the only one sacrifice
of his death / and merits of his passion / which whole abomination you
confirm / and shows your selfs / consentinge to the murder of those that
has suffered for speaking against it / as often as ever you decore that Idol
with your presens. Note.
And therefore avoid it / as that ye will be partakers with Christ / with whom
ye have sworn to dye and to live in baptism and in his holy supper. Shame it
were to break promys unto man / but is it not more shame too break it unto
God? foolishnes it were to leave that king / whose victory you did se
present / and too take part with him / whom understood and perceived to be
so vanqueshed and overthrown / that he neither might withstand / neither yet
abide the coming of his adversary. Ioh. 12.16
O brethren / is not the deuel the prince of this world / vanquished and cast
out? has not Christ made conqueste off him? has he not carried our self up
to glory in dispite of satan's malice. Acto. 1.
Shall not our champion return? you understand that he shall and that with
expedition / when satan and his adherentes Idolatours / Apo. 20.
worshippers of that blasphemous beast / fylthie persons / and fearful
shrinkers from the truth of God shall be cast in the lake burninge fire and
brimstone / which never shall be quenched. Folishe fear.
But in the mean time / you fear corporal death / if nature admitted any man
too live ever / then had your fear some apare^ce of reason / but if corporal
death be common to all / why will you leoperde to lose the life everlasting?
to decline and escape / that which neither rich / neither poor / neither
wife / neither foolish / proud of stomach / nor feable of coraige / and
finally no earthly creature / by no craft nor mean of man did ever escape / if
any has escaped the horrible fear of death / it was such as boldly did
withstand men's iniquity in the earth.

The flesh can do nothing but grudge.
But it grudgeth the flesh (say you) for fear of the torment / let it do
the own nature and office / for so must it do till it be burdened with
Christ's cross / and then no doubt / shall God send such comfort / as now
we look not for. Let us not torn back from Christ / albeit the flesh
complain / and fears the torment. Wonder it is that the way too life is so
fearful unto us, considering that so great a number of our brethren / has
passed before us in at the same gatte / that we so much alhorre. Has not the
most part of the saints of God entered in to their rest / by tormente and
trobles of whom witnesses Paul / some were racked / Others before us has
past to life by torment.
some heawin a sonder / some slain with swerdes / some walked up and down in
sheep skins / in neade, tribulation and vexation, Heb. 11.
in mountains / dens / and in caves off the earth / and in all those
extremities / what complaints hear we of their mouths / except it be that
they lament the blindness of the world / and the perdition of their persecutors.
Did God comfort them / and shall he despise us if in obediens to him / we
follow their footsteppes / he shall not do it / for he has promised the
contrary. And therefore dearly beloved in the Lord, As that you purpose too
avoid the vengeance of God / that suddenly shall strike all obstinate
Idolatours. As that you would hane the leage between God and you to stand sure
/ and as that you will declare your selfs to have true faith / without which
no man ever shall enter in life. And finally / as that you will leave the true
knowledge of God / in possession to your children. Avoid Idolatry / and all
participation thereof / for it is so odious before Gods presens / that not
only does he punish the inuentours / and first offenders / but oftentimes
their posterity are stryken with blindenes and dasynes of mind. Deuteronomy. 28.
The battaylle shall apeare strong / which you are to suffer / but the Lord
him self shall be your comfort / he shall come in your defense with his
mighty power / Zacha. 2^ Psalm 46.57.61.
he shall give you vittorie / when none is hoped for / he shall turn your
teres to everlasting Joy / he shall confound your enemies with the breath of
his mouth / Apoc. 7.22. Psalm. 55.
he shall set you se their destruction that now are most proud.

The God of all comfort and consolation for Christ Jesus / his sons sake /
grant that this simple and plain admonition / yea / rather the warning of the
holy ghost may be received / and accepted of you with no les fear and
obedience then I have written it unto you with unfeigned love / and sorrowful
heart / and then I doubt not / but we shall be comforted / when all such as
now motesteth us / shall trymble and shake by the coming of our Lord Jesus /
whose omnipotent sprete perserue and keep you undefiled body and soul to the
end. Amen.

A godly prayer.
AH Lord / most strong and mighty God / which destroyest the cou^sayles of
the ungodly / and ryddest away the tyrauntes of this world / out of the earth
at thy pleasure / so that no counsel or force ca^ tesiste thine eternal
counsel and everlasting determination / we thine poore^ creatures and humble
servants / do most instantly desire the for the love that thou have to thine
well-beloved / and only begotten soune our Lord and savior Jesus Christ /
that thou will look upon thine cause / for it is time o Lord / and bring to
naught all those things that are or shall be appointed / determined and fully
agreed against the and thy holy word / let not the enemies of thy truth to
miserablye oppress thy word and thy servants / which seek thy glory /
tender the advancement of thy pure religion / and above all things wish in
their hearts that thy holy name may only be glorefied among all nations. Give
unto thy servants the mouth of thy truth and wysedom / which no man may
resist: And although we have most justly deserved this plague and famyn of
thine word / yet upon our true repentance / grant we beseke the / we may be
thereof released / and here we promise before thy deuyne majesty / better to
use thy gifts then we have done / and more strayghtlye to order our lives /
according to thy holy will and pleasure / and we will sing perpetual
praises too thy most blessed name / worlds without end / through Jesus
Christ our Lord. Amen

FINIS. GOD IS MY HELPER.

A confession and declaration of prayers added thereunto / by Ihon Knox /
minister of christ's most sacred Euangely / upon the death of that most
verteous and most famous king Edward the VI. king of England / France and
Ireland / in which confession / the said Ihon does accuse no less his own
offenses / then the offenses of others / to be the cause of the away taking /
of that most godly prince / now raininge with Christ while we abide plagues
for our vntha^fulnesse.

Imprinted in Rome, before the Castle of s. Aungel / at the sign of saint
Peter. In the month of July / in the year of our Lord. 1554. (?)

A declaration of prayer / made by Ihon Knox.
Unto the small and dispersed flock of Jesus Christ / How necessary is the
right invocation of Gods name / otherwise called perfect prayer / becomes no
christian to misknow. Prayer spri^geth out off true faith. Romans 10.
Seeing it is the very brau^ch / which sprigeth forth of true faith. Whereof / if
man be distitute / notwithstanding he be induid with whatsoever other virtues /
yet in the presens of God is he reputid for no Christian / Men negligent i^
prayer are not perfect in faith.
therefore a manifest sign understand nothing of perfyt faith / for if the fire
may be without heat / or the burning lamp without light / then true faith
may be without fervent prayer. But because in times passed was / and yet alas
/ within small multitude is / that recoued to be prayer / which in the sight
of God was and is nothing less. I intend shortly too touch the circonstaunce
of prayer.

What prayer is.
wHo will pray / must know and understand that prayer is an erust and
familiar talking with God / to whom we declare our miseries / whose supporte
and help / we implore and desire in our adversities / and whom we laud and
praise for our benefytes received. What prayer contains.
So that prayer contains the exposition of our dolours / the desire of Gods
defense / and louinge of his magnifice^t name / as the Psalms of David clearly
teaches.

What is to be observed in prayer.
THat this be most reuere^tly done should provoke us the consideracion / in
whose presens we stand / to whom we speak / and what we desire / standinge in
the presence of the omnipotent creator of heaven and earth / and of all the
contents thereof / to whom assist and serve a thousand thousand of angels /
Daniel. 3 Job. 16.
giving obedience to his eternal majesty / and speking unto him / who knows
the secrets off our hearts / dissimulation and lies are always odious / and
hated. And asking that thing / which without we receive of all other creators
we are most miserable / diligently should we atte^de that such things as may
offend his godly presence to the uttermost of our power be removed. And first
that worldly care^s / and fleshly cogitacions / such as draw us from
contemplacion of God be expellid from them / that it may freely without
interrupcion call upon God. Note.
But how diffysed and hard is this one thing in prayer to perform / knows
no man better / then such as in their prayers / not content to remain within
the bands of their own vanity / but as it were ravished / do inte^de to a
pure word of God / asking not such things as the blind and folish reason of
man desires / but what may be plesaunt and acceptable in Gods presens. Petre. 5
Our adversary satan / at all times co^passing us about / is never more busy
then when we adresse and be^de us to prayer / for o / how secretly and subtly
crepeth he in our breasts / and calling us back from God / causes us to
forget what we have to do.

Let ever man judge his own heart.
SO that frequently / when we with all reuerince should speak to God / we
find our hearts talki^g with the vanites of the world or with the folish
imaginacions of our own consent / so that without the sprete of God.

How the sprete makes intercession for us. Roma. 8.

SVportinge our infirmities / mightily making intercession for us / with
incessable gro^nes / which can not be expressed with tou^ge / hope is there
none / that any thing we can desire / according to Gods will. I mean not that
the holy ghost mournes or prays / but that he sterith up our minds / giving
unto us a desire or boldness for to pray / and causes us to mourn when we are
extracted and plucked there from / which things to conceive / no strength of
man suffiseth / neither is able of it self. Who prays not.
Hereof it is plain / that such as understand not what they pray / or
expou^des not / or declare not the desire of their hearts / clearly in Gods
presens. And in time of prayer / to their possibilite with out their expel
vain cogitacions from their minds profyt / nothing in prayer.

Why we should pray / and also understand what we do pray.
although we expound not or declare our necessites unto him. Such me^ verily
declares them selfs / never to have understanding / what profit prayer meant /
nor too what end Jesus Christ commands us to pray. Which is first that our
hearts may be enflamed with continual fear / honor and love of God / to whom
we run for supporte and help / when soever danger or necessity requires /
that we so lerninge to notefye our desiers in his presence / may teach us
what is earnestly to be axed / and what not. Seco^darely that we knowing our
peticions to be granted by God / to him alone we must refer and give land
and praise. And that we ever having his infinite goodness / fixid in our minds
/ may constantly abide to receive that / which with fervent prayers we desire /
Vvhif God deffereth to grant our prayer
for sometime God deffereth or prolo^geth to grant our peticions / for the
excercision and trial of our faith / and not that he slepeth / or is absente
from us at any time / but that with more gladness we might receive that /
which with long expectacion we have abyden / that thereby we assured of his
eternal providence / (so far as the infirmetie of our corruptie and most
weked nature will permit) doubt not / but his merciful hand shall releaf us
in most urgent necessite and extreme tribulacio^. Therefore such men as
teaches us / that necessarely it is not required that we understand not what
we pray / because God knows what we need would also teach us / that neither we
honor God nor yet refer / or give unto hi^ thanks for benefits received /
for how shall we honor and praise hi^ / whose goodness and liberalite we know
not / how shall we know / oneles we receive / and sometime have experiens. And
how shall we know that we have received / unless we know verily what we have
asked.

The second thing to be observed in perfect prayer is / that standing in the
presens of God / we be found such as beryes to his holy law reverence / Prou.
18.
earnestly repe^ting our iniquite passed and inte^ding to lead a new life /
for otherwise in vain are all our prayers / as it is written / who withdrawes
his ear / that he will not hear the law of God / his oration or prayer shall be
abominable. And also ye shall multeply your prayers / and I shall not hear /
because your hands are full of blood / that is off all cruelty and
mischeuous works. And the sprete of God appears by the mouth of the blind
/ Ioh. 9.
whom Jesus Christ does illuminate by these words / we know that God hears
no sinners / that is such as glories / and do continue in iniquites.

When sinners are not hard of God
SO that of necessite true repe^tau^ce most needs be had / and pass before
perfitte prayer / or sincere inuocacio^ of gods name. And unto these two
preside^ces must be annexed the thride which is the direction of our selfs in
gods presence. Utterly refusing and casti^g of own justice with all
cogitacio^s and opinion thereof / that nothing proceeding of our selfs / that
we should be hard / for all such as auaunce / boast or depend any thing upon
their own justice / from the presence of his mercy / repellith and holds
with the high proud pharesey. And therefore the most holy men / we find in
prayers most dejected and humble. Psalm. 79.
David says: o Lord our savior help us / for the glory of thy own name
deliver us / be merciful unto our sins for thy own name. Remember not our
old iniquities / but have thou o Lord / and let thy mercy prevent us. Jeremy
says: if our iniquities bear testimoni against us / do thou according to
thy own name. And behold I say / thou art crabbid / O Lord / because we have
sinned / and are replenished with all wickedness. Esaias. 64
And our justice is like a filthy clothe. etc. But now O Lord / thou art our
father / we are claye / thou art the work man / and we the workema^ship of
thy hands. Daniel. 9
Be not crabid O Lord / remember not our iniquities for ever. And Daniel
greatly co^me^did of God / makes in his prayer most humble confession in these
words / we be sinners / and have offeded / we have done ungodly / and fallen
from thy commandment / but not in our own righteousness make we our prayers
before the / but thy most rych and great mercy bring we forth for us. O Lord
hear / Lord be merciful / and spare us Lord / atte^d / help and cease not my
God / eue^ for thy names sake / do it for thy people and thy city called after
thy name. Behold / that in these prayers is no me^cio^ of their own justice /
their own satisfaction / or their own merits / but most humble confession /
procedinge from a sorrowful and penitent heart / having nothing whereupon it
might depend / but the mercy of God alone / who had promised to be their God
that is their help / comfort / defendor / and deliverer (as he has also don to
us by Jesus Crist) in time of tribulacion. Note.
And therefore / they / dispayrid not / but after knowledge of there Sins /
callid for mercy and obtained the same / wherefore it is plain / that such men
as in their prayrs / have respect to any virtue / proceeding of them selffe /
thinkinge thereby their prayrs to be accepted / never prayed aright.

What fasting almoses deeds are without pray.
ANd albeit to fervent prayer be Ioynyd / fasting / waking and almos deed /
yet are none of these the cause / that God does except our prayrs but they are
spurs which suffer us not to vary / but make us more able to continue in
prayr / Psalm. 38.86.
which the mercy of God does accept. But here may it be obiectid / David
praythe / keep mi life o Lord for I am holy / o Lord here my justice and
suffer me not to be confoundid / 4. reg. 20
and Ezechius remember Lord I beseech the / that I have walked righteously
before the / and that I have wrought that which is good in thy sight. These
words are not spoken of me^ glorious / neither yet trusting in there own
works. Note we
But here in they testefy them selfs to be the sons of God by regeneracio^ /
to whom he promisid always to be merciful / and at al tims to hear their
prayers.

The cause of there boldness was Jesus Crist.
ANd so their words spring a wontyd / constante and fervent faith / surely
beleuinge that as God of his infinity mercy / had callid them to his knowledge
/ not sufferinge them to walk after their own natural wickedness / but partly
had through them to confirm them to his holy law / and that for the promised
seeds sake / so might he not leave them destitute or comfort / consolacion and
defense / in so great and extreme necessite. And so their justice a leage they
not to glory thereof / or to put trust therein / but to confyrme and strengthen
them selfs in Gods promyses / and this consolation I would wyshe to al
Christians in their prayers / a testimony of good conscience to assure them of
Gods promises / but to obtain what they ask must depend upon his mercy / al
opinion and through of our own justice laid aside. And more over David in the
words above compares him self with King Saul / and with the rest of his
enemies / who wrongfully did persecute him / desyiringe of God that they
prevail not against him (as who say) iniustlye do they persecute me and
therefore according to my innocensi defend me / for otherwise he confessith him
self most grievously to have offendid God / as in the precident places he
clearly testifies.

Ipocrisie is not alowid with god.
THirdly in prayer is to observed / that what we ask of God / that we most
ernistly desire / the same knowleginge us to be indigent void thereof / and
that God allone may grant the peticion of our hearts. mark well
For nothing is more odious before God then Ipocrisie and dissimulacio^ (that
is) when man does ask of God a thing / whereof he has no neade / or that he
believes to attain / by others then by God allone. As if a man ask of God
remission of his sins / thinkinge nevertheless to obtain the same by his
own works / papistical pardons / merytes of masses / or whatsoever other
means / does mock God / and in such causes does a great number offend
principally / the might and rich of the earth / who for a common confuetude
and custom / will pray this part of Gods prayer give us this day our daily
bread / Daily bread.
that is a moderate and reasonable sustentacion / and yet their own hearts will
testefy that they neade not so to pray / saying they abound in all wordly
solace and felicity. I mean not that rich men should not pray this part of
prayer / but I would they understood / what they ougt to pray in it (whereof we
intend after to speak) and that they asked nothing whereof they felt not them
selfs marvelous ind^gent and nedeful, / for onelesse we call in verite / he will
not grant / and without we speak with our hole heart / we shall not find
him. The fourth rule / necessary to be followed in prayer / is a sure hope to
obtayn what we ask for nothing more offends God / then when we as^e doubtyng
wether he will grant our peticions / for in so doing we doubt if G^d be true
/ if he be mighty and good. Iaco. 1.
Such faith James obtain nothing of God / and therefore Ihesus Christ
commands that we fyrmly believe to obtain whatsoever we ask / for all
things is possible unto him that believes / and therefore in our prayrs always
is to be expellid desperacion. Note well
I mean not that any man in extreamite of troble / ca^ be without a present
dolor / and without a greater fear of troble to follow.

Sporris stire us to prayer
Troble and fear are the very spures to pray for when man compassid about with
vehement calamyte / and vexid with continual solicitude / having by healpe of
man / no hope of deliverance with sore oppressed an punished heart / ferynge
also greater punishment to follow from the deep pyt of trybulacion / does call
to God / for comfort and supporte.

God deliuerith his chosen from their enymyes.
THat prayer ascendith into gods presence and retourneth not in vain / as
David in the vehement persecucion of Saul / Psalm. 7.
hunted and chased from every hole / fearing that one day or other he should
fall in to the hands of his persecutors / after that he had complained / that
no place of rest was left for him vehemently / prayde saying / o Lord which
art my God / in whom I have trusted / save me from all that persecute me / and
deliver me / let not th^s man (meninge King Saul) devour my life as the lio^
does his pray / seeing their is no man to deliver me / in the myddest of these
a^guishes / the goodness of God sustainid him / that the present tribulacion was
tolerable / and the infallible promysis of God / so assured him of
deliverance / that fear was partly nitegate and gone / as plainly apereth to
such as diligently mark the prosses of his prayer / for after long
meniss^nge and threateninge made to his enemy / he concludith with these
words. The dollor which he ente^dith unto me / shall fall upon his own head /
and the violence wherewith he would have oppressed me / shall cast down his own
head / and I shall magnify the Lord / according to his justice / and shall
praise the name of the most higest. A comfort to the writer / being in
aduersite.


This is not written for David only / but for all such as shall suffer
tribulacion / to the end of the world / for I the writer hereof (let this be
said to the land and praise of God alon) in anguishe of mind / and vehement
tribulacio^ and affliction called unto the Lord / when not only the ungodly /
but even my faytheful brother / yea and my own self / that is / al natural
understanding. Judge my cause to be irremydiceble and yet in my greatest
calamyte. And when my pains where most cruel / would his eternal wisdom / that
my hand should write (far contrary to the iudgeme^te of carnal reason) which
his mercy has prouyd true / and therefore dare I be in the veryte of Gods
word to permit that not withstandinge / the vehemence of troble / the long
continuance thereof / the desperacion of al men / the fearfulnes dolor / and
anguishe of our own hearts / yet if we call constantly to God / that by
expectacion of al men he shall deliver.

Notewel Where constant prayer is, this granted the peticion. Psalm. 41. Psalm.
119.
Let no man think him self unworthy to call and pray unto God / because he has
grievously offendid God in times past / but let him bring to God a sorrowful and
repenting heart / saying with David / heal my soul o Lord / for I have
offendid against the / before I fell in mysery I transgressed / but now let me
observe thy commandments.

To mitegate or ease the sorrows of our wou^did conscience / two playsters has
our most prudent physician prouyd to give us / in corrage for to pray /
notwithstanding the knowledge of offenses committed / that is a precepte and a
promise / the precept or commandment to pray is universal frequently
inculeate and repetyd in Gods scripturs. Mat. 7. Psalm. 49. Matt. 26. 1. Tim.
2. 1. Tessa. 5
Ask and it shall be given unto you. Call upon me in the day of thy tribulacion
/ watch and pray that ye fall not into temptacion. I command that ever ye
make deprecacions / pray incessable and give thanks in all thing / which
commandment / who contemns or dispiseth / does e^^ally sin with him that
does steal.

For as this commandment / thou shall not steal / is a precept negatyue / so
thou shall pray is commandment affirmatyne / and God requires equal
obedience of / and to al his commandments (yet more boldly will I say) when
necessite co^straynth desires / Notewel
not supporte and help at God / does provoke his wrath no less then such as
make falsse Gods / do or openly deny God.

Who prayth not in tribulacio^ denies God.
FOr like as it is to know no physician or medicine / and in knowinge them
refuse to use and receive the same / so not to call upon God in thy tribulacion
is / like as thou not God / or else utterly deny him.

Not to pray is sin most odious.
O Why cease we to call instantly to his mercy / having his commandment so
to do above al our iniquities / we work manifest contemtion and dispisinge /
when by wekid negligens / we delay to call for his supporte / we does call to God
obeyth his will / Iere. 7.
and fyndeth therein no small consolacion / knowing no sacryfice / so
acceptable to his majesty / as humble obedience is.

To his commandment he adds his most undoubted promise in many places /
Mat. 7.
ask and ye shall have / seek and ye shall find / Ierem. 27
and by the Prophet Jeremy ye shall call upon me / and I shall hear you / ye shall
seek and shall find me / and by Esaye / may the father forget his natural son
/ or the mother the child of her womb / and although they do / yet shall I not
forget such as call upon me. And hereto corresponde^t and agree the words of
Jesus Christ / saying / if ye being wekid / Luck. 1.
can give good gifts to your sons / much more my celestial father shall give
the holy ghost too them that ask of him. And that we should not think God to
be absent or not hear us accurreth. Moses saying / Deuteronomy. 4
there is no nacio^ that have their gods so adherent or nyghe unto them as our
God is present / at al our prayers. And the psalmist / nyghe is the lord to al
/ which call upon him in veryte / and Jesus Crist says / wheresoever are two or
three gathered together in my name / there am I in the mids of them.

Reddines of God to hear sinners.
THat we shall not think that God will not hear us / Esaias sayng before they cry
I shall hear / and while they yet speak / I shall answer / and also if at even
/ come sorrow or calamiti / before the morninge spring I shall redress and
turn gladness / and his most comfortable word / spoken not to carnal Israel
only / but to al men sore oppressed / abidinge Gods deliverance. From a moment
and a lyttel season have I turned my face from the / but in everlasting
mercy shall I comfort the.

The hope to obteyn our peticions / should depend upon the promyses of God.
O Stony are the hearts / whom so manyfolde most sweet and sure promis is does
not molyfye / whereupon should depend the hope to obtain our peticions / the
dingnite or unworthiness of our selfs is not to be regarded / for albeit to the
chosen / which are departed in holiness and purite of life / we be inferiors /
yet in that part we are equal in that we have / the same Commandment to pray
/ and the same promise to be hard / for he estimeth not the prayer / neither
grauntith the peticion / for any dingnite of the person that prayth / but for
his own promise sake. And therefore says David. 1. King. 7
Thou have promised unto thy servant / o Lord that thou will build an house
for him / and therefore thy servant has found convenient matter to pray in
thy presence. Now so o Lord God / thou art God / and thy wonders are true /
thou haste spoken these good things unto thy servant / begin therefore to do
/ according to thy promise / multiply o Lord the household of thy servant.
Gene. 23.
Behold / David altogether dependith upon Gods promise / as also did Iacobe /
who after he had confessed him self unworthy of all the benefits received /
yet dare he boldly ask greater benefytes in times subsequent / and that
because God had promised. In the like manner let us be encouraged / too ask
whatsoever the goodness of God has freely promised / what we should ask
pri^cipally we after shall hear.

Obseruacion in godly prayer.
THe fifth obseruacio^ / which godly prayer requires / is the perfyt knowledge
off the advocate interceffour and mediator for seeing no man is of him self
worthy to compare / or apeare in Gods presence by reason / that in all men
continually rests sin.

Of necessyte we must have a mediator.
Which by the self does offend the majesty of God / reasinge also / debate
/ strife / hatered / and division betwixt his inviolable justice and us.
Whereunto / oneles satisfaction be made by any other then by our selfs / so
littel hope rests that any thing from him. We can attain / that no suerty
may we have with him at all.

To examine us of his horrible confusion / knowinge that our minds most
fragile / here by continually should have been deiectid / our merciful father
has given unto us his only begotton son Jesus Christ to be advocate and
forespeaker for us / 1. Ioh. 2. Hebre. 8.
that we led by such a guide with whose justice (if in him we believe) we are
so clede that we may with boldness co^payr and apeare before the trone of gods
mercy / doubtyng nothing / but whatsoever we ask by our mediator / Heb. 4.
the same we shall obtayn in mose opportunite.

Here is most diligently to be eschewed / that without our mediator for
speaker / and peace maker / Note diligently, by Whom we must pray.
we enter into prayer / so the benifite of such as pray without Jesus Crist /
are not only vayn / but also they are odious / and abhomenable before God /
which thing to us in the leuitical priesthode most evident was prefigurate and
declarid / for as within santum santoru^ entered no man / ^. par. 26.
but the hige priest allone / and as al sacrifices offered by any other then by
priests only / provoked the wraught of God upon the sacrifice maker / so who
does intend to enter into gods presence / or to make prayrs without Jesus
Crist shall find nothing / but fearful judgment and horrible da^nacion. Wherefore
it is plain that Turks and Jews not withstanding that they do appearau^tly /
Turks Jews.
and most verfently pray unto God / who created heaven and earth / who guides
and rules the same / who defends the good / and punishes the evil / yet
never are their prayers pleasant unto God / neither honor they his majesty in
any thing / because they acknowledge not Ihesus Christ.

When we be not heard.
FOr who honoreth not the son / honorith not the father / for as the law is
a statute / that we shall call unto God / and as the promise is made that he
shall hear us / so are we commanded only to call by Jesus Christ / 2. Cor. 1^
by whom alone our peticions we obtain / for in him allone are all the
promises of God confirmed and co^pleant / whereof without all contreuerses / it
is plain that such as have caullid or calls presentlye unto God / by any
other mean / the^ by Jesus Crist allone / does nothing regard Gods will / but
obstinatly preuaricat / and do against his commandments / and therefore
neither obtai^ they their peticio^ / nor yet have entres in his mercy. For no
man comes to the father (sayith Jesus Christ / but by me he is the right way
/ who declineth from him errith and goyth wrong / he is our leder / whom
without we follow / we shall walk in darkness / and he alone is our captain /
without whom neither praise nor victory we shall obtain against such as depend
upon the intercession of saints / no otherwise will I contend / but shortly
touch the propertis of a perfyt mediator.

Intercession to saints.
FIrst are the words most sure of Paul / a mediatoure is not the mediator of
one / that is / wheresoever is required a mediator / there are also two parties
/ to wit one party offendant and the other party / which is offendid which
partise by themself may in no wise be reconsiled.

Secondly the mediator / Mediator.
which takes upon him the reco^siling of these two parties / must be such
one as have trust and favor of both parties in some things / And differ
from both / and must be clean and innocent / also of the crime / committed
against the party offended / let this be more plain by this subsequent
declaration.

Angels may not be mediators.
THe eternal God stands upon the one part / and all natural men /
desce^ding of Adam upon the other / the infinite justice of God is so offended
with the tra^sgession of all men / that in no wise can amyte be made / except
such one be found as fully may make satisfaccion / for man's offenses /
among the sons of men none was found able. For all they were found
criminal in the fault of one / and God infinite in justice must abhor the
society and sacrifice of sinners. And unto aungelles / what prevailed the
preuarication of man / who albeit / they would have interponed them selfs
mediators / had not the justice infinite / who shall here be found peace maker.
The infinite goodness and mercy of God / might not suffer the perpetual loss
and repudiacio^ of his creature / and therefore his eternal wisdom / provide
such an medyator having wherewith to satisfy. The justice of God differs also
from the godhead / his only son / cledde in the nature of manhead / who
interponed him self mediator / not as man only.

Jesus Christ / God and man is mediator.
FOr the pure humanity of Christ of it self / might neither make
intercess^o^ nor satisfaccio^ for us / but God and man in that that he is God /
he might complete the will of the father / and in that / that he is man pure
and clean / without spot or sin he might offer sacrifice / for purgacion of
our sins and satisfaction of Gods justice / without saints. Have these two
godhead equale with the father / and humanite without sin / the office of
mediators they may not usurp /

Who makes other mediators then Jesus Christ / takes over from him.
DO not such men ientelly entreat Jesus Christ / detracting from him such
portion of his honor / otherwise speaks the scriptures of God / testefying
him to be made man / and to have proved our infirmites to have suffered death
willingly / to have overcome the same / and all to this end / that he might be
our perpetual high sovereign and pryse / Heb. 6.7.9.10.
in whose place or dignity none other might enter / as Ihon says / if any
man sin / we have an advocate with the father / even Jesus Christ the just /
mark well this words / Ihon says / Ioh. 3. Romans 8.
we have presently a sufficient advocate / whom Paul affirms to sit / at
the right hand of God the father / and to be the only mediator between God
and man / for he alone (says Ambrose) is our mouth / by whom we speak to
God / he is our eyes / by whom we se God / and also our right hand / by
whom we offer any thing unto the father / who onelesse he make intercession /
neither we / neither any off the saints may have any societe or fellowship
with God. Libro de Isaac de anima. True members.
Note diligently.
What creator may say to God the father / let mankind be received into thy
favor / for the pain of his transgression that have I sustained in my own
body / for his cause compassed with all infirmety became I the most contempted
and dispraysed of all me^ / and yet in my mouth was found no disceyt nor gyle /
but always obedient to thy will / suffered death / that for mankind. Obedience
of Christ.
And therefore behold not the sinner / but me / who by my infinity justice /
have perfetly satisfied for his offenses / may any other Jesus Christ / except
I / in these words make intercession for sinners / if they may not then / are
they not neither mediators nor intercessors. Libro co^tra parme niz, ca
For albeit / says Augustine Christians do commend one another unto God in
their prayers / yet not make intercission / or dare usurps office of a
mediator / not Paul albeit under the head / he was a principale member / yet
because he commends him self too the prayer of faithful men Apoc. 6.
knowleginge them selfs to be delivered from great affliccion / too have been
purged by the blood of the Lam / and therefore none of them do attempt to be a
mediator / seeing they neither have being / nor justice of them self / but in
so great light of the Gospel (praise be to the omnipotent) it is not necessary
upon such matter long to remain. Note this well.
Some say / we will use but one mediator Jesus Christ to God the father / but
we must have saints / and chiefly the virgin Mary / mother of Jesus Christ
too pray for us unto him.

Against such as would have mediators too Jesus Christ.
A Lace / whosoever is so mi^ded / shows plainly them self to know nothing of
Jesus Christ righteously / is he who descended from heaven / conuersed among
sinners. Commanded all / vexid sore / Math. 11.
seek too come unto him / who hanginge upon the cross / prayde first for his
enemies / become new so intractable / that he will not hear us without a
parson to be a mean. O Lord / open the eye of such / that they may clearly
perceive thy infinete kyndnes / gentelnes and love toward mankind. Above all
precidentes is to be observed / that what we ask of God / ought too de
proffitable to our self and too others / and hurt or danger of no man.

Secondarely / we must consider whether our peticions extenditeth to
spiritual or corporal things. Spiritual things should be axid without
co^ditio^.
Spiritual things / such as are deliverance from impiete / remission of their
sins / the gift of the holy ghost / and of life everlasting should we
desire absolutely / without any condition by Jesus Christ / in whom alone all
these are promised / and in asking hereof / we should not pray thus: O father
forgive our sins / if thou will / for his will he has expressed / saying:
as I live / I desire not the death of a sinner / but rather that he convert and
live / mark well
which in mutable and sole^pned oath / who calls in doubt / makes God a liar
/ and so far as in him lies / would spoil God of his godhead / for he ca^
not be God / but he must be eternal and infallible verity / as Ihon says: 1.
Ioh. 5.
This is the testimony / which God has testified of his son / that who
believes in the son / has eternal life to the verite whereof we should
steadfastly cleue / although calamite and worldly dolor apprehendith us / 2.
Reg. 15
as David exiled from his kingdom / and deprived of all his glory / secluded
not from God / but steadfastly believed reconsiliacion by the promise made /
notwithstanding that all creators in earth had refused / objected / and
rebelled against him / happy is the man whom thou shall inspire o Lord.
Corporal things.
In asking corporal things / first let us inquire / if we be at peace with God
in our conscience by Jesus Christ / Fyrmly beleuinge our sins to be remitted
in his blood. Secondly / let us inquire our own hearts / if we know temporal
riches or substance / not to come to man by accide^te fortune or chance /
neither yet by the industre and diligence of ma^s labor / but to be the
liberal gift of God only / whereof we ought to land and praise his goodness /
wisdom / and providence alone.

What should be prayed for.
ANd if this we do truly knowledge and confess / let us boldly ask of him /
whatsoever is necessary for us / as sustentacion of the body / health thereof /
defense from misery deliverance from troble / tranquilite and peace to our
common wealths / prosperous success in our vocacio^s / labors and affairs /
and whatsoever which God will / we ask all of him too certify us / that all
thing stand in his regiment and dispocition. And also by asking and receyuinge
this corporal commodites / we may taste of his sweatnes / and be inflamed with
his love / that thereby our faith of reconciliation and remission of our sins
may be exercised and take increace.

But in asayng such temporal things / we must observe. Note we Why Go^
differreth or prolongeth to grant us our peticion.
First / that if God differrith or prolonge to grant our peticions / even so
long that he does apparently reiecte us / yet let us not seace to call /
prescribing to him / neither time nor manner of deliverance / as it is written /
if he prolonge time abide patiently upon him / and also let not the faithful be
to hasty. For God sometime differreth / and will not hastily grant to the
probacion of our eontinuau^ce / as the words of Iseus Christ testefie / and
also that we may receive with greater gladness / which with hardent desire we
long have looked for / as Anna / Sara and Elizabeth / after great ingnontye of
their barranenes and sterilite / received fruit of their bosumes with joy.

Secondarely / because we know the church at all times to be under the cross
/ in asking temporal commodites / and specially deliverance from troble let
us offer unto God obedience / 2. Re. 15.
if it shall please his goodness we longer be exercised / that we may patiently
abide it / as David desired to be restored to his kingdom / what time he was
exiled by his own son offers unto God obedience / saying: if I have found
favor in the presence of the Lord / he shall bring me home again / and if
he shall say / thou please my not longer too bear auctorite / I am obedient
/ let him do what seemed good unto him. Dani. 3.
And the three children unto Nabuchodonosor say: we know that our God / whom
we worship / may deliver us / but if it shall not please him so to do / let it
be known to the o king / that thy Gods we will not worship.

Better it is to obey God then man.
HEre give they a true confession of their perfect faith / knowing nothing to
be impossible to the omnipote^cy of God / affirming also themself to stand in
his mercy for otherwise the nature of man could not willingly give it self to
so horrible a torment / but offer they unto God most humble obedience to be
delivered at his pleasure and godly will. As we should do in all afflictions /
for we know not what too ask / or desire as we ought / that is the frail
flesh / oppresses with fear and pain / desires deliverance ever abhorring
and drawing back from obedience given. (O Christen brother / I write by
experience) but the sprite of God calls back the mind to obedience / that
albeit / it does desire and abide for deliverance / yea / would it not repyng
the goodwil of God incessantly asks that it may abide with patience. How
hard is the battle / no man knows but he / which in him self has suffered
trial / Note well
it is to be noted that God sometime does grant the peticion of the sprete /
wyle he yet defferreth the desired of the flesh.

The peticion of the sprete. Gene. 9

AS who doubts / but God did mitigate the heaviness of Joseph / although he
sent not hasty deliverance in his long imprisoneme^t / and that as he gave
him favor / in the sight of his iaylour / so inwardly also gave he unto him
consolation in sprite. And more over / God sometime grau^teth the peticio^ of
the sprite / where all utterly he repelleth the desire of the flesh / for the
peticion always of the sprete is / that we may obtayn to felicite whereunto we
needs must enter by tribulacio^ / and the final death / both which does ever
the nature of man abhor / and therefore the flesh under the cross / and at
the sight of death / call^^h and trusts for hasty deliverance / but God who
alone knows what is expedient for us.

Flesh strives against the sprete.
Percecucio^ of the fay^^ful.
Sometime prolongeth the deliuerau^ce of his chosen / and sometime permits
them to drink / before the maturite of age / the bitter cup of corporal
death / that thereby they may receive medicine and care from all infirmite / but
who doubtith / but Ihon the Baptiser / desired to have seen more days of Jesus
Christ / and to have been longer with him in conversation. (...). 7.
Or that Steven would not have labored more days in preaching Christ's gospel
/ whom nevertheless / both he suffered hastily to vnderlye the statute and
general sentence. And albeit / we se therefore no apparent / help to our
self / nor yet to others afflicted / let us not cease to call / thinkinge our
prayers to be in vain / whatsoever become of our bodies. Comfort to the
afflictyd
God shall give unspeakable comfort too the sprete / and shall turn all to
our commodite / by our own expectacion. The cause I am so long and tedious in
this matter is / I know how hard the battaill is betwixt the flesh and the
sprete.

Impedimentes co^mith of the weakness off the flesh.
SPrete under the heavy croce^ of affliccion / where no worldely defense / but
presence death does appear / I know the grudging and murmoringe complayntes of
the flesh / I know the anger wrath and indignacion / which it conceiueth
against God / calling all his promises into doubt / and being ready every
hour / utterly to fall from him. Against which all rests in faith /
provoking us to call instantly and to pray for assistaunce of Gods sprete.
Whereunto / if we continue our most desperate calamites / shall he turn to
gladness and joy and prosperous fine.

To the o Lord alone be praise / for with experience I write this and speak:
it is not too be permitted / where / for whom / and at what time we ought to
pray.
Private prayer / Private prayer. Matt. 6.
such as men secretly offer unto God by them self / require no special place
/ although that Jesus Christ commands / when we pray to enter in our
chaumber / and to close the door after us / and so to pray secretly unto our
father / To enter in to thy chamber to pray
whereby he would we should choose to our prayers such place as might offer
least occasion too call us back from prayer / and also that we should expel
forth of our minds in time of our prayer all vain cogitacions / for
otherwise Jesus Christ him self does observe no special place of prayers / for
we find him sometime pray in mount Oliuete / sometime in the deserte /
sometime in the temple. Actu^. 10.
Peter coueteth to pray upon the top of the house / Paul prays in prison
/ and was hard of God / who also commands men to pray in all places /
Private places to pray in.
lifting up unto God pure and clean hands / as we find that the Prophets
and must holy men did / wheresouer danger or necessity required.

Appointed places too pray in / may not be neglectd.
But public and common prayers should be vsid in place appointed / for assemblye
of the congregation / from whence / whosoever negligentlye extracte them self
is in nowyse excusable / I mean not that to absent from that place is sin /
because it is more holy than another. For the hole earth created by God / is
equal holy / but the promise made / that whersoeuer two or three be gathered
together in my name / there shall I be in the mids of them / condemns all
such as contemns the congregation / gathered in his name / but mark well
gathered / I say not to hear pyping / singing or playing / not to patter upon
beads or books / whereof they have no understanding / not to commit Idolatry /
honoring that for God / which is no God indede / for with such will I neither
join my self in common prayer / nor receiving of the external sacraments /
for in so doing I should affirm their supersticion and abominable Idolatry /
which I never will do nor cou^sail other to do to the end.

What is to be gathered in the name of Christ.
THis congregation / which I mean / should be gathered in the name of Jesus
Christ / that is to laud and magnefye God the father for the infinite
benefits they had received by his only son our Lord / in this congregation
should be distributed the mystical and last supper of Jesus Christ / without
supersticio^ / or any more ceremonies then he him self used / and his apostels
after him indistribution thereof / in this congregation should inquisicio^ be
taken of the poor among them / and sufficient support while the time of their
next conuencio^ / should be provided and distributed.

In this congregation should be made common prayers / such as all men hearing
might understand that the hearts of all subscribing to the voice of one /
might with unfeigned and ferfent mind say Ame^. Whosoever do withdraw them
self from such a congregation / but allace where shall it be found / do
declare them selfs too be no members of Christ's body.

For whom and at what time we should pray.
FOr all men / 1. Tim. 2. When and for whom we should pray.
and at all times does Paul command that we shall pray / and principally for
such of the household of faith / as suffer persecucion / and when common
wealths tyranniously we oppressed / then incessantly should we call that God
of his infynite mercy and power woll withstand the violence of such tyrauntes.

Gods sentence may be changed.
ANd when we se the plagues of God / hunger / pestilence / or war / coming
or apearing to raygne / then should we with lamentable voices and repe^ting
hearts call unto God / that it would please his mercy to withdraw his hands /
for with such as do aleage / that God may not change his sentence and our
prayers / therefore to be in vain / can I in no wise agree / being otherwise
taught in the scripture by his infallable and eternal verity. He says: I
shall destroy this nation from the face of the earth / and when Moses
adressed to pray for the^ the Lord proceeds saying: Suffer me that I may
utterly destroy them / and then Moses falls on his face flatling / and
fourtye days contineweth in prayer / for the salvation of the people / to
whom at the last obtained forgeuenes. David in the vehement plague /
lamentable calls unto God / and the king of Niniue says: 2. King. last.
who knows / if God shall be converted and led back by repentance. Iona. 3.
And be turned from the furor of his wrath / that we perish not / which
examples and scriptures are not written in vain / but too certefye us / that
God of his native goodness will metigate by our prayers offered by Jesus Christ
/ although he has threatened to punish or presently by punishing / which he
does testefye by his own words saying: Ierem. 18
If I have propheried against any nation or people / that they shall be
destroyed. And if they repent of their iniquity / it shall repent me of the
euel / which I have spoken against them. ^a^enes in prayer.
This I write lamenting the great couldnes of men / which under so long
scorgis of God / is nothing kyndled to prayer by repentance / but carkese
sleep in weked life / even as though their continuante wars / urgent famyne /
cotidian plagues off pestilence / and other contagious insolent and strange
maladis / were not the present signs of Gods wrath provoked by our iniquite.

A plague threatened too England.
O England / A plague threatened to England.
let thy intestiue batteries and domestical murder / provoke the to purety of
life / according to the word / which openly has been proclaimed in the /
other wise the cup of the Lords wrath / thou shall shortly drink of. The
multitude shall not escape / but shall drink the dregs / and have the cup
broken upon their heads / The godly punisshed.
for judgment beginning in the house of the Lord / commonly the least
offender is first punished / to provoke the more weked too repentance. But O
Lord / infinite mercy / if thou shall punish / make not consumacion / but
cut away the proud and luxuriant branches / which bear no fruit / and
preserve the common wealths / of such as give succor and herber / to thy
contempned messengers / which long have suffered exile in deserte / so be it.

FINIS.
Here after follows a Confession
OMnipotent and everlasting God father of our LORD Jesus Christ whoo be thy
eternal providence / disposes kyngdoms / as best seameth to thy wysdom / we
acknowledge and confess thy judgments to be righteous in that thou have
taken from us / for our ingratitude and for a businge of thy most holy word /
our native King and earthlye comforter / justly may thou pour forth upon us
the vttermoste of thy plagues / for that we have not known the days and time
of our merciful visitacion / we have contempned thy word / and despised thy
mercies / we have tra^sgressed thy laws / for deceytfully have we wroughte
every man / with our neighbors oppression and violence we have not abhorred /
charity / has not apeared among us as our profession requires / we have
littel regarded the voices of thy prophets / thy threatninges we have esteemed
vanytie and wynd / so that in us / as of our selfs restes / nothing worthy of
thy mercies / for all are found frutles / eue^ the princes with the prophets
/ as wythered trees apt and mete too be burnt in the fire of thy eternal
displeasure. But o Lord / behold thy own mercy and goodness / that thou may
purdge and remove the most filthy borden / of our most horrible offenses /
let thy love overcome the severity of thy judgments / even as it did in
giving to the world thy only son Jesus / when all mankind was lost / and no
obedience was left in Adam nor in his sede. Regenerate our hearts o Lord by
the strength of the holy ghost / convert thou us / and we shall be converted /
work thou in us unfeigned repentance / and move thou our hearts too obey thy
holy laws. Behold our trobles and apparent destruction / and stay the sword
of thy vengeance before it devour us. Place above us o Lord for thy great
mercies sake / such a head with such rulers and maiestrates as fears thy
name / and wills the glory of Christ Jesus to spread. Take not from us the
light of thy Euangely / and suffer thou no papistrie to prevail in this
realm. Illuminate the heart off our sovereign lady queen Marie / with
prignant gifts of thy holy ghost. And inflame the hearts of her cou^sayl /
with thy true fear and love / repress thou the pride of those that would
rebelle. And remove from all hearts the conte^pte of the word / let not our
enemies rejoice at our destruction / but look thou too the honor of thy own
name o Lord / and let thy Gospel be preached with boldines in this realm /
if thy justice must punish / then punish our bodies with the rod of thy
mercy. But o Lord let us never reuolte / nor turn back to Idolatry again.
Mytigate the hearts of those that persecute us / and let us not faint under the
cross of our savior / but assist us with the holy ghost / even to the end.
