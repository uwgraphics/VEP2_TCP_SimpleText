Here begins a little prosses or matter called the chance of the dolorous
lover newely co^pyled or made by Crystofer Goodwyn The year of our Lord god,
a, M. ccccc. xx.



The prologue of the auctour.
Upon a certain time as it befell
I was all pensyfe and thoughtfull in my heart
For sundry things which I knew full well
Could not be remedyed as touching my part
Wherefore I imagining from me to astarte
Such thoughts and fa^tasies coming through ydeues
And even so I began this little matter or prosses
For as I have read in books and in stories old
Of all vices the chief rote of Idelnes
And if it be as wise men have told
Which veryfyenge of the same plainly did expres
That of all sins Slouthe is chief maystres
Into the which lest I should fall I made for fere
This treatise called ye chance of the dolorous lover
Not for no prasynge but my spyrytes to wake
Which at that time were full rude and dull
And so I you requyer that you will it take
Which that does entende for to read it full
Or it to here and so I trust that you will
That slouthe to avoid which enemy is to virtue
This work I took in hand that after does ensewe
Thus ends the prologue.
Here foweth a little treatise called The chance of the dolorous lover.
AS it fortuned me for pass
Thrughe strange countres my solace to take.
When the feldes were resplendent and covered with grass
And with sweet herbs and flowers delycate
And birds melodyously singing on every busshe or stake
I mean in the pleasant time of Autom
Which next unto vere may have the chief rome
And thus as I rode my self all alone
Musing of things that were in times past
By the space of three days and than about none
My way I did lose by riding over fast
Than I was full sorry yet at the last
A pleasant way I found I thank god of his grace
In which I entered and rode in an esye pace
For my Journayes which I had the days before
And also the ways that I had reden wrong
Had made me full weary and also faynte and sore
That ferther on my horse I could not endure long
Wherefore I thought me to rest and with yt I herd asonge
Nere by which was so melodyous and sweet
That all my werynes I did all forgete
To know what it might be I had great purpose
Wherefore thyderwarde full fast I did me hye
And then before me I saw a grene close
Enuyronned with great trees and hedges full strongly
Yet not withstanding I entered pryuely
In at the gate wiche open then I found
And there I tied my horse and lyghted on the ground.
And when I within this close entered was
Being nothing round but of compass quadrant
I beheld it well in every corner and place
Saying to my self that such another skant
Could not be found of flowers so habundaunt
As was this little close which before truly
I herd the song that was song so swetely
And in beholdynge this field round about
Right against me then did I espy
A way which as this close went out
Also in another place truly
I saw a bird which sange full hye
Upon four flowers casting so sweet a savor
yt they quyckened my spyrytes with their doulcet odor
And ever this bird full plesauntly did sing
With her sugered notes very loud and shyll
That all about ye place her Iocou^de voice did ring
Whom dylygently to here I stood full soft and still
And to understand I fyxed my mind and will
The dytte of her song which was so certain
God send every true lover his lady to obtain
Than to this sweet bird or auys I (...) nere
And as I went I stombled on a busshe
And almost had a fall and with a ragged bryere
I was constrained to make a great russhe
Where with she was a ferde and suddenly did flusshe
And would no longer tarry but with all her might
From thens I wist not whyther fast she took her flight
Than I was full sorry when I saw her gone
Not withstondynge I knew there was no remedy
And straight unto the place I walked all alone
From which a little before I did se her fly
And when I was this foresaid place by
I wist not well wheder I did wake or sleep
So great a swetnes in to my stomach did beat
And wha^ I was reuyued and come to my self again
I beheld ye meruaylous facyon of this foresaid place
Which was square and also low and plain
Compassed round about with hye herbs and gras
So that no man might se in but at one space
Which was opyn wherein to enter I did purpose
Thinking there my self for to repose
And when I had entered in this little gardyn grene
Which full smothe and low was with herbs
In all my life I had never seen
An arbor that was so pleasant I wys
Wherein stood in the mids
Of this said place four delycyous flowers
Casting meruaylous sweet and delycyous sauoures
(...) which I went and down by them did lie
And over this as I lay right well I did behold
What herbs and flowers they were if I could dyscry
Then of all their names I might read as I would
The first letters which were of beten gold
Syngulerly set on every flower above
Growyng after the manner of a goodly true love
The first flower to my thinking was of a crymsyn pure
Having an A written him upon
Which stood for y^e first letter of his name I was right sure
Yet what flower it was I lay musing long
And when I had all studied yet knew I none
Name that it had wherefore I was right sore
For it passed all other in swetenes and beauty
The second flower was a vyolet full sweet
That had on him written of his name the first lettre
Which was an. U. both fair and great
In all the world could not be a better
The.iij. herb orfloure which might none be swetter
Was Isope of savor both good and wholesome
Which had for his name an I upon him written
The sovereign herb sauge was the fourte
Which all other herbs in virtue does excel
As in old time wise men did report
Which had written upon him an. S. as I you tell
For the first letter of his name meruaylously well
And than full well I knew these herbs among
Sat this little bird or auys singing of her song
All these four flowers so sweet and delectable
Grew like a true love as I before did tell
Having this gold lettres without any fable
Each one his own which I to geder did spell
And when I had set them to gyder than I knew well
That it was the name of my true love
Whom specially I desired next god above
And thus when I had read the name of my lady dear
From women I was departed not long before
Suddenly was changed all my merry chere
And my heart began to be full heavy and sore
With grievous groans and syghes more and wore
So that in faith it was no great wondre
Though in a hundrede peaces it had brast a sondre
From her the departing to me so grievous was
Whom to the said flowers full well lyken I might
She is so goodly and beautefull of face
So curteys so gentle so amyable and so bright
That in the wide world such another wyhgt
Could not be found so full of grace and goodness
As is this mine own sweet lady and maystres
And when I had been a long time in this heaviness
The absence of my love right peteously be waylynge
It came to my mind my sorrows to releys
Some balade to make which that I might sing
And thus I began right dolorously wenynge
By cause of her the syghte I had lost
Whom in this world I desire most
Here after follows the balade of the dolorous lover.


O Miserable creature wrapped all in woe
Full well may I complain both morn and weep
Sith my lovely lady I am departed fro
That was so gentell so goodly fair and sweet
So dulcet a bird or auys a man cannot get
Wherefore I may say alas my mortal pain.
From her the departing full nyghe has me slain.
Sle me it will ye and that right shortly
Without that I may within a little space
Have of her a light or else right gladly
Would I dye even in this same place
And never to se no body more in the face
Wherefore I beseech dame venus above
To send me again the sight of my true love
Alas unfortunate man what thing did I mean
From her wha^ I departed whom I so much set by
Has now out of her favor clean
I shall be cast than may I both sobbe and cry
And also to be sorrowful ever till I dye
Wherefore alas my mortal pain
From her to depart full nyghe has me slain
O rubycunde ruby and perle most oryent
O gyloffer gentle and sweet flower delyce
O daynty dyamounde and most respendent
O doulset blossom of a full great price
O sweet maystres above all creatueres most wise
Wherefore I beseech dame venus above
To send me again the sight of you my true love
In virtue to Magulon I may you well acounte
In wisdom to lady Florypes ye do insewe
In mekenes Gryselde ye do surmounte
In stedfastnes to Clerymounde that lady true
In beauty to the lady Eglantyne I may deem you
And ever alas my mortal pain
From you the departing full nyghe has me slain
Also four letters ye have in your name
In tokenynge of love ye should be true
Of which these flowers have the same
That be so sweet and full of virtue
Wherefore to them I may well lyken you
And yet I beseech dame venus above
To send me again the sight of my true love
This flower unknown and vyolet in swetenes
This Isope so wholesome this sage so souerayn a thing
You pass and excel thrughe your goones
Also to this bird or auys that hereafore did sing
With your dulcet voyece ye may be lykened my dear swetynge
But ever alas my mortal pain
From you ye departing well nyghe has me slain
Alas dear lady ye be mine only hope
My Joy my heart and the substance of my life
My pain my sorrow and also my death god wot
Against which I can make no manner of strife
Nor other remedy I know but still morn and syghe
And yet I beseech dame venus above
To send me again the sight of my true love
That I might to your goodly parsone declare
How faythefull I have been how steadfast and how true
But alas I fere that ye be void and bare
Of pity and compassyon which I full sore may rewe
For then my woe and sorrow shall renew
Wherefore alas my mortal pain
From you the departing well neyghe has me slain
Alas I trow a Jew on me would take co^passyon
Knowing my faythfulnes and my loving heart
Whicheuer to her I have borne with all my hole ente^cion
And still purpose to do and never for to reuerte
From her my mind though she untrue astarte
And yet I beseech dame venus above
To send me again the sight of her whom I do love
Alas to call her untrue I am gretely to blame
Seeing that as yet I never showed my mind
Unto her goodness alas I durst not for shame
Wherefore I am yet in good hope yt I shall her find
To me her own true seruau^te both loving and kind
And yet alas my mortal pain
From her the departing full nyghe has me slain
She is so gentell so lovely and so meke
So fair so sweet so good to more and les
That wha^ I on her thy^ke I wene my heart shall break
For the love of her I am in so great dystres
Which is mine own dear lady and maystres
Wherefore I beseech dame venus above
To send me again the sight of my true love
Of all her goodness what should I more endyght
The half whereof it would not well suffyse
For to be declared is an hole seuvn night
If still thereat sit I should and never fer to rise
She is so beautefull so curtyes and so wise
Whefore alas my mortal pain
From her the departing full nyghe has me slain
Alas at this time I may no more sing
I feeble my heart so feel and so sore
With lamentacyons and contynuall weeping
Which does in dure ever more and more
Wherefore adue the best that ever was bore
Always besechynge dame venus above
To send me again the sight of my true love
Adue my swetynge adue my darlynge dear
Adue my health and solas with pains smarte
Adue the goodlyest that ever life did bear
Adue for whom I am both pale and swarte
Yet crystes dear blessing have sweet heart
But ever alas my mortal pain
From you the departing full nyghe has me slain
Adue adue my life so sweet
Adue my death so sherpe and strong
Adue fair bird and auys so dulset
Adue for ever I cannot endure long
Wherefore this is the last of my song
yet or I dye I beseech dame venus above
To send me again the sight or my true love
There ends the balade of the dolorous lover and foweth of the adventure that
happened unto him showed by vysyon in his sleep
And thus when I had of this balade made an end
I began right strongely to sobbe syghe and weep
Besechynge dame venus some conforte me to send
And from all parelles my dear heart for to keep
And then for pure werynes I fell in a little sleep
And as I slepte me thought the foresaid auys
To me did come and bad me arise
Saying o thou slothful man and full of ydylnes
Wenest thou with slouggynge thy lady to obtain
Or by alone complaining her sorrows to redres
Nay nay it must be througe great labor and pain
And here thou do but spend thy time in vain
Wherefore I the counsel that shortly to her thou go
Else thy mind and purpose shalt thou never come to
And be nothing aghast to show to her plain
All thy mind and will requyrynge her of grace
And when she knows yt troth then will she again
Some conforte the give and that within short space
Otherwise look never thy will to bring to pass
Farewell for I go hens and look thou take good head
Unto to my foresaid words if thou purpose to speed
Than out of my sleep suddenly I made abrayde
And looked round about but nothing I could aspy
And than I remembered what ye bird to me had said
And in my secret mind I prynted it surely
Saying yt I would do after it for me thought truly
It was the best counsayll I that herd my life days
Wherefore I concluded to rise and go my ways
And when I was by I went a full soft pace
Unto my horse whom I left behind
When I went the song to here and in the same place
Where as I him left I did him find
Upon whom I light all thoughtfull in my mind
And rode for the on my way besechynge our lord Jesus
To keep my lady and me and all lovers that be true
AMEN
Lenuoy of the auctour.
Go forth little quayre with full due reverence
Unto the princes of beauty sovereign
And the humbly submyt unto her magnyfycence
Requyrynge her to take not in dysdayne
This little work which with great labor and pain
Her goodness to declare I took on hand to make
Though I unworthy were such things to under take
Wherefore I beseech all you that shall over read
This little proses to have me in no skornynge
Nor me to dysprayse though I so rudely enterprysed
such matters to take in hand to me nothy^ge pertainy^ge
But where as is amys there to be amendynge
Thus I you pray with my hole affection
Which entendeth to read or this dytte to look upon
Finis.
