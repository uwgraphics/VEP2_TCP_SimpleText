TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, his singular good LORD, Sir HENRY HOBART Knight and
Baronet, Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleaes, increase of true Honor
here, and eternal happiness hereafter.
Right Honorable,
WHat has formerly been offered to your RELIGIOUS ear, is now further
presented to your JUDICIOUS eye. Neither doubt I, but that, as it then found
attentive audience with the one, so it will now find kind welcome and
acceptance with the other: the rather it being, for the matter and substance of
it* the message of Him in whose seat you sit, though brought by a weak and
unworthy Messenger, and delivered in mean and unpolished manner. Messages are
wont to be respected and received, and Presents esteemed and accepted more for
the party from whom they come, then for the Person by whom they come, or for
the manner of the delivery of them. The matter, I hope, will not be altogether
unprofitable or unfruitful, though not handled so artificially or methodically
as it might, or as were meet But neither mine incessant encumbrances, and
perpetual distractions, (...) of body, variety of business, and slender means
of assistance, will afford leisure or liberty for any accurate and exact
discourse: Nor is there much need of Art to persuade godly regard and holy
obedience, where the power of piety has already in some good measure possessed
the heart. The Truth of God cannot but find good entertainment with all those
that sincerely love and like it, although it come naked and bare, as (...)

best beseems it, or but meanly attired, not bedecked and set out with such
ornaments and dressings, as the natural eye and ear only affect and regard.
If in ought it seem ouer-harsh unto any, C^ncti qui ^derunt mandatu^ sacrum,
causam od^ in seipsis habent* omne illis fastidium non in legis praecepti^, sed
in moribus sun. Salvian* ad Eccles. cathol. l. 4.

will not endure to have it come near their lips, when they have sore mouths.
Quam d^ blanditur sibi and dulcis est iniquitas, (...) est veritas. Aug. de
verb. D^. 4.
It is man's love of his own corruptions and impatience of cure, that makes
the word of God harsh and unpleasant unto any. But there is no fear or doubt
that ought here should in this kind be distasteful to your Lordship, whose
discreet, and moderate and upright carriage in your place is so generally
acknowledged and testified of all sorts. If at vacant hours your Lordship
shall vouchsafe to cast your eye on it, it shall be more then a sufficient
recompense of my pains in it. A monument it shall at least be of that duty,
that I deservedly owe unto your Honor, and of my thankful acknowledgement of
that undeserved favor and countenance that your Lo: has been pleased from
time to time to* vouchsafe me, as well before, as since I came under the wing
of your Honorable protection. And the Lord of Lords protect your Lordship,
increase in you his graces, direct you in your courses, and bless you with
long life and many good days, to his glory, the public good, your own
spiritual comfort in this life, and your eternal salvation after this life.

Your Lordships at command in all Christian duty THO. GATAKER.

GODS Parley with PRINCES: With An APPEAL from them to Him.
PSALM. 82. verse. 6, 7, 8. 6. I have said; Ye are Gods, and sons of the most

Princes. 8. Arise, o God, judge thou the earth: for thou inheritest Or, in all

we need not stand to discuss by what or whose pen it was written. Regis

When letters or mandates are known to come from the King and to be signed
with the Kings own hand, it is needless to inquire either by what Secretary
they were drawn, or with what quill his name was subscribed.

The matter of the Psalm does mainely and principally concern Magistrates:
Which to make the more effectual, Verse. 1.
God himself is produced here sitting on the bench, said to be (...)
his, amids the Judges termed (...)
Gods; tam praeses quam praesens, not as present only with them in place, but
as President in power; and by virtue of that power of his parlying and
expostulating with them; and that

1. Verse. 2.
by way of reprehension; rebuking them sharply, and taking them up roundly,
for their unjust and corrupt cariages in matter of judicature.

2. Verse. 3. 4.
By way of admonition, inciting them to the due and diligent performance of
their office, and discharge of their duty in the upright and impartial
administration and execution of justice.

3. Verse. 5.
By way of admiration; as wondering at their sottish and senseless behavior;
that, though Terra statumina dimoventur.
the pillars of the whole State, and their own seats withal were shaken
under them, partly through their own misgouernment, and partly also through
the just judgment of God upon it; yet they would not see it and take notice of
it, to amend what was amiss; but go on still wilfully in their corrupt
courses, till all came to confusion.

Now because such great men might peradventure allege for themselves that

by way of correction: as if he had said: True it is indeed; I have said it;
and I still grant it; ye are by office and commission Gods, and Gods sons and
Heirs as it were in some part of his power. But yet neither does this exempt
you from your native condition of frailty and mortality; nor deprive or
abridge God of his authority and soueraignti^, which he has in part so
imparted to you above others, as yet (...) (...). de reg^o. R^ (...) in
proprios greges: Reg^s in ipsos (...) Iovis est. H^rat. (...). lib. 3. (...) 1.
he retains over you and them still: That which you shall one day find and

as other ordinary me^ do, and Sicut vn^s (aliorum) princip^. ^orum scil. de

as others of your own rank have done before you; and you that now judge
others, shall be judged with others, coming Post mortem iudiciu^. Heb. 11. 26.
after death to give up your accounts unto him.

In Verse. 9.
the last verse is the conclusion of the Psalm; (as the Preface was in the
first verse) wherein the Psalmist by an Apostrophe turns his speech: and,
whereas before he spoke in the person of God unto Rulers, he now leaves them,
as little hoping to prevail oughts with them; so bent especially as Verse. 5.
then they were ( Drant on Eccles. 11. 1.
It is in the reformation of a State, as in flaying of a beast, the matter
sticks most when it comes to the heads:) And he speaks now in his own
person, or in the person of the poor and oppressed, whom he had Verse. 4.
before mentioned, concerning them unto God: Entreating him, whose (...) scuta
terr^. i. protectiones. ^un. Psalm. 47. 9.
the Sheilds of the world are, and Psalm. 2. 8.
whose Inheritance the whole world is, Psalm. 10. 14.
to take the matter into his own hand, and Psalm. 146. 7.
to execute justice himself for those that sustain wrong, as well on those by
whom they are wronged, as on those that refuse to do them right.

And thus much both for the General sum of the Psalms, and the principal
parts of it; which might easily be minced out into many more particulars: But
because Aeque c^nfusa est divisi^ and ni^ia and nulla. Senec. epist. 89. Itaque
in parts divid^ vtile est, non in (...) concidi (vel comminui (...)) ^d.
multiplicitie of division, as one well observes, breeds but confusion; this
for the present shall suffice.

Now to leave the rest of the Psalmists discourse either of, or with these
earthly Gods and Governors; in the three last verses, which my purpose is
principally to insist on, we may consider according to the former analysis and
resolution of them, these two parts;

1. Verse. 6, 7.
A parley with them: and, 2. Verse. 8.
An Appeal from them.
In the former the special points obseruable, may be referred to two Heads;

1. Verse. 6.
The dignity and eminency of Rulers and Magistrates above others, in regard of
their divine constitution; 2. Verse. 7.
The frailty, misery and mortality common to them with others, in regard of
their humane condition.
For the former of these: The dignity and excellency, Vise Justin. (...).
quaest. 14^.
as of Angels above other Creatures, so of Magistrates above other men, herein
appears, in that the name of God himself is given unto either. To Angels,
where the Psalmist says of man. Psalm. 8. 5.
Thou have made him little less then the Gods: that is, Hebr. 2. 7. Et ^ic
Sept. (...).
then the Angels. And of Christ the son of God; Psalm. 97. 7.
Worship him, all ye Gods: that is, Heb. 1. 6. Et sic Sept.* (...).
all ye Angels of God; as the Apostle himself expounds it.

To Magistrates, where it is said: Exodus 22. 8. and 21. 6.
He shall appear before the Gods: and, Exodus 22. 2^. Act. 23. 5.
Thou shall not rail upon the Gods, nor revile the R^ler of thy People. And,
not to go far, as Verse. 1.
before, where God is said to sit in judgment (...)
amiddes the Gods: so here, where he both avoweth the style, and extends it
to all of them, what ever they be otherwise, good or bad, just or unjust, godly
or godless; I have said it: Ye are all of you, both (...)
Dij, Gods, and (...)
filij Dei, sons of God: as the Heathen Poet calls (...). Ho^er. passim. Et
Plin. Paucgy^. Necdum Imperator, (...) Dei fili^ (...).
Kings, Persons divinely descended; and the Heathen King speaking in his
heathenish language, says Dan. 3. 25.
he saw in the furnace with those three servants of God that abode safe in the
fire, I^ sed pia s^amma tunc pepercit. Prudent. stepi^a^ 6. Et quorum
vestimenta non attigit, vincula co^sumpsit, vt vno codemque tempore and haberet
flamma virtutem suam ad solatium, and non haberet ad tormentum. Oreg. mor. lib.
9. cap. 49. and dialog. lib. 3. cap. 18*
which though it burst their bonds asunder, yet burnt not their bodies, a
fourth person (...) Sicut Apo^. 1. 13. (...). Like a son of man. W. May.
like a son of the Gods, that is like Alexander Sacerdoti Iovis filium
^uncupa^ti: (...). (...)* (...). Plut. apophth.
some rare and excellent personage.

Now if we ask the question, why Kings and Rulers are so termed; our Savior
himself will inform us, if we conceive him aright. Ioh. 10. 35.
Si illos dixit Deos, Sic vetus vulg. Vatabl. Leo I^d. Erasm. Beza etc.
ad quos sermo Dei factus est: If he called them Gods, to whom the word of God
came; or, was made, or, was. They were (says our Savior) called Gods, not,
because Sicut Angl. vecu^ tum communis tum Ge^r.
the word of God was spoken to them: but Sic Sir. Quia.
because the word of God came, or word for word, (...) fuit. Sir. prout. and
Ebr. Joel. 1. 1. and Ion. 1. 1.
was made unto them. Word by an Hebraisme is used commonly for charge, command,
commission, or warrant. So Deuteronomy 10. 4.
december verba, Gods ten words, for his ten precepts, or edicts. And, Dan. 3. 22.
(...) vti Joan. 10. 35. Sir. (...)
verbum Regis, The Kings word, that is, his command, was urgent. And Ester. 3.
12, 15.
Queen Vashti refused to come, adverbum Regis, at the Kings word, or command.
And, Ester. 3. 15. and 4. 3.
the Posts went out speeded Vel cum edicto, vel Rege (...). Drus.
in or cum verbo Regis, with, or by the Kings commission. As by the Kings word
then is meant the Kings commission or warrant: so by Gods word in our Saviors
speech may his charge, warrant or commission be well understood in the
judgment of very Vise Zanchium ad Hosh. 1. 1.
good Divines. And as it is said of Hosh. 1. 1.
Hoshe, Ion. 1. 1.
Jonas, Luke 3. 2.
John the Baptist and others, that the word of God came, or, (...).
was made unto them, because they had special charge and commission from God
for the performance of some Offices with the people of God: so Frustra enim est
Origin. qui ad Angelos detorquet, in Exodus ho^ 8. frustra etiam, quod ad totum
genus humanum distendit idem in Romans 3. de qu^ Aratus tamen v^re, (...). -- ad
sanctos saltem vniversos, Iusti^, cum Tryph. Tertull. ad Hermogen*: and Hieron,
ad Gal. 1. de quibus 2. Petr. 1. 3, 4. Et Sen. in Apocol. Pictate and institia
principes Dij ^iunt.
of Magistrates says our Savior that the word of God is made to them, because
they have a special commission signed them from God, for the executing of a
special place under him and from him.

That Kings and Princes therefore are termed Gods and Sons of God, it is
(...), (...). Eustath. Itaque quod H^od. in Theogon. (...) - Ho^er. Iliad.
(...) Eustath. (...). Just. quaest. orth. 142. O^ communitat^m ipsi^ pot^ntiam
and potestatem Zanch de na^. Dei. lib. 1. cap. 12. Non quod natura sint Dij,
sed quod officium ^orum sit ordinatio divina. Brent. in Ioam. 10
not in regard of nature or natural descent, but in regard of honor,
authority and power conferred upon them from God. For, Prou. 8. 15, 16.
By me, says P. 18. 23, 25.
the eternal Son of God by Solomon, do Kings reign, and Lords execute
judgment: By me Princes rule and Nobles, even all the Judges of the earth.
They rule and reign all of them aut missi, aut permiss^, Either (...)
sent of him or Pet. 2. 18. ^ Judge. 3. 8. and 4. 2.
suffered by him: wrongful Usurpers by permission of him, rightful Governors
by commission from him: by his providence the one, by his ordinance the other:
For, Romans 1^. 1.
there is no power but it is of God: and the powers that are, are ordained of
God: says the Apostle Paul of the one: And, Joan. 19. 11.
Thou could have no power over me, were it not given thee of God: says our
Savior himself of the other. I^de est Imperator, vnde and homo antequam
Imperator: inde potest as illi, vnde and Spiritus Ter^ull. apolog. Cuius (...)
homines (...), buius iussu and Reg^s constituunt^r. Ir^n, lib. 5. cap. 24.
Of him alone are their places, of whom are their persons, whatsoever their
persons are* And Potestas enim (...) (etiam nocentin^. Aug. de not. bo^i cap.
32.) a summa Dci potestate omnino datur. Idem cont. S^cund. ^. 10. Qui dat
regnum caelorum solis pijs, regnum terrenum and pije and impijs, sicut ei
placet, cui nihil injuste placet. Idem de ciuit. l. 5. c 21. A quo sunt omnes
potestates, quamvis ab illo non sent omni^ voluntates. Ibid. c. 8. Legatur and
Theoplryl. in Romans 13.
the power it is his, howsoever they come by it, or howsoever they abuse it.

Hence it is that the Kings chair of estate is called Gods Throne. 1 Chronicles.
29. 23.
Solomon sat on the Throne of God as King in steed of David his Father. And
the Bench of Judges is called Gods Bench. Verse. 1. inca^ Dei. Iun.
God stands in the Congregation, or assembly of God. And the judgment they
execute is said to be Gods judgment. 2 Chronicles. 19. 6. and Deuteronomy. 1. 17.
The judgment ye judge is not Man's, but Gods.

Yea hence it is that Kings and Princes are termed Christi Domini, The Lords
anointed: not Hebrews only, as Saul, though a bad one and one that feared
not God; 1. Sam. 24. 7.
He is, says David, the Lords anointed; but even Heathens too, as Cyrus,
though a Pagane and one that knew not God; Esaias. 45. 1, 5.
Thus says the Lord to Cyrus his anointed; I strengthen thee, though thou
know not me. And not Christi Domi^i, 1 San. 12. 3. 2. Sam. 1. 14, 16.
the Lords anointed only, but Domini Christi, 1 Cor. 8. 5. Christus Cherub.
Ezech. 38. 14.
Lords anointed, or Gods anointed, if you will: as Psalm. 89. 20. 1 Samuel 10. 1.
anointed of God, so anointed, Psalm. 45. 6, 7. Esai. 61. 1. and 1. Reg. 19. 15,
16. vngere sic sumitur.
that is, solemnly appointed to be Gods, though not by nature, yet by office,
by deputation from God, as Ego e^ omnibus mortalibus placui electusque sum, qui
in terris diuina vice fungerer. Sen. de ele^. l. 1. c. 1. Sed and Eleutherlus
Episc. Romans Lucium nostratem Dei in regno suo Vicarium agn^scit.
Deputies, Leifetenants and Vicegerents unto God.

Neither is this an idle appellation only, titulus sine re, a naked title
without truth, or a bare shadow without substance. Aug. in Psalm. 108.
Deus cum benedicit, faci^ quod dicit: God where he blesses, he does what he
says: where he imposes a name, he imparteth withal what the name imposed
does import. As he has given an eminent appellation unto them: so he has
conferred an eminent power and authority upon them, (...). Diotog. de regno.
(...). Ecp^a^. tes Pythag. de regn^ apud Stob. tom. 2. c. 46. (...). Ag^petus
Iustiniano. Inde (...) Diotogenes, (...) Philippus Mac. d^cit; quod Plin. in
Panegyr. Aequata^ dijs potestate^.
a divine power representing and resembling his own sovereignty. He has made
them sacred and sovereign; he has put his own sword, the sword of Justice
and Judgment into their hands.

The Magistrate is (...). Romans 13. 4.
Ensifer Dei, Gods Swordbearer: says the Apostle: and that not to bear, or
wear the sword for a show; ( (...) Ibid.
for he has it not for naught:) but to draw it out, and (...).
to make use of it according to such directions as from God himself he has
received. V^s quibus rector maris atque terrae Ius dedit magnum necis at ^
(...). Sen. Thyest. act. 3. sc. 3. Vit^ necisque gentibus arbiter datus. S^noc.
de clem. l. 1. c. 1.
He has ius vita and necis, power of life and death, the most sovereign power
that may be: the greatness whereof may hereby appear, in that Non fit re^
homicidi^, qui hominem occiderit, obedions potestati; (...), nis^ fecerit,
imperij deserti. quo^ tamen si sua sponte atque authoritate fecisset, in crimen
effusi human^ sanguinis incidisset. Aug. de ciuit. l. 1. c. 26. Non enim ipse
occidit, qui (...) debet i^benti; ^icut admini^ulum gladi^e est vtenti. Ibid.
c. 21. Visatur The. p. 2^ 2^ ^. 74. ^. 3.
that being done in due sort at his appointment is good justice, which being
don without him were no better then murder the highest degree of injustice,
even to them that should deserve it.

And thus you see summarily both the ground and reason of this Title; as also
the great dignity and excellency that it imports.

The Use whereof concerns either Rulers themselves, or others in regard of
them.

For the former: (Give, I beseech you, not me leave, but God leave, in whose
place I stand here, as your selves sit elsewhere, to put you in mind and
admonish you of your duty to him:) Has God himself conferred this great
honor on you? Apud Great. (...). ^. did. 81. c. 18. and Lucius c. 19. Et
Bo^fac. 8. in 6. d^cret. l. 1. tit. 3. c. 15.
Non datur beneficium nisi propter officium: No benefice, says the Canon, is
bestowed upon any, but in regard of some office to be performed for it. Then as
he has honored you, be you careful to honor him.

It is a point of great Equity. For Quid aequius, quid iustius, quam vt vos
honoran^em honor^tis ipsi?
what can be iuster or more equal, then that you should honor him again when
he honors you, whom you stand bound to honor whether he thus honor you or
no? yea what is more agreeable both to religion and reason, then (...).
Arist^t. polit. l. 5. c. 11. (...). Agapet. Justin.
that they should honor him more then others, whom above others he has
honored? Cur qui in saeculo prim^ es, non in Christi familia pri. mus sis?
Hieron. Iuliano. (...). Pietas optimus est Imperatoris cultus. Soz^m. praefat.
ad Theodos.
Why, says he, should not thou be a prime Scholar in Christ's school,
that art a prime person in the State? Why should not you be more forward then
others in advancing of Gods glory, whom God has in such glorious manner
advanced above others?

And on the other side Quid iniquiu^, quid indignius qua^ beneficio tanto
mal^cium rependere? Ierem: 18. 20.
what can be more unworthy or unequal, then for you to repay God again with
evil for good, for so high an honor, for so great a good? where consider (I
beseech you) in the fear of God, what a fearful thing it is, when it falls
out as it did in Ieremies time. o I will get me to the great ones: says the
Prophet, when he could not prevail with the poorer sort of the common people:
they (I am sure, though the other be foolish and sottish;) know the way of the
Lord, and the judgment of their God: But how found he them affected? But they
have wholly shaken off the yoke, and broken the bonds: not unlike those of the
same rank, Ierem: 5. 5.
that say in the Psalm, Psalm: 2. 3.
Let us break his bands asunder, and cast his cords away from us. The
greatest men were the greatest Rebels; Vt divitijs, s^c vitijs primi ^uere.
Salvia^. de prouid. l. 7.
as foremost in wealth and worship, so forwardest in wickedness. And remember
withal, as that of the Wiseman, that Potentes potenter tormenta patientur.
Sap. 6. 7. Leviusque ferit leuiora Deus. Sen. Hippol. act 4.
Mighty men shall be mightily punished: so that also of the Centurists, that
Ingentia bene^cia, ingentia flagitia, ingentia supplicia. Cent. 5. praefat.
Extraordinary blessings seconded with extraordinary sins will at length
draw down extraordinary judgments.

Interest hominis Deo cedere. Tertul. apolog. Dijs te minorem quod geris,
imperas; Hinc omne principium, huc refer exitum. Horat. carm. l. 3. ode 6. Sic

It is a point of good Policy. For, 1 Samuel 2. 30.

honor. And, Psalm. 75. 6.

up and pulls down. It is God that makes Gods and that vnmaketh them at his

Who owe more duty to their Sovereign then those, that have been by him
highest advanced? It is a foul imputation, and no small blemish for great
Ones, not only to go beyond others in dishonouring of God, but to come short
of others, yea not to outstrip others in seeking the glory of God, in doing
their duty unto him; to be more slack, less frequent and fervent, Deuteronomy. 17.

And here, let me more particularly, (...). 2 Cor. 5. 20.
as from God and in Gods name, entreat you, to have a special regard of
observing Gods Sabbaths. You that Exodus 20. 10. Deuteronomy. 5. 14. Nehem. 10. 31. and

are to see them observed by others, ought not you much more to observe them
your selves? Vita Principis censura est, eaque perpetua. ad hanc convertimur;

Your carriage is a kind of censure: that all men fix their eyes upon, that
most men shape their courses by. If others then shall see you riding in your
circuits on the Sabbath, will not they think within themselves? And why may
not I as well ride on the Sabbath to a Fair, as the Judge may to the place of
Assise? If they shall be warned to appear before you for some hearing by
themselves, or by their Counsel upon the Sabbath, will they not be ready to
argue from the works of your calling, to the works of their own? And why may
not I as well be about my work as they about theirs? And in truth (to speak
plainly as the thing it self is) why may not a Smith as well work at the
forge, or an Husbandman at the plough, as Causas die D^minico vel audire vel

a Judge sit to hear civil causes on the Sabbath? The one hinders the
sanctification of it as well as the other.

And if it be alleged that the one is (as before was proved indeed) more
specially Deuteronomy. 1. 17. 2 Chronicles. 19. 6.
Gods work. So were the repairing of a Church, which yet the Mason or Plumber
may not work about on the Sabbath; no more then Besaleel or Aholiab might
about the work of the Tabernacle, Exodus 31. 2, 6, 11, 13, 14, 15. de quo recte

for the furtherance whereof, God would not admit or give way to the least
violating of his Sabbath. But I leave this to your grave and discreet
consideration. You are wise and reverend: and a word with the wise is
sufficient. I forbear therefore to press this further, and pass on to an
other branch not much unlike this.

In the next place then. Are you Gods in regard of your eminent places? Grandis

It is a great honor indeed; but it is a weighty charge that this honor
lays on you. It is most equal that those that are termed Gods, should in
their courses and carriage most resemble him whose name they bear.

an high seat and a base mind, a principal place and a vulgar carriage, is a
thing not unsightly and unseemly only, but even ugly and abominable, says one
of the Ancients.

Great-men may easily be entreated to take notice of the eminency of their
places, for the clayming of Offices of respect and regard from others their
Inferiors: Happy were it for them, could they as readily be induced seriously
to consider of it for the exacting of wise and wary, discreet and seemly
carriage from themselves, that they might not by their unadvised and indiscreet
carriage, or by any base and unbeseeming course, bring the least aspersion upon
either their persons or their places: If they could and would say to
themselves, when they are either by others solicited, or of themselves inwardly
moved to do ought, yea though it be not simply evil of it self, yet that it is
such as will not stand with their honor, and with the honor of their places,

though many things may be true; yet ought not a Judge to give credit to them

Secondly, Deuteronomy. 1. 16, 17.
justly and uprightly; without respect of persons for favor, friendship or
other sinister respects. Such is Gods judgment. Psalm. 119. 75.
I know, o Lord, that thy judgments are just. And, Psalm. 92. 15. Deuteronomy. 32. 4.
God is just, and there is no iniquity with him. And such therefore also
should yours be: As Iehosaphat tells the Judges of his time in giving them
their charge: 2 Chronicles. 19. 7.
Take heed that you do justly with an upright heart: For there is no iniquity
with the Lord your God, nor respect of persons, nor receiving of bribes.

Remember you that your seats are Psalm. 122. 5.
seats of judgment, of justice. And it is an evil of all others most foul
and most fearful, Eccles. 3. 16. cu^ inde manant iniuri^, v^de iur^

when oppression is found in the place of judgment, and iniquity sits in
the seat of justice: Eccles. 10. 5.
when a wrong sentence proceeds from the face of him that rules and should
do right.

Elementum in loco non (...). ex^ra (...) grave fit.
The Elements weigh not heavy when they are in their own place, as they do
when they are out of them, in the room of some other element. A man that
diueth under water, perceives not the weight of it, though he have a whole tun
of water over his head: whereas were there but half an hogshead of the same
water put into some vessel, and set above water on his head, he were by no
means able to stand under the weight of it.

In like manner Psalm. 41. 9. and 55. 12, 13, 14, 20.
is vice or sin nothing so offensive, while it is in its own sea, as when it
is in the seat of the contrary virtue. For a man to be coosoned by some
cheating Companion, some shifting Mate that lives, as we say, by his wits, we
are wont to make no great matter of it; He has put a trick upon me; and I am
well enough served: I had little reason to look for other at his hands. But
for a man to be over reached by one that he has trade and traffic with, and
professes to deal honestly and uprightly with him, that we can not so well
brook or bear; we look for square dealing at the hands of such, and to have
monies-worth for our money.

So here for a man to be robbed by the high-wayside, or to have his pocket or
purse picked by a common Diuer or Pick-purse, it is nothing so greiuous: there
is wrong and robery in his own proper subject. But for the Judge that sits
in the seat of justice to wring or wrong the party that sueth to him for
right: to be as the bush, or the bramble (it is the Prophet Mica. 7. 4.
Michaes comparison) that teareth the fleece from the sheep, that flies to it
for succor and shelter against the storm: yea worse then bush or bramble, in
stripping not the fleece only from the skin, but Mica. 3. 1, 2, 3.
the skin also from the flesh, and the flesh from the bone; and so Quid est
aliud omnium dignita^ sublimium quam proscripti^ civitatu^? aut quid aliud

praying upon those, whom they ought to protect, worse then those, against whom
they ought to protect them: for Judges and their Officers or Followers to be
Partners and Sharers with Thieves and Murderers: (it is the Prophet Esai. 1.
23.
Esaies complaint:) When courses of law and justice are so perverted and
corrupted, that (as Piu^ 2. test Platina.
one of the Popes sometime said, and it is no other similitude then the Prophet
Ierem. 5. 26, 27.
Jeremy long before him used:) Litigatores aves forum aream, iudicem (...),

the Counselor treacherously betraieth his Clients cause, whom he has
undertaken to defend; and ^
the Judge sets his doom and sentence to sale; and he that sits to
reform sin, commits sin there himself; he that is called to redress
wrong, does wrong there himself, and that to those that repair to him for
right; and (...) and seve^e P. Syru^; I^dex damn^r, c^m noce^s absolvitur.

ciuit. l. 4 c. 4. Et de iniquo iudice, iudicijsque i^iustis ^dem dixeris; esse
illum latrone de^eriorem, haec latroci^ijs gemina, vel eisdem etiam d^teriora.
This it is of all other most greiuous and intolerable; because here is now
injustice and iniquity in the room of justice and equity: Which as it makes
the transgression of such the more heinous here, so shall it cause their
condemnation to be most hideous hereafter.

Thirdly, as justly and uprightly, so boldly with confidence and courage:
favoribus incorrupti, pavoribus interriti; as not led aside with favor, so not
forced aside with fear. Else as Temerit as iudicis, so, Timidit as iudicis
calamit as innocentis: as the Judges temeritie, so the Judges timiditie may
prove the Innocents calamity: as it was in poor Naboths case. And therefore
Iethro advises Moses to choose out men as vncorrupt, so Exodus 18. 21.
of courage to make Judges and Rulers.

Remember to this purpose and to encourage you herein, what Moses tells them
there in giving l 1 King. 21.
them their charge: Deuteronomy. 1. 17.
Fear not any man's face: for the judgment is Gods. Ye are not the Kings
Judges, but (...). Romans 13. 4, 6.
Gods Judges; at least your judgment it is his: as the Ministers of the word,
though they be Act. 14. 23. Tit. 1. 5.
called by men, and Romans 15. 8, 16.
minister to man; yet Colos. 4. 17.
their ministry it is Gods, and they are 1 Cor. 4. 1. 2 Cor. 3. 6. and 6. 4.
and 11. 13.
Ministers not of man but of God.

And what follows hence? Surely if your judgment be Gods, and you judge
according to God, God he will undoubtedly bear you out in it. So does
Iehoshaphat assure those that he called to that office: 2 Chronicles. 19. 6.
Take heed how you judge: for you execute the judgment not of man but of God:
and he will be with you. He will never be wanting to his own ordinance, nor
fail to back and bear out those that duly execute it.

See you do right therefore, because God is righteous: and therefore fear not
to do it, because it is his will you should do it. 2 Samuel 13. 28.
Smite him, says Absalom to his servants of his brother Ammon, and slay him;
and fear not: have not I bidden you? be bold therefore. So smite you the
wicked, as their wicked courses shall require: smite them, I say, and fear
not: has not God bidden you? be bold then. Absalom could not secure them: God
is able to secure you: yea as (...). Math. 28. 14.
the high Priests promised the Soldiers, though it was more then they could
make good; (...). He will secure you: Do you your duty, and you shall not need
to take further care for it. 2 Chronicles. 19. 6.
The Lord will be with you: says Iehosaphat: as to assist you, so to protect
you. As he hearteneth Joshua: Josh. 1. 9, 5.
Have not I bidden thee? be strong and courageous: fear not, nor quail not;
for I the Lord will be with thee: as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee;
I will never leave thee, nor fail thee. And Romans 8. 31.
if God be with you, as the Apostle speaks, who can be against you? If Act.
18. 9, 10.
God be with Paul, no man shall be able to lay hand on him to hurt him. If
(...). 1. 18, 19.
God be with Jeremy, though Prince and Priests and people band all together
against him, yet shall he stand firm like an iron pillar, like a brazen
bulwark against them: they shall never be able to hurt him that God gardeth.

Whereas on the other side, if to please men you shall displease God, shrinking
and swar^ing from the rules that he has prescribed you, and for fear of man's
face deal unfaithfully, in the execution of that office that he has imposed
upon you: ^
by stepping aside to shun danger, you shall but plunge your selves into
greater danger. As the Proverb has it: Qui ti^ent pru^, irruet sup^r e^s nix.
Job. 6. 16. (...) Drus prou^. 1. cent. 2. prou. 2.
He that fears the frost shall be overwhelmed with the snow. Pruiua i^rius

While you ^eare the frost of man's anger that lies under your feet and might
easily be overcome; you shall be overwhelmed with the snow of the divine
vengeance, that descends from heaven and cannot therefore be avoided. (...),
vt Lucian. Necyom^t. ^umu^ fugientes in flammam incidunt.
While you fly the smoke of man's displeasure, you shall fall into the Deuteronomy.
^2. 22.
flaming fire of Gods wrath, that burns even to the botome of hell.

Prou. 29. 25.
Trepidus homo ponit tendiculam sibi: The fearful man, says Solomon, sets
a s^are for himself. And it is in this case verified that the Prophets have,
and (...).
the Jews use as a byword. (...) Esai. 24. 17, 18. Ier. 48. 43.
He that flies from the noise of fear, falls into a pit, and he that
gets up out of the pit, is caught in the snare. We may well apply it with
some transposition to the present occasion. When matters are to be heard before
you, and some Great-mans letters come, whom the one party has some interest
in, here if you be fearful of doing your duty, your fear sets a snare for
you, and if for fear of offending him you decline from the right, while you
fly from the noise of a false fear, you fall into a true snare: or while you
seek to shun one snare, you fall into another, a worse snare: while you seek
to shun the snare of man's offense which you might easily have wound your selves
out of again, yea Psalm. 124. 7.
God would have broken for you and set you free from; (...). Apostolius.
Fugi^ns pluviam incidit in lacunam. Drus. l. 1. cent. 1. prou. 36.
you fall into the pit of Gods heavy indignation, out of which it is
questionable whither ever you get up again or no.

In a word; it is a sin for any man to fear man more then God, and for fear
of man to do ought that may displease him: but it is much more a foul shame
for those that are termed Gods to fear any but God, and out of fear to fail
in the doing of that duty, which with courage and confidence God has called
them to execute.

Fourthly and lastly, severely where God himself (were he present) would show
severity, and has willed severity to be shown. As ye have just cause to
Neque enim debet dispensat^r crudelis esse, vbi paterfamilias misericors est.
August. alicubi.
take heed how ye deal rigorously, where God would have lenity and clemency
used, as 2 Samuel 21. 2.
Saul with the Gibeonites, Parvis peccatis ven^am, magnis severitatem
co^modare, nec p^na semp^r, sed (...) paenitenti^ contentus esse. Tacit.
Agricol.
in lesser and slighter slips Dat veniam c^rvis, vexat censura columbas. Iuven.
sat. 1.
with silly weak ones, in simplicity and infirmity ouer-taken rather, then
offending out of malice and wilful contempt: that were as the Prophet
speaks, Amos. 5. 7. and 6. 12.
to turn judgment into gall: Etiam nocentes (...) supra meritum manifesta
iniquttas est. In quantum enim punitio excedit del^ctum; in tantu^ ^tia punit^
Rob. Gr^thed* (...). 4^.
It is as well a point of injustice above desert to punish the guilty, as it
is without desert, to punish those that be wholly guiltless.

So have ye no less cause to beware, least, as 1 S^m. 15. 9.
^ul with Agag, you spare there, where God would have you severe. Deuteronomy. 13. 8,
9, 10, 15, 16.
Thine eye, says he, shall not spare them, that the Lord thy God may spare
thee: neither shall thou show any mercy unto them, that God may show mercy unto
thee. Prou. 17. 15. Aequ^ iniquitas est, non punire nocentes, and punire
innocents. Grosthed ibid. Non eris innocens, si aut punias eum cui parcendu^
esset, aut parc^ ei qui fuerat puni^ndus. Bern. de consider. l. 2.
It is alike injustice not to punish the guilty, (as the quality of the crimes
committed by them shall require,) and to punish the guiltless.

sermon. lib. 1. sat. 3.
A discreet hand therefore is to be held of you in the administration of
justice, and in the sentencing and censuring of Transgressors and Offenders.
You must remember that you are sent by God as Deuteronomy. 25. 2, 3.
with a rod for some, so Romans 13. 4.
with a sword for others, (...). 1 Pet. 2. 14.
to take vengeance on malefactors. And therefore you fulfill not your charge,
you discharge not your trust, if you put not the power which to that purpose he
has given you in practice: And Vnde punitur, si fecerit iniussus inde
punietur, nisi fecerit iussus. Quod si ita est iubente imperatore; quanto magis
iubente cr^atore, cuiu^ ^on est f^ iussa contemnere? Aug. de ciuit. ^. 1. c. 26.
you shall answer for it with your own souls, as Ahab; not only, 1 King. 21.
19.
if you slay Naboth, but 1 King. 20. 42.
if you slay not Benhadad. If you let murderers, and Masse-preists
soule-murtherers, and other like malefactors escape, whom God has committed
into your hands, Naeista vobis mansuet^do and misericordia in miseri^ vertet.

Petron. satyr. Itaque hic tenet (...) apud S^ob. (...). 2. c. 9. (...).
your lives shall go for theirs, you shall answer it with your own lives for
the saving of their lives.

Yea, you shall not only bring that curse upon your selves, that Ier. 48. 10.
the Prophet denounces against that man that does the work of God
negligently, that with*holdeth his sword from shedding of blood when God
calls him thereunto: But, like either fearful or unfaithful Physicians,
who by sparing an ounce or two of corrupt blood, that were better out then in,
infect and taint all the rest, and so endanger the whole body; Qui feri^ndi
petestatem habet, solus in culpa est, si culpa non feritur qua ferienda est,
and ^o imp^tu quo ferienda vel potius fulminanda est. Bern. Epist* 23^. Si ^st

be encouraged to commit; yea and the wrath of God at length also upon the
whole state, which by such means you shall cause to be totally defiled
therewith. For N^. 35. 33.
the whole land, says the Holy Ghost, is polluted with blood, and with the
like enormious crimes, and cannot be purged again but by the blood of those
that shed blood, and by the condign punishment of such as commit such crimes.

In a word: as you bear the name of Gods, so let your conversation and
courses, your carriage both general and special be Godlike, correspondent to
this great and glorious title given you of God: that you may not be as he said
sometime of the Heathen Philosophers and their writings, like Apothecaries
pots, Qu^ru^ tituli habent remedia, py^ides venena. Lact. instit. l. 3. c. 15.
that have an inscription of some sovereign medicine without, when there is
either nothing at all, or that which is worse then nothing, nothing but some
rank poison within.

Hitherto we have showed what this stately and lofty style of Gods given to
Rulers by God himself requires of them: let us now see what it exacteth of us
that live under them. That which the Apostles tell us both Peter and Paul. If
Magistrates be Gods, and their power and place be of God, then must Romans 13. 1.
every soul be subject to the higher power, Romans 13. 5.
not for fear of man's wrath but for conscience of God: Then 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14.
submit your selves you must to every humane ordinance for the Lords sake; be
it unto the King as sovereign, or to Presidents and other inferior
Governors, as those that be also sent of him.

Where comes justly to be taxed the intolerable pride of that 2 These. 2. 3.

That these things are enjoined not secular men only, says Chrysostom, but
even Priests and Monks also, the Apostle shows evidently when he says, Let
every soul be subject to the higher power. (...).
Be thou Apostle, or Evangelist, or Prophet, or whatsoever thou be else,
(...).
thou must not only obey them, but even be subject unto them. And Bernard,
though he lived but in a bad and corrupt age, writing to a great Bishop; Si
omnis anima, etiam vefi^a. quis vos excepit ab vniversitate? Qui tentat
excipere, conatur decipere. Bern. ad Henric. Sen^nens. epist. 42.
If every soul must be subject to the higher power, then yours also among the
rest. For who has given you an exemption from this general iniunction? He
that endeavors to exempt you, does but seek to delude you.

In a word to apply a speech of Optatus spoken of him by that insolent
Schismaticke Donatus to the present proud Romish Prelate; Cum supra Imperatorem
non sit nisi Deus qui fecit Imperatore^; dum s^ Donatus super Imperatorem
extollit, iam quasi hominum excesserat m^tas, non verendo cum qui post Deum ab

they say:) the Pope advancing himself above the Emperor, goes beyond humane
bounds, and carries himself not as man but as God, in not reverencing him who
of men is to be feared next after God.

But to leave that Antichrist to his transcendent not eminency but insolency:
we are admonished, when Kings and Governors are by God termed Gods, so to
account them as God calls them, and accordingly to carry our selves in our
demeanor toward them: to obey and be subject, as one says, (...). Basil.
Bonis tanquam Deo; malis propter Deum.
unto good Rulers as God, bad Rulers for God; or rather, T^ bonis quam malis.
and tanquam Deo and propter Deum.
to both good and bad as well as God as for God. And herein is the true
difference between the religious and the irreligious subject, that Ier. 44.
17. (...). P^rpuram colentes, non Deum. Themist^ apud Socratem hist. lib. 3. ^.
25.
the one worshippeth God for man, 1 Pet. 2. 13. (...).
the other obeys man for God.

Yea not only are we to take heed of rising against them, and laying of
violent hands on them. For 1 Samuel 26. 9.
Who can lay his hand on the Lords anointed, and be guiltless? Qui insurgit
in Christum Domini, insurgit in Dominum Christi. Psalm. 2. 1.
Who so rises against the Lords anointed, arises against the Lord himself
by whom he is anointed. Romans 13. 2.
Who so resists the higher power, resists Gods own Ordinance: and those
that so do, procure destruction to themselves: Or of offering the least outward
disgrace unto them. 1 Samuel 24 6.
It stuck shrewdly in David's stomach, and troubled his tender conscience not
a little, that he had snipped away but a little shred of the skirt of Saul's

to them: Sithence God, (...). Plut. ad prefect. indoct. D^ enim imaginem l^a.

Hitherto we have considered of the dignity, eminency and excellency of
Princes and Rulers in regard of their place and divine constitution: Now a word
or two withal of the latter branch, concerning their frailty, misery and
mortality in regard of their natural estate and humane condition.

change of their nature. (...) adhuc quod eras: and non minus ho^ as, quam quod

It is is not their place that can alter their persons: nor their divine
constitution that can strip them of their native condition. Though they sit
above others, yet (...). Eurip. Archel^ apud Stob. c. 45.
must they die as others. Though they may live like Gods, yet must they die
like men, even as other ordinary men are wont to do.

We need go no further then experience for the proof of this point. For Psalm.

A point of great importance, and that might prove of good use, had I longer
time to insist on it, as well for others as for themselves.

For themselves, for great ones. 1 Timothy 6. 17.
Charge the rich men of this world, says the Apostle to Timothy, that they be
not high-minded. And the great men of this world have as much need of the like

exceeding rich gemme. But it is no other than an earthen pot, though gilt and
garnisht, that both the one and the other is committed unto. Neither is it the
gilt or the garnishing of it that makes it the less brittle, or that hinders
but that soon it may, and once it must be broken as well as others. H^c ^e

So esteem therefore of your selves in regard of others; so demean your

Otherwise if you swell with pride in regard of your high places, contemn such
as be beneath you, and forget your own frailty; hear your doom, ye Gods,

Because thine heart is lift up, and thou say, I am a God, and I sit in the
seat of God; and (...). Ath^nienses Pompeio.
yet art thou but a man still, and not God, though thou take it upon thee as
if thou were God: Therefore I will bring terrible ones upon thee, that shall
draw their swords against thee, and shall spoil thy bravery, and shall cast
thee down to the pit; and thou shall dye the death of the slain, Will thou
say then before him that slays thee, I am a God? But thou shall be a man, and
no God, in the hand of him that slays thee.

then make not Gods of them: put not your trust in them; depend not upon them.
It is no wise course, it is no safe course, neither for you, nor for them

Trust not in Princes, says the Psalmist, nor in any son of Adam: For there
is no surety of safety in or by any of them. Esai. 20. 6. Qui alijs dicit dare

God is a sure stay, says the Psalmist, Psalm. 18. 30. and 33. 22.

tract. 1.
there are, says Augustine, some infirm and unsure stays, which when a man
has betaken himself unto, he is never a whit the surer, but more unsure often
then ever he was: they not only fail a man then, when they should stand him
in most steed, but are themselves many times the means of his miscarying.

A man thinks himself safe, if he can get into favor with the Prince; he
shall be sure then to rise: or if he can compass the countenance of such a
Judge or such a great personage, he shall be able then to make his part good,
and to go through with his suites against any adversary whatsoever. But what
faith the Psalmist? Psalm. 146. 4.
His breath departs, and he returns to his dust: and then all his thoughts
perish. This great-man that they depend upon is but a little Genesis 2. 7.
air and dust tempered together. And while they live in hope of great matters
by him, and he, it may be too, is purposing of great mat^ers for them* comes
God and Esai. 40. ^.
blows him away so dai^ely with a blast of his breath; and Na i^le

then all his princely power perishes together with him, and his proiects they
come all to naught.

Yea oftentimes Confugis ad aliquem in seculo magnum, vt facias tibi potentem
amicum, refugium videtur. Tam incerta tame^ hui^ seculi sunt, ruinae potentum
ta^ crebr^, vt postquam ad tale refugium confugeris, plus ibi timere incipias.
Antea enim caus^ tu^ tantum timebas: cum vero ad talem refugeris, and de illo
tibi timebis. Multi enim cadentibus illis ad quos confugerunt, and ipsi quas^ti
sunt, quos nemo qu^reret, si^on ad talia confugissent. Aug. in Psalm. 45.
dependence upon such great ones, when they fall, proves the ruin and
breakenecke of those that depend upon them or belong to them; who might have
been safe enough otherwise, had they not sought to such succors: as the fall
of a tall Cedar bruiseth the underwood about it, that might have done well
enough, had it stood further of it.

It is with many an one in this case, In Pelago periclitantim^ns apparet: sed
latent saxa sub monte. dum ad montem conatur, in saxa incidit, and invenit ibi
non portu^, sed planctu^ Idem in Joan. 1.
as with the Seaman at sea, that surprised with a tempest, casts about for
some harbor, and espying a bay with high hills on either side, puts in
there hoping to find succor and relief, but strikes unawares on some rock
or shelfe that lay out of sight, and so is cast away irrecouerably in the
harbor, whereas in the tempest it may be he might have done well enough; or as
with a Passenger in a storm, that for shelter against the weather steppeth out
of the way, betaketh him to a fair oak, stands under the boughs of it with
his back close to the body of it, and finds good relief by it for some
space of time, till at length comes a sudden gust of wind that drives down
some maine arm of it, which falling upon the poor Passenger, either maimeth
or mischeifeth him that resorted to it for succor. So falls it out with not
a few: meeting in the world with many troubles and with manifold vexations,
they step aside out of their own way, yea and sometime too out of Gods way, to
get under the wing of some great one, and gain it may be, some aid and
shelter thereby for a season: but after a while, that great one himself
coming down headlong and falling from his former height of favor or honor,
they are also called in question, and so fall by that means together with him,
that might otherwise have stood long enough for their maine estate untouched,
if they had not betaken themselves to him.

Let no man therefore trust to such unsure stays: let no man make any man his
principal stay. Psalm. 1^6. 5. Ier. 17. 7.
Blessed is he that has the true God for his stay: whose hope and happiness
is fixed and founded wholly on him. But Iorem. 17. 6.
accursed is he that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm; and
withdraws his heart from God, by placing of man in the room of God. Let us
take heed Esai: 2. 22.
how we set by man more then is meet. Let us Prou: 24. 21. 1 Pet. 2. 17.

offend God for the pleasing of them, or forbear our duty to him for fear of
displeasing them. Ierem. 1. 18.

Man is not able to shelter us against God.

day die as well as other men, and with other men then come to an account; that
which might alone serve to make them more wary, if nothing else would or could.

Let us now hear the Psalmist Verse. ^.
appealing from them unto God, and commending unto him the causes of such, as
were either oppressed and wronged, or not righted by them.

The whole verse being the conclusion of the Psalm consists of two parts:

There is first an Appeal commenced by way of suite unto God; and that
expressed in two Branches:

1. Surge Deus; arise, o God: a metaphore taken from the common gesture of
Judges, whose usual manner is to Exodus 1^ 13, 14.
sit while they are hearing of causes, Esai. 2. 19. and 3. 13, 14. Si^ sta^tem
videt Stephanus Act. 7. 55. quem sedente^ Marcus 16. 19. Greg. hom 29. non
quasi causam dicentem, vt Aug. quaest. mixed. 88. sed quasi pro Stephano statim
sententiam laturu^, vt Psalm. 76. 9.
to arise and stand up when they come to give sentence. 2. Iudica terram; Judge
thou the earth, or the Land: Psalm. 9. 16.
do thou make thy self known and seen by executing justice thy self: do
thou that that they will not do.
There is secondly a reason, why this is required at his hands; because Psalm.
2. 8.
all Nations, these poor oppressed ones among the rest, are part of his
portion, which it behooves him therefore to take notice of, and to right them
in their wrongs.

Now in this practice of the Psalmist the first point that we observe is, that
the highest Appeal is to God himself: As Ad Dei verbum fit vl^ima resolutio
fidei. Camerac. ad 1. Sent. q. 1. a. 3. corol. 1. lit. H.
the utmost resolution of faith is into the word of God; so Ad Dei tribunal sit
vltima reuolutio iustitiae.
the utmost revolution of justice is to Gods Tribunal.

Hence those forms of Appeal so frequent in Scripture. Psalm. 7. 8. and 26. 1.
and 43. 1. (...). Easil. (...). Sept. Iudic^m meum age. Iun.
Iudica me, Domine: Judge me, or, Vindica me* vt Psalm. 10. 18. and 35. 24.
Drus. miscel. l. 1. c. 59.
right me, O Lord. And, Psalm. 74. 22.
Surge Deus, Arise O God, and judge thine own cause: and, Psalm. 35. 23.
Arise unto my judgment: and Psalm. 10. 12, 14.
Surge Domine; Arise, o Lord, and lift up thine hand, the poor commits his
cause to thee. And 1 Samuel 24. 13, 16.
The Lord be judge between thee and me, and right me on thee. Yea of our
Savior himself, when he was here upon earth, it is said, that ^ Pet. ^. 23.
^ee committed his cause to him that judges justly. And the Apostle Paul that
Act. ^5. 10.
appealed from F^lix and Festus, to C^sar Augustus; yet from them and him too,
and all men he makes his appeal unto God: 1 Cor. 4. 3, 4.
I pass not, says he, (...). ex Cilicum idiotis^. Hieron. ad Algas. q. 10.
Diem tamen dicere ali^ni, pro, in indici^ v^care L^tinis tri^ satis.
for man's day, that is, man's doom; Qui me iudicat Dominus est; It is the Lord
alone that must be my judge.

The truth and equity hereof may more fully appear, if we shall consider; that

First, Appellati^ fit semper a minore ad maiorem. Gloss ad Gra^. c. 2. q. 1.
Appeal is ever made from the Inferior to the Superior: not A maiore ad
minor ^ appellare ^o^ licet. Digest. l. ^9. t. 1. l. 1. and Gloss. ad Great. c.

tit. 6. c. 20.
one equal has no power over an other his equal: but from the Inferior to
the Superior, as (...) 2^. 10.
from Faelix to C^sar, from Festus to Augustus. But ^
God is higher then the highest, and there is none higher then he. Psalm. ^3. 18.
That they may know that thou, whose name is Ieh^vah, art, (...) No^en soli^
very Dei. ^ellarm. d^ Chri^* (...). ^. cap. 7.
altissimu^, the only most high in the whole world. All Appeals end at him:
they may be made to him, bu^ none can be made from him; they cannot go further
or higher then him.

Secondly, the party that Appeal is made unto, must have, that it may be
effectual and to good purpose, (...), and potestatem and potentia^, both right
and might, both place and power, both power of authority, and power of ability.

Now in man these are often severed. Princes often want power: they have Potestatem
sine potentia right often without might, C^actus Princeps quos nolebat occidere:
ereptumque Principi illud in principa^ ^mum, quod nihil cogitur. Plin. Panegyr.
they dare not do often what they know they should do, and what they would if
they could. ^ Sim. 3. 39.
Ye are too hard for me, says David, ye sons of Zerviah. And, Ier. 38. 5.
Minime is est Rex qui possi^ contra v^s quicquam. Iun.
The King, says Zedekias to his Nobles, can deny you nothing: They had such an
hand of him, that he durst not displease them.

And (...) ( ita ^mendo (...) Stob. tom. 2* ^* 44. quod v^lgo, (...)) (...).
Plut. ad praef. indoct.
tyra^nous Usurpers have power more then is meet: they have potentiam sine
potestate, might without right: as had Nimrod, Genesis 10. 9. Arripuit insueta^
pri^ in populum tyrannidem. Hiero^. qu^st. in Genesis No^ tamen primus, credo,
primarius potius.
that mighty Hunter, not of Dear, but of men. And where they have right, they
do not use it aright oft-times, but abuse it. And therefore to appeal unto
such, from Herod to Caesar, were but as for the lamb to appeal from the Fox
to the Wolf, as Luke ^3. (...).
Christ terms the one, or from the Wolf to the Lion, as ^.
the Apostle styles the other: or for the silly Hare to appeal from the Hound
to (...). 10. 9.
the Hunter.

But with God these are not severed. He has and (...) and potestatem, both
might and right, both (...) and ability. For Esai. 33. 22.
Jehovah Iudex noster, (...) legislator noster, Jehovah Rex noster: Jehovah is
our ^dge; Jehovah is our Lawgiuer, Jehovah is our King. Yea God is all these
(...), in a kind of principality a sovereignty, a singularity; so as none are
but he al^e. He is not only Iudex, legislator and Rex, Judge, Lawgiuer, and
King: but as he is said to be Soli sapienti Deo. 1 Timothy 1. (...)* 25.
solus sapiens, only wise; so wise, that in comparison there is none wise but
he; so (...). 1 Timothy 6. 15. (...). I^d. 4. (...)* (...) Desp^.
solus Iudex, Legislator, and Rex, The only Judge* the only Lawgiuer, the only
King; so Judge, Lawgiuer, and King Praet^r m^ null^ est. Esai. 45. 5. (...)
as none are but he only.

First he is Judge. (...) Psalm. 75. 8.
For God is judge. And, (...) Psalm. 50. 6.
God himself is Judge: And so Judge, as there is none but he. For

1. He is Iudex generalis: The general, the universal Judge: not Iudex totius
Angliae, but Iudex totius orbis: The Judge of all the world. Other Judges have
their particular and several Circuits, and he that is Judge in one is not in
another: It is not so with him, he is Judge every where; the whole world is his
circuit. Psalm. 94. 2.
Arise, thou Judge of the whole world, says the Psalmist. And, Genesis 18. 25.
Should not the Judge of the whole world do Justice? says Abraham speaking
both unto him and of him.

Even Princes and Judges as well as others, Psalm. 2 9, 10, 12.
whom therefore if they be (...) the wiser, he will bruise with his iron mace,
and break them to shivers like an earthen vessel.

3. He is Iudex supremus: The supreme Judge. Other Judges iudicant,
iudicantur; They judge, and they are judged, at let iudicabuntur, they shall
be judged. But it is true of Omnes iudicat, a nullo iudicatur* Cyrill thesaur.
l. 9. c. 1
God, that is untruly and bl^sphemously ascribed Vise Great. did. 40. Et cause.

to the Pope, Omnes iudicat, a nemine iudicatur: He judges all, but is judged
of none. Iudicat iudicantes: He judges those that judge others. As Prove. 8.
15, 16.
they judge now by him; so Esai. 3. 14.
they shall once be judged of him. They are liable to his judgment: but he is
liable to no judgment. For Romans 9. 20, 21. Esai. 45. 9.
none may call him to account; or Dan. 4. 32. Job. 34. 17, 1^, 19.
say to him, Why do thou so?

Secondly, he is Legislator, the Lawgiuer: yea he is vnicas Legislator, the
only Lawgiuer: so Lawgiuer as none other is but he. Iam. 4. 1^*
There is one Lawgiver, says James, able to save and to destroy. But Judges
ordinarily, they are not Lawmakers, or Lawmasters. They are but servientes ad
legem, or iudicantes secundum legem: They are but Sergeants at Law; at the
most, but Expounders of the Law, Seeds secundum legem iudicaturu^. Act. 23. 3.
Hinc Diotogen. de regno. (...). apud Stob. cap. ^6.
sitting to judge according to the Law. They do not make Law, but Expon^t ^ibi
legem, and faci^ iuxta legem. Deuteronomy. 17. 9, 11.
Interpret the Law, and judge according to it.

Or though they have ius condendarum legum, Power of enacting and making Laws,
as D^n. 3. 29. and 6. 26. (...). Plut. ad praef. indoct. Quod principi placuit,
legis habet vigorem. Vlpia^. Digest. lib. 1. ^. 4. l. 1.
in free Monarchies and absolute Estates Princes have: In lege temporali nihil

yet must all their Laws be grounded upon and agreeable to Gods Law, or Non
videtur ess^ le^, iniusta si su^rit. Aug. de lib. arb. l. 1. c. 5. N^c ^ura

Vbi de^st ratio, quae legis est anima. Idem de lib. arb. l. 1. c. 6.
else they are no Laws, or as good as none.

And those when they are so made, See D. Field of the Church. l. 4. c. 32, 33,
34.
they bind and restrain the outward man only. As Vsque ad car^e^ saeuis;
animam no^ attingis* terra terra^ per^utis* p^res f^rire habitaculum; (...)
quid and habitatorem? terres visibilis visibilem ^ (...) occides, quem non
vides. Aug. de sanct. 13. Luke 12. 4.
they can meddle only with the outward man, they have no power over the mind;
Non occides quem non vides; What they cannot see, they cannot slay: So their
Laws of themselves, as they are but positive Laws and subject to repeal, can
take no hold of the inward man, though a man may by the breach of them make
himself to stand inwardly guilty of sin; as Gerson. d^ vi^ spirit. lect. 4.
^rol. 5.
by not following the advice given him by the Physician he may incur the
guilt both of sin and selfemurther.

But Psalm. 19. 7, 8. Roman. 7. 7, 12.
Gods Law reaches directly eu^n to the inward man also. For he is Iam. 4. 12.
The only Lawgiver, that has power by Law to bind the soul as well as the
body; as Genesis 2. 7. Qui vtrunque cre^it, vtrunque (...): qui homi^ (...).
vtroque constru^it, vtrumq^e vbi voluerit, destr^ere poterit. Aug. desanct. 13.
he made both: and for the breach of it to inflict penalties as well on the
soul as on the body; Math. 10. 28. Luke 12. 5
to destroy both soul and body together for ever in hellfire.

Again they, even the highest and the absolutest of them, Leges dant, and
accipiunt, both give Laws and take Laws. For, to omit, that Paret^ legi

Principi nemo leges scripsit, yet Deus praescripsit; though no man may
praescribe Laws to such Princes, yet Verse. 3, 4.
God has prescribed Laws as well to them as to others. They give the^ to
others, they receive them from him.

Whereas he Leges dat, non accipit, He gives laws, but takes none. Dat leges
leges dantibus, Legislatoribus ipsis: He gives laws to all, even to those
that give laws to others, to the Lawmakers themselves: But he receives none
from any: for Job. 36. 23.
no Creature may prescribe Laws or Rules to his Creator.

Thirdly, he is Psalm. 93. 1. and 97. 1.
Rex, a King: and Psalm. 47. 2. Mala. 1. 14. Math. 5. 35. qui titulus olim

Rex magnus, A great King.

He is Rex, not Tyrannus. A King not a Tyrant: A rightful and lawful King, a
King Regnu^ enim Dominiest. Psalm. 22. 28. 1. Chron. 29 11.
of his own, not an Usurper: there is his right.

And again Rex magnus, not Regulus: not a petie Prince, but a great King: a
mighty, puissant, (...). Apoc. 4. 8.
omnipotent Monarke: there is his might.

Yea he is not only Rex magnus, a great King; but Rex solus, the only King: a
King so as there is none but he.

For 1. he is absolute and independent. Omne sub regno grauiore regnum est.
Sen. Thyest. 3. 3.
Other Kings and Princes are not absolute. Prou. 8. 15, 16.
They hold all from him; Psalm. 75. 8.
they depend all upon him; Psalm. 22. 27, 2^. 29. (...). Agapet. Magnus qui
tantu^ pr^mium cepit; sed mayor, qui capienti dedit. Plin. Panegyr.
they do service all to him. As Psalm. 47. 9.
the sheilds of the world; so Apoc. 19. 12.
the Crowns, and Apoc. 1^. 15.
the kingdoms of the world are all his: and Dan. 4. 22.
he disposes them at his pleasure. For Ille regna dispensat, cui^ est and
orbis qui regnatur, and hom^ ipse qui regnat. Tertull. apolog.
he dispenses the kingdoms of the world, whose both the world is that is
governed, and man that does govern.

But God is absolute and independent. He is 1 Timothy 6. 15. Apoc. 19. 15.
Rex regum, and Dominus dominantiu^, King of kings, and Lord of lords; and
Psalm. 50. 1. and 96. 4.
Deus Deorum, God of Gods too: Romans 9. 5. 1 Chronicles. 29. 11. Qui nuncupativ^
dicitur, inter omnia Deui, qui vere and essentialiter, super omnia Deus est.
Greg. in Ezech. l. 1. ^m 3.
God above all; and none above him; 2 Cron. 20. 6.
regnans super omnia regna terrae, reigning over all the Kingdoms in the
world, as he does over all the kings of the earth.

Domini sunt, and Dominum habent; Lords they are, and a Lord they have: to wit,
him that is called Apoc. 1. 5.
Princeps regum terrae, The Prince of the Kings of the earth. Dij dicti, quosi
a Dee dati; Domini quia a Domin^ potesta^ fortiti. Origin. in Exodus him. 8.
Gods they are called, because given by this God; Lords because they have
received power and place from this Lord.

But, as the Heathen man sometime said, Qui Rex est, regem, Maxim, non habeat.
Martial. epigram. 18. l. 2. Sit liber, Dominus qui volet esse meus. Ibid. ep.
32.
Let him be my King, who himself has no King: So, let him be my God, who
himself has no God. Solus verus Dominus es, qui Dominum non babes. Aug.
confess. lib. 10. c. 36.
He is the only true Lord, that has no Lord: he is the only true Prince, that
has no Prince above him: And therefore 1 Cor. ^. 5, 6.
though there be many that are called Gods and Princes and Lords: yet unto* us
there is but (...) e Idem h^bent iuris adversus imperia, quam adversus
imperantes habet* Sen. epist. 91.
God, and one Prince and one Lord; because one (...) absolute and independent.

2. He is great in and of himself. Other Princes and great personages are not
great of themselves. They are not to other men, as a Giant to a Dwarf, or as
Cedars to shrubs. A Cedar is a tall tree, though there stand never a shrub
near it, and though it grow below in a botome: and the shrub is but a shrub,
though it stand aloaft by it self on an high hill, or on the top of a stone
wall. Non est magnus pumili^, licet in monte constiterit. Coloss^ magnitudinem
suam servabit, etiam si st^terit in put^. Sen. epist. 76.
A Giant is a Giant, though he lie along on the ground: and a Dwarf is but a
Dwarf still, though Pygmaei in turribus. Diverbium e^ Vulg. versione tractum
Ezech. 27. 11. Vise Iun. not.
he get him up to the top of a turret.

But it is with Princes, as with stones in a building, in a stone-wall: where
some stand higher, some lie lower, of equal size otherwise the one with the
other; and the lower support and bear up the higher. They are but men still in
nature and stature, though Gratia, non natura Dij dicti. Origin. in Exodus 8.
Gods by name and in state, rather higher in place, then greater in person then
others are.

Whereas God is great of himself and in himself; he is not (...). Aristot.

relatiuely, or comparatively, but he is simply and absolutely and infinitely
great. So great, that 1 King. ^. 27.
The heavens, and the heavens of heavens are not able to h^ld him: but Ierem.
23. 25.
He fills both heaven and earth. So great, that Esai. 40. 12.
He meateth the heaven with his span; and takes the whole sea up in the palm
of his hand: that Esai. 40. 15.
all the world is with him but as a little dust that hangs o^ the balance and
yet altreth not the weight, as a drop of water that falls from the bucket,
and yet minisheth not the measure: that Esai. 40. 17.
all the people in the world compared with him, are but as vanity and a thing
of nothing; yea that Psalm. 62. 9.
all the nations of the earth, if they be weighed against him, they are lighter
then vanity and Esai. 4^. 1^.
less then nothing. So great that there is no end of his greatness: Infinit^
longit^ di^is linea recta* circulum faciens, and in se rediens. Cusan^ presb.
apud Trithem. ad C^sar. quaest. 1.
a straight line, says one, of infinite length, returning into it self, and
so making a circle: Sphara, cui^ centru^ vbique, circumferentia nusquam.

a sphere, whose center is every where, and the circumference of it no where,
not to be found. So great, that his greatness cannot be comprehended: (...).
Joan. Dam^se. de ^ide lib. ^. cap. 13.
he were not God, if it could.

Psalm. 14^. 3.
Great is the Lord, says the Psalmist, and greatly to be extolled, and his
greatness is incomprehensible. Magnus, magnus, magnus nimis. Volebat dicere
quantum magnus. Et si t^ta die, Magnus, magnus, diceret, quid magnum diceret?
tota di^ dicens, Mag^, finiret aliquando, quia fi^iretur di^. magnitud^ illi^

cogita: and cum cogitaveris, parum erit. quod cogitatio nullius explicat,
lingua alicui^ qu^ exprimat. Aug. in Psalm. 144.
There is great, and great, and great: says Augustine: He would feign, if he
could, have told us how great. But had he said, Great, and great, all day long,
what great matter had he said? He that says, Great, all day long, must needs
once make an end, because the day it self has an end: where as Gods
greatness is infinite, without either beginning or end. But saying, His
greatness is incomprehensible, ^e gave over speaking, and left it to us to
conceive what he could not utter. As if he had said; What I cannot utter, do
thou imagine: and when thou have imagined the greatest greatness that man's
mind is able to reach unto, then kn^w that thou come yet infinitely short
of Gods greatness, Which since no man's mind is able to comprehend, no marvel
if no tongue of man be able to utter.

Again Princes receive power from their people. Prou* 14. 28.
The might of a Prince consists in the multitude of his people. And Eccles.
5. 8.
the throne is supported by the Ploughmans pains. It is their subjects
shoulders that bear them up; as the lower stones in the wall do those that
lie aloaft over them: take these supporters away, and they will lie as low as
the lowest.

Master: and Quanquam Diogenes apud Sen. de tranquil. c. 8. Turpe est Manem sine

(...). tom 7. eclog. 30. ex ^ Cor. homil. 34.
the Master can no more be without his Servant, then the Servant can be without
his Master: In like manner it is here: Nec magis s^ne to nos esse selices, quam
tu sine nob^s esse potes P in* panegyr.
The Prince has as much need of his people, as the people have need of their
Prince: and the Prince can no more be without his people, then the people can

But God, he gives to all, he receives from none. Act. 17 25.
Dat omnia omnibus: He gives all things to all: For Romans 11. 36. 1 Chronicles. 29.

He was as well and as happy, before the world was, as now he is or can be.

Ipse ^ Ipse Deu^ est tuus, qui tuis non eget bonis, non timet a malis. Idem in
Psalm 80.
He is the only true Lord, that has no need of servants, and whose servants
have need of him: Ipse (...) est Dominus, qui a servis nihil sumit; and a quo

He is the only true Lord, that receives nothing from his servants, but from
whom the servants have whatsoever they enjoy. And so is he the only true
Sovereign that has no need of his subjects, but they all need of him: Quomod

that receives nothing from them, and from whom they receive whatsoever they

3. His dominion it is infinite. Other Princes have their dominions listed and
limited; yea listed and limited by him. For Act: 17 27.
he has set them their bounds, as Psalm: 104. 9.
he has fet the sea hers, which they cannot pass. It seemed a great matter,
when it was said; Virgil^ Aen. l. 1. Sic Dan. 4. 19.
Imperium Oce^no, fama^ qui terminet astris: Psalm: 72. 8.
His dominion shall reach from Sea to Sea, and from the river to the lands end.

But here is Virgil: ibid.
Imperium sine fine; sine limite; a dominion without list or limit, other then
the bounds of the vast universe. Psalm: 47. 2.
For Ieh^va is high and dreadful: he is a great King over all the earth. And,
Psalm: 103. 19.
The Lord has prepared his Throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all.
And, 1 Chronicles: ^9. 12.
Riches and honor are of thee; and thou reignest over all.

He has prepared his throne in heaven: there is his chair of estate: But
where is his footstool, or his foote-pace then? Himself tells us by the
Prophet: Esai: 66. 1.
Heaven is my throne; and the earth is my foote-stoole. The Kings of this world
sit all at his feet: it is but his footstool, that they share all among
them; the mightiest Monarkes Territories are but a small patch of Gods
foot-pace.

God only does, and none but he, to him may appeals be made by men out of all
places, because Psalm. Psalm. 139. 7, 8, 9, 10.
every where they are within and under his jurisdiction, and out of his
government they cannot go.

4. His dominion as it is boundless, so it is endless. Other dominions can
have (...). Easil. Sell. in David orat. 1.
no further or longer extent* then the lists of this present life. They are
regna huius mundi, The kingdoms of this world: And as 1 Cor: 7. 31. 1 Ioh: 2.
17.
Mundus transit, so gloria mundi: As the world passes away; so must they
needs pass with it. As it has an end; so Dan: 2. 4^, 45.
must they needs end with it, if they end not before it, as often they do. Dan:
2. and 7.

God only that turns it) Regnabo; regn^; regn^ui; Rex fine regno.
some get up and some go down; some stand aloaft that lay below before, and
some lie along that stood aloaft before.

But Gods government is for ever. For, Dan: 3. 33. and 4. 31. Psalm: 145. 13.
His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom: and his dominion endures throughout
all generations. And, Dan: 2. 44.
His kingdom shall break and destroy all other kingdoms: but shall stand
firm it self for ever. Psalm: 9. 7.
The Lord shall sit (as Judge) for ever on his throne, which he has prepared
for judgment, And, Psalm: 10. 16.
he will be king for ever and ever, even when all Heathen Kings are perished
from of the earth.

Sol^ ver^ Rex est, qui semper reg^ est.
He is the only true King that reigns for ever. But Psalm: 146. 10.
Jehovah only reigns for ever, and Sions God only throughout all ages. He
is therefore the only true King.

To conclude then: The highest Appeal is therefore to God, because he is the
supreme Judge, the supreme Lawgiver, the supreme King: yea the only
absolute Judge, the only absolute Lawgiuer, the only absolute King: therefore
the supreme and only absolute Judge, because the supreme and only absolute
Lawgiuer; and therefore the supreme and only absolute Lawgiuer because the
supreme and only absolute King, the only insinite, universal, eternal King.

Now thevse of this point does partly concern private persons, and partly such
as be in place of authority.

For the former: Private men must be admonished, what their course must be,
when courses of justice fail, and they cannot have it at man's hand, at the
hand of the Magistrate: To rise instantly in arms, and seek to right
themselves either by public rebellion, or by private revenge? No: Psalm. 9. 19.
Exurge Deus; Arise, o God; and, Psalm. 68. 1.
Exurgat Deus; Let God arise. Not that upon every slight wrong, and every
trifling occasion, men should be making of their moan in that manner unto God,
and craving justice at his hand; as Genesis 16. 5.
Sara with Abraham, when her maid Hagar having conceived by him, carried her
self malapertly toward her: Prou: 19. 11. and 24. 11. Magni animi est

So did our Savior Christ, he committed his cause d 1 Pet. 2* 23.
to the judgment of God his Father. So the godly before Christ. David to Saul,
1 Samuel 24. 13. 16.
The Lord be judge between thee and me, and do me right on thee. And
Jeremy; Ier. 18. 19.
Hearken, o, Lord, to me; and hear the voice of them that contend with me:
Ier. 20. 12. and 11. 20.
And let me see thy vengeance on them: for to thee do I commit my cause. So
the faithful ever since Christ. Ab^it vt v^tione^ no^ aliquam michinem^r, quam

It is the divine l Athanas. apud Epiphan. hares. 6^.
vengeance that must right our wrongs. The Lord, says Athanasius to
Constantine, judge between thee and me; since thou give way to my false
Accusers against me. (...). Greg. Naz. in Julian. orat. 2.
We, says Gregory Nazianzen speaking of Iulians time, that had no other
weapon, nor wall, nor bulwark, but our hope in God left us, whom could we have
either to hear our prayers, or to protect our persons but him? Rogamus,
Auguste, non pugnamus: non timemus, sed rogamus. Amb. l. 5. epist. 33.
We entreat o Emperor, say the Soldiers in Ambrose his cause against the
Arrians, We fight not: neither fear we, and yet we entreat only. Nay,
Stabimus, and pugnabimus vsque ad mortem, si ita oportu^rit pro matre nostra,
non scutis and gladijs, sed (...) ad Deum. Bern. epist. 221.
We will stand to it, and fight it out, even to death, if need be, says
Bernard, for our Mother the Church; but with such weapons as we may, not with
sword and target, but with tears and prayers to God.

This has been the practice of good Christians in all ages. And to do
otherwise is Deuteronomy. 32. 35. Romans 12. 19.
to sit down in Gods seat, to take the sword out of Gods hand, to make our
selves Gods, Romans 13. 2. Math. 26. 52.
to pervert the order, to resist the ordinance of God; and so to bring upon our
own heads the just vengeance of God, while we seek to right or revenge our
selves upon others.

Again those that be in place of authority and judicature must be admonished,
that they be wary how they carry themselves in their places. Remember they must,
that Quicquid a vobis minor extimescit, Mayor hoc vobis Dominus minatur: Omne
sub regno grauiore regnu^ est Sen. Thyest. 3 3.
as they are above others, so there is one above them: as they now judge
others, so there is an other that will one day judge them, to whom they must
once give account of their judgment, and unto whom an appeal lies from the
highest and greatest of them, even from Caesar himself.

Dan. 6. 1, 2.
It pleased Darius, says the story, to set over his kingdom 120. Governors
to rule the whole state: and over them again three, that they should all give
up an account unto of their government. And at Athens, howsoever (...).
some of their Officers were not accountable to any; yet the most of them were
after their offices expired to give a strict account to certain (...). Vise^di
Poll^ and Harp^cr. Et de Co^. Romany Polyb. hist. l. 6. (...). Hinc Plin.
panegyr. Ad^ Imperator cum imperio calculum ponere: sic exeat, sic redeat,
tanquam rationem redditurus.
Auditors by the state thereunto assigned, each one that could charge them
before those of any wrong done him while they were in Office, having free
liberty so to do.

So it has pleased God the Father Ioh. 5 22, 27.
to make his Son Jesus Christ his General, his O^cumenicall Auditor: and not
some alone, but all Offices and Officers must be accountable unto him. For Romans
14. 10.
We must all appear before Christ's Tribunal: and, Romans 14. 12.
Every one (...) there g^ account unto God for himself. 2 Cor. 5. 10.
We must all, says the Apostle, be made to appear there. But what? And we
alone? Mean men alone, or Ministers only? No: Apoc. 20. 12.
I saw the dead, says John, great and small; Apoc. 6. 15.
Kings and Princes, and Captains and chief Commanders as well as others;
stand before him that sat on the white Throne: and Dan. 7. 10.
the books were opened, and Apoc. 20. 13.
they were judged all concerning the things that were written in those books
according to their works.

As the Apostle therefore warns Masters; Coloss. 4. 1.
Masters deal equally with your servants; considering that you have also a
Master in Heaven: Coloss. 3. 25.
and there is no respect of persons with him. So be you admonished to carry your
selves in your places equally and uprightly; remembering that you have Iudic^
omniu^ Deum. Heb. 12. 23.
a judge also in heaven, before whom you and those that you now judge must
together one day appear; Romans 2. 11. Job. 34. 19.
and there is no respect of persons with him. And as R^lat quod ipse qui n^nc
testis est sub homine iudice, ^abit aliquand^ indicandus sub Deo iudice, qui
simul iudicis and testis (...) officio. etc Rob. Grosthed Lincoln. Ep. in
decalog. mand. 8.
that worthy Bishop wills a witness when he is deposed before a Judge here,
so to speak as remembering that he must answer hereafter for what he now
speaks, before one that will be both witness and Judge, because Io^. 2. 25.
he shall need no information from any other, and in whose presence now he
speaks: So you, when you sit upon the bench, remember that Bench, before
which you must once appear to answer for what you do there; when you look
down to the bar, be put in mind of that Bar, at which one day you must stand
that now sit on the Bench amiddes those that stand before you now at the bar:
and so judge you now as in the presence of him, that now sees you, and
hereafter will judge you, and Iudex quisque iudicij sui supern^ i^dicem
sustin^bit. Chrysolog. sermon. 26.
unto whom you must all one day give an account of your judgment.

Let the dread hereof prevail with you, as it did sometime with Nehemie. N^m.
5. 15.
The Rulers, says he, before me were ouer-burthensome to the people, and their
servants domineered over them. But so did not I for fear of God. As it did
with Joseph: When Gen^s. 50. 15.
his brethren justly expected some hard measure at his hands after their
Fathers decease, remembering Gen 42. 21.
what hard measure they had before offered unto him; Genesis 50. 19.
Fear ye not; says he: For am not I under God? As with Job: Job. 31. 21, 22,
23.
If I have lift up mine hand against the fatherless, when he sought mine
help, and I saw that I might steed him in the gate: Let my shoulder fall from
my shoulder blade, and mine arme-bones be broken. For destruction from God was
a terror to me: I knew I could not escape his highness. And when you shall be
moved and solicited to do ought against right, say as the same Job says, If I
take this bribe, or do this wrong; Job. 31. 14.
what shall I do when God arises? or what shall I answer him when he
visits?

Let this dread, I say, of God that highest Judge, that Judge of Judges,
prevail so with you to keep you in awe and within compass, as the dread of
you does the like with other inferior ones for the present. Otherwise O (...).

Know ye for certain, be ye assured of it, that, as Solomon says, for all
these things God will bring you to judgment. And though you may carry matters
here Fsai. 29. 15, 16.
so closely and so smoothly, that men cannot epsy nor discover your corrupt
carriage, and so you go away with the name of good Justices and just Judges,
when indeed you are nothing less; yet Eccles. 12. 14.
Every one of your actions will God one day bring to trial, and Luke 8. 17. 1
Cor 4 5.
every secret work be it good or bad. And so I pass to the next point.

Where men that should judge, either judge not at all, or judge otherwise then
they ought, there will God himself at length arise and judge.

I say, If they judge not, or if they judge unjustly, if they do not justice,
or if they do injustice, (and it is a point of injustice in them not to do
justice, Non (...) nocens, s^d patt^o fuit. de Claudio A sonius. Et Ausonium
imitatus G. Godwin in ^pic^dio Iac. Mauritii, Nes faciendo nocens, (...)
patiendo fui.
there is passive as well as active injustice) then will God arise and judge:
For otherwise when they do their duty, there is no need for God to enterpose
himself and his power, unless it be to protect them. It had been needless
and superfluous for Paul to appeal to Augustus, if Faelix or Festus had done
him right.

Again, at length, I say; because God does it not ever instantly, but delaieth
it oft*times: He seems sometime to Hab. 1. 13.
sit still and say nothing, to look on and keep silence, Psalm 44. 24. and 78.
65.
to be, as 1 King. 18. 27.
Elias said of Baal, as one fast asleep: as these kind of speeches and the
like imply; Psalm. 3. 7. and 7 6. and 10. 12. and 74. 22.
Arise; and* Psalm. 35. 23. and 59. 5. Esai. 51. 9.
Awake; and, Psalm. 28. 1. and 39. 12. and 83. 1.
Be not silent; o *God: Which he does, 1 Pet. 1. 7.
to try our faith, Apoc. 14. 12.
to exercise man's patience, Romans 9. 22.
to show his own, Genesis 15. 16. Math. 23. 32. 1 Thessalonians. 2. 16.
to let wicked ones fill up the measure of their iniquity.

But Esai. 44. 14. (...). *Solon apud Stob. tom. ^. c. 9.
though he bear long in this kind, yet will he not always for bear; but he
will at length arise and judge the earth: judge those that pervert justice, yea
judge the whole State where judgment is so perverted. When children pilled the
people of God, and women ruled over them, and they beat the poor to pieces,
and ground their faces to powder: Esai 3. 12. 16.
The Lord, says the Prophet, will stand up to plead, and to give sentence for
his people: He will enter into judgment with the Elders, and with the Princes
of his people: And, Esai 59. 14. 19.
when judgment was turned backward, and justice made to stand aloof off, and
truth was fallen in the streets, and equity could not enter; and true dealing
failed; and In ^oc scelus res devoluta ^st, vt no^ possit esse salvus qui nolit
esse malus; nec a latrocinijs tut^s, nisi qui latronibus ipsis par fuerit.
Salvian. de prouid. l. 5.
he that refrained from evil made himself but a pray and a spoil: and there
was no judgment, not one that would or durst right the wronged: Then God,
wondering that none would offer himself to plead for or to protect the
oppressed, put on justice as a corslet, and salvation as an helmet, and zeal
as a cloak, and robes of vengeance for a gown, to repay his enemies according
to their deeds, and to render fury to the Wrongdoers and Oppressors of his
people.

The certainty hereof may be further confirmed, a natura rei, a natura Dei,
Either from the nature of the thing it self,

Or from the nature of God himself.

For the former: It is the prayer of the Spirit: for by it were both this and
the like elsewhere endited. And as our Savior says of himself; Ioh. 11. 42.
I thank thee, Father; thou hear me always: As the prayer of Christ is
always heard: so the prayer of the Spirit is always heard. Romans 8. 27.
For the Spirit makes intercession, says the Apostle, according to God for
the Saints. And, 1 Ioh. 5. 14. 15.
This assurance we have, that whatsoever we ask of God according to his will,
he hears us. And if we be sure that he hears us, Certi sumus quod habenius.
then are we no less sure that we have whatsoever we ask: as sure are we to
have it as if we had it already. Yea to reason, as Augustine does, Orat
Christianus, and exauditur? ^rat Christus, and non exauditur? Aug. in Psalm.
Is any Christian heard when he prays? and is not Christ himself much more?
So Ioh. 14. 13, 14.
is every child of God heard, when he prays though not immediately
inspired? and is not the Spirit of God it self much more heard, and the prayer
that 2 Timothy 3. 15.
it immediately inspireth? Qu^do n^n exauditur a patre, qui exaudit cum patre?
Aug. ibid.
How can he be but heard of the Father praying, that together with the Father
is prayed unto and hears prayer?

As there is an echo of obedience answering the word and commandment of God
in the heart of every faithful one. Psalm. 27. 8.
When thou say, Seek my face; mine heart, says the Psalmist, returns
answer again, Thy face, o Lord, will I seek: So there is an echo of
audience and gracious acceptance with God ever answering the prayers and
supplications of such. Psalm. 9. 19.
Surge, Deus; Arise, o God; and, Psalm. 68. 1.
Exurgat Deus, Let God arise: says the soul of the poor faithful oppressed.
And, Psalm. 12. 5.
Surgam, I will arise, says God, for the oppression of the needy, and the
sighs of the poor: And, Psalm. 102. 13.
Surges, Thou will arise, says the Psalmist to God, and have pity upon Sion,
when the time is once come: And, Esai. 3. 13.
Surget, He will arise, says the Prophet of God, and st^ up to give sentence
for his poor oppressed people.

Psalm. 34. 17.
The just man cries, says the Psalmist, when he is thus oppressed; and God
he^th him. How can he do otherwise? Mark our Saviors own argument. Luke 18.
4, 5, 7.
If importunate clamor prevail with the unjust Judge that neither regards
man nor fears God, shall not God much more avenge his own elect ones that
cry day and night to him, for the wrong that is done them, and the right that
is denied them? I tell you; says our Savior, and he is Ioh. 14. 6.
truth it self that speaks it; though he forbear long, yet at length he
will do it.

Yea suppose they do not cry themselves; Lam. 3. 27, 2^, 29.
they sit down by it, and thrust their mouths in the dust, Psalm. 39. 9.
swallow their grief with silence, and (...). 7. 9.
bear that burden with patience that God has called them to undergo and
endure, Psalm. 109. 4. Luk 23. 34* Act. 7. 60. 1 Cor. 4. 12 13.
praying rather to God for those that persecute and oppress them, then either
expostulating with them, or exclaiming against them, or making solemn appeal
and complaint to God of them. They need not. Resipsaclamat; The thing it self
does it, whether they do or no. Iam. 5. 4.
The very hire of the Laborers that is withheld from them, it self cries,
says James: and the cry of it as well as of the persons themselves enters
into Gods ears. As, Genesis 4. 10.
the blood of Abell from of the earth; so Habb. 2. 11. 12.
the very timber and stone from the building that is founded upon falsehood and
built up with blood, cries for vengeance to heaven. And not Genesis 1^. 20. and
19. 13.
from the sins of Sodom only, that filthy stie, but Iona. 1. 2.
from the sins of Nineueh too, that Nahum. 3. 1.
bloody shambles where lies and robbery roust, and oppression and injustice
harbor, does a loud cry ascend and appear before God.

And can God do less then regard and take notice of this cry? No: his own
nature will not endure, that he should do otherwise.

For first; God is Psalm. 92. 15.
a most just God; yea he is justice it self: He is originally just;
essentially just: so just, that Qui vult esse iniustum, non vult esse Deum.
Bern. de temp. 58.
he can no more cease to be just, then he can cease to be God. Being so just,
he cannot but love justice. Psalm. 11. 7.
Iustus Iehova quae iusta sunt, diligit: The just Lord, says the Psalmist,
loves that that is just. Loving justice he cannot but hate and abhor all
injustice, and all unjust ones. Each thing naturally hates that that is
contrary to it own nature. Psalm. 45. 7.
Thou love righteousness, and hate iniquity. And, Psalm. 11. 5.
Those that love violence, he abhors from his heart.

But as there is no impiety to Ierem. 7. 11. 2 Chronicles. 36. 14.
that impiety that is committed in Gods sanctuary: so there is no injustice to
that injustice, whereby men Inter leges ipsas contra leges deli^quitur ^ inter
iura contra iura peccatur. nec innocentis illic, vbi defenditur res^rvatur

in the very seat and sanctuary of justice. Quo quid esse (...), vel iniqui^

Then which, what can be more abominable in the eyes of any just man; and much
more then of him that is most just and justice it self. Genes. 18. 25.
Should not the Judge of the whole world do justice? says Abraham. Or can he
do less in a case of such injustice as this is?

Again Exodus 34. 6.
God is a merciful God; no less merciful then just. And therefore cannot but
hear the cry of the oppressed, and take vengeance on unmerciful men. It is
the argument that God himself uses by Moses. Exodus 22. 22, 23, 24, 27.
Vex not, nor oppress the widow, the Orphan, nor the poor; (they are my
Clients, that I have taken into my protection;) If you do, when they cry to
me, I will certainly hear them: for I am merciful: and I will slay you with
the sword, so that your wives shall be widows, and your children Orphans.

Psalm. 59. 5.
Awake, o Lord, to visit, says the Psalmist; Et ne sis misericors, and be not
merciful to those that transgress maliciously. A strange kind of prayer,
that the Spirit of God should entreat him not to be merciful, who cannot be
but most merciful, being mercy it self. But we must know, that even (...)

this also, it is a point of mercy, to be merciless to unmerciful men.

How can he be a good man, said one, that is alike mild to good and bad? So

whosoever denies it to others, debarreth himself of it. Iam. 2. 13.
For there shall be judgment without mercy, to those that do not show mercy.

In a word: God, if he be Pater (...)* 2 Cor. 1. 3. (...) de suo, (...) de
nostro. Tertull. con^r. Mar^.
naturally merciful, as he is mercy it self; then as he loves mercy in man;
( Mica. 7. 1^.
mercy pleases him, says the Prophet:) so he hates unmercifulness toward
man: and therefore cannot but do justice in the behalf of those that are
cruelly and unmercifully dealt with.

So that whether we regard the prayer of Gods Spirit, which cannot but
prevail; or the wrongs of the oppressed that cry aloud in Gods ears; or the
nature of God, who is justice it self, and Habb: 1. 12.
can endure no iniquity, is mercy it self, and must needs then Psalm. 5. 6.
(...) ^. 16* 19.
abhor cruelty: it cannot be but that at length he must arise and redress
all such abuses, though for a while he may seem to sit still and forbear.

The Use whereof concerns either the oppressed, or their Oppressors.

The oppressed it teaches patience. For is there a God, that will Psalm. 146. 7.
do them right that endure wrong. Then Iam. 5. 7, 8.
be patient, my brethren, and wait the Lords coming: be patient, I say, and
quiet your minds: for the coming of the Lord draws near.

Eccles. 5. 7.
If thou see in a Country the poor oppressed, and judgment and justice
perverted* Sicut. 1 P^t. 4. 12.
wonder not at it, says Solomon. No? why who would not wonder, might some say,
to see iniquity set, where justice ought to be seated? yea but be not utterly
dismaide yet in that regard; but remember, that There is one higher then the
highest of them that regards it; and there be Mysteriu^ Triad^s Iun. ad
Angelos refer^ Cart^r.
those that be higher then they. Eccles. 3. 17.
He, when time shall be, will judge both the just and the wicked, by righting
the one, by revenging the other.

Cartwr. in Eccles.
As a man therefore that is ouerswaied with might and strong hand against right
in some one Court, yet is not out of hope nor out of heart, so long as he has
liberty to appeal to some higher Court, so be it he be sure of the equity and
sincerity, of the uprightness and integrity of the party whom he is to make
his appeal unto. So those that are here oppressed, are not therefore to be
discouraged, if at man's hand they can have no help here: they may make their
appeal to God, and they are sure to prevail with him according to the equity
of their cause: for he is one with whom Job. 34. 19.
there is no respect of persons, 2 Chronicles. 19. 7.
nor accepting of bribes, one who as he will not be corrupted, so Galat. 6. 7.
he cannot be deluded: And he (that Psalm. 9. 18, 19.
the poor may not always be forgotten, nor the hope of the oppressed perish
for ever;) Act. 17. 31.
has set down a certain day, wherein he will without fail and without
further delay, if not before, hear every man's cause, and right every man's
wrong, and do justice upon every wrongdoer.

As in this world then, howsoever some rebellious persons are by martial law

And as one therefore that either has been robbed himself, or that has had
his friend murdered, if he have the party apprehended and laid up fast in
prison, is not presently out of patience, because he sees him not instantly
executed, but is well content quietly to expect the time of Assise, though it
be half a year after, as long as he is sure that then he shall have justice
against him. So ought we not presently to grow impatient, if we see not
justice done instantly, so soon as our ouer-hasty hearts shall require it,
upon those that we suppose have wronged us, but rest content to stay Gods
leisure, and to expect his universal day of Assise, when we shall be sure
without fail to have justice done us according to that which the equity of
our cause shall require: Remembering withal, that all wicked ones are the mean
while (...). Plut. de vindict. divin. Et mundus carcer est, and corpus carcer

selves we may, that Idoneus patienti^ sequester est Deus, quicquid apud eum

whatsoever loss or damage we shall thereby sustain, God will then

And for Oppressors and Wrong-doers, let them take heed how they deceive
themselves, in hoping to go hand* smooth away with it for ever, because they
can for the present carry matters so cunningly, delude or corrupt Judge and
Jury, and make all so sure, that no writ of error can be had, nor reversement
of judgment, none to call them or those they corrupt to account here. There is
yet an other and an higher Tribunal, whereat they and those that they wrong
must appear one day together, Romans 2. 2, 6, 11. Ierem. 17. 9, 10.
where they shall not be able to delude or to bribe Judge or Jury, or to
procure an unjust sentence. Yea Quotidie ille scit, quis hic sibi quaerat
malum: Qui hic litem adipisci postulant periu^io; Mali res falsas qui impetrant
apud iudicem: Iterum ille eam rem iudica^a^ iudicat; Matore multa multat, qua^

where their former sentence and judgment wretchedly purchased by them, and
wrongfully passed for them, shall be ripped up, and sifted, and reversed again

Neither let them fondly and vainly suppose, that because it is not done
instantly, therefore it will never be. (...). Vise Plut. de sera numinis

Seldom, says the Heathen man, is it, but that the divine vengeance
ouertaketh wicked wretches, though it seem but limpingly to pursue them.
Seldom it is here, but that in some one kind or other it catches them and
meets with them there, where they look not for it; but elsewhere it is
certain never to miss of them, whether it meet with them here or no.
Remember Ahabs doom and Iezabels. They thought they had made all sure, when
false witnesses suborned, and the Judges corrupted, a wrong judgment was
procured, and poor Naboth not condemned only but executed. But what does
Elias from God tell Ahab? 1 King. 21. 9, 23. 2 King. 9. 36, 37.
In that very place where the Dogs licked Naboths blood, shall dogs likewise
lick thy blood. And, The Dogs shall eat Iezabell under the walls of Izreel:
And Iezabels carcass shall lie like dung on the ground in the fields of Izreel;
so that none shall be able to say, This is Iesabell. And no less evil, if not
the same, shall befall all those that take the courses that they did; Psalm: 76.
9.
When God shall stand up, as he will one day, to judge, and to right all those
that are now wronged and oppressed.

And it wants not his emphasis, that the Psalmist says, Iudica terram, Judge
the earth: not, Iudica istos, Judge these men; but Iudica terram ipsam, Judge
the earth, or the Land it self: as he said before, Verse. 5.
Terrae ipsius statumina dimoventur; the very props and shores of the whole
State are shaken. For when corruptions are crept into place of judicature, they
become the sins of the Land, of the State.

When private men do wrong, the sin is their own, it is their personal
offense, and they must answer it with their heads. But when private men's abuses
and enormities are borne with or bolstred out by authority, are not duly
redressed and condignely punished by those that be in authority, when either
justice is denied to those that be wronged, or injustice is done them by those
that should do them right, then the offense becomes public, even the sin
of the whole State: And makes God enter into judgment not Esai: 3. 13.
cum senioribus populi and principibus eius, With the Elders of his people and
their Princes alone; but cum terra vniuersa, with the whole Land, with the
state in general. Ierem: 5. 28, 29.
They execute no judgment, neither for fatherless nor poor. And what
follows thereupon? And should not I then visit my self? says the Lord:
should not my very soul be a venged on such a nation? not on them alone, but
on the Nation it self. And, Mica* 3. 9, 10, 11, 12.
Hear this, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and ye Princes of the house of
Israel: ye that abhor judgment, and pervert justice, and judge for gifts,
and give sentence for bribes: Therefore, Vestri causa, for your sake shall Sion
be made a ploughed field, and Jerusalem a wast heap, and the Temple a wild
forest.

Whence learn ye how to avert and prevent general judgments. 1 Cor: 11. 31.
Si vosipsi iudicaretis, non iudicaremini: If you would judge your selves,
says the Apostle, you should not be judged: so here, Si iudicaretis, non
iudicaremur: If you that be in place of judicature would judge, you might save
God a labor, neither you nor we should be judged. Amos: 5. 15.
The surest course that can be to strengthen a state, and to keep the
judgments of God out from a Country or Kingdom, is by the due and diligent
administration and execution of justice, and by keeping out corruptions in
places of judicature.

Ierem. 22. 1. 6.
Go to the Kings house, says God to Jeremy, and say; Hear the word of the
Lord, o King, that sit on David's throne, thou and thy servants. Thus says
the Lord, Execute ye judgment and justice, and rescue the oppressed from the
hand of the Oppressor: and vex not the stranger, nor the fatherless, nor the
Widow: nor do any violence; nor shed any innocent blood. For if you do this,
there shall a succession of Kings sitting upon David's throne enter in at these
gates, and ride in charets and on horses, both they and their Followers. But if
you do otherwise; I swear by my self. Jurat vobis, per quem iuratis.
Cassiod. variar. l. 8. ep. 3.
He swears to you, by whom you swear. And, h happy you for whose sake he
vouchsafes to swear, if you regard b O beats nos quorum causa Deus jurat! o

what he swears, most unhappy, if you neither fear, nor believe him, when
he swears. But what is it that so solemnly he swears by himself? That
this house, (the Kings palace) shall be laid wast, and the whole City (of
Jerusalem) made a wild wilderness. For I will bring in those upon you, that
shall utterly destroy either. And surely, if by justice and judgment Prou: 25.

Were such a question propounded to many severally, it is likely, as the common
saying and the usual manner is, that many men would be of many minds, that
some would say one sort, and some other again name another sort.

Some it may be would point at the promiscuous multitude of idle Varlets that
swarm about the skirts and suburbs of this City especially, Vulgus cuiusque
motus novi cupidu^. Tacit hist. l. 1. Seditiosum, atque discordiosum, cupidu^
novarum verum. Salust. Iugurth.
ready to make head and do mischeife, if opportunity were offered. Others
such notorious and enormious Transgressors, as by walowing in such beastly and
abominable filth, as either Leuit. 18. 27, 21.
caused the Land of Canaan to spew out her Inhabitants, or Genes. 19. 24, 25.
Iud. 7.
drew down fire and brimstone on Sodom and Gomorrha from heaven. And it is
not unlikely but that our Popish Priests and Jesuits would not undeservedly
have the most honest-minded men's voices, whom yet we suffer too freely to lie
and lodge like aspes and Vipers in the bosom and bowels of our State.

But I would say, and I shall make good what I say by Gods word, that there may
be (to let pass the former) much more dangerous enemies to us then these.
(...). Malum iudicium causa est c^iusvis mali. Iamblychus apud Sto^* tom. 2. ^.
44.
Corrupt Rulers, unjust Judges, Oppressors of Gods Saints and Servants, and
Perverters of judgment and justice are more dangerous to Crown and State, I
say not then idle Vagrants, or then Whore-masters and Adulterers, or then
Thieves and Murderers; (and yet the more duly and diligently justice is
executed, the fewer there will be of all such sorts;) but even then popish
Traitors and Conspirators, even the very worst of them, then the very Inventors
and Contrivers of the Powder Plot it self.

The one use the might and malice but of man, or of the Devil at most, against
us; which God is able to courb and restrain, to rule and overruled at his
pleasure. Whereas (...), (...). Hesiod. oper.
the other encense and bring in the wrath of God on us, which no created power
is able to avert or avoid. Ierem. 21. 12.
Execute justice and judgment, says God, and deliver the Oppressed out of the
hand of the Oppressor: least my wrath break out like fire, and so burn that
none can quench it for the wickedness of your works.

The sins of private Offenders bring wrath upon themselves: But the wincking
at them or partaking with them in those whose place and calling is to punish
them, makes them the sins of the State; and so draws down the wrath of
God upon the whole land: it is Mica. 3. 12.
Vestri causa, For them that Sion is ploughed, and Jerusalem sacked, and the
whole Land dispeopled and destroyed. It is their not doing of justice or their
doing of injustice, that enforces God to arise and judge the whole State.

But what is the reason, why God should so take to heart the poor peoples
oppressions as to stand up and judge himself in this sort? For all people,
says the Psalmist, are thine inheritance They are all Psalm. 28. 9.
thy people, Psalm. 2. 8.
thy possession, Psalm. 74. 2.
thy portion, Psalm. 74. 9.
thy poor; and therefore their cause it is in some respect Psalm. 74, 21, 22.
thine.

God has a special right to them, a special interest in them, (...)
in all nations, in all people, as well in poor as in rich, as well in low and
obscure as in high and honorable, as well in people as in Prince, as well in
Subject as in Sovereign.

He has interest in the one as well as the other;

1. Iure creationis, By right of creation: He has made the one as well as the
other. Prou. 22. 2.
The poor and the rich (...) together, says Solomon; God is the maker of them
both. Job. 31. 15.
He that made me, says Job, made my servant too. And, Job. 14. 15.
He loves, says the same Job* the work of his own hands. Job. 34. 19.
Neither does he accept the person of Princes, or regard the rich rather the^
the poor; says Elihu: because they be all alike the work of his hands.

2. Iure redemptionis, by right of redemption. He has redeemed the one as well
as the other. Galat. 3. 26, 27, 28.
You are all alike the sons of God by faith in Christ; as many of you as
being baptized into Christ, have solemnly put on Christ: And there is no
difference of Jew or Greek, bond or free, rich or poor, male or female, but
ye all are one in Christ. Yea, 1 Cor. 1. 25, 26.
You see, brethren, your calling, ^ow that there are not many wise ones after
the flesh, nor many great ones in the world, nor many rich ones neither, among
you, But Iam. 2. 5.
God has chosen a many mean and despised ones in the world, to be rich in
grace, and heirs of his kingdom. The very poorest souls ransom cost Christ
as dear a price as the redeeming of the richest did: and the meanest true
Christian has as good, and as great a portion in Christ, as the mightiest
Monarke in the world either has or can have.

3. Iure protectionis, By right of preservation and protection. He preserves
the one as well as the other; he provides for the one as well as for the
other; he protecteth the one as well as the other.

He preserves and vpholdeth the one as well as the other. For Job. 12. 9, 10.
as his hand has made them all: so the soul, or the life, of every living
creature is in his hand; and the brea^h of all mankind. And be we high or
low, rich or poor, Act. 17. 28.
We all live and mo^e and have our being in and by him.

He provides for the one as well as the other. His providence extends it
self unto either. As Act. 17. 26.
he made all men of one blood to dwell on the face of the whole earth: so has
he bounded out to each one his place of abode: and Act. 17. 25.
he gives as life and breath and being, so all things else too, unto all. As
(...). Aristip. apud Laert.
he sometime answered the beggarly Philosopher asking him whence he had all his
store: (...). Pindar. Is^hns. ode 5.
The poor man has his pitance from no other hand, then the rich man has his
world of wealth. It is the same God Psalm. 65. 9. and 68. 10.
that provides as well for the Pesant, as for the Prince.

He protecteth the one as well as the other. Yea he has undertaken more
specially to protect as Psalm. 18. 50.
Princes, so (...). Menand. apud Stob. to^. 2. cap. 93. Pauperes (...). Psalm.
74. 19.
poor ones. As Princes though they protect all their Subjects in general, yet
are wont to vouch safe more special protection in some cases to some sorts: so
God the Protector of all in general, has yet more specially taken into his
protection the poor, the Widow, the Fatherless, the friendlesse, the helples.
Psalm. 10. 14.
The poor, says the Psalmist, commits his cause unto thee: for thou (...)
the Helper of the Fatherless. And, Psalm. 9 9.
The Lord is a refuge for the poor; or, as our Meeter well has it, the poor
man's Protector. And, Psalm 68. 5.
He is the Father of the fatherless, and the Widows Judge, even God in his
holy habitation.

And therefore as he gives Judges his Deputies a special charge of such.
Verse. 3. 4.
Defend the poor, and the fatherless; see that the afflicted and needy have
justice: deliver the poor and the needy; rescue them out of wicked men's hands.
So to all others he gives a caueate concerning them, to take heed how they
wrong them: Exodus 22. 22. Z chapter 7. 10.
Vex ye not any widow, or poor fatherless child. And where ought is done
contrary to * Malac. 3. 5.
this his inhibition, he takes special notice of it, and threatens in severe
manner to avenge it. Psalm. 10. 14.
Thou see it, says the Psalmist, and viewest oppression and wrong, to take
the matter into thine hands. And, Exodus 22. 22, 23.
If you vex or oppress any such, says God, and they call or cry to me, I
will not fail to hear them: But I will draw near unto you to judgment; and
I will be a swiftwitnesse (there shall need no further proof nor pleading, I
hear and see all my self, I see your wrong, and hear their cries) against
those that vex and oppress such; and fear not me: says the Lord of hoastes.

I might add a fourth right, Ius glorificationis, Of glorification, He has
purposed and promised to glorify as well the one as the other. For Luke 12.
32. Iam. 2. 5.
he has chosen the poor as to grace, so to glory, to be heirs of his
Kingdom. Luke 6. 20.
Blessed be you, poor ones (so be you be Math. 5. 3.
poor in Spirit as well as poor in purse) says our Savior: for yours is the
Kingdom of heaven. And as Augustine well reasons in an other case, Quidat
regnu^, non ^abit ^iaticu^. Aug. de verb. Dom.
He that will give them a Crown, will he deny them a crum? So, he that Apoc.
1. 6. and 3. 21. 1 Cor 6. 2, 3.
will make them Kings and Judges, will he not much more do them justice?

To conclude: as he reasoned sometime for the body and the resurrection of it;
Quam De^ manibus suis ad imaginem sui struxit, quam de suo afflatu ad
viv^citatis suae similitudinem animauit, quam incolatui, fructui, dominatui
totius suae operationis praepesuit, quam sacramentis suis discipl^nisque
vestivit, cuius munditias amat, castigationes probat, passiones sibi adpreciat;
haeccine non resurget, toti^ns Dei? Absit vt Deus manuum suarum operam, ingenij
sui cura^, adflatus sui vagina^, moli^ionis suae regina^, liberalitatis suae
haeredem, religionis suae sacerdote^, testimonij sui militem, Christi sui
sorore^ in ater^ destituat interitu^. Tertul. deresurr. carn.
the body that God himself at first fashioned, that he quickened, that he
adorned and advanced, that he protecteth and preserves, that he has redeemed
by his Son, that he has sealed with his Sacraments, whose purity he
desires, whose chastity he delights in, whose discipline he approves,
whose patience he prizeth; how can he suffer it to perish utterly, that is so
many ways his? So may we reason for the poor oppressed and Gods righting of
their wrongs: Those that God has created, and that in his own image, has
redeemed with a price of inestimable worth, does in fatherly manner daily
preserve and provide for, has taken more specially into his protection, is
purposed to make one day Romans 8. 17. Apoc. 21. 7.
coheires with his Christ; how can he choose but do them justice, and right
all their wrongs, that are in so special manner so many ways his?

That which may serve, briefly to admonish, as all others, so those especially
that be in place of authority and judicature, to take heed how they contemn or
wrong their poor brethren in regard of their poverty and penury, and mean
estate in the world; or how in favor of any great one, that oppresses or
opposes them, they either deny or delay to do them right. Since the poor are
part of Gods portion as well as the richest, as the greatest, and may have as
good part in God as they.

Say of the poor man therefore that appears before thee, as Job sometime of
his servant: Job. 31. 13.
I may not contemn him, be he never so mean: Job. 31. 15.
The same God that made me, made him too: yea, the same Christ that redeemed
me, redeemed him too: (...), que^ serrum tuu^ vocas, ^x (...) or^um (...),
e^de^ (...) cae^o, aeque spir^re, aeque vivere, aeque mori. Sen. ep. 47.
He is made of the same mould that I my self am: he ^eareth the same image of
God that I my self do. And, He that either Prou. 14. 31.
oppresses or Prou. 17. 5.
reproacheth the poor, he wrongeth his Maker: he that oppresses or
reproacheth him, he wrongeth his Redeemer.

Yea he that oppresses or reproacheth him wrongeth his Protector: (It is a
wrong to the Prince for any man to meddle with those whom he has undertaken
to protect:) who will not suffer such wrong therefore to go unrevenged; it were
against his own honor. Prou 23. 10, 11.
Remove not the ancient bound, says Solomon, nor encroach upon the fields of
the Fatherless: For their Redeemer is mighty; (though they be feeble
themselves) and he will maintain their cause against thee. And again, Prou.
2^. 22, 33.
Rob not the poor, because he is poor; neither oppress the afflicted in
judgment: For the Lord himself will plead their cause; and he will spoil the
soul of such as spoil them.

If one hane business before you, be he himself never so mean, that has the
Princes protection, or that belongs to some Great-man, my Lord Duke, or my
Lord Marquess, how charily will you be sure to carry your selves in his cause,
how wary of doing him the least injustice that may be? You make full account to
hear of it again, if you do otherwise. But every poor oppressed one that
repaireth to you for relief and redress of his wrongs, that resorteth to your
seats, as to Gods Sanctuary, for succor, he is a Sanctuary man, he is one
that belongs unto God, God has special interest in him, he has undertaken
the protection of him. And how careful, yea how fearful should you be then
of doing the least wrong or injustice unto any, that he owneth and that he has
promised to protect?

Assure your selves, if you do, you shall hear of it with a witness, Psalm.
76. 9.
When God shall arise to judge the carth, and to right the wrongs of all his
oppressed ones. At what time you shall find our Saviors words to be true,
which I shall shut and seal up all withal: Math. 18. 6.
Better it were for you, that a ^il-stone were hanged about your necks, and
that you were so drowned in the deepest Ocean, then that you should, in your
places especially, do the least wrong to the least of those little ones; whose
wrongs God neither will nor can suffer to pass unrevenged, because they are
part of his inheritance. (***)
