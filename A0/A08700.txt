Forasmuch therefore as We plainly perceive, many good Orders and Rules

Item That no Persons which sells Wine within this University, from
henceforth shall set Abroach any kind of Wine to be sold, before the
Chancellor or his Deputy, or other officer appointed for that purpose have
tasted, tried, and allowed the same to be good and vendible, or shall after
such taste thereof any way embase, blend, or corrupt, under pain of forfeiting,
twenty shillings, for every Vessel of Wine so set Abroach, contrary to this
present Proclamation.

Item That all and singular Vintners, and Winesellers, within this University
and City of Oxon, from time to time, and at all times do sell their Wines in
their several kinds, at such reasonable prizes, as the said Chancellor or his
Deputy, shall prescribe or limit, upon pain by the Statutes of this Realm in
that behalf provided. And farther under the like Pain, that no Person

Measure, and are sealed and allowed by the said Chancellor, or his Deputies,
the Clerks of the Market.

Item That no Butcher, or Butchers, Cook, or Cooks, Chandler, or any other
Person whatsoever inhabiting the University, City, or Suburbs of Oxford,
shall sell their Tallow to any Forreiner, upon pain of forfeiting the Value
thereof.

Item That all manner of Butchers dwelling or inhabiting, out of this
University or City of Oxon, and bringing or causing to be brought, any
Victuals to be sold in this Market, shall also bring their Hides, Fells, and
Tallow, belonging to the said Victuals, so by them brought to be sold, and
shall sell the same, if any will have them at the Prize limited, under pain of
forfeiting for every such offense, six shillings eight pence. And farther that
every such Butcher, who has not his said Hides, Fells, and Tallow, at twelve

adjudged not to have brought them, and so incur the penalty aforesaid.

Item That no Chandler shall sell any Candles, Cotton or Wieke, above such
rates and prizes, as shall be set and limited, from time to time, by the said
Chancellor, Vice Chancellor, or his Deputy, under pain to forfeit for every
such offense, ten shillings.

Item It shall not be lawful for any Person, or Persons whatsoever, to
Traffic, Merchandise, buy or sell by any Weights and Measures within this
University and City of Oxon, or Suburbs of the same, except such Weights and
Measures be found lawful, approved and Sealed by the said Chancellor, his
Deputy, or Deputies, the Clerks of this Market, upon pain of forfeiture for
every such offense, twenty shillings, and all such false Weights and Measures
to be utterly destroyed.

Item That all manner of Persons, that bring any Corn or Grain to the Market,
of this University and City of Oxon to be sold, shall measure the same with
the common Market-Bushels, and Measures, and in the Marketplace, and not with
any other Bushells, or Measures, nor any other where. And whereas We
understand, that diverse of the City of Oxford, inhabiting in, or near the
said Corne-market, have lately of their own will, without any approbation from
Us, or our Vice Chancellor, taken upon them to keep and set forth on
Market-dayes, public Bushells and Measures, for the measuring of Corn and
Grain, and take Tole for the same, without stint or limitation, sometimes a
Pint and half, and sometimes a Quart for the measuring of a Bushel, whereas
the ancient and laudable Due is, but the quantity of a quarter of a Pint at the
most for such Measure: And also that diverse Malsters, Bakers, and Brewers, do
keep in their private houses two Bushells, a bigger wherewith to buy, and a
lesser to sell, whereby the Country people that bring in their Corn and Grain
to the said University, are deterred to furnish the said Market, in regard
that the Measure of Grain, will not hold out fully with the said great
Bushells. We therefore for the future prevention of the said Inconveniences,
and for the better government of the said Market, that there be no fraud
used, do by these Presents, straightly prohibit the Inhabitants of the
University and City of Oxon, and all others resorting to that Market, from
keeping and setting forth any public Bushel, or any other Measure, or to
receive any Tole or profit for the same: And also all Malsters, Bakers, and
Brewers, from keeping in their houses, any more then one lawful and sealed
Bushel, by which they shall sell, as well as buy.

Item That to provide a sufficient and convenient remedy for the premises. We
have by our Letters Pattents under our Seal, appointed Christopher Divall
Inhabitant within the said University, to look unto the cleansing, and sweet
keeping the Corne-market-place, and to provide a competent and sufficient
number of Bushells, and other Measures, to be approved and Sealed by us, or our
Deputies the Clerks of the Market, to measure the Corn and Grain brought to
the said Market, and to take and receive the just and due Tole for the same,
Viz: a Quarter of a Pint for every Bushel and not above: And We will and
require, that no Buyer or Seller, or Inhabitant within the University or
City of Oxon, not exempt from paying of Tole, do hinder, deny, or molest,
Him the said Christopher Divall, in the due and lawful execution of the said
office, and taking the said Tole under penalty to be punished, as contemners
of the Privileges and Liberties of this University, and the government of the
same.

Item It shall not be lawful for any Hucster, living and inhabiting within the
University or City of Oxon, and Suburbs of the same, or any other Person
whatsoever under color of buying, keeping or making provision for any College
or Hall of this University, or for any other Person whatsoever Privileged or
not, or under any other pretense to buy, obtain, or get into his hands or
possession in this Market, or within four Miles thereof, any Piggs, Geese,
Capons, Hens, Chickens, Conies, Fish, Butter, Cheese, Eggs, or other Victual
whatsoever, to sell the same again in this Market, or within four Miles
thereof, or to dispose of the same otherwise then for his own use and
spending. And because Hucsters have proved the Baine of the Market, and their
cunning devises by any former Rules and Orders heretofore published, have not
been sufficiently met withal: We do therefore hereby straightly Prohibit,
all and every Hucster aforesaid, from bringing or placing their Wares,
Victuals, and Provisions, though bought without the four Miles before
mentioned, to be sold in the common Marketplace, Viz: upon or near CARFOX, or
Penny-loes-bench, but that they keep and contain themselves for the uttering
their said Wares and Provisions in one proper place, to be appointed and
assigned from time to time, by us or our Deputies, which place for the present
We appoint and assign, to be under the West-wall of Christ-church, between
the great Gate thereof and CARFOX, only so far as that Wall reaches. And in
case any Hucster aforesaid, shall presume to place his said Wares and
Provisions, or put the same to sale elsewhere, then in the place formerly
appointed and assigned, ( Viz:) under Christ-church-wall, or shall otherwise
break or violate any part, or clause of this Article; for every time so
offending, he shall incur the penalties of the Statutes of this Realm in
that behalf provided, and be farther proceeded against as a Contemner of the
Liberties and Privileges of this University, and the Government of the same.

Item Whereas the greedy, and over hasty coveting of Victuals in the Buyer,
has been a great means to encourage, and cherish Hucsters, it shall not be
lawful for any Person or Persons whatsoever, to buy of any Hucster any manner
of Provision aforesaid, elsewhere then in the Place formerly appointed and
assigned by Us, nor before the same be brought and placed there openly to be
sold, upon pain of forfeiting for every such said offense, ten shillings,
and farther to be punished for Contempt.

Item That if any Butcher, Baker, Brewer, Poulterer, Cook, Manciple,
Fruiterer, Hucster, or any other Person whatsoever, shall be convinced to
conspire against any Article, Clause, or Branch of this Proclamation, whereby
the same may not be duly executed according to the true meaning thereof, then
every such Conspiratour so convinced, shall be punished according to the Laws
and Statutes of this Realm.

And to the intent that every man to whom it appertains might know his duty,
and not by Ignorance thereof, incur any of the said Penalties, We do
straightly Charge and Command, that no manner of Person whatsoever, do Rent,
Tear, or pluck down, or any way deface this Proclamation, or any Parcel
thereof, but shall suffer it continually to remain in his Place, under Pain
of Imprisonment, and such other punishment, as shall be thought fit to be
executed, upon all and every the transgressour of this Commandment.

GOD SAVE THE KING.
