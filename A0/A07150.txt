An Advertisement to the READER.
GEntle Reader: This Remonstrance is not presented to thy view, to the end to
gain credit to the pretended reasons thereof, but that thou might see under
what colors and disguises they revolt, to hide their own ambitious
Designements, whose end is only to engarboyle the State, and whose counsels
have always been under pretext of public good to obtrude their private
discontents, by casting those aspersions on the State, and the public
Ministers thereof, with which themselves have been chiefly tainted I had
thought to have joined the answer to these reasons, which I shortly expect:
But because I guess that to every indifferent man's understanding, they may
answer themselves by their own insufficiency and nullity, I have adventured
to proceed to publication, before the other party has put in their answer.

Vale and fruere.
AN EXTRACT of the Reasons and Complaynts made by the Queene-Mother of France,
to the KING her Son.
THe Queene-mother is much grieved, and complains, that she being borne a
Princess of one of the most Illustrious houses in Europe, and having had the
honor to be the wife of one of the greatest Kings that ever reigned in France,
and mother to the King at this present reigning; that after she has with many
perils, dangers and cares, during the minority of the King her Son,
preserved and governed the Realm: In recompense of her so great pains, and
motherly affection, she has bin shamefully driven from the Court, and from
the presence and company of the King her Son, and the rest of her children,
and restrained as a prisoner in Blois, with all sorts of indignities, without
any respect of her birth, or of so many great Princes, to whom she has the
honor to be allied; and against the honor due to the memory of the late King
her husband, and of the King her son: and that wholly by the advice and
counsels of Luynes his brethren, and adherents, thereby the more easily,
during the minority of the King, to usurp the authority Royal, and the
management of the State.

The Queen likewise complains, that the parties aforesaid, abusing the youth
and favor of the King, have in such manner continued and proceeded in their
mischievous disseigns, that not contented with the most barbarous cruelty that
may or can be used against the most unworthy and abject person in the world,
they have caused her best and most faithful houshold-Seruants to be separated
from her, and diverse others for her sake to be committed to Prison, without
reason or justice; contrary to the ordinary proceedings of the Realm.

Prohibiting all persons of what estate soever to visit, and frequent or
repair unto her, as if She had been guilty of high treason, with
commandment not to go or walk above a Mile out of the Town of Blois.

And appointed Monsieur de Roissy to watch and have regard to her actions;
suborned her Servants to betray her, sending a number of messengers one after
the other within the space of two and twenty weeks, with a thousand false
promises of procuring her access again unto his Majesty, the rather to mock
her, and to increase the number of her afflictions.

Marrying her Daughter to a strange Prince, without her knowledge or presence,
that her disgrace might be the manifester to all Kings and Princes of
Christendom, and to all the Realm of France. And for the full accomplishment
of all their wickedness and tyranny, caused the King to resolve upon the
confining of the rest of her days in the Castle of Amboise, or some other
place, in their custodies.

Whereof having faithful intelligence, by one of those whom they confidently
trust in their most secret affairs, she was constrained by night to make her
escape, and to retire to the Duke D'Espernon, to make her retrait sure in the
Town of Angoulesme: That being there in safety out of her enemies hands, she
might with more liberty let his Majesty understand the cruel and inhumane
dealings which she received from the persons aboue-named, and to give him
advise of the disorders which such people cause and procure within the Realm;
together with the remedies fit and convenient to stay them.

And to begin with their bad behauiours. It is to be considered what sinister
and arteficiall subtilties they used, to constrain the Court of Parliament to
give sentence against the Marshall D'Ancre, by false accusations, to make a
pray of him; whereof perceiving themselves to be assured, to get more absolute
command, counseled the King to keep the Prince of Conde prisoner, with the
Princess his wife, by whose means and her captivity together, she has lost
three children, for whose imprisonment, the Queene-mother truly confesses, and
protests before God, that she never was more grieved then that by evil
counsel, and false intelligence, she had been induced thereunto, having
since known the truth of his innocence, whereof she will assure the King, and
most humbly beseech him, to set him at liberty, both for the good of this
Realm, and of the said Prince.

The perfidious treasons, practices, and imprisonments of Innocent persons, is
also to be noted, wherewith they served their turns; to get the Prince of
Conde into the custody of Monsieur de Vitry, and Monsieur de Peisan his brother
in law, thereby to have him in their hands. And what boldness is in them, to
make and appoint a new regiment, to keep him more assuredly, and to have the
force and power of arms in their hands? whereunto must be added, the
presumption and boldness by them used, to induce the Princess of Orange to
such an extremity (that to deliver the said Prince her brother) she should
marry Cadenet, to the end, that by the means of so strict a favor and
alliance, they might under the protection thereof (to the great prejudice of
the King) preserve their power and authority?

And further to make their pernicious designs manifest and evident, every man
sees, how they have put from attending on the Kings person, Monsieur de
Breues, a man chosen and appointed by the late King, for his deserts, and one
that worthily discharged his duty in that respect, to put him into the hands
of one of their confident friends, whereof they were formerly glad, and thought
themselves happy to be domestical servants. The Earl of Soissons, for his
part, has not been exempted from being observed, and they have not failed to
have regard to his government, by persons that pry into his actions.

Touching the Princes, Dukes, Peers, and Officers of the Crown, and other
Lords of this Realm, they have been wholly deprived of the intelligence and
government of the affairs of estate, to give the entire management thereof to
Modene, Du Hagent, Coronell D'Othano, and Marsillai, persons altogether
unworthy and incapable of their charges.

The entertainment they have given to the Duke D'Espernon, after his long and
faithful service done to this Crown, sufficiently witness, their insolence,
having proceeded so far, as to make him the Kings prisoner, and after, caused
him to be sent to Metz, under pretense of imaginary affairs of Bohemia; to
procure some credit to be given to their Designs, and to execute the
functions of his charge of Colonel of the Infanterie: Whereunto must be added
the persecutions, which for his sake have been laid upon Marshall de
Roquelance, Monsieur de Tilladet, and la Dimoisselles du Tillet.

Touching the Marshall de Bouillon, the great contempt that has been made of
his quality and power, using him with all sorts of indifferency, sufficiently
shows how they would cause the King to loose the affection of the greatest
personages of the Realm, and those that are able to serve him worthily.

The Duke de Montmorencie, has also experimented and well tried their
impudency, by the effects which they have given to Madame the Constable, his
Mother in law, having taken her from the person of the Queen, to place Madame
Luyne, and their Sister, in her stead, to the end, that no body may have
access to their Majesty's, but by their means. The said Duke de Montmorencie,
in that which concerns his charge and government, having received all sorts
of discontentments, by the bad offices which they have done him about the King.

It is well known, what great perfidiousnesse they have used toward Monsieur
le Grand, for the affairs of the Duke d' Espernon, and of Monsieur de Vitry:
And how that in the great sickness which he had in Paris the last year,
thinking he would have dyed, they had obtained the reuersion of his Offices, by
that means frustrating the merits and deserts of the service of the Baron de
Terms his brother.

Of all the Offices that have been void since the time of their favor with
the King, from the greatest to the least, none have escaped, which they have
not retained for themselves, to be either sold or given to those that are of
their fraternity; and every day do nothing but gape for the death of those
that have good and great Offices, to make their profit of them, to the ruin
and damage of such as for their virtues and services, are justly to be
rewarded and recompensed.

Touching the Kings treasure, they have and boldly do dispose thereof at
their pleasures, without any contradiction, and have drawn it so dry, that
the King and his estate, are thereby greatly indamaged.

Touching the form and dignity royal, to order all things, and to appoint
and ordain all affairs, and times of audience, they only do it, playing the
Kings; proposing, and resolving upon the great affairs of this Realm, without
calling any other thereunto, but those whom they think good; themselves giving
audience in open Counsel unto the greatest persons of the State, after that,
resolving upon them in their Chambers, where every man must attend the
definitions of their wills, upon all sorts of occurrences: Which to attain,
the difficulty to approach and speak unto them, puts many worthy and honest men
that are about the King, clean out of heart.

And that which is most lamentable, while they in this manner effect their
wills, to the great impouerishment of France, they busy the King, by the
means of idle and vaine-fellowes, with Plays and Child-like exercises; things
unworthy the age of so great a King, whose actions ought to serve for an
example to all his subjects.

The assembly of the Nobles made in Roan, under a false pretense, to give
contentment to France, touching the so necessary demands propounded to the
general States, was made only to break the policy, to the ruin of all the
affairs of the Realm: clean contrary to the intents and means that had been
propounded at the assembly of the said State and Nobles, to the end, that they
alone might dispose of the Offices that should be void, not only to draw unto
themselves great sums of money, but also by that means to get creatures of
their own making in all the Towns of this Realm, is a manifest proof, that
they prefer their own particular profit before that of the State, and the
public benefit: Since which time, such a number of Imposts raised by
extraordinary means, have been imposed upon the people, that they are
wholely oppressed.

Wherein the Queene-mother beseeches his Majesty to take order, as also to
stay the course of the tirannies and vexations of Officers, Captains, and
Archers of the gabelles, which they daily exercise upon all his Subjects, and
particularly upon those of the Clergy, and of the Nobility; a thing that
never was used in the time of the King deceased, nor in the regencie of the
said Queen, but only since the time that these men, participating with them
therein, have given liberty and impunitie to all sorts of pillages, confusions,
murders and cruelties.

The sale of Clark-ships so improperly made against the deceased Kings project,
whereby his Majesty has been robbed of more then six millions of Franckes,
to enrich the parties afore-sayd, with the treasure of the Crown, with the
Pensions and money which they have upon all the parts, and Farms of this
Realm, make a great mass of Treasure, which they assemble, to make themselves
redoubted of the State, and by the means of this power, to withstand those that
would oppose themselves against this tyranny.

By all these means afore-sayde, they have made themselves Masters, with
license of the Duke de Mombason, of the Citadell of Amiens, La Fair, Coussy,
Chauny, and of the government of the Isle of France, and Veruveil in Perch,
with the Lieutenancie of Normandy, the more easily to join Quillebeuf,
thereby to hold Paris and Roan in subjection.

And not content to have the Castelles of Amboise and Nantes, upon the River of
Loire, have since sought to draw into their power the government of Britain,
Lieutenancie of the King, Blavet, Coucarraw, with Fougers, which Iosan Modere
holds; to the end to join them all together, and by their authority make
themselves so puissant, that when the King himself would pull them down,
perceiving their too great power, so dangerous to his estate, he should not be
able: And when he should chance to die, (which God forbid) they might divide
the Realm with his successors.

Every man likewise knows, what means they have used, to have that little
which rests, which is the authority of Monsieur de Longeuille in Picardie,
having no obstacle but that, to hinder them from having the rest of the places
in that Province.

Their folly and ignorance, has showed it self in the highest, degree, by
shaking the body of the reformed Religion, by the innovation of the affairs
of Beam, and the failing in the observations of Treaties of Peace made with
them, by the precedent Kings, without considering the consequences, and
foreseeing of the peril that such breaches may procure to this Realm.

Touching foreign businesses, it is a most great shame, that all the
Ambassadors of Kings and Princes throughout Christendom, are to make their
Propositions, and to take their Resolutions from men so impertinent, and of so
base condition; and that the knowledge thereof is taken from the principal
officers of the Crown, and the state of the Land.

From thence it proceeds, that the good intelligence, and strict amity which
has so long time bin contracted between the Crowns of England and France,
has been so badly continued, with so many differences, as if we had no need
of so good and faithful friends. They have in like sort, proceeded with the
States of Holland, causing the King to take Barnavelts part, in his Treasons
against his Country, which are not to be approved by any good Christians,
nor true French men.

The means by them wrought to withdraw the Governor of Orange, from the
obedience which he owes to his Master and Lord, have no less stirred the
courage of that great Captain, whose virtues and affection which he has
always borne to France, deserves not to be dealt withal in such manner,
touching that which concerns his patrimony, contrary to humane right.

To conclude, every man may judge, what misery, desolation, ruin and
calamity, men of so base condition, void of all experience, capacity, and
honesty, may produce and cause in the management of so great a Realm. And
what shame it is to France to endure and suffer such infamy.

In which disorders and abuses the Queene-Mother having most great and notable
interests, to have speedy remedy therein, not only in regard of the extreme
affection that she bears to the King, as his Mother, and the conservation of
his estate, but also because of the great inconveniences that thereby may grow
and ensue; She most humbly beseeches his Majesty, to drive from his presence,
such unworthy and incapable persons, against whose insolency, rapine, and
treasons, all France ought to cry vengeance; and to re-establish all the
Princes, Dukes, Peers, and Officers of the Crown, Lords and Gentlemen, in the
free liberties of their functions, offices and dignities. And to entertain and
retain about his Person, and in his Counsel, men that are virtuous, and
capable to serve the State well and sufficiently; that she may be in surety,
near to his Majesty and her other Children, that she may not have cause of
dislike, that men that have been the causes of her so unworthy entertainment,
should so unjustly be maintained and vpholden, against so many good affections
which they bear unto him, and to his Realm. Which she expects and hops
for at his good inclination, being persuaded that he will not compare the
amity of so dangerous servants to hers, that has had the honor to bring him
into the world.

If not, she protests to employ all those to whom she has the honor to
appertain, with her life, and those that honor the memory of the King
deceased, against the persons aforesaid, to have reason and justice; with
protestation, which she makes before God, and men, not to have any pretense
against his Majesty, whom she holds to be innocent of all the sensible
displeasures which have been done unto her, but only against those that are
the cause of all the mischiefs which she is forced to endure: In this
proceeding having no other end nor intent, but only the increase and
advancement of the greatness and prosperity of his Majesty, and his Realm.

FINIS.
