AN HUMBLE REMONSTRANCE TO THE HIGH COURT OF PARLIAMENT, BY A dutiful Son of
the CHVRCH.

LONDON, Printed by M.F. for Nathaniel Butter in Paul's Churchyard at the pyde
Bull near St. Austins gate. 1640.

AN HVMBLE REMONSTRANCE TO THE HIGH COURT of Parliament.
Most Honorable Lords, And ye the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, of the
Honorable House of Commons;
LEST the world should think the Press had of late forgot to speak any
language other then Libellous, this honest paper has broken through the
throng, and prostrates it self before you: How meanly soever, and unattended,
it presents it self to your view, yet it comes to you on a great errand, as
the faithful Messenger of all the peaceable and right-affected sons of the
Church of England; and in their names, humbly craves a gracious admittance: Had
it regarded the pomp and ostentation of names, it might have gloried in a train
past number; It is but a poor stock that may be counted; Millions of hands (if
that tumultuary, and underhand way of procured subscriptions could have reason
to hope for favor in your eyes) shall at your least Command, give attestation
to that, which this scroll does in their names humbly tender unto you.

Ye are now happily (through Gods blessing) met in a much-longed-for
Parliament; It were but a narrow word to say that the eyes of all us the good
Subjects of the whole Realm are fixed upon your success; Certainly there are
not more eyes in these three interessed Kingdoms, then are now bent upon you;
yea all the neighbor Churches and Kingdoms, if I may not say the whole
Christian world, and, no small part beyond it, look wishly upon your faces, and
with stretched-out necks gaze at the issue of your great Meeting; Neither doubt
we but since Sovereign Authority has for this purpose both summoned, and
actuated you, you will not fail to produce something worthy of so high an
expectation.

Ye are the Sanctuary, whereto now every man flees, whether really, or
pretendedly distressed; Even a Ioab or Adonijah will be also taking hold of
the horns of the Altar: Your noble wisdoms know how to distinguish of men
and actions, and your inviolable justice knows to award each his own.

Many things there are doubtless, which you find worthy of a seasonable
reformation, both in Church and State. Neither can it be otherwise, but that in
a pamperd full body, diseases will grow through rest. Ponds that are seldom
scoured will easily gather mud; metals, rust; and those patients that have
inured themselves to a set course of medicinal evacuations, if they intermit
their springs and falls, fall into feverous distempers; Not, that supreme, and
immediately-subordinate Authority has in the mean time been wanting to its
charge; Surely, unless we would suppose Princes to be Gods, we cannot think
they can know all things: Of necessity they must look with others eyes, and
hear with others ears, and be informed by others tongues, and act by others
hands; and when all is done, even the most regular, and carefullyinquisitive
State is not like the Sun, from whose light and heat nothing is hid.

It cannot be expected that those constellations which attend the Southern
Pole, should take view of our Hemisphere, or intermixe their influences with
those above our heads; Every agent is required, and allowed to work within the
compass of its own activitie: Ye therefore, who by the benefit of your
dispersed habitations, enjoy the advantage of having the whole Kingdom, and
all the corners of it within your eyes, may both clearly see all those
enormities, wherewith any part is infested, (unknown to remoter intelligence)
and can best judge to apply meet remedies thereunto. Neither can it be, but
that those eyes of yours, which have been privately vigilant, within the places
of your several abodes, must needs (not without much regret) in this your
public Meeting, take notice of the miserable disorders of so many vicious and
misaffected persons, as have thrust themselves upon your cognizance.

Whiles the Orthodoxe part in this whole Realm, has (to the praise of their
patience) been quietly silent, as securely conscious of their own right, and
innocence, how many furious and malignant spirits every where have burst forth
into sclanderous Libels, bitter Pasquines, railing Pamphlets? (under which more
Presses then one have groaned) wherein they have endeavored, through the sides
of some misliked persons, to wound that sacred Government, which (by the
joynt-confession of all reformed Divines) derives it self from the times of
the blessed Apostles, without any interruption, (without the contradiction of
any one Congregation in the Christian world) unto this present age; Wherein, as
no doubt their lewd boldness has been extremely offensive to your wisdoms,
and piety, so may it please you to check this daring, and mis-grounded
insolence of these Libellers, and by some speedy Declaration to let the world
know, how much you detest this their malicious, or ignorant presumption; and by
some needful Act to put a present restraint upon the wild and lawless
courses of all their factious combinations abroad, and enterprises of this
kind.

And if you find it pass for one of the maine accusations against some great
persons, now questioned before you, that they endeavored to alter the form of
the established government of the Commonwealth; how can these Pamphleters seem
worthy of but an easy censure, which combine their counsels and practices, for
the changing of the settled form of the government of the Church? Since, if
Antiquity may be the rule, the civil Polity has sometimes varied, the
sacred, never; And if original Authority may carry it; that came from
arbitrary imposers, this, from men inspired, and from them in an unquestionable
clearness derived to us: And if those be branded for Incendiaries, which are
taxed of attempting to introduce new forms of administration, and rules of
Divine worship into our neighbor Church, how shall those boute-feux of ours
escape, that offer to do these offices to our own? the several, and daily
variable projects whereof, are not worthy of your knowledge, or our
confutation; Let me have leave to instance in two, the prime subjects of their
quarrel, and contradiction; Leitourgie, and Episcopacy.

The Liturgy of the Church of England has been hitherto esteemed sacred,
reverently used by holy Martyrs, daily frequented by devout Protestants, as
that, which more then once has been allowed and confirmed by the Edicts of
religious Princes, and by your own Parliamentary Acts; and but lately, being
translated into other Languages, has been entertained abroad, with the great
applause of foreign Divines and Churches; Yet, now, begins to complain of
scorn at home: The Matter is quarrelled by some, the Form by others, the Use of
it by both: That which was never before heard of in the Church of God, whether
Jewish, or Christian, the very prescription of the most holy devotion
offends. Surely, our blessed Savior, and his gracious Forerunner, were so
far from this new Divinity, as that they plainly taught that, which these
men gainsay; a direct form of prayer; and such, as that part of the frame
prescribed by our Savior, was composed of the forms of devotion then formerly
usual; And Gods people ever since Moses his days, constantly practiced it;
and put it over unto the times of the Gospel; under which, whiles it is said
that Peter and John went up to the Temple at the ninth hour of prayer, we know
the prayer wherewith they joined was not of an extemporary, and sudden
conception, but of a regular prescription; the forms whereof are yet extant,
and ready to be produced; And the Evangelical Church, ever since, thought it
could never better improve her peace, and happiness, then in composing those
religious models of invocation and thanksgiving; which they have traduced unto
us: And can ye then with patience think, that any ingenuous Christian should be
so far mis-transported, as to condemn a good prayer, because, as it is in
his heart, so it is in his book too? Far be it from me to dishearten any good
Christian from the use of conceived prayer, in his private devotions; and upon
occasion also, in the public; I would hate to be guilty of pouring so much
water upon the spirit, to which I shall gladly add oil rather; No, let the
full soul freely pour out it self in gracious expressions of its holy
thoughts, into the bosom of the Almighty: Let both the sudden flashes of our
quick ejaculations, and the constant flames of our more fixed conceptions mount
up from the altar of a zealous heart, unto the throne of Grace; and if there be
some stops or solecismes in the fervent utterance of our private wants, these
are so far fro being offensive, that they are the most pleasing music to the
ears of that God, unto whom our prayers come: Let them be broken off with
sobs, and sighs, and incongruities of our delivery, our good God is no
otherwise affected to this imperfect elocution, then an indulgent Parent is to
the clipped, and broken language of his dear child, which is more delightful
to him then any others smooth Oratory; This is not to be opposed in another, by
any man that has found the true operation of this grace in himself: But in
the mean time, let the public forms of the sacred Church-Liturgie have its
due honor; Let this, by the power of your Authority be reinforced, as that
which being selected, out of ancient models, (not Roman, but Christian) and
contrived by the holy Martyrs, and Confessors of the blessed Reformation of
Religion, has received abundant supply of strength, both from the zealous
recommendation of four most religious Princes, and your own most firm and
peremptory establishment; Amongst which powerful inducements, that is worthy
of no slight consideration, which I humbly tender unto you, from the judgment
of the learned King that ever sat upon this Throne, or (as I verily think)
since Solomon's time, upon any other; King James of blessed memory, who (however
mis-alledged by some, as letting fall disgraceful speeches concerning this
subject) after a solemn hearing of those exceptions, which were taken by some
against this open form of Common Prayer, (as it is called in Queen Elizabeth's
Act for uniformity) shuts up in his Proclamation given at Westminster, the
fifth of March, in the first year of his reign, with these words; And last of
all, We admonish all men, that hereafter they shall not expect or attempt any
farther alteration into the Common and public form of Gods service, from
this, which is now established; For that, neither will We give way to any, to
presume, that Our own judgment having determined in a matter of this weight,
shall be swayed to alteration, by the frivolous suggestion of any light spirit;
Neither are We ignorant of the inconveniences that do arise in Government, by
admitting innovation in things once settled by mature deliberation: And how
necessary it is to use constancy in the upholding of the public
determinations of States; for that such is the unquietness, and
unstedfastnesse of some dispositions, affecting every year new forms of
things, as, if they should be followed in their unconstancie, would make all
actions of State, ridiculous and contemptible; whereas the steadfast maintaining
of things, by good advise established, is the weal of all Commonwealths.

Thus, that great Oracle of Wisdom, and Learning, whom I beseech you suppose,
that you still hear directing this prudent and religious advise to your
present ears; and consider how requisite it is for you, out of the reason both
of State, and piety, to rest in that his sound, and exquisite judgment. As
for those particularities of exceptions which have been taken by some at
certain passages of that Book, they have more then once received full
satisfaction, by other pens: Let me only say thus much, That were the Readers
but as charitable, as the Contrivers were religiously devout; those quarrels
had either never been raised, or had soon died, alone: Oh suffer not then, I
beseech you, this holy form of Gods Service, to be exposed to the proud
contempt of ignorant, and illaffected persons; maintain, and bear up the pious
acts of your godly predecessors, yea, make good your own: And if our holy
Martyrs heretofore went to heaven with a Litany in their mouth; Let not an ill
advised newfanglenesse be suffered to put scorn upon that, wherein they thought
themselves happy.

As for that form of Episcopal Government, which has hitherto obtained in
the Church of God, I confess, I am confounded in my self, to hear with what
unjust clamours, it is cried down abroad, by either weak, or factious persons;
of either, or both which, I may well take up that word of our Savior, Father
forgive them, for they know not what they do: Surely, could those look with my
eyes, they would see cause to be thoroughly ashamed of this their injurious
mis-conceit; and should be forced to confess, that never any good cause had
more reason to complain of a wrongful prosecution; Were this Ordinance merely
humane, and ecclesiastical, if there could no more be said for it, but that it
is exceeding ancient, of more then 1500 years standing, and that it has
continued in this Island, since the first plantation of the Gospel, to this
present day, without contradiction: A man would think this were enough plea to
challenge a reverent respect, and an Immunity from all thoughts of alteration;
For, even nature if self teaches us to rise up before the hoare-head; and has
wrought in us a secret honor, even to the very outward gravity of age; and
just policy teaches us, not easily to give way to the change of those things,
which long use, and many Laws have firmly established, as necessary, or
beneficial.

Yea, the wisdom of the ancient Grecians went so far, as to forbid the
removal of a well settled evil; But, if religion teach us better things, and
tell us, that nothing morally evil, can be settled well: and being, however,
settled, had the more need to be (after too long delay) removed; Yet right
reason, and sound experience inform us, that things indifferent, or good,
having been by continuance, and general approbation well rooted in Church, or
State; may not upon light grounds be pulled up: But, this holy calling fetches
its pedigree higher, even from no less, then Apostolical; (and therefore, in
that right, Divine) institution; For, although those things which the Founders
and prime Governors of the Evangelical Church did, as men, went no further
then their own persons, yet, what they did as Apostles, is of an higher and
more sacred consideration; and, if as Apostolic men, they did, upon occasion,
enact some temporary things, which were to die with, or before them, yet, those
things which they ordained for the succeeding administration of the Church
which they should leave behind them, in all essential matters, can be no
otherwise construed, then as exemplary, and perpetual.

Now if to this Text, we shall add the undoubted Commentary of the Apostles
own practices, and to this Commentary, we shall super-adde the unquestionable
gloss of the clear practice of their immediate succeslors, in this
administration, continued in Christ's Church to this very day; what scruple can
remain in any ingenuous heart? but, if any one resolve to continue unsatisfied,
in spite of reason, and all evidence of history, and will wilfully shut his
eyes, with a purpose not to see the light, that man is past my cure, and almost
my pity: The good God of heaven be merciful to such a mis-zealous obstinacy:
Certainly, except all histories, all Authors fail us, nothing can be more
plain then this truth; Out of them, we can, and doc show, on whom the Apostles
of Christ laid their hands, with an acknowledgement and conveyance of Imparity
and Jurisdiction; we show what Bishops so ordained lived in the times of the
Apostles; and succeeded each other, in their several charges, under the eyes
and hands of the then living Apostles; We show who immediately succeeded those
immediate successors, in their several Sees, throughout all the regions of the
Christian Church; and deduce their uninterrupted Line, through all the
following ages, to this present day; And if there can be better evidence under
heaven, for any matter of fact, (and in this cause, matter of fact so derived,
evinceth matter of right) let Episcopacy be for ever abandoned out of Gods
Church; But if these be (as they are) certain and irrefragable; Alas, what
strange fury possesses the minds of ignorant, unstable men, that they should
thus headily desire, and sue to shake off so sacred, and well grounded an
Institution!

But I hear what they say; It is not the office of Episcopacy that displeases,
but the quality: The Apostles Bishops, and ours, were two; Theirs was no other
then a parochial Pastor, a preaching Presbyter without inequality, without
any rule over his brethren; Ours claims an eminent superiority, whether in a
distinct order, or degree; and a power of Ordination, Jurisdiction, unknown to
the Primitive times. Alas, alas, how good people may be abused by
misinformation! Hear, I beseech you, the words of truth and confidence; If our
Bishops challenge any other spiritual power, then was by Apostolic Authority
delegated unto, and required of Timothy, and Titus, and the Angels of the seven
Asian Churches, (some whereof are known to us by name) let them be disclaimed
as usurpers; and if we do not show, out of the genuine and undeniable writings
of those holy men, which lived both in the times of the Apostles and some
years after them, and conversed with them, as their blessed fellow laborers,
a clear and received distinction, both of the names and offices of the
Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons, as three distinct subordinate Callings, in
Gods Church, with an evident specification of the duty and charge belonging to
each of them; Let this claimed Hierarchy, be for ever hooted out of the Church:
And if the bounty of religious Princes have thought meet to grace this sacred
function, with some accession of titles, and maintenance; far be it from us to
think, that the substance and essential parts of that Calling is ought
impaired, or altered, by such gracious munificence; And, although (as the world
goes) these honors cannot balance the contempt of those eminent places; and
that portion (which is now made hereditary to the Church) cannot, in the most
of these dignities, (after all deductions) boast of any superfluity, yet (such
as they are) if any man have so little grace, and power of selfe-government, as
to be puffed up with pride, or transported to an immoderation in the use of
these adventitious favors; the sin is personal, the calling free; which may
be, and is managed by others, with all humble sociablenesse, hospital
frugality, conscionable improvement of all means and opportunities to the good
of Gods Church.

I may not yet dissemble, that, whiles we plead the divine right of Episcopacy,
a double scandal is taken, by men, otherwise not unjudicious, and cast upon us
from the usual suggestions of some late Pamphleters; The one, that we have
deserted our former Tenet, not without the great prejudice of Sovereignty; for,
whereas we were wont to acknowledge the deriving of our Tenure, as in fee, from
the beneficent hand of Kings, and Princes; now as either proudly, or
ungratefully casting off that just dependence, and beholdingness, we stand
upon the claim of our Episcopacy, from a divine Original; The other, that,
whiles we labor to defend the Divine right of our Episcopacy, we seem to cast
a dangerous imputation upon those Reformed Churches, which want that
Government; Both which, must be shortly cleared.

The former had never been found worth objecting, if men had wisely learned to
consider, how little incompatiblenesse there is in this case, of Gods Act, and
the Kings; both of them have their proper object, and extent: The office is
from God; the place, and station, and power, wherein that office is exercised,
is from the King; it is the King that gives the Bishopric, it is God that
makes the Bishop; Where was it ever heard of, that a Sovereign Prince claimed
the power of ordaining a Pastor in the Church? this is derived from none, but
spiritual hands: On the other side, who but Princes can take upon them, to
have power to erect, and dispose of Episcopal Sees, within their own
Dominions? It is with a King, and a Bishop, as with the Patron, and the
Incumbent: The Patron gives the Benefice to his Clerk, but pretends not to give
him Orders, That this man is a Minister, he has from his Diocesan; that he is
Beneficed, he has from his Patron; Whiles he acknowledges his Orders from the
Reverend hands of his Bishop, does he derogate ought from the bounty of a
Patrons free presentation? No otherwise is it with Episcopacy; which thankfully
professes to hold at once from God and the King; Its calling, of God, its place
and exercise of Jurisdiction, of the King: And, if it be objected, that both
some former, and Modern Divines, both abroad* and at home, borrowing S. Ieromes
phrase, have held the superiority of Bishops over Presbyters, to be grounded
rather upon the custom of the Church, then any appointment of Christ, I must
answer; First, that we cannot prescribe to other men's thoughts; when all is
said, men will take liberty, (and who can hinder it?) to abound in their own
sense: But secondly, if they shall grant (as they shall be forced) that this
custom was of the Church Apostolical, and had its rise, with the knowledge,
approbation, practice of those inspired Legates of Christ, and was from their
very hands recommended to the then present, and subsequent Church, for
continuance; there is no such great dissonance in the opinions, as may be
worthy of a quarrel.

The second, is intended to raise envy against us, as the uncharitable
censurers, and condemners of those Reformed Churches abroad, which differ from
our Government: Wherein, we do justly complain of a sclanderous aspersion cast
upon us; We love and honor those Sister-Churches, as the dear Spouse of
Christ; we bless God for them; and we do heartily wish unto them that
happiness in the partnership of our administration, which, I doubt not, but
they do no less heartily wish unto themselves.

Good words, you will perhaps say, but what is all this fair complement, if
our act condemn them, if our very Tenet exclude them? for, if Episcopacy stand
by Divine right, what becomes of those Churches that want it? Malice and
ignorance are met together in this unjust aggravation: First, our position is
only affirmative; implying the justifiablenesse, and holiness of an
Episcopal calling, without any further implication: Next, when we speak of
Divine right, we mean not an express Law of God, requiring it upon the
absolute necessity of the being of a Church (what hindrances soever may
interpose) but a Divine institution, warranting it where it is, and requiring
it where it may be had; Every Church therefore, which is capable of this form
of Government, both may, and ought to affect it, as that, which is, with so
much Authority derived from the Apostles, to the whole body of the Church upon
earth; but, those particular Churches, to whom this power and faculty is
denied, lose nothing of the true essence of a Church, though they miss
something of their glory and perfection, whereof they are barred, by the
necessity of their condition; Neither are liable to any more imputation, in
their credit, and esteem, then an honest, frugall, officious Tenant, who,
notwithstanding the profer of all obsequious services, is tied to the
limitations and terms of an hard Landlord. But so much we have reason to know,
of the judgment of the neighbor Churches, and their famous Divines, that, if
they might hope to live so long, as to see a full freedom of option tendered
unto them, by Sovereign Authority, with all suitable conditions, they would
most gladly embrace this our form of Government; which differs little from
their own, save, in the perpetuity of their ((...), or) Moderator-ship, and
the exclusion of that Lay-Presbyterie, which never, till this age, had footing
in the Christian Church.

to the incomparable Lord Primate of Ireland, does zealously applaud, and
congratulate unto us, the happy, and (as he conceives) flourishing estate of
our Church, under this Government, magnifying the graces of God in the Bishops
thereof, and shuts up with fervent prayers to God for the continuance of the
Authority of the Prelates of these Churches. Oh then, whiles Geneva it self
praises our Government, and God for it, and prays for the happy perpetuation
of it, let it not be suffered, that any ignorant or spightfull Sectaries,
should openly in their Libels curse it, and maliciously brand it, with the
terms of Unlawful, and Antichristian: Your wisdoms cannot but have found
abundant reason to hate, and scorn this base and unreasonable suggestion; which
would necessarily infer, that not Christ, but Antichrist, has had the full
sway of all Gods Church upon earth, for these whole sixteen hundred years; A
blasphemy which any Christian heart must needs abhor; And who that ever has
looked into either Books, or men, knows not, that the religious Bishops of all
times, are, and have been they, which have strongly held up the Kingdom of
Christ, and the sincere truth of the Gospel, against all the wicked
machinations of Satan, and his Antichrist? And even amongst our own, how many
of the Reverend, and Learned Fathers of the Church, now living, have spent
their spirits, and worn out their lives in the powerful opposition of that
Man of sin. Consider then I beseech you, what a shameful injustice it is, in
these bold sclanderers, to cast upon these zealously-religious Prelates, famous
for their works (against Rome) in foreign parts, the guilt of that, which
they have so meritoriously and convincingly opposed. If this most just defense
may satisfy them, I shall for their sakes rejoice; But, if they shall either
with the wilfully-deafe Adder stop their ears, or against the light of their
own consciences, (out of private respects) bear up a known error of
uncharitableness, this very paper shall one day be an evidence against them,
before the dreadful Tribunal of the Almighty.

What should I urge in some others, the careful, peaceable, painful,
conscionable managing of their charges, to the great glory of God, and comfort
of his faithful people? And, if whiles these challenge a due respect from all
wellminded Christians, some others hear ill, (how deservedly, God knows, and
will in due time manifest) yet, why should an holy calling suffer? why should
the faults (if such be) of some, diffuse their blame to all? Far, far we know
is this, from the approved integrity of your noble Justice, whiles in the mean
time, (unless your just check do seasonably remedy it) the impetuous and
undistinguishing vulgar are ready so to involve all, as to make innocence it
self a sin; and (which I am amazed to think of) dare say, and write, The better
man, the worse Bishop.

And now, since I am fallen upon this sad subject, give me leave I beseech you,
to profess, with how bleeding an heart, I hear of the manifold scandals of
some of the inferior Clergy, presented to your view, from all parts; It is the
misery, and shame of this Church, if they be so foul as they are suggested;
but, if I durst presume so far, I should, in the bowels of Christ, beseech
you, (upon the finding of so hateful enormities) to give me leave to put you in
mind, of the charitable example of our religious Constantine, in the like case;
you cannot dislike so gracious a pattern; I plead not for their impunity, let
them (within the sphere of their offense) bear their own sin; But oh, forbid
to have it told in Gath, or published in the streets of Ascalon; Your wisdoms
well see, under what malignant eyes we are, of opposite Spectators; What a
death it is, to think of the sport, and advantage these watchful enemies will
be sure to make of our sins, Et nostris pinguescunt monstra ruinis. Jos. Isc.
and shame? What exprobrations, what triumphs of theirs, will hence ensue?
These, and all other our cares are now securely cast upon your exquisite
prudence, and goodness; The very mention of our fears, whiles ye sit, had
need to crave pardon of presumption; But withal, to take down the insolence of
those envious Insulters, it may please you to give me leave to tell them, that,
however, in so numerous a multitude, there be found some foully vicious, (as
there is no Pomegranate wherein some grains are not rotten, and even in twelve
there is one Judas) yet, upon a just survay, it will be found, that no one
Clergy in the whole Christian world, yields so many eminent Scholars, learned
Preachers, grave, holy, and accomplished Divines, as this Church of England
does at this day; And long, and ever may it thus flourish, as it surely shall
(through Gods blessing) whiles the bountiful encouragements of Learning, and
ingenuous education are happily continued to it; And the more, when those
luxuriant boughs of disorder and debauchednesse, are through just censures
seasonably lopped off.

But stay; Where are we, or what is this we speak of, or to whom? Whiles I
mention the Church of England, as thinking it your honor, and my own, to be
the professed sons of such a Mother, I am now taught a new Divinity, and bidden
to ask, Which Church we mean? My simplicity never thought of any more Churches
of England but one; Now this very dayeswiser discovery tells us of more; There
is a Prelaticall Church (they say) for one; and, which is the other? Surely it
is so young, that as yet, it has no name; except we shall call it
indefinitely, as the Jews were wont to style the creature they could not abide
to mention, That other thing; And what thing shall that be, think we? Let it be
called, if you please, the Church Antiprelaticall; but leave England out of the
style; Let it take a larger denomination, and extend to our friends at
Amsterdam, and elsewhere, and not be confined to our England: Withal, let them
be put in mind, that they must yet think of another subdivision of this
division; some there are (they know) which can be content to admit of an
orderly subordination of several Parishes to Presbyteries, and those again to
Synods; others are all for a Parochial absoluteness, and independence; Yea,
and of these, there will be a division, in semper divisibilia; till they come
to very Atoms: for to which of those scores of separated Congregations, known
to be within and about these walls will they be joined? and how long without a
further scissure? Oh God; where do men stay, when they are once past the true
bounds? But if it be so, that the Prelaticall part must needs make up one
divident member of this English Church; tell me, brethren, I beseech you, what
are the bounders of this Church? what the distinction of the Professors and
Religion? and, if the clients of the Prelacy, and their adherents, (whose
several thousands are punctually calculated) be they who make up this
Prelaticall Church, what grounds of faith, what new Creed do they hold,
different from their neighbors? what Scriptures, what Baptism, what
Eucharist, what Christ, what heaven, what means of salvation other then the
rest? Alas, my brethren, whiles we do fully agree in all these, and all other
Doctrinall and Practical points of religion; why will ye be so uncharitable,
as by these frivolous and causlesse divisions, to rend the seamlesse coat of
Christ? Is it a Title, or a Retinue, or a Ceremony, a garment, or a color, or
an Organ-pipe, that can make us a different Church, whiles we preach and
profess the same saving Truth, whiles we desire (as you profess to do) to
walk conscionably with our God, according to that one rule of the Royal Law of
our Maker; whiles we oppose one and the same common enemy, whiles we unfainedly
endeavor to hold the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace? Oh consider, I
beseech you in the fear of God, consider, whether these be the thoughts of the
sons of peace, and such as are suitable to the charge, and legacy of our dear
Savior, and think seriously from what spirit they proceed; For us, we make no
difference at all (in the right and interest of the Church) betwixt Clergy and
Laity, betwixt the Clergy and Laity of one part, and another; we are all your
true brethren; we are one with you, both in heart and brain; and hope to meet
you in the same heaven; but if ye will needs be otherwise minded, we can but
bewail the Churches misery, and your sin; and shall beseech God to be
merciful to your willing and uncharitable separation. Howsoever, I have freed
my soul before my God, in the conscience of this just expostulation, and
faithful advise.

What remains, but that I pour out my heart in my fervent, and daily prayers
to the Father of all mercies, that it would please him to inspire this Great
Counsel, with all wisdom from above; and crown this great meeting with the
blessing of all happy success, so as it may produce much glory to his own
name, much complacency and contentment to his dear Anointed, comfort to all
good hearts, terror to his enemies, seasonable restraint to all insolence and
faction, prevention of all Innovations; and lastly, a firm peace and settlement
to this Church and Commonwealth, and to all other his Majesty's Dominions?
Which God grant for the sake of the Son of his love, Jesus Christ the
righteous. Amen. Amen.

FINIS.
