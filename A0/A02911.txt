A pore help.

The buklar and defense
Of mother holy kyrke
And weape^ to drive hence
Al ye against here wircke.
Will none in all this land
Step forth and take in hand
These fellows to wtstand
In number like the sand
That with the Gospel melles
And will do nothing else
But tratlinge tales tells
Against our holy prelacie
And holy churches dignity
Saying it is but papistrie
Yea feigned and Hypocrisy
Erroneous and heresye
And takes their authority
Out of the holy euangelie
All customs ceremonial
And rites ecclesiastical
Not grounded on scripture
No longer to endure
And thus ye may be sure
The people they allure
And draw them from your lore
The which will grieve you sore
Take heed I say therefore
Your need was never more
But sens ye be so slack
It greu^th me a lack
To here be hind your back
How they will carpe and crack
And none of you that dare
With one of them compare
Yet some there be that are
So bold to show there ware
And is no priest nor deacon
And yet will fire his be cone
Against such fellows frail
Make out with to the and nail
And hoyste up main sail
And manfully to fight
In holy prelates right
With pen and ynke and paper
And like no trifling Japer
To touch these fellows in deed
And I in deed am he
That wayteth for to se
Who dare so hardy be
To encounter here with me
I stand here in defense
Of sum that be far hence
And can both bliss and sense
And also under take
Right holy things to make
Yea god within a cake
And who so that forsake
His bread shall be dowe bake
I openly profess
The holy blissed mass
Of strength to be no less
Then it was at the first
But I would se who dourst
Set that among the worst
For he should be acurst
With book and bell and candel
And so I would him handel
That he should right well know
How to escape I trow
So hardy on his head
Deprave our holy bread
Orels to prate or patter
Against our holy watter
This is a plain matter
It needs not to flatter
They be such holy things
As has been used with kings
And yet these lewd loselles
That brag upon there Gospelles
At ceremonies' swelles
And at our christined belles
And at your long gowns
And at your shaven crowns
And at your tipettes fine
The Jauelles will repyne
They say ye lead evil lives
With other men's wives
And will none of your own
And so your sede is sown
In other menns ground
True wedlock to confound
Thus do they rail and Rave
Calling every priest knave
That loves mess to say
And after Idel al day
They would not have you play
To drive the time away
But brabble on the bible
Which is but un possible
To be learned in all your life
Yet therein be they rife
Which makes all this strife
And also the paraphrasies
Much differeig from your porteises
They would have daily used
And porteise clean refused
But they shall be accused
That have so far abused
Their tongues against such holiness
And holy churches business
Made hundred years ago
Great clearckes affirms so
And other many mo
That searched to and fro
In scripture for to find
What they might leave behind
For to be kept in mind
Among the people blind
As waueringe as the wind
And wrote thereof such books
That who so on them lokes
Shall find them to be clerks
As proves by their warks
And yet therebe that bark
And say they be but darcke
But hark ye loulars hark
So well we shall you marcke
That if the world shall turn
A sort of you shall burn
Ye durst as well I say
Within this tow years day
As sone to rune a way
As such parts to play
When sum did rule and reygne
And ancient things maintain
Which now be counted vain
And brought into disdain
Such men I say they were
As loved not this gear
And kept you still in fear
To burn or faggottes bear
Then durst ye not be blood
(Against our lerninges old
Or images of gold
Which now be bought and sold
And were the lay man's book
Whereon they ought to look)
One word to speak a miss
Can ye say nay to this?
No no ye foles I wysse
A thing to plain it is.
Then did these clerks deuyne
Daily them selves incline
To prove and to define
That Christ's body above
Which suffered for our love
And died for our behoue
Is in the sacrament
Flesh blood and bone present
And bread and wine a way
As Soon as they shall say
The words of consecracion
In time of celebracion
So must it be in deed
Though it be not in the creed
And yet these fellows new
Will say it is not true
Christ's body for to vewe
With any bodily eye
That do they plain deny
And stifely stand thereby
And enter prise to wright
And also to endight
Books both great and small
Against these fathers al
And heresy it call
That any man should teach
Or to the people preach
Such things without their reach
And some there be that say
That Christ cannot alday
Be kept within a bor
Nor yet set in the stokes
Nor hidden like a fox
Nor presoner under locks
Nor clothed with powdered armine
Nor bredeth stinking vermin
Nor dwells in an house
Nor eatyn of a mouse
Nor moulde or he be spent
Nor yet with fire be brent
Nor can no more be slain
Nor offered up again
Blessed sacrament for thy passion
Here and se our exclamacion
Against these men of new facion
That strive against the holy nacio
And Jest of them in plays
In tauerns and hye ways
And their good acts disprayse
And martirs would them make
That brent were at a stake
And sing pipe meri annot
And play of will not cannot
And as for cannot and will not
Though they speak not of it it skill not
For a noble clarke of late
And worthy in estate
Has played with them chek mate
Their courage to abate
And tells them such a tale
As makes their bonettes vale
And marreth clean the sale.
Of all their whole pastime
And al is done in ryme
Oh, what a man is this
That if he could I wysse
Would mend that is amys
His meaning is in deed
That if he might well speed
And bear some rule again
It should be to their pain
I think they were but worthy
Because they be so sturdy
To rail against the wircke
Of our mother holy kyrke
Yet some there be in fume
And prowdly do presume
Unto this learned man
To answer and they can
And wene they had the grace
His balad to deface
And trow ye that will be?
Nay nay believe ye me
I take my mark amys
If once he did not mys
A very narowe his
Well if you come again
May happen twelve men
Shall do as they did then
Have you forgote the bar
That ever there you war
And stood to make and mar
By god and by the country
You had a narowe entrey
Take heed of coram nobis
We will reken with vobis
If you come again
We will know who pulled the hen
For all your bold courage
You may pay for the potage
And are you now so brag
You may come to lagge
Your hap may be to wagge
Upon a wodden nagge
Or else a fayer fire
May hap to be your hier
Take heed lest you tyer
And lie down in the myer
Hold fast by the mane
By the mass it is no game
If my Lord ware not lame
You will all be tame
When you here him next
Marcke well his text
He has been curstly vexed
I fere me he be wext
A popistant stout
Surely all the rout
That here is him shall doubt
He wylbe in and out
Prowlynge round about
To get forth the snowt
If prayer may do good
All the whole brood
Skuruy, skabbed, and skald
Shaven, shorn, and baule
Pore priests of Baule
We pray for him all
Unto the god of bread
For if he be dead
We may go to bed
Blyndefild and be led
Without rag or shred
But I am sore adred
I se him look so red
Yet I durst ley my head
As docter friar said
He has some what in store
Well you shall know more
Harken well therefore
Some shall pay the skore
He has been a pardoner
And also a garddener
He has been a vitaylar
A Lordly hospitelar
Anoble teacher
And so so a preacher
Though Germin his man
Were hanged what than?
Say worsse and you can
Best let him a lone
For Peter James and John
And Apostelles every one
I give you plain warninge
Had never no such learning
As has this famous clarke
He is learned be beyond the mark
And also master huggarde
Does show him self no fluggard
Nor yet no drunkin drunkarde
But sharpeth up his wit
And frames it so fyt
These yonkers for to hit
And will not them permit
In error still to sit
As it may well apeare
By his clarkely answer
The which initled is
Against what means this
A man of old sort
And writes not in sport
But answers ernestly
Concludynge heresy
And yet as I trow
Some bluster and blood
And crake (as the crow)
But nets will we lay
To cache them if we may
For if I beging
I will bring them in
And feche in my cosyns
By the whole dosens
And call them coram nobis
And teach them dominus vobis
With his et cum spiritutuo
That holy be both duo.
When they be said and song
In holy latin tongue
And solemn belles do ringe
But these babes be to young
Perkyng upon their patins
And feign would have the mattes
And eueninge song also
In English to be do
With marriage and baptising
Burialles and other thing
In vulgar tongue to say and sing
And so they do it newly
In diverse places truly
Saying they do but duly
Maynteinyng it in any wise
So should they do their service
Alas who would not moan
Or rather grount or groan
To se such service gone
Which saved many one
From dedly sin and shame
And many a spote of blame
From purgatory pain
And many shower of rain
Well yet I say again
Some honest men remain
And keep there customs still
And ever more will
Wherefore in deed my read is
To take you to your beads
Al men and women I say
That uses so to pray
That such good priests may
Continue so always
Or eles none other like
But al lies in the dyke
And look ye do not faint
But pray to some good saint
That he may make restraint
Of all these straung facions
And great abonamacions
Because I may not tarry
I pray to sweet Sir Harry
A man that will not vary
And one that is no sculker
But kna. knight of the sepulcher
That he may stand fast
And be not over cast
Or eles to be the last
Of al them that do yield
In city town or field
For if he ^ike therein
No doubt he shall not blin
Till he come to eternity
With all his whole fraternite
A men therefore say ye
That his partakers be
Ye get no more of me
Finis.
