The Parliament of Birds.
THis is the parlyament of birds
For hye and low and them amyddes
To ordain a mean how it is best
To keep among them peace and rest
For much noise is on every side
Against the hawk so full of pride
Therefore they shall in bylles bring,
Their complaints to the Egle their king
And by the king in parlyament
Shall be set in lawful Judgment.
The Grype.
The great Grype was the first that spoke,
And said own is own, who can it take.
For thine and mine, make much debate,
With great and small in every estate.
The Cuckoo.
I sing said the Cuckowe ever one song
That the weak takes ever the wrong
For he that has with us most might,
Takes his will, as reason is right.
The Fawcon.
Than answered the Fawcon to that same,
That pleases a Prince, is just and law,
And he that can no song but one,
When he has song, his wit is gone.
The Commons.
Than all the birds that could speak
Said, the Hawk does us great wreake,
Of them so many diverse there be,
That no Foul nor bird may fro them fly.
The hawk
The hawk answered the prating pie
Where is many words the troth goes by
And better it were to seace of language sone
than speak and repent when thou have done.
The sterlyng.
Than said the sterlynge verament
Who says so shall be shent,
No man may now speak of troth,
But his head be broke, and that is routh.
The hawk.
The Hawk swore by his head of graye,
All soothes be not for to say,
It is better some be left by reason
Than troth to be spoken out of season.
The Popyniay.
Than spoke the Popyniay of paradyse,
Who says little he is wise,
For little money is soon spend
And few words are soon amend
The hawk.
The hawk bad for dread of pain
Speak not to much of thy sovereign
For who that will forge tales new,
When he weneth least his tale may he rewe,
The commons.
Than desired all the Birds great and small
to mewe the hawk for good and all
A place alone we would he had
For his counsel to us was never glad.
The Hawk.
The Hawk answered, ye tail, ye fail al wit,
It is no time to mewe hawks yet.
Commons, of hawks can but little skyll,
They shall not rule them as they will.
The Nightyngale.
Anon than sang the Nyghtyngale,
With notes many great and small.
That bird that can well speak, and sing,
Shall be cheryshed with queen and king.
The Hawk,
The Hawk answered with great fury,
The song is naught that is not merry,
And who so no better sing can,
Makes little chere to any man.
The Dove
Than tombled the Dove for her lot,
Folk may be merry and sing not,
And who so has no good voice,
Must make merry with little noise.
The Hawk.
When this reason was forth showed,
Learn (quod the Hawk) or ye be lewed,
For the bird that can not speak nor sing,
Shall to the kytchyn to serve the king.
The Fesaunt.
Than crowed the Fesaunt in the wood,
Domme men he said gets little good,
Wood nor water nor other food,
It fleteth from him as does the floode,
The Hawk said when all is sought,
Great crowers were never ought,
For I swear by my folly,
He is not most wise that is most ioly.
The moore Cock.
Than crowed again the More Cock,
The Hawk brings much thing out of nock,
The Osyll whysteleth and birds black,
He must have a do, that a do does make,
The Hawk.
I must said the Hawk, buy all my belles,
Say for my self, for none will else,
He is not greatly to repreue,
That speaks with his soueraynes leave.
The Byttur.
Than blushed the Byttur in the fenne,
The Cote, the Bobchick, and the water Hen,
The Hawk that does us all this dear,
We would be were soused in the mire.
The Hawk
The Hawk said wysshers want will,
Whether they speak loud or still,
When all this done was said and lafte,
Every man must live by his craft.
The Malarde.
Than creked the Malarde and the Goose,
They may best fly that are lose,
He is well that is at large,
That needs not the Kings great charge.
The hawk.
The hawk said, though they fly lose,
they must obey they may not chose
Who has a master or a make,
He is tied by the stake.
The Heron.
Than creeped the Heron and the Crane
Great trouble make wits lame
He is well aduysed that can bear him low,
And suffer every wind to over blow.
The hawk.
The hawk said, who can blow to please,
Long necks done great ease,
For the commons that has no rest
Means not ever with the best.
The Patryche, Quayle and Lark.
The Patryche Quayle and Lark in field
Said, her may not avail but spear and sheld
the hawk with us makes great battle.
In every country, where he may avail.
The hawk.
The hawk said who so wilfully will fight
May make him wrong soon of right
Law is best I understand,
To right all in every land.
The Rodyn and the Wren.
Than chydde the Robyn and the Wren,
And all small birds that bear pen,
Against the hawk the commons must arise
And help them self in their best wise.
The hawk.
The Hawk made the Wrenne his answer
Small power may little dear.
And who will live in rest louge.
May not be besy with his tongue.
The commons.
Than prayed all the common house.
That some might the hawk souse.
For foul nor bird by water nor land,
He will leave a live, and he might stand.
In his nest may none abide
In country where he does glyde.
Their feathers he plucketh many a fold,
And leaves them naked in full great cold.
We think therefore by reason good.
To distroy the Hawk and all his blood.
The King and his Lords.
The King and his lords answered anon,
States may not the hawk forgone.
Nor by no law his kind destroy.
Nor deem him self for to dye.
Nor put him to none other distress.
But keep him in a pair of Iesse.
That he fly not to no bird about,
Except his keeper let him out.
The Cornysh dawe.
Than said the Cornyssh daw.
Little money little law.
For here is naught else with friend nor foe,
But go bet penny go bet go.
The Hawk.
Thou Cornysshe quod the Hawk by thy will
Say well, or hold thee still,
Thou have hard of many a man,
A tongue breaks bone, and it self has none
The King.
Then answered the king, and the birds a row
Why comes not to the parliament the Crow
For good counsel refourmeth every mysse,
And it betokens where it is.
The Hawk.
The Hawk said it is not less,
Counsel is good in war and peace,
But the Crow has no brain,
For to give counsel but of the rain,
The Night Wale.
Than said the night whale with his head gay,
He shameth us with his parliament array,
It is a term with John and Jack,
Broken sleue, draws arm a back.
The Hawk.
The Hawk said he shall thryue fullate,
that looks to keep a great estate,
And can not with all his wisdom,
Get him self an hole gown,
The Pecoke and the Swanne.
Than said the Pecoke and the Swanne,
Who no good has, no good can,
And little is his wit let by,
That has not to bear out company.
The Hawk.
The Hawk said he is worse than wood,
That makes him fresh with other men's good,
Or ought will borowe and never pay,
Or with wrong gets gallant array.
The Specke.
Than in his hole said the Specke,
I would the hawk brake his neck.
Or brought unto some myscheuous dale,
For of every bird he tells a tale.
The Hawk.
The Hawk said though thy castle be in ye tree
Build not above thy degree,
For who so heweth over hye,
The chippes will fall in his eye.
The King.
Then said the King it is our intent,
To amend the Crows raiment,
And all the Birds said anon,
Of each of our feathers be shall have one.
The Hawk
The Hawk said he may sone come to honest^*
That every man helps in his post,
For as teaches us the learned clerk
Many hands makes light work.
The Tytyffer.
I say said the Tytyfer we kentysshe men,
We may not give the Crow a pen,
For with them that are sober and good,
A bird in hand is worth two in the wood,
The Hawk.
The Hawk said I take me to my creed,
Who so will spend with you he may speed,
Little ye give but ye wot why,
Ye make the blind eat many a slye.
The Crow.
Than the Crow was put in his array,
I am not now as I was yesterdaye.
I am able without offense,
To speak in the Kings presence.
The Hawk
The Hawk said to the commons by dene,
Envy and pride would feign be seen,
He is worthy none audience to have,
That can not say but knave knave.
The Commons.
Than asked the birds by aduysement,
Who is that takes to us no tent,
He presumes before us all to fly,
To the Kings high majesty.
The Hawk.
The Hawk answered to the white seamew
It is the sorry black Crow,
And for him fares no man the better,
Let him crow therefore never the greater.
The Lords.
Than said the Lords euerychone,
We will ask of the King abone,
That every bird shall resume,
Again his fether and his plume.
And make the crow again a knave.
For he that naught has naught shall have,
The Hawk.
Than said the Hawk as some said,
Borrowed ware will home again,
And who will harken what every man doose
May go help to shoo the goose.
The Cormoraunt.
For the Crow spoke the Cormoraunt,
And of his rule made great auaunt,
Such worship is reason that every man have
As the Kings highness vouchsaue.
The Hawk.
It is so the said the hawk that thou do say
When all turns to sport and play,
Thou may lest speak for the crows pelf
For all thing loves that is like it self.
The hole parlyment.
Than prayed the hole parlyament,
To the King with one assent,
That every bird her fether might,
Take from that proud knight.
The King.
The king said ye shall leave have,
A knight should never come of a knave,
All thing will show fro whence it come.
Where is his place and his home.
The Hawk.
Now trewly said the Hawk than,
It is a great comfort to all men,
Or the Kings great prosperity,
When the King rules well his communalty
Than was plucked from the Crow anon,
All his feathers by one and by one,
And lef^e a^l bi^cke in ^eede of red,
And called him a page of the first head.
The Hawk.
Quod the Hawk the Crow is now as he should be
A ^^nde knave in his degree,
And he that weneth no bird is him like,
When his feathers are pluked he may him go pike
The Commons.
T^an made the Commons great noise,
And asked of the Lords with one voice,
That they would the hawk exyle,
Out of this land many a mile,
Never to come again hither,
But the king sent to him thither,
Him to trust we have no theson,
For it is proved in trust is treason,
And sithe ye say he shall not dye,
Pluck of his hokes and let him fly,
The Lords.
To that said the Lords we pretend,
This statute and other to amend,
So in this that ye accord,
To put all to our sovereign Lord.
The Commons.
The commons said it is great skyll,
All thing to be at the kings will,
And under the hand of his great might,
By grace the people to seek their right.
The Hawk.
Than said the Hawk now to, now fro,
Thus goes the world in well and woe,
The King.
Than said the King in his majesty,
We will disseuer this great sembly,
He commanded his chauncelere,
The best statutes to read that he might here
Thus the fynall Judgment,
He read of the birds parlyment,
Whether they be White or black
None shall others feathers take,
Nor the Rauyn pluck the Pecokes tail,
To make him fresshe for his avail,
For the Commons feathers want,
For with some they be right skant.
The Iaye.
Thus says the chosen of the Iaye,
That none shall use others array,
For who so mounteth with Egle an hye,
Shall fail feathers when he would fly.
Sapiencia.
Be not gredy glede to gader,
For good fades and fowls fether,
And though thy fether be not gaye,
Have none envy at the Swannes array,
Concludent.
For though an astryche may ease nail,
Wrath will plucked his winge and tail,
And if thou lie in swalowes nest,
Let not ^^oush in thy feathers rest,
Be true as turtyll in thy kind,
For lust will part as feathers in wind,
And he that is a glotonous gull,
Death will soon his feathers pull,
Though (...) be as hasty as a wype,
And the feathers ^^^ght ripe,
Look thy feathers and writing be dene,
What they say and what they mean,
For here is none other thing,
But fowls feathers and writing,
Thus ends the birds parlyment,
By their kings commandment.
