Of holy poverty. The first chaptre.
Dives and pauper obui aueru^t sibi: vtriusque operator est dn^s Prouerbi.
xxii. These ben the words of Solomon this much to say i^ englissh The rich
and the pore met to themself / the lord is worcher of euireither This text
worshipfulle Bid expowneth thus. A rich man is not to be worshipped for this
cause only that he is rich / ne a poor man is to be dispysed. because of his
pouertye. but the werk of god is to be worshippyd in them both / for they
both been made to the image. and to the lyknesse of god. And as it is written.
Sapiencie.vii. ca. One manner of entering into this world / and a like manner of
out we^dyng fro this wrechid world is to all men both rich and pore: For
both rich and pore comen i^to this world nakyd and pore / weeping and
weilynge / and both they wenden hens nakyd and pore with much pain
Nathelesse the rich and the pore in their lyuynges in this world in many
things been full unlike For the rich man abou^deth in tresoure gold and silver
/ and other richesses He has honors great and erthly delices / where the pore
creature lives in great penury. and for wantyng of richesses suffers cold
and hunger / and is often in dispyte.

Pauper. I that am a pore caytyf simple and little set by. biholdynge the
prosperity of them that been rich. and the disese that I suffer and other pore
men like unto me am many a time steryd to grutche. and to be weary of my life.
But thanne re^nen to my mind the words of Solomon before rehersyd / how the
lord made as well the pore as the rich. And thereto Job witnessith / that no
thing in earth is made withouten cause. Job v. Thanne I suppose within my self
/ that by the preuy domes of god that be to me unknown / it is to me
profitable to be pore. For well I wot that god is no nygarde of his gifts.
But as the apostle says. Rom^. viii. To them that been chosen of god all
things worchen to gydre into good. And so sithen I trust through the godenes
of god to be oon of his chosen / I can not deem but that to me it is good to be
pore. Moreouir seint Poule.i. Thy moth.vi. writes in this manner They that
will or desire to be made rich fall into temptacion and into the snare of
the devil. and into many desires unprofitable and noyous For couetise of
richesses more than is bihoueful a man for to have / is rote of al euylles.
Experience accords with this saw of the apostle.

For lesynges / and periuries / falssotelties and gyles and many other
wyckednesses / been as common as the cart weye with such inordinate lovers of
richesse which sins bring them to endless perisshinge / but if they be
wasshen away before the our of death / with great and bitter penance It is an
old proverb He is well at ese yt has enough and can say ho He has enough
holy doctoures sey to whom his temporalle gods be they neuir so few /
suffisen to him and to his / to find them that them nedyth. Well I know that as
poul says in the place before rehearsed and Job says the same Job.i. Nakyd we
come i^to this world we bring no richesse with us. ne none shall we bear
with us / when we shall pass fro this world as is also before seid
Nathelesse whiles we live here we may not utterly cast all temperal gods
awey / wherefore after the i^formacion of this holy man Poule in the same
cheptre / have I belynge and simple liuelode I purpose through gods grace. to
hold me content / and neuyr bisye me to keep to gider abundance of worldly
richesses.


The secounde Cheptre
Dives. Thou art the more fool But it is a common proverb. A foles bolte is
sone shot Abide and answer and I wol ley an hundryd pound that I shall
preue the by good argumentis that he is but a fool which will not bisye him to
be rich And that thou be not in dout of what richesse I speak / worldly
richesse or gostly. I do the out of doubt I speak of worldly richesse.


Pauper. I will neither strive ne leye wageours. but if it like your benignite /
to ^arpe with me a simple caytyf / I will lowly admyt your comynynge Say what
ye wole.


Dives. God made Adam and ma^kynd lord of erthly things when he said.
Gen^. i. Dominamini piscibus maris etc. Be ye lords he said of the fysshes of
the sea. and of the birds of the air and of all things that live and styre
upon earth. Now to a lord it longith to be rich Sithen than lorshyppe
perteyneth by kind unto man / and so suyngly to be rich / how may thou deny
but yt he is a fool. that wole not besye him to be rich. For who is a more
fool than he that wol not besy him to keep gods ordenau^ce. what can thou
say to this.


Pauper. Lordshyppe is taken in diverse manners There is naturel or kyndely
lordshippe There is also ciuyle or seculer lordship And there is lorshyppe
pretense. Of naturel lordship spekith the scripture that ye allegyd. For god
ordained in the state of i^nocencie man kyndely to have soueraynte ouir bestes
fisshes and birds And this manner of lordshyp ordained by wey of kind may a
just man have without abou^daunce of worldly richesse To seculer or cyuyle
lordshyp. introducte by occasion of sin perteyneth worldly riches / which
manner lordshyp longith to kings / dukes / erlys / and other lower lords / If
I that am a pore wretch should besy me to get such lordshyp / of holy
scripture ne of holy doctors I wot well prisyynge get I none Domini um. or
lordshyp p^tense have tyrauntes and falls oppessoures ouir the people / which
manner of lordship god forbede that euir I desire. Sir if ye mark well this
distinction and this simple short answer ye shall clerly se that your
argument is but feeble and preuyth not me to be a fool because that I besy me
not to be worldly rich.


The iii. chaptre.
Dives. What say thou thanne to this Criste ihesus said thus Beacius est
magis dare quam accipere. act xx. It is he says more blisful to give tha^ to
take But the rich man may betr^ give than may the pore / for he has more
whereof Ergo it is more blisful to be rich. than to be pore But he that wole
not bisye him to have the better part. is a fool Ergo nunc tibi concluditur.
Now thou art co^cludid.


Pauper. That crist says may not be false But ye rich men take full much and
give oftentyme fulle little for the love of god ye take the great and give the
small / ye take much more tha^ takith the pore. And the more that ye take the
harder ye be bounden / and the harder reknyncte ye ninste give / For as says
Gregory. Quanto dona crescunt ta^ to crescunt raciones donorum. The more that
gifts increase. the more increase reknynges of gift / and seint poule says
to the rich man Quid he^s quoth no^ accepisti. what haste thou. yt thou have not
received of god Right naught but sin. So ye rich men been all on the
taking side / and little or the yeuynge side. The poor man takyth but little /
and yeueth fulle much For one penny yeuyn of the poor man is more in gods
sight in case / than twenty pound yeuen of the rich And therefore Criste
says in the gospel Luce. xxi. that the pore wydowe which offryd but ii. mytes
in the temple / that been but one ferthynge / she offryde more than did all men
and wymen yt day / and yet it was fulle great offrynge For as Criste says she
offride all that she had to live by. Other men might have offryd much more
than they did and not have be the worse. And as touching cristes words which
ye allegge. Beacius est dare etc. It is more blisfulle to give thanne to take.
Worshypful Be de says upon the same text. act xx. The lord he says prefer
ryth natt by these words rich men yt give alms / before them that forsake
al thyngis and sue Criste But Criste commendith them most which forsake worldly
richesse and trauayl natheles with their hondes with such little as they may
get justly to help the pore nedy Or ellis it may be understand thus That to
every man be he rich be he pore if he have any thing which he may forbere /
it is better to him with such as he may to help other that been pore and
nedy. than him self to take yeftes of other men. Moreouir sithen the pore
wydowe that offryd but ii. mytes yaf so great a gift. because of her good
will. A man that forsakyth the world / and yeueth away all that he has.
for the love of god / and also forsakith therewith couetyse of having / save
only that him bare nedythe / because that he so dischargyd of worldly
business / may be the more goostly occupied yeueth a fulle great gift / ye so
great a gift that a rich man as he kepith his richesse with couetyse may not
give so much as such a poor man yeueth Ergo sir by your own words such a
poor man is more blyssed. thanne many that been full rich.


The iiii. chaptre.
Dives. If all men were as pore as thou art thou should fare full evil.


Pauper. If all men were as rich as ye been / ye should fare much worse who
should tile your land / hold your ploughe / repe your corn / keep your
bestes / whoo should shape your clothes or sewe them what mylwarde would than
grind your corn / what baker bake your bread / what brewer brewe your ale /
what coke dighte your mete / what smyth or carpenter amend your house / and
other thingis necessary / ye should go sholesse and clothlesse / and goo to
your bed metelesse Al must ye than do alone* If ye had a wif much woe should
she have. And if ye had none ye should be wreche of all wreches There should
no man well do any thing for you. Therefore says saint austyn / quod dives and
pauper sunt duo sibi necessaria. The rich and the pore been ii. things fulle
necessary each to other: And I say moreouir the rich man has more need than
the pore.


Dives. how preuyst thou that.


Pauper. Have a poor man simple lyuelode / simple mete / si^ple drink and other
simple things / and few necessaries to him / it suffiseth to his person and
to his astate He carith not but for him self or for few mo But the rich man
carith for his person for his astate / for his great meyne / for his
worship for his gods He has need of much gold and silver. much meyne /
many vitayles He has need of many mennys help / of servants / of laborers
/ men of craft / of men of law / of great lordshyp without which / he may not
mayntene his state ne his richesse The pore nedith but little of all this. He
that much has much bihoueth And he that less has / less bihoueth The
rich man must give to his friends to have their assistence / and their help
He yeueth his enemies to let their malice And so of much richesses he yeueth
but little to help with his soul. The poor man of little may give little and has
much thank of god So the rich man nedith more and has more need and
myscheif tha^ne has the poor man. For the more that he has / the more him
nedyth / and in more myscheif and in perel he is day and night For as the house
that stondith high on a hylle is in more tempest tha^ne the house in the valy
So men of high dignite and great richesses in high worshippes been in most
dread and most disease And therefore god says to the proud covetous rich man
/ Thou hold the fulriche / thou see that thou haste need of no good / and
thou know not how wreched thou art how myscheuous / how blind pore and
nakyd. Apoc. iii.


The v. chaptre
Dives. Thou magnifiest much poverty


Pauper Cristes words must needs be true. Beati pauperes quoniam vestrum est
regnum celorum Luce. vi. Blessed he says be ye pore men / for youres is the
kingdom of heuyns And in a another place he says thus to the pore / ye that
have have forsake al thies worldly richesses for love of me and have followed me
/ shall sytt on twelve trones at the day of dome / and deem the twelve
kyntedys of israel That is to say all that shall be demyd quycke or deed / And
therefore rich men do ye as Criste bids you in the gospel. Make ye the pore
me^ your friends of the deuelsheue either richesses of wyckednes / that the
pore men may resceiue you into duellynges of endless bliss Either ye must be
pore or beg heuyn of the pore / if ye wole come to heuyn.


Dives. Why clepythe Criste richesse richesses / or a deuelsheue of wyckydnesse


Pauper. For couetyse of richesse makith folk to serve the devil / and bring
them to sin and shrewydnesse


Dives. This is fulle wounderfulle to the rich folk to here.


Pauper. We find mathe^.xix. yt there came a yongma^ to our lord and axed him
what he should do to have the life that euir shall last. Christ aunsweryd.
Serua mandata. Keep commandments. Slay no man / Do no folly by no woman /
Stele not / Bear no false witness / worship fader and mother and love thy
neighbor / as thy self Lord said he / all these have I do / what lackith
me yet Tha^ said Criste. If thou wylt be perfect. go and selle al yt thou
haste and give it to pore folk / and come and follow me But as says the gospel
when he herd these words he went away fulle sorry for he had many
possessiones and much richesses* Thanne Christ said to his disciples / It is
full hard the rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaviness It is more easy
said he a camele to posse bythe nedles iye / tha^ne the rich man to enter the
kyngdodome of heaviness. Thanne his disciples said to Christ Lord who may
thanne be save. Christ aunsweryd and said That as anentes man it is i^possible
/ but to god all thing is possible.


Dives. These words sound fulle hard to mine understanding / and sone may
bring me and such other in despair / I pray the declare me this manner of
speech if thou can.


Pauper. Some expositoures of the words of Christ / say yt in Jerusalem was a
little prive yate which for straytnesse was clepyd the nedyl. When the
cameles came y charged to this yate they might not enter but they did away
their burdeynes and their packys. And so by these words Christ excludyth natt
you rich men from heuyn / But he techyth you how ye may enter the yates of
heuyn. For as he says in the gospel The yate and the weye that ledith to life
and bliss is fulle strayte / and few pass thereby. And so by this nedyl is
understand the enter of heuyns bliss. By the camel chargyd / the rich men
that been chargyd with the richesse of the world / which charge as long as it
is fast upon them / So long they may not enter in to heuyne bliss. For
Criste says in the gospel. Nisi quis renunci auerit omnibus que possidet / no^
potest meus esse discipulus: But a man forsake all that he ^athe / he may not
be my disciple And therefore if thou enter the strait yate of heuyn / thou must
unbind and louse thy charge / of richesse from the / and ley it besides the
under foot. So that thou be lord and master of thy rychesses / and natt
richesses thy master.


The vi. chaptre.
Dives. How should I louse my richesses fro me.


Pauper. As the prophet says Diuicie si afflua^t nolite cor appouere / If
richesse and welthe fall to the / set not thine heart to much thereon. Love
them not to much Be ready to thank god when he sent them the / And as ready
to thank him patiently / if he take them fro the / And sey as Job said. Nudus
egressus sum de vtero matris m^e. Nakyde I came into this world. out of my
moders womb / and nakyd I shall wend hense. Sithen we have taken goods / of
richesses and of wealth of god des hand / why should we natt suffer patiently
woe and disease if he send them to us. God yaue me gods / and god has taken
awey / as god would so is it done / Blessed be gods name. Job. primo. Vnlouse
so thy rychesses from the / that in gods cause thou be redye / to forsake
all that thou haste / rather than thou shuldyste offend thy god. So that for
no winning / ne for no loss / thou woldyste. do any dedly sin. Always be
ready rather to forsake thy gods thanne thy god And on this manner must every
man forsake all that he has if he wol^e Cristes disciple / that is to say he
must with draw his heart and his love from all that he has / so that he
love no thing asmoch as god ne in letting of his love ne of his worship. For
who that wole be sauyd he must be pore in spirit and in will And therefore
says Criste in the gospel Beati pauperes spiritu quo niam ipsorum est regnum
celorum Blessed been they that been pore in spyrite and in will. For theires is
the kingdom of heaviness. All though this exposicion as touching the moralle
sense be fulle true and fair Nathelesse doctor de lira because it has noon
authority of holy scripture / that there was such a yate at Jerusalem / that was
clepyd a nedle / expowneth the words of Christ in a another manner and says
that Criste spekith in that te^te of rich men that set their bliss and their
trust in richesse wherefore this is the menynge of the te^t as lire says As it
is impossible a camele to pass through a nedlys iye So it is impossible a man
that settith his trust and his bliss in richesses / to enter into the Realm
of heuyns. But if he cast from him such in ordinate love and trusting in
richesse. And that thies words of Criste should be thus understood / the same
doctor preuith by Cristes own words in a another place / Mark.x. where our
lord says thus How hard it is yt men trustyng in riches enter into the
Realm of god It is easyer or lighter. yt a camele pass through a nedles iye /
thanne yt a rich man enter into the kingdom of god / that is to say so
trusting in his richesses / inordinatly them loving.


The vii. chaptre.
Dives. I assent to this exposicio^ I was aferd that god had not louyd rich
men:


Pauper. Abraham Isaac and jacob the holy patriarchs were full rich men / and
yet god louyd them fulle well Dauyd / ezechie. and iosye were kings of gods
people / much louyd and prysed of god. Joseph Danyel reulers of realms were of
god chosen Job zachee Joseph of Aramathie were fulle rich men / and now ben
fulle high in bliss. For the rich men be not lackyd in holy wryt for their
richesses / but for her wykyd couetyse and myswylle of richesse And therefore
says seint a^brose st luca^. yt the fault is not in the richesse / but in
them that can not use their richesse in due manner. And therefore says he that
right as riches is letting of virtue to wicked men / so it is helpinge of
virtue to good men Ne pore men be not prysede so much in hole writ for
wauntyng of richesse / ne for myscheif yt they been in / but for their good will
and their love that they have to god / when for his love they forsake
richesse / and put them in pouert and mischief to serve there god the more freely
with out lettynge of worldly couetyse For more shrewys find I none than pore
beggars that have no good that the world has forsake / but they not the world


Dives. Therefore me thinks always that it is better to be rich thanne pore For
pouerte and myscheif draw many a man to robbery / manslaughter and lichery and
other sins many moo And therefore says Solomon Propterinopiam multi
deliquerunt: Ecclesiastes. xxviii.


Pauper Some be pore and nedy by there good will / and some ageynste their
will / And they that be pore against their will / some have patience / and
some have no patience / and they because of myscheif lightly fall in sin.
But neither pouert wilfully taken / for the love of god / ne pouert yt fallith
to man against his will bringith man to sin if he haf patience More ouir I
say that couetyse of richesse is more cause of sin tha^ne is pouert And
therefore says saint Poule that couetyse is rote of al manner wickydnes And the
poor man dare not / ne may not sin ne meyntene his sin / as the rich man
may. For he may sooner be punysshed and chastised tha^ne the rich man Also there
is need of pouert and need of couetise For as Salomo^ says / the covetous man
has neuir enough But for mischief of heart he lesith his soul. And of this
myscheyf and need. spekith Solomon the words yt thou alleggist.


The viii. chaptre
Dives. I here by thy talking thou art a lettryd man / what can thou sey to
the words of Solomon Proverb. xxx. where he prayde thus. Mendicitatem et
diuicias ne de ^eris michi / ne egestate comp^ssus periure^ nomen dei. Lord he
says give me neither great richesse ne beggary yt Ibe not co^streyned by need
to forswere my gods name / and holy church singith and says Diuicias and
paupertates ne dedet m^ Lord says he give me no great richesse ne great pouerte
whereby as me thynkith each man should be besy to flee pouerte beggerye and
myscheif.


Pauper. I pray the be as besy to forsake thy richesse by ensample of Solomon
as thou art to forsake poverty and beggary / For in his prayer in which be
contained mo words thanne thou rehersist / he for soke both richesse and
beggary: But thou doiste as many men done / Thou allegyst the scripture as the
list / and applyest it to thy fantasye / and leuyst behynd what the list
which is ayenste thy fantasye. The hole prayer of Solomon is this /
Mendicitatem et diuicias ne deed ris michi Tribue tantum victui meo necessaria
Ne forte saciatus illiciar ad negandum. et dicam quis est dominus. et egestate
co^pulsus furer et periurem nom^ dei mei. Beggerye he says and riches ne give
thou not to me / give thou only to my lyuelode ne deful things Lest
perauenture / I fulfilled be drawn to deny. and sey who is the lord / And
through need constreyned stele / and forswere the name of my god. After the
exposicion of Bid / and Lyre. in this text. Solomon prays to god that he be
not so filled with richesses / that he for pride and aboundau^ce of worldly
gods foryet his god and endless gods / Also on that other side that vnpacience
of pouert compelle him not to stele / neither to forswere him. In which prayer
he refusith no more poverty / thanne he does abundance. of richesse. But
his prayer in differently biholdith great richesse / and much poverty. Also
sir sauf thy patience / thou rehersist the words of Salomones p^yer with false
englisshe and not conuenyent. For he said not give me neither richesse ne
beggerye. as thou saydest But he said give me richesse and beggary. That is to
say / give me not richesse with nygardshyp and straytnesse of heart and
couetyse / which make the rich man always. to beg and crave. For as I said.
Ecclesiastes. the v. c. the nygard has neuir enough And so by these words he
prays to god that if he give him richesse. that he should give him therewith
largeness of heart / and grace to spend them to gods worship and to have
good of his good by his life. For as he says Ecclesiastes vi. It is a great
myscheyf and a great vanytye that god gives a man richesse. and gods enough
what he wol have And with that he yeueth him no power fornygardship to have
part thereof / But kepith them to the straungere / which shall devour all that
he gettyth. With much care Again this myscheyf and beggary of couetyse. Solomon
made his prayer saying to the lord. give me not richesse and beggerye to
gyder. For such nygarshyp: and beggerye / makith rich men to forsake their
god. So it is understand of beggary and poverty that comes of myscouetyse /
not of poverty and begery that comyth of need and wantynge of good For the
rich man nedith more to beg bodily tha^ne the pore.


Dives. That is false.


Pauper. I preue it. Dauyd ye worthy king said. Ego autem mendicus sum et


pauper: I am said he a beggar and a poor man / where the gloss says thus
Beggynge is to axe thing of a another that he has not of him self / But the
rich man nedythe more tha^ne the pore to axe help of other / as I showed here
before Ergo it nedith him more to beg tha^ne the poor man.


Dives. Although we axe help of other men as us nedith al / yet we pay them
for their trauayl and for their good. And therefore it is no beggary / but a
couenauute making / paynge / byeng and selling.


Pauper. Fulle often ye pay fulle evil. Thou askyste for the love of the penye
/ and a pore nedy man axith for the love of god. Thou profryst men of whom thou
axist bodily help the penny the other need / and god proferyth him self to mede to
them that help pore men.


Dives. Al we be begers gostly as says saint austyne / for we have no good
gostly but of gods gift


Pauper. Ergo we be all beggars bodily / for we haf no good bodily but of
gods gift.


The ix. chaptre.
Dives. Thy speech is skilfulle / but not much plesau^t to many rich folk I
pray the what is thy name.


Pauper Why askyst thou.


Dives. Twenty year a goo I spoke with a man of thyn astate / that was fulle
like the in spech and person But he spoke of so high perfection as thou now
begynnest to do / that unto this day I could neuir ateyn thereto And he told me
the same tale of that young man that thou toldest me now


Pauper. Of which young man


Dives. Of him that asked Criste what he should do to have the bliss with
outen end. To whom Christ. taught him that perfection / that thou spekest of
And yet he did it not no more than I do.


Pauper There is two manner of perfecto^ns of which Criste spoke and taught that
young rich man / There is perfection less. and perfection more The first is
nedeful and sufficient The secou^de is a passing holiness and fulle
excellent. Of the first god says. Perfectus eris ^ine macula. Glo^a.
Criminali. deuteronomy. xviii. Thou shall says he be parfyte without spotte of dedely
sin Of this parfection spoke Christ to that young rich man when he badde him
keep the commandments Of the secounde parf^ction that is so excellent / he
said to him. Si vis perfectus elle. etc. If thou wylt be parfyte go and selle
all that thou haste and give it to the pore folk and come follow me.


Dives* The same tale told me thy brother twenty year ^aste. But we spoke than
most of the high parfection of excellency I pray the let us now speak a
while of the less perfection that is nedefulle to all. For sithen I may not
atteyn to the more parfection. I would as me must / keep and hold well the
less parfection /


Pauper. Do thanne as Criste taught yt young rich man. Serua mandata. Keep
well the commau^deme^tes Have one god in worship Take not his name in ydelnes /
Halowe thine holidaye. Fadre and mother worship and pay Sle no man / Do no
folly by no woman / Look that thou not stele. And no false witness that thou
bear Coueyte thou not thy neighbors good with wrong house ne land Desire
not his wife ne his child / ne his servant ne his be / ne any thing that
to him longith. These ben the.x. commandments which god wrote in two tables
of stone / and took them to Moses / for to teache them to the people. The
three first precepts were written by them self in the first table / For tho
principally teache us how we should worship our god / and love him above al
thing And therefore they ben clepyd the three precepts / of the first table.
The other vii. been clepyd of the secounde table / for they were written in the
secound table And they teache us how we should worship and love our even
christian as our self. And so all the ten commandments been comprehendyd. in
the two precepts of charity.


Dives. Which been tho.


Pauper. The first is that thou shall love thy lord god with al thyn heart with
all thy mind. With all thy might: The secou^de is that thou shall love thy
neighbor as thy self / that is to say. thou shall love him to the same
bliss that thou love to thy self / and do to him as thou would men did to
the / and not do to him but as thou would men did. to the / as long as he
kepith the law of charity For and if he forfete and do ayenste charity / it is
charity to chastise him and punysshe him. till he will amend him / for salvation
of his soul. and ensample of other In these ii. commandments as Christ
says in the gospel / hangith all the law and all the prophecy. And therefore
seint poule says yt love and charity is fulfillyng of all the law.


The x. chaptre.
Dives. me merueylith much why Crist taught more that young rich man the
commaundementis of the secounde table: than of the first / and why he taught
hi^ more how he should love his neighbor. tha^ he should love his god For
neither Criste spoke to him of the first p^cepte of charity / how he should
love his god above al thing / ne how he should have one god in worship. ne how
he should flee perjury / ne yt he should halowe the holidaye And yet without
keeping of these may no man be sauyd.


Pauper. When Crist badde him keep the p^ceptes in general he badde him keep
the x. commandments and the ii p^ceptes of charity / and al gods hestes
and his laws But he specifyed more the p^ceptes of the secou^de table tha^ of
the first / and more the secou^de p^cepte of charity than the first. not yt
he was more bound thereto but for he was more enclyned. because of youth / of
richesses / and of lordship / to forfet against tho p^ceptes than against the
other of the first table For youth is enclyned to wrath / hastynesse.
fightyng / and so to ma^slaughter to lichery / auoutrye / to lyenge / and so to
false witness / to theft / to pride and rebellion / to i^dignacion to dispyte
of his elder / And so in many wise offendith his neighbor and his even
christian And namely when youth is vndersett^ with riches / and is at his own
rule without dread of punysshinge. as that young man was. For he was fulle
rich / and he was a prince leder and ruler of the cuntre. as says Seint
Luke. in his gospelle. And therefore Criste most souerayn leche. not only
taught him how he should live withouten end. but more ouir he warned him to
what seknesse he was most disposed to / whereby he might lose that life and die
withouten end and taught him medicynes against tho seknesses / when he bad him
not sle / do no lichery / no theft. bear no false witness / worship fadre and
modre / and in his reulyng love his neighbor as him self / and do to him as
he would men did to him.


Dives. Why specified not criste to him the ii. last p^ceptes of the secounde
table which be against falls couetise.


Pauper. For young folk be be not so much enclyned to couetise as they be to
other sins


Dives. That is sothe / for couetyse reigns most in old folk And so as men
wexe in age / so encresith there couetise And wha^ al other sins forsake man
for elde and feblenesse / than couetyse is most breme Pride is first i^ youth
/ couetyse last in age Say forth what thou wylt.


Pauper Euirmore thou shall vndrestonde yt there be ii. manner of lives by the
which man may be sauyd The first is co^templatyf / the secounde is actyf. The
first stondith principally in besinesse to know god and gods laws / and to
love him above all thing. The secounde stondith principaly in good deeds and
good reule / and help of our even criste^ The three first p^ceptes of the first
table belongith to all / but principaly to them that been in life contemplatyf
that have forsake the world and worldly business for the love of god. The
vii. p^ceptes of the secounde table also longen to all / but principally to
them that been in life actyf and in business of the world The life contemplatif
is in ease and rest of heart. The life actyf is in doing and trauayl and
business of body and soul And of this life spoke ye young rich man wha^ne he
said. Lord what shall I do. how shall I live to have the life withoute^ end And
crist taught hi^ what good deeds he should do what misdeeds he should fle / if
he would keep well the life actyf Also thou shall understand for this speech of
crist and many such other / that criste i^ the gospel and hole writ by
example of the less preueth and shewith the more As when he says yt men
should be sauyd at the day of dome for they yaue mete to the hungrye. drink to
the thrusty / much more than should there be ^aued yt yaf all that they had or
might have for the love of god. and hem self to serve god night and day. body
and soul / and put them to the death for his love. And they also that feed
mannys soul with bread of gods word And since they shall be dampened yt wole natt
give to pore folk mete and drynk for gods sake / Much more should they be
dampened that rob men of there life and lyuelode. and they that done lechery /
auoutrye / ma^slaughter / robbery / and other orrible sins. And on the same
manner when christ specifyed to that rich man / the precepts of the secounde
table / and the secounde precepte of charity / He shewith that sithen tho were
so necessary to have the life withouten end / Much more the p^ceptes of the
first table and the first p^cept of charity been necessary to all that wole
have the life with outen end.


Dives. Therefore would I feign keep them better thanne I have done. But I se
many doubts therein ye I can not keep them.


Pauper. What doubt haste thou therein.


The first chaptre.
Dives. In the first commandment as I have lernyd / god says thus. Thou
shall have no on other strange gods before me. Thou shalt make to the no
grauyn thing / no mawmet / no likeness that is in heuyn above / ne that is
bynethe in earth / ne of any thing. that is in the water under therth Thou
shalt not worship them with thy body outewarde / ne with thyn heart inward.
Exodi xx.c. So by this me thinks ye god defends making of images and
worshippynge of them / and yet men do make images / these days great plente /
both in church and out of church And all men as me thynk worship images:
And it is fulle hard to me but I do in that as al men done And if I worship
them me thinks I do ydolatrie against gods law.


Pauper. God forbedith not men to make images / For he bad moses make images
of ii. au^gelys / that be clepyd cherubyn. in the lyknesse of two young men /
as we find Exodi. xxxvii.c. And solomon made such and many mo thereto i^ the
temple / to the worship of god. the iii. book of kingis vii.c. And god bad
moses make his tabernacle and all that longith thereto / aftre the example and
the lyknes. yt was shewyde to him upon the hylle / when he was there with god
xl. days and xl. nights. Exodi. xxv. And therefore god forbedith not utterly
the making of images / but he forbedith utterly for to make images for to
worship them as gods / and to set their faith / their trust / their hope
their love / and their bileue in them For god wole have mannys heart hole knytt
to him alone / for in him is al our help and al our salvation And therefore we
must worship him and love him / and trust in him above al thing. and no
thing worship but him or for him. That all the worship that we do to any
creature be do principaly for him. and arectyd to him. For he says. Gliam meam
alteri non dabo / et laudem meam sculptilibus / ysaie xlii. I shall not give my
worship / my bliss / my glory / to none other / ne my prysynge to grauyn
images / ne to painted images

And in the same chaptre he says Shamfully shent mote they be all that set
their trust i^ graven images.


Dives. Whereof serve these images / I would they were brent all /


Pauper. They serve for three. things / For they be ordained to stere ma^nys
mind to think on cristes incarnacion / and on his passion and on his living
/ and on other seintes living Also they ben ordained to styre mannys
affection. and hi^ heart to devotion For often man is more steryd by sight than
be herynge or redynge / Also they be ordained to be a toke^ and a book to the
leude people / that they may read i^ ymagery and painture / that clerks read i^
the book as the law says. de co^secra. distinct.iii. per latu^. Where we
find that a bishop distroied images as thou would do / and forfendyd that
no man should worship images He was accused to the pope saint Gregory which
blamyd him gretely for that he had so distroyed the images / but utterly he
prised him for he forfendyd them to worship images.


The ii. chaptre.
Dives. How should I read in the bo^ke of peynture. and of ymagery.


Pauper. Wha^ne thou see the image of the crucifixe / thynk on him yt died on
the cross for thy sin and thy sake and thank him for his endless charity /
yt he would suffer so much for the Take heed by the image how his head was
crowned with a garlonde of thorns till they went into the brain / and the
blood braste out on every side / for to distroye the high sin of pride /
that shewyth most in ma^nys head and woma^nes and make an end of thy pride
Take heed by the image how his arms were spradde abroad and drawn fulstrayte
upon the tree. till all the veins and the synowes crakyd / And how his hondes
were nalyd to the cross and stremyd out blood / for to distroye the sin
that Adam and Eve. did with their hondes / when they took the apple against
gods forbode / Also he suffryd this to distroye the sin of wicked dedys and
wicked works / that men and wymen do with their hondes / and make an end of
thy wicked werkys Take heed also how his side was opened / and his heart
cloven in two with the sharp spear / and how he shed blood and water / to
show that if he had had more blood i^ his body more he would have yeuen for
mannys love. He shed blood to rau^some of our souls / and war^ to wasshe us
from our si^nes Also he suffride this for to distroye the sin of pride /
couetise envy. hate wrath and malyce^ yt reign in man's heart and woman's

Take heed and make an end of thy pride / of thy false couetise / of hate /
envy wrath and malice / and foryeue thyn even christian / for his love yt
foryaue his death Take heed also by the image / how his feet were nailed to the
cross and stremyd on bode / to distroye the sin of sleuth i^ gods service.
And make an end of sleuthe in gods service / and haste thy fot to gods
house and to gods service / Take heed also by the image how his body was to
re^t and al to torn / with tho sharp scourges yt fro the sole of the foot unto
the top of the head / there was no hole place on his body. and that was to
distroye the sin of lust and likyng of the flesh. glotonye and lichery.
Which regne in mannys body and woman's. and make an end of glotony and lychery.
Take heed how naked and pore he henge upon the cross / for thy sin and thy
sake / and be thou not ashamyd to suffer poverty and myscheif for his love.
And as saint Bernarde byddith take heed by the image how his head is bowed
down to the ready to kiss the and come at one with the / See how his armies and
his hondes been spradde abroad on the tree / in token that he is ready to halse
and clyppe the / and kiss the / and take the to his mercy. Se how his side
was opened. and his heart cloven on two / in token that his heart is always
open to the / ready to love the and to forgive the all trespass / if thou
will amend the and axe mercy / Take heed also how his feet were naylyde fulle
hard to the tree. in token that he will not fle away from the. but abide with the
and dwell with the withoute^ end. On this manner I pray the read thy Book and
fall down to ground / and thank thy god that would do so much for the /
and worship him above al thing not the image / not the stock / stone / ne
tree / but him yt dyed on the tree / for thy sin and thy sake So that thou
knele if thou wylt before the image. not to the image. Do thy worship before the
image not to the image. Make thy prayer before the image. but not to the image.
For it sees the not / herythe the not. understands the not Make thyn
offrynge if thou wylt before the image / but not to thymage Make thy pilgramage
not to the image ne for the image. For it may not help the / but to him and
for him that the image representith to the. For if thou do it for the image /
or to the image thou doste ydolatry.


The iii. chaptre
Dives. Me thynkith that wha^ne men knele before the image pray and look on the
image / with weeping teres / bu^che or knock their brestys / with other such
countynaunce / they do all this to the image / and so wenyth much people.


Pauper. If they do it to the image / they sin greatly in ydolatry against
reasone and kind / Butt as I said before / they may do all this before the
image and not to the image /


Dives. How might they do all this before the image / and not worship the image.


Pauper. Often thou see that the priest in the chirch has his book before him.
he knelyth he stareth* he looks on his book he holdith up his ho^des And for
devotion in case he wepith / and makes devout prayers / To whom wenyste thou
the priest does all this worship /


Dives to god and not to the book.


Pauper. On the same manner should the lewd man use his book that is ymagery
and painture not to worship the image / but god in heuyn and seintes in their
degree And that all the worship that he does before thymage / he does not to
the image / But to him yt the image representith.


Dives. this example is good / but know thou any bettre /


Pauper. When the priest says his mess at the autre / commonly there is an
image before him / and como^ly it is a crucifixe stone / or tree / or portrayed.


Dives. Why more a crucifixe than an other image.


Pauper. For every mess syngyng is a special mind making of cristes passion.
And therefore he has before him a crucifixe to do him have the more fresshe
mind as he owith to have of cristes passion.


Dives. The skylle is good / say forth.


Pauper. Before this image the priest says his mess / and makith the highest
prayers ye holy chirch can deuyse / for salvation of the quycke and of the deed
He holdith up his ho^des / he louteth / he knelyth in case / and all the
worshype that he can do he does Ouirmore he offreth up the highest sacrifyce
and the best offrynge that any heart can deuyse / that is Christ / gods son
of heuyne / under form of bread and wine All this worship does the priest
at the mess before the image / and yet I hope that there is no man ne woman so
lewd / that he would say yt the priest syngith his mess ne makes his prayer
/ ne does yt worship / ne offrith up gods so ne criste him self to the image.


Dives. God forbede that any man or woman should say so or believe. That were
error most of all erroures


Pauper On the same manner. should the lewd man do his worship before the image
Make his prayer before the image and not to the image.


The iiii. chaptre.
Dives. Contra. On good friday ouir al in holy church / men crepe to the
cross and worship the cross.


Pauper. yt is sothe / but not as thou menyst The cross that we crepe to and
worship so highly that time / is criste him self yt died on the cross that day
for our sin and our sake As says Beda libro iii. de gemma anime / For the
shap of a man is a cross. And as he heng upon the rode he was a very cross He
is that cross as all doctoures say / to whom we pray / and say O crux aue
spes vnica Hail be thou cross our only hope / increase thou to the meke her
right wisnesse this passion time. and give pardone to them that been gylty. He
is that cross brighter than all the sterres of the world as holy church
syngeth and says O crux splendidior. cunctis astris mundi / etc. And as Bede
says for asmoche as christ was most despised of mankind on good friday /
therefore holy church has ordained yt on good friday men should do him most
worship. And for this skyl we do yt high worship that day / not to the cross
that the priest holdith in his ho^de / but to him yt dyed for us al ye day upon
the cross For oftym ye cross yt the priest holdith in his hand is fulle
vnthende criste himself / cristes passion / cristes death / cristes living / in
earth fulle of pain and woe / the cross yt he dyed on and every lyknes of the
cross is clepid cristes cross But the lyknesse of a thing o with not to be
in as much reverence / and worship as the thing himself And every lord and
knight has a special token in his arms or else besides his arms whereby he
is known / and often beryth the name of his token / and by the name of his
token his dedys ben told of heraudes and gestours yt know not their name ne
their person. Right so Criste in holy wryt often times is clepyde a cross / for
the cross is his special token And so su^tyme we speak to the cross as to
crist him self Su^tyme we speak of the cross only / yt he henge upon And so we
speak often in holy church service to the cross as to criste him self / and
anon we turn the word only to the cross / yt he died on And so su^tyme we
spe to the cross and of the cross / as to him and of him yt the cross
betokens Sumtyme we speak of the cross only as of his token / and the cross
yt he died upon / and so one word is referred to diverse things And this
bli^dith much folk in their redynge For they wene that all the prayers that
holy chirch makes to the cross / that he makes them to the tree that Criste
died on / or else to the croce. in the church / as in that anteme. O crux
splendidior. And so for lewdness they been deceived / and worship creatures as
god him self.


Dives. On palm su^day at procession the pressed drawith up the veyle before the
rode / and fallith down to ground. With all the people / and says. thries.
Aue rex noster. Hayle be thou our king / and so he worshipeth that image as
king


Pauper. Absit. God forbede. He speaks not to the image / yt the carpenter
has made and the peyntour painted but if the p^ste be a fool For that stock
or stoone was neuir king / but he spekyth to him that dyed on the croce. for
us al / to him that is king of all thing.


The v. chaptre.
Dives. I assente / for this is against skylle and reason and kind / that man
which is nere of kyn to god that is verry man and our brother. should worship
in that manner either stock or stone For they may neither here ne se. ne help
themself And therefore who so worshyppeth images i^ this manner / does great
dishonor to man that is so noble in order of kind / and much more to god
that took mankind. and bicame man / and in our manhood is above all mankind.


Pauper. If the kings son. knelyd to his churl or to his page and worshypyd
him as his sovereign and prayed him of grace. that only the king might grant
and did him the same worship. yt he should do his fader the king it were a
great dishonor both to the son and to the fader. And therefore it is
repreef to gentylles to be ouir homely with boys against good norture. But much
more dishonor. do we to god and to our self also / sithen we be the kings
children of heaven. so nygh of kynne and heirs of the kingdom of heuyn / if we
worship stocks or stones or any other images / or done them any service / as
says the law. De consecrac. di.iii. Venerabiles.


Dives. This is open enoughe that thou say For the image. neither can ne may
help at need For it has no virtue at all It is nothing else but a book or a
toke^ to the leude people as thou saidest first to stire hem to think on god and
on seyntes in heaven / and so to worship god ouir al thing and seyntes in their
degree


Pauper. For this skylle been crosses made by the wey / that when folk
passing se the cross / they should think on him that dyed on the cross. and
worship him above all thing. And for the same skylle is the cross borne
before i^ procession / that all that follow and mete with the cross should
worship him yt dyed on the cross and thank him for his endeles charity. Also
the cross is borne before. in token yt in all our living and all our dedys /
we should haf iye and heart to him that died on the cross. as to our king our
head / our lord / our leder to heaven bliss. And therefore Solomon says. Oculi
sapien^is in capiteeius. The iyen of the wisema^ been always in his head. yt is
Jesus Criste. Which is head of holy church / and of al. christian people.


The vi chaptre
Dives. Sithen ymagerye is but a token and a book of the lewd people / teache me
yet a litel bettre to know this book and to read therein


Pauper. Imagery su^what betokneth in special. su^what in comen and general In
special token the image of our lady is painted with a child in her left arm /
in toke^ yt she is modre of god / and with a lylie or else with a rose in her
right hand / in toke^ yt she is maiden withouten end and flower of all wymen
And so of other seyntes / whose images have diverse signs in their hondes and
other places / for diverse virtues and martirdomes yt tho sei^tes suffrydde and
had in their life

The image of seint petyr is painted with keys in his hond in token yt criste
betoke seint petyr the keys of holy church / and of the kingdom of heuene
But yet afterward / Criste yaue tho keys to all the apostles / as the
gospelles witness. Mt.xviii. and io.xx.c. Saint poule is peynted with a sword
in his hand / i^ toke^ yt he was heded with a swerd for cristes sake / and also
in token / yt su^tyme he pursued holy church with the sword / Saint John / the
euangeliste is peynted with a coupe in his hand / and an edder therein / in
token yt he drank dedly venym / and through the virtue of the cross it lost
his molice. and did him none harm. And i^ his other hand he be^eth a palm.
in token that he was a martyr / and had the palm of martyrdom / all though
he were natt slain for his will was to dye for gods sake Saint John baptist
is peynted in a camelys skin at the peintoures will in token that his
clothyng was fulle hard and sharp / made of camelys ^ere He ^erith a lombe with
a cross in his left hand: and his fyngere of the right hand. there toward /
in token yt he showed gods lo^be gods son yt dyed for us on the cross
when he said to the people. Ecce agnus dei / ecce qui tollit pcta^ mu^di. Se
gods lombe / se him yt does awey the si^nes of the world Saint Kateryne is
peynted with a whele in the one hand / in token of the orrible wheles which the
tyrant maxence. ordained to rent her lith from lithe But the aungel distroyed
them and many thousands of hethen people. And so they did her no harm. She
has a sword in the other hand / in token yt her head was smyten of with a
sword for cristes sake / Saint margarete is painted with a dragon under her feet
/ and with a cross in her hand in token that wha^ne the dragon devoured her /
she blessid her and by the vtue of the cross / the dragon brast and she came
out of him in health and hole And so forth of diverse images of other seyntes /
which images be made to represente to man the virtuous living of seintes / and
the holy ending of their temporal life.


The vii. chaptre.
Dives. What betokneth ymagery in gn^al or common


Pauper. Commonly all the appostles ben peinted bare foot in token of innocence
and of penance Nathelesse they went not always fully barfoote / but su^tyme with
galoches / a sole bineth and a fastnynge above the foot Of which galothes
saint Bid says in his original The au^gel spak to saint Petyr. saying.
Calciate caligas tuas. Do on thy galoches or sandalynes as says saint make in
his gospelle Also the apostles commonly and other seyntes ben peynted with
ma^teles in token of the virtue and poverty which they had For as says saint
Gregorye. Al these worldly gods ben naught else but a clothinge to the body
And a ma^tele is a louse clothyng not fast to the body but louse. and lightly
may be done away Right so the gods of this world were but a mantel to
apostles and other sei^tes. For they were always so louse from their heart yt
they yaf no great tale thereof / nor to lose them. They were not fast ne
cleuyd not to them by no false couetyse / but always they were redye to forsake
all for cristes sake.


Dives. What betokneth the round things peynted on their hedes


Pauper. The blys yt they have withouten end Of which the prophet ysaie*
spekyth Leticia sempiterna super capita eorum. persa: li.c.


Dives. they were not so gay in clothing as they be peynted


Pauper. That is sothe For many of hem were clothed in fulle hard clothyng and
pore / as seint Poule says. Circuierunt in melotis i^ pellibus caprinis
angustiati. They went about in brocke skynnes / in skynnes of get nedy
anguysshed Nathelesse yma. ges stondynge in churches may be considered in ii.
manners / either as they represent the state of sei^tes of whom they be images
/ as they lived in this life / and so they be to be peinted in such manner
clothing as tho seintes used whiles they lived here Or else they may be
consideryd as they rep^se^t the state of enldesse bliss. in which seyntes be
now / and so they be to be peynted ryaly and solemnly / as the cherubynes yt
rep^sentyd the au^gelles yt been in heuene were made of gold Exodi. xxv.
Natheles in all such paynture an honest mean neither to costly because of this
co^sideracion / ne to vile because of the former consideraco^n me thi^keth is
to be kept


The viii. chapt
Dives. Why ben au^gelles peynted i^ liknes of young me^ since they be spirits
and haf no bodies


Pauper. There may no peyntoure peynte a spirit in his kind And therefore to
the bettre representacion they be peyntyd. in the lyknesse of a man / which in
soul is most according to aungellys kind And though the aungel be not
such bodily. as he is peynted. he is nathelesse such gostly / and has such
doing and being spirituel. They be peynted like young men berdlesse / in token
yt they ben endeles and elden not / ne feeble natt / but alwey in one liking /
in one state. alwey mighty and strong / And alsoo they be peinted with crulled
here in token yt their thoughts and there love ben set alwey in right order /
and turn always up again to god / thanking him and worshippynge him in all
thing For by the here of the head in holy wryt been understand thoughts /
and affectiones of the heart. Also they be peynted with towelles about their
necks / in token that they be always ready to serve god and man at gods
bidding And therefore they been clepyd. Administratorii spu^s. Ad hebre. i.c.
That is to say. spirits of service. For they serve to god / in rulynge of
mankind / and governance of this world / They been peynted fetheryd and with
wings / in token of lightness and delyuernesse i^ her works For in a
twynclynge of an iye they may be in heuyn and in earth / here and at rome / and
at jerusalem They be peynted with whelys under their feet i^ token yt they mean
and rule the round bodies. the wheles and the circles / in heuene / and the
course of the planetes / as the philosopher says / and also in token / yt as
the whele turns always about the center. and his mids / so the au^gelles
doing is always about god / and always ben nighe him where euir they be Also
su^tyme they be peynted armed with spear sword and shield / in token yt they
be ready for to defend us fro the fendes yt been besy night and day to lose us
For but if holy au^gellys helped us and defend us and kept us. letting the
fendes malice. We might not withstonde ne be sauyd And therefore right as
every man and woman has a wicked aungel assigned to hi^ by the fend to tempe
him / So has he a good aungel assigned to him of god / to save him if he will
follow his rule.


The ix. chaptre.
Dives. Why ben the iiii. eua^gelistes peynted in such diverse liknes since they
were me^ al iiii.


Pauper For diverse manner of writi^g and teching / matheu is peynted in
lyknesse of a man / For he principaly wrote and taut the ma^hode of Criste and
told. how he bicame man / And most specially and most openly wrote his
genologie Seint John that wrote In principio erat verbn^. is peynted in
lyknesse of an egle which of all fowls flees highest / and in sight is
sharpest. and may se the ferthest / So saint John spoke and wrote higheste of
the godhode / and had more i^sight and understanding in the god head. than
the other eua^gelistes. Seint luke is peynted i^ the lyknesse of a calf or an
ox / because that he spekith most openly of the passion of christ that was of
fryd up to the fadre of heaven / on the altre of the cross on good friday / as
the ox or the calf: was offryd on the altar in the temple. by the law / for
salvation of the people / which offrynge was toknynge of cristes passion And
for that seint luke spekith most openly of cristes passion. Which was
betokned by the sacrifice of the ox Therefore he is painted and presentyd by
the lyknes of an ox. Saint mark is peynted i^ lyknesse of a lion / because
that he spekith most openly of cristes resurrection / how he rose from death
to life / For when the lioness has whelpid they lie deed iii: days and iii.
nights / till on the thridde day / the lion their fader comes and makes an
hidous cry ouir them And anoon with ye voice and cry they quyckne and waken /
and in manner rise from death to live And for this skille is seint mark p^sented
by the liknesse of a lion for he spoke more openly of cristes resurrecto^n And
therefore his gospel is read on ester day Also thou shall understand ye Criste
was god and man / and priest and king Mathewe spoke most openly of his manhood
/ and began at his manhood / and therefore he is painted in the lyknesse of a
man Seint John spoke most of his godhode / and began at his godhode / And
therefore he is painted in the liknes of an egle as I said first Saint luke
spoke most of his presthode / and therefore he is painted in the likeness of
an ox or of a calf / For that was the principalle sacrifice that the prestes
by the old law offryd i^ the temple. Saint mark spoke most of his kingdom /
showing him king of all thing. And therefore he is painted in the lyknesse of
a lion / that is king of unreasonable bestes.


Dives. Why ben they so painted in four ends of the cross


Pauper. In token that he yt died on the cross is king of all thing For the
Egle is king of al fowls The lion is king of all wild bestes unreasonable.

The ox is king of tame bestes / helpli^h to mankind. Man is king of all
bestes and of al visible creatures / that were made for him But criste is king
of al thing visible and vnuysible. And in token thereof the four evangelists
been peynted about him on the cross in diverse lykenes of iiii. diverse
kings i^ kind as four kings herawdes blasynge his arms / and the great
batayl and victory that he did against the fend / for mankind upon the cross
/


Dives. Why be they painted in houses in four parties of the house.


Pauper. For the same skylle and for deuocio^ and for knowlechynge of his high
lordshyp that all we have of hi^ and against tempests and wicked spirytes that
fle the evangelists set i^ manner of a cross / and been ashamede and abashed
of the cross / and specially of Crystes passion. by the which they were all
disconfyt.


The x. chaptre
Dives. Why ben images. hilyd in Lenten from man's sight


Pauper. In token. that while men ben in dedly syn they may not se gods face
/ ne seyntes in heuyn And in tokenynge yt god and all the court of heuyn hyde
their face from man and woman / whiles they be in dedly sin / till the time yt
they wole amend them by sorrow of heart and shryfte and satisfaction.


Dives Why been they more hyd in lente^ than in other time


Pauper^ the time of Lent betokneth the time of Adamys syn / for the which we
lost the sight of gods face / and god and the court of heaven hid their
faces from ma^kynd unto the tym of cristes passion. and in token thereof in lxx.
Wha^ holy church begi^neth to make mind of Adamys sin / he leuyth songs of
myrthe / as Gloria in excelsis. Te deu^. and Alleluya For through the sin of
adam / our joy was turned in sorrow and woe


Dives. I hold it well done to hyde images in Lenton to let men from
ydolatry. Nathelesse images of common offrynge ben seldom hyd in lenton / for
lettyng of lucre.


Pauper. Saint poul says that couetise and namely of prestes is cause of much
ydolatrye. Auaricia est ydolorum seruitus. Coloc. iii.c. For ne were couetise
tho images should be set as little by as other and as sone hiled and hyd


Dives. I suppose yt seintes i^ earth were not arrayed so ^ay with shone of
silver / and with clothes of baudkyn rings and broches and other iewelles as
images be now And su^tyme thou seydest yt by the feet is understand man's
love and his affection / And therefore me thinks that the feet so shode in
silver show that the love and the affection of prestes is much set in gold
and silver / and erthly couetyse For such richesses of clothing of the image
is but a tollyng of more offrynge. and a token to the leude people / where they
should offer and what / for they had liver a broche or a ring of silver or of
gold than a penny or a halfpeny / though the broche or the ring be but of
easy price / And como^ly they shoe none images ne clothe them so richely / but
if they erne first their shone and there clothes / but if it be to toll folk
to offrynge.


Pauper. leave this matter for it is odiouse to the coueitouse prestys yt win
great richesse by such images. And therefore let such words pass at this
time and speak we of su^what else more to purpose.


The xi. chaptre.
Dives. Christ says in the gospelle: Dn^m deu^ tuu^ adorabis. and ei soli
seruies. Mt. iiii.c. Thou shalt worship thy lord god and serve him alone And
it is of the first co^maundment as holy writ shewyth well. Deuteronomy. vi.c. How
might I keep this that I should no thing worship ne serve but god. I must
worship my king / my prelate / my soueraynes. and serve them as mine astate
axith / and do to them my duties homage / and fewtie. and seint Poule says
Per caritate^ seruite i^uicem / Ad gala v c. Serve ye to gyd each man other by
charity: And seint Petyr says: Serui subditi estote. dn^is vri^s / non tantum
bonis et modestis / sed eciam discolis. ye servants be ye subget to your
lords / not only to the good and the meke / but also to tyrauntes. And in the
same place he byddeth us worship all me^ He biddythe us also. dread our god
and worship our king.


Pauper. As clerks say there is ii. manner of service and of worship. One that
longith only to god and to no creature / and is clepyd Latria. on latyne that
is to say divine service and dyuine worship / for it longith only. to god A
another is a service and a worship common / to god and to creature reasonable and
intellectual yt is to say to man woman and au^gel. and it is clepyd Dulia. on
latyne: The first service and worship that is clepyde Latria. dyuyne. service
longith only to god And on this manner service spekyth Criste when he says
tho words Dominum deum tuum. etc. Thou shalt worship thy lord god and serve
him alone with divine service / and dyuyne worship. that is to say. Thou shall
do no Latriam. no divine worship ne divine service to no creature. but only to
god / And therefore who so does any divine service that is clepyd Latria. to any
creature to any image. or any form or figure. he does ydolatry. For ydolum.
on latyne is clepyd a form and an image. on englisshe. And therefore who so
does divine worship that is clepyd Latria. to any image he does ydolatrye.


Dives. What clepist thou propirly latriam. divine worship and service that
longith only to god


Pauper. As says a great clerk Antisidorensis in summa sua. libro tercio.
Latria is a protestacion and knowlechyng of the high majesty of god yt he is
sovereign godenesse. souereyne wisdom / sovereign might. sovereign truth /
souerayn largeness. shaper and sauer of al creatures. and end of every
thing. and all that we have we have of him / and withoute^ him we have right
naught. and naught may have ne do withouten him we. ne none other creatur /
This knowlechynge and protestacion is done on three manners / by heart by speech /
by deed By heart yt we love him as sovereign godenesse. and love him as souerayn
wisdom and souerayn troth yt may not disceyue / ne be disceyued / and hope and
trust i^ him as i^ souereyn might yt may best help at need / and as souerayn
largeness and lord yt best may yield us our mede / and as souerayn savior
most merciful and most ready to forgive us our mysdede By mouth and spech
this knowlechynge and this service is done / when we swear by his name
worshipfully and truly i^ thing of charge. and fle ydel oaths / foul oaths
false oaths / and in our spech do worship to his holy name / and swear not by
creatures / but only by his holy name For he says in the gospelle. Reddes dn^o
iuramenta tua. Thou shall yield thyn oaths to thy lord god and to no creature
Also it is done by vows making For it is not leeful to make a vow to any
creature And therefore he says Reddes dn^o vota tua. Thou shalt yield thine a
vows to thy lord god. and to no creature. And the prophet says / Vouete et
reddite domino deo vestro. Make ye vows / and yield ye your vows to your
lord god not to the ymagis stocks ne stones Also it is done with prayer. and
prisynge of the mouth For we must pray him and pryse him as sovereign might /
sovereign wisdom / sovereign godenesse sovereign treuthe / as all rightfulle
and merciful. as shapper and sauer of all thing / and lord of al and
sovereign help in every need. And on this manner may we not pray ne prise any
creature And therefore they yt make their prayers and there prisinges before the
images / and say their Pater nost. their Aue maria / and other prayers and
prisynges / used como^ly of holy church / or any such other if they do it to
the image / and speak to the image / they do open ydolatrye And they be not
excusyd all if they understand not what they say. For their sight and their
other wits / and their ynner wit also / shewyth well that there owith no such
prayer prysynge ne worship be done to no such images. For they may not here
them / ne se hem / ne help them at need.


The xii. chaptre
ALso this protestacion and knowlechyng is done by deed / as by offrynge / and
sacrifice making which long only to god. For what man offreth or makes
sacrifice / he knoulegith him yeuer of grace. and maker of holiness / savior
and foryeur of sin / and this may no creature do Also it is showed by tokenys
of the body / as by kneling loutyng lyftynge up of hondes / by bunchynge of the
breast / which tokenys may be do both to god and to reasonable creatures / but
otherwise to god than to reasonable creatures. For as says a clerk Ricardus de
media villa super terciu^ sentenci. did. i^ qo^ne vltima wha^ne we knele to
god / in yt we knowledge that we may not sto^de in virtue / in godenesse / ne in
well but only by him / wha^ne we fall al down to ground to god we knowledge
that but he held us and kept us / we should fall al to naught And wha^ne we
hold up our ho^des to him. We knoulege that we may right naught do withouten
him / and that we be al in his power / and that he may do withouten us what he
wole / and so we put us only in his grace Also by that we knoulege. that all that we have of any godenes we take it of his hand / and of his yifte. When
we bunche our breestys / we knowledge us gyltye ayenste him in heart / and in
deed. And that we have done. much sin / which only god knowith For only he
knowyth mannys heart and man's will Also we bunche our self on the breest in
token of sorrow of heart for our mysdedys / and that we repent us sore of our
misdeeds These toknes of reverence be do also to reasonable creatures / as to
au^gel / man and woman / but not in this manner: For when we knele or loute.
or fall down to ground / or hold up our hondes to any creature / we knoulege
that there is some souereinte and some virtue in him that we knele to / wherbye
he may help us. not as principal helper / but as secundary with the help of
god And therefore these dedys of worship and reverence should not be done to
images / stocks / or stones / ne to none such other For they have no such
virtue ne soueraynte above man ne woman. ne right naught may help them at need
/ ne themself neither So that these dedys of reverence pri^cipally ought to be
done to god. secundary to au^gel man or woman / but on no wise to noon other
unreasonable creatures / ne to none such images And as says a great clerk.
Doctor halis in summa sua. To god men should knele with both the knees / in
token that in him is al our principalle help / but to man only with the one
knee. So leave friend ye shall understand that the worship which is clepid
Latria. shall be done only to god. The worship that is clepid Dulia. is common
both to god and man For we should worship man woman and aungel. not for them
self / but principally for god / for that they ben made to gods image For
they be gods servants and gods mynistres. For there is no lord / ne
tyrau^t / ne p^late / man ne woman so wicked but that he seruyth god in some
thing. And all though he be now wicked / we woote neuir how sone he shall
amend him. and be our brother in bliss. as says seint Austyn upon the
sauter But to the fend should we do no worship / for he is dampened withouten
end / and there is no hope of his salvation.

The xiii. chaptre
WE should worship man and woman / for he is made to the lyknesse of god / for
his office / for the worship of god / and dispyse his syn And therefore says
saint petre. Omnes honorate. Worship ye all men and wyme^ Honor inuicem
preuenientes. Be ye besy / who so may every man worship other

Dives. me merueyleth much why men be so ^^sy to do the people worship images


Pauper. Couetyse of men of holy church and lewdness both of them and of
the people ben cause of such ydolatrye.


Dives. I have herd say that many great clerks holden therewith / and say that
men should worship images


Pauper. Worship is a large word and common to divine worship. and service
that is clepyde Latria. and to worshype that is clepyd Dulia. Which longith
propirly to speak only to reasonable creature For as says the philosophre.
quarto ethicorum. Worship is mede of virtue And it owith not to be done to any
creature. but that creature have some godenes of virtue moral / and of grace /
or else some office to lead and bring folk to moralle virtue


Dives. Thanne to the image stock or stone / gold or silver / longith none
such worship For wha^ne it is so sere and dry. and worm eten / it has no
virtue at all / but for to brenne sooner i^ the fire than a grene tree But
when it wext upon the earth. it had virtue to wex and spring and to bring
forth grene leuys and flowers to conforte of mannys iye and fruit. to help of
man and be And yet wole no man worship such grene trees ne p^cious stones
ne erbys all if they haf great virtues and wou^derfulle for they have no
virtue moral. Much more men should not worship sere dry trees / that have
no virtue at all / Say forth what thou will.


Pauper^ Also worship is clepyd veneracion that stondith i^ honest and siker
keeping / honest handlynge / clean dightynge / in stondyng / in sitting / in
place setting And this manner of worship may be done and ought to be done to
every holy thing yt longith to god. and holy church as book chalyce vestment /
belles and images. in asmoche as they be ournamentes of holy church / and the
lewd mennys book. But this worship and veneracio^ is no service ne subjection
of hi^ yt does it to the thing yt he does it to / but it she with subjection /
and service of the things so worshypyd to him that puts it so in worship.
so kepith it and so sauyth it And on this manner the law clepith images
venerable and worshypful / for there should no man dispyse them ne defoul be^.
brenne them ne break them De consecrac. di / iii. Venerabiles. and for this
manner of veneracion. and worship says the law in the same place / and su^me
doctoures / that images book or vestment and chalice / may be worshyped with
Dulia. But they take that dulia. fulle largely / and fulle vnpropirly / For
such worship and veneracion / is no service ne subjection as I said before.
And propirly to speak dulia. is a worship yt longith only to god and to
reasonable creatures / And principally and excellently / to our lady seint
mary. and to the manhood of Criste. Which worship is clepyd. yperdulia:
propirly said Also to the cross that criste dyed upon / if that men had it as
clerks say longith yperdulia For of al things that want life / the cross of
criste owith most to be worshipyd / and be in most veneracion and reverence But
that veneracione is clepid yperdulia. vnpropirly Also friend there is worship
that the subget does to his sovereign / knowlechyng him his sovereign / by
word or by token / as by knelynge loutyng and such other / and this manner
worship is clepyd propirly adoracion Other worship that is clepyd honoracion /
and veneracion is co^uenyent both to the sovereign and to the subget For a
lord honors his servant by yiftes / by promocions in office. in dignity /
Also a lord worshypeth a poor man when he settith him at his own table or
above other that been of higher degree thanne he / and yet adoureth he him not
/ ne does him the worship of adoracion / Nathelesse adoracion is taken su^tyme
fulle vnpropirly / for common honoracion and veneracion / And for asmoche as al
these manners of worship so diverse ben clepid with one name of worship in
englisshe tunge. and often the latyne. of worship is taken and used. vnpropirly
and to commonly. Therefore men fall in much dout and error in redyng and not well
understand what they read


The xiiii. chaptre.
Dives. This distinction. and declaracion of worshypynge how it is taken / and
used in diverse manner / and how it is clepyd with one name in englisse / has
avoided many argugumentes and skylles which I thought to have made ayenste the
/ I am out of doubt. I can answer thereto my self by thy declaracion / But
ii. things as me thinks thou saidest not al truth


Pauper. Which be tho


Dives. Thou seydest that me^ should not offer but only to god

Ne knele on both knees but only to god And we se at iye yt me^ offer to the
pressed i^ the church and knele on both kneis to the p^ste i^ sherifte.


Pauper. Men offer not the preeste but only to god. as I said first by the
ho^des of the p^ste For the priest is gods mynistre ordeynede to resceyue
things yt been offryd to god / as tithes and deuocio^s / and live thereby
honestly and dispende the remena^t to nedy folk / and to worship of god and
help of holy church. Ne men knele not on ye manner / to the p^ste / but to god
before the priest. for the reverence of god and of the sacraments of holy
chirch But when man knelith to temporal lords p^lates or p^stes / or any other
person / for reverence of his p^soone or of his dignyte / he should knele only
with the one knee But as says saint Austyn de ciuitate dei. lio.xo.c.v. By
flaterye and ouirlownesse of the people and ambicion of the souereyns many
worshyppes yt longed su^tyme to god alone / ben now used in the worshipyng of
synful man and woman / And though it be do to man or woman for the worship of
god as I said first it is suffrable:


The xv chapt
Dives. Thurification. and encensyng was by old time an high divine worship.
And many seyntes were putt to the death for they would not encense images
stocks ne stones But now clerks encense images and other / priests and
clerks and lewd people also. And so as me think they do ydolatrie


Pauper. In every law thurificacio^ and encensyng has been an high dyuyne
worship. yt ought not to be done to any creature by wey of offrynge Neuirtheles
it may be done on ii / manners. First by weye of offrynge with convenient
toknynge and so it may not be do to any creature For on this manner it owith not
to be done butt only of a preeste / and at an auter. hallowed or with a
superaltare hallowed / so ye prestes lefully may sey there their mass. For by
the encensour is understand mannys heart / by the ence^se holy pyer / by the
fire charity And so such encensyng and thurificacio^ betokneth that right as
the p^ste offrith up in the encensoure encense. sweet smellyng by hete of the
fire So the priest and the people by the priest offer up her hertes to god and
her prayers quycned by the fire of charity. And pray that their bedes and
their prayers and deuociones may be plesaunte to him for that endless charity
that he showed to mankind / when he dyed for us all upon the cross /
which charity is presentyde in the sacrament of the autre. For all the mass
syngyng is a special mind making of cristes passion / And right as Christ was
mean in his passion bitwene god and mankind / so is the priest i^ his mess
saying / and sacrifice making and offrynge and encensynge / mean bitwene god
and the people. And therefore only a priest should encense at the autre / and
with hallowed encense / and with holy prayer sayng on this wise for him self
and for the people. Dirigatur oration mea sicut incensu^ in conspectu tuo. Lord
make my prayer go right up in thy sight as encense Also thurificacion may be
done only for steryng to devotion and for to kenynge And so it may be done to
the clergy and to the people. in token that as the encense by hete of the fire
smellith sweet / and styeth up to heaven ward / So should they lift up their
hertes / with devotion / and make their prayers in charity yt they might be
plesaunte to god / and wend up to god. For but the priest and the people be in
charity / else their prayer pleasith not god / ne gothe not up to god as it
should else do. and therefore is no man worthy to be encensed but if he be in
charity And when the clergy in the quere or the people is encensed / they
should lowte low / for reverence of god / and take it not as for worship done
hem but as sterynge to devotion / and as a token / what devotion they should
show to god / and by loutyng show lowness of devotion that it sterith them
to For without devotion and lowness of heart our prayer goth not up to god But
as says the wiseman The prayer of him that loweth him in his prayer thirlith
the clouds The myssalle and the gospel is ence^sed in token that the prayers
written therein profit litel or naught but if they be made with devotion and i^
charity And there should no man preche the gospel. butt with devotion and for
charity and all his speed and all his profytte refer up to god / and all
his prayers put in his will At buriynge men encense the deed bodies / in token
that he dyed in charity. and in his dyenge he had his heart up to god / by hope
feith charity and devotion / for else he is not worthy to be buried in christian
buryelles. Also in token / yt he shall quycken again and rise up from death to
life at the dome and wend up to heuene for his charity which he had by his life
as the encense stieth up by the hete of the fire / And for the same skylle is
the grave encensed i^ token that he shall awake and rise from death to life Also
the body and the grave ben ence^sed / in toke^ that it is plesaunt to god ye
holy church pray for him. But this manner of encensyng done to the clergy to
the people and to the deed bodies to the grave should be done with encens not
hallowed ne blissed. for it is noon offryng And as touching encensynge. done in
the presence of images. as it semyth to me it is not done propirly to the
images / but before the images in diverse significaciones or toknynges / For
wha^ne ence^syng is done before a peinted image yt rep^sentith criste which is
very god and man. It semyth to me that the ence^syng signifies yt al devotion
and charitable prayer which is betokned by encence / should principally. stye
up to god / and wha^ ence^syng is done before any image of our lady or of other
seyntes / it may signifye that the prayers of seintes which pray for us
wreches in earth stye up by their great cherite to the majesty of god.


Dives. Since encensyng is not done to the people by wey of worshypyng / why
encence they first the souereynes more thanne the subgettys.


Pauper. For in all thing must be kept order in doing And also in token yt
as they ben principal in state and dignite. so should they be principal in
devotion and charity / and give other good ensample.


The xvi chaptre.
Dives. Why worship we god and pray to him more in the est than into the
weste. southe and north.


Pauper. Eest and west south and north and ouir al it is leful and medeful to
worship god / as him yt is ouir al / lord of al thing. But for to draw
criste^ people to one manner doing / and to fle difformite. Therefore holy
church has ordained yt me^ should in chi^che and other places if it may be
well done / worship god pray him and pryse him in the Eest / as the law
shewith well / Distinct xi. ecclesiasticarum. And that for diverse skylles
First for crist upon the cross dyed into the west / and therefore in our
prayer we should turn us i^to the eest / to see how crist for us henge upon the
tree / and so to have an iye to his passion / and worship him yt dyed for us
all. upon the tree Also to let the people to sue the iewys in manner of
worshypyng For at gods ordenaunce they worshyped west ward in token yt
their law and their manner worshipyng i^ their cerymonies should sone pass
and go down and make an e^de as the day endith and passith a way into the west
And also in token yt for any worship or prysynge or p^yer yt they did / yet
they should go down to hell / till the new law came when criste dyed for us al
And for the same skylle criste died west ward / and in his dyeng said.
Consu^matum est. That is to say It is endyd / For in his death the old
testament endyd and went down as the son And the day gothe down in the
west And therefore we criste^ people worship into the Eest / by techynge of the
holy ghost / in token yt our law shall spryng and sprede as the day cu^myng of
the son rises and spryngeth out of the eest. and as all the sterres ben
most brighte in thest. and when they wend into the west all they begin to
dymme and derk / so was tholde law full dymme and full derk / but the new law
is open brighte and clear Also we worship Christ most in the eest for he was
most dispisyd in the Eest when on good friday he heng on the cross turned
into the weste / when the jews stood before him and passide before him with many
scorns and dispytouse words / with mowes / and many a iape they seyde. Vath q
destruis templu^ dei: Tprut for the yt distroyest gods temple. And for he was
most dispysed into the Eest of the jews and hethen people / Therefore christian
people there against worship hi^ most i^to the eest And for he was most dispysed
for us on good frydaye Therefore we worship him most on good fridaye And on this
manner as much as we may / al his dispyte we turn to worship of him Also we
worship god in the eest in token bright as the son ryseth up in the eest / so
we believe that criste rose up from death to life / and in that we worship: him
as him that rose from death to life / and shall live withoute^ end Also in token
that we long to come again to the bliss of paradyse yt we lost in the eest /
and pray god yt we may with his mercy / come again thereto.


Dives. These skylles ben good But why were thanne the xxv. men blamed of god
for they worshipyd estward at the risyng of the son / as we find.
ezechielis. viii.c.


Pauper Not for they worshipped god estwarde For danyel and many other worshyped
god Estwarde. weste. southe / and north / as he is worthy to be worshyped ouir
al A solis ortu vsque ad occasu^ laudabile nome^ dn^i. From the son rysynge
unto the going down gods name is prisable and worshipful But they were
blamed for they worshyped the son in his rysynge / and did divine worship
thereto in dispyte of gods temple / and of gods law as many foles yet do
these days worshipynge the son in his risyng and the new moan in his first
she wynge.


Dives. They worship him yt made the son and the moon.


Pauper. If they do so they do well / But I dread not al do so And as says a
great clerk Leo papa i^ a sermon / for asmoche as it has a likeness of
ydolatry and custom of hethen people. men should absteyne them therfro For the
people is full much enclyned to folly and to ydolatrye.


The xvii. chaptre.
Dives. That is sothe For these days men do worcester / ship to son / moan / and
sterres / yt for to worship the sterres and the planetes and the craft of
astronomye. they wole put out god of his majesty. out of his kingdom and his
lordship / and out of his fredome / and make him more bond to sterres / than
euir was any king or any lord / or any man upon earth They wole be of gods
pryue cou^seyl / will god nyl god / and rule his domes his dedys his works /
and al by their wits and by the course of the planetes in somoche yt as they
say there shall no man ne woman be hole ne seek / foul ne fair / rich ne pore
/ wise ne fool / good ne wicked. but by the worchynge of the bodies above and
by their wits so yt they can tell it before There shall fall no myscheyf ne
welthe neither to person ne to comunyte / but by her wits and by the course
of the planetes None hu^gre mo rain ne tempeste. no sickness no war shall
fall but by their wits and by the worchyng of the bodies above For as they
say / the bodies above rule all thing here bynethe And thus they wol make god
more thralle and of less power than any king or lord upon earth. For why
our liege lord the king god save his life has power and fredome of a page to
make a yoman / of a yoman a gentylman / of a gentylman a knight / of a poor man
a great lord / without leave or help of the planetes And if a man trespass
against him and be taken with treasone / he is of power to do hi^ to be hanged
and drawn / and to take from him and his heirs the heritage and make him full
pore And he is of power to make his true lie geman rich though he be right
pore This fredome and this power has our liege lord / our king where so
the planetes ben or in what sign / i^ what respect or in what co^stellacion or
coniu^ction our king may do all this and a^e the planetes no leave They may not
let him Ne all the astronomoures with al their calculacio^ though they watch and
stare / after the sterres / till they lose their hedes may not let him / ne save
oo man's life yt the king wol haf deed Much more tha^ the king of heuyn yt
made son and moan / and sterres and al thing of naught and rules gydeth and
weldith al thing at his will may make rich and pore / fair and foul / hole
and seek / wise and fool / good or wicked whom he lyketh wtouten help. of the
planetis And if any person or co^munyte trespass against him he may chastise him
by hungre / by moreyne / by sickness / by tempest / by swerd. by pou^te. by
loss of catel and what wise he wole / and he may reward his true servants as
him likes / both in this world and i^ the other world axing the planetes no
leave / ne cou^seyl of astronomours


The xviii c.
PAuper. As we find i^ holy writ Gen^. i.c. At the beginning of the world
when god made al thing of naught ye iiii. day he made son and moan and
sterres and set hem i^ the firmament to give light to the creatures here byneth
/ yt the son principally should shine and give light / by day / moan and
sterres by night. More ouir as says the book he made them and ordained them
for to perte the day from the night / and they should be in tokenys / and times
days and years. yt by the tokenys of ye bodies above me^ should know the day
from the night and one day from a another / and wit what day it were / and
what time of the day / what night and what tym of the night / what year and
what time of the year / what month and what time of the month Also god
ordained them and made them yt by the toknes and by the bodies above. men
should know when it were time to sleep and time to wake / time to trauayl /
and time to rest / time to halowe / and time to labor / time to ete and time
to fast. time to set and to sow: time to ere time to repe and to mow And
therefore solomon says Ecclesiastices iii.c. yt all thing has his time /
and al thing under heuyne passith away by space of time / And so god made the
firmament above with bright bodies yt been therein to serve mankind. and other
creatures also of light and time Of light as a lantern that may not be
quenchyd Of time as an orloge that may not fail God made hem to serve man /
not man to serve them He made them for man. not man for hem He made hem not to
govern man / but he yaue man. and woman wit and discrecion to govern them
selue with his grace by the light and wissyng of time / which he has of the
bodies above / that by their light they may see. to worche. and by their
stirynge and their course they may wit when it is time to worche And therefore
says the law xxvi. q^. v. No^ licet. in glosa. That the bodies above ben
toknes and not causes. of things here bynethe And as a lamp or an orloge ben
necessary to religious by night where by they may rise and rule themself / in
gods service / so serve the bodies above to mankind yt we may have of them
bodily light And by their mouyng know our time to serve our god each man
and woman in his degree And as the lamp and the orloge i^ the dortoure rule not
the religiouse but the religiouse rule hem by the lamp and by the orloge / and
in citees and towns men rule them by the cloak / and yet propirly to speak /
the clock rules natt them but a man rules the clock Right so man and woman /
be and ^yrde and other creatures rule hem self by the bodies above / and the
bodies above rule not them And therefore they should not be clepid gouernoures
of this world / for they govern not this world. They be naught else but
^strumentes of gods governance For it farith by god and the bodies above /
as it does by the smythe and his gryndyng stone / by the wright and his axe:
by the orloger and his orloge.


Dives. I pray the show me well this


Pauper Thou see at iye that when the smyth grindeth a knyf or an axe or a
sword on his stone / the stone does naught but goth about in one course. And
as the smyth that sytteth above wole dispose and hold / so gryndeth the stone.
If he wole grynde sharp it shall grynde sharp If he wole grynde blunte and
play ne / it shall grynde blunt and play ne Right as he wol that it grynde. so
it gryndeth. If he take away the knyf axe or sword the stone gryndeth right
naught / and yet it goth about the same course as it did before / Right so it is
of god and the bodies above. For the planetes and the bodies above gone always
about in one course certain / i^ which god ordained them at the beginning of
the world / which course they shall keep unto the dome. And as god wole yt
they worche / so they shall worche If god wole yt they grynd sharp / and
cause moreyne seknes and te^pestes hungre and werre and such other they shall
do so If he wole yt they grynde plain and smothe and cause health of body /
fair wedyr and wholesome / plenty of corn and vitayles / pees and rest / they
shall do so Right as god wole yt they worche so they shall worche So yt god may
do with the planetes what he wole and he may do without the planetes what he
wole In what sign in what co^stellacion / co^iu^ction / or respte yt they be /
they be always ready to fulfill the will of god.


Dives. Sithen god may do with the bodies above what he wole and when he wole
/ and sithen god is so fre in his doing. and not artid by the planetes ne by
none other creature / how should any man know gods domes by the course of
tie planetes / or deem thereby / or tell what god will do in time coming / or
dyuyne of things yt be to come.


Pauper. Thou may not know by the axe what the wrighte wole worche ne when
Ne thou may not know by the orloge what time the orloger wole set it ne
know the orlogers will. Ne thou may not know by ye gryndstone what the
smyth wol grynde / ne what manner ne wha^


Dives It is soth


Pauper. No more may we know by the bodies above ne by the course of ye
planetes what god wole do / ne what he wole ordeyne of man or of woman / or of
any comunyte land. realm / cuntre or cite / for the planetes and the bodies
above ben naught else but gods instruments / and the course of the planetes
is not chaungeable ne variable / but it is put i^ certain meuynge and stirynge
which they may natt flee ne change / for they have no fre election i^ their
doing But god is souereyn judge most rightful most merciful most free / to
punysshe and to spare / For he is most of might and no thing may him
withsto^de and therefore his domes and his works be not nedyd ne artid by the
planetes / but after yt me^ change her living so cha^gith he his domes / to
punysshe or spare to well or to woe to heuyn or to hell He demyd the si^ful cite
of nynyue. because of sin to be distroyed within xl. days but when they
repe^tyd hem and ame^dyd them and cryde after mercy / he changed his dome and
spared the cite / and distroied it not as tellith Jonas the prophet / and yet
the planetes cha^gyd not her course for non ame^dme^t of the people Also we find
i^ holy wryt the fourth book of kings yt god send the prophet Isaie to the
king ezechie wha^ he had sined and badde him make his testament for he should
dye and no lengre live Anon the king repentyd him and wept full sore and axed
mercy / And anon god badde the prophet Isaie yt yet was i^ the kings halle to
wend again to the king and say to him yt god had accepted his repentance /
and herd his prayer / and yt he should not dye than / but he should live xv.
year lengre. Lo leave friend how sone the dome of god was changed al to mercy
And though the planetes yet ye time kept forth their course. they chau^gyd not
for all the kings weeping


Dives. Anon after the son chaungyd his course and turnyd again i^to the eest
and began a new day


Pauper. The turnyng again of the son was natt cause of the mercy of god. ne
of chau^gynge of his domes / for god chau^gyd his dome before or the son
turnyd again So the turnyng again of the son was naught else / but a token of
mercy to the king ezechie / and to all synful wreches yt would amend hem For
right as the son changed his course after the repentance of the king Right
so god chau^gith his sentence anon as man or woman repe^tith him of his syn /
and is in will to amend him. Therefore says the law De penitent. di. i.
sufficiat No uit deus mutare sentenciam / si tu nouis eme^dare delictu^: God
can change his sentence and / his dome anon as thou can amend thy
trespass Also it was a token to the king yt gods bihest to him should be
fulfilled Butt all the astronomours that euir were could not tell before of
ye wounderful token in the son. For it was al against the common course of
kind / and yt and such other show well that god is not ruled by the course
of the planetes / but that god rules the planetes and not the planetes him /
ne his domes ne his works. But god rules demeth and governs al mankind
person and comunyte after that they deserve / and as him thinks most
spedeful to his worship and to the common proufyt of his Realm / in heaven in
earth and in hell / whose domes and ordenau^ce pass man's wit And therefore
seint poul says. Quis cognouit sensu^ dn^i aut quis consiliarius eius fuit /
who says he has know ye wit of god / or who was his counseloure. Forsothe
not the astronomoures ne wyches / for they ben fools of all foles / and put
fettheste out of gods counseyl / as folk that god most hatyth Seint poule
says / yt the domes of god ben inco^p^hensible / noma^ may know them well /
no man may trase his weyes Tho been his wonderful domes / they ben so meddled
with mercy and rightfulnesse yt they pass man's wit Therefore the prophet
Dauyd says. Universe vie dn^i mi^a et veritas: All the weyes of the lord
been mercy and treuthe. Iudicia dn^i abissus multa. The domes of god been a
much depnesse / ye so deep that no man's wit may seek to the depenesse / ne
know well the cause. ne skylle of his wonderfulle domes And therefore such
astronomoures and wyches that entermet them so high of gods domes / and
wonderful works and presume to divine of things that been to come and make
them wise / as if they were gods fellows. and knew all his preuy counseyl
/ they ben foles of all foles.


Dives. Therefore clerks say. that they may no thing tell for certain But
they may tell where to man or woman or comunyte is enclened by the worchyng of
the bodies above Neuirthelesse as they say / man and woman may by virtue
ouircome the planetes / and so every wise man is lord and master of the
planetes And therefore ptolomeus the great astronomoure says. Quoth vir sapiens
dn^abitur astris.


The xx. chaptre.
ALso as they say by astronomye they may know when men ben i^clyned to werre
or to peace And when by common course of kind should fall moreyn / hungre /
tempest / drought and such other. But as they say one holy prayer may change
every dele And though it fall not in one cu^tre it fallith in an other cuntre.

Pauper. Sithen they can not tell for certain / what shall bifalle but al in
doubt / and their sawes and their domes may so lightly be chau^gyd and brought
to naught / it is a great folly to set any trust to their tales For so may
every fool tell what he wole and excuse every lesynge. This manner of spech is
naught else but a mayntenynge of lesynges and of faytrye and of hydynge of
folly and a synful excusacion of sin / and a nett to cache with woma^nes soul.
and a stre^ge to draw men to hell / and to draw man's heart his love his
trust from god They would feign beholde^ wise and nigh of gods cou^seyl but
they wot not how for they be founden so false. ye shall understand leave
friend. that there is but one son and one moan / and other five planetes /
Saturn Iubiter Mars Venus and Mercury. Which with other. sterres gone about
all earth with the firmament every day natuturel / and so pass all the lands /
all realms / persons: al earth al waters / al air in xxiiii. ours. that is
clepid day natural / from son rise to son rise / from none to none And
sithen they pass all lands and al persons so euenly / and make no more
duellyng ouir one than an other why should they more enclyne one lord tha^
another / or one person more tha^ a another to vice / or to virtue / to war
or to peace /


Dives. For some constellacion or some respe^t in her passinge fallith upon one
land more than a another. And as folk ben borne under diverse constellacions or
co^iunctiones. diverse respects in diverse signs and under diverse planetes /
so ben they enclyned in diverse manner and to diverse things / vice or virtue /
werre or peace / health or sekenes / pouerte or richesse and such other.


Pauper. When the kings sone is borne / in the same time in the same
co^stellaco^n respect planete and syne / is the bond man's sone borne. And
yet have they not both one inclinacion / ne one disposicion For the kings
son is disposed by his heritage to be king after his fader The bond ma^nys
son. is disposed by his birthe / to be a bond man all his life as his faders
have been before him hundryd years / yt no planete might avoid their bondage
/ ne fro the kings their dignyte In the same time and in the same
constellacion and under the same planete and sign that one child is borne
been many borne and yet have they not all even inclinacion ne even disposicion
For some of them ben enclyned to godenesse and su^me to wyckednes su^me ^o
sickness / and su^me to health / Su^me been fulle angry and su^me be not so.
Su^me be wise / su^me be foles / su^me foul some fair su^me rich some pore
su^me living long / su^me dye fulle sone / Esau and jacob. had both oone
fadre and one modre Isaac and rebecca. both were bigoten at ones / as says
saint Austyn / and both borne at ones / and yet were they no thing like For
jacob was a good man / esau a shrewe Jacob was loved of god Esau was hatyd for
his wickedness / Jacob was smothe of body with little here. Esau fulle of here
as a be Jacob was a true simple man Esau a rauenoure / and a maliciouse
shrewe. Jacob was peasible / Esau a faytoure a baratoure. So thou might well
se that diverse inclinacion of man and woman. stondeth not in the planetes ne
in the time of the birth:


The xxi. chaptre.
Dives. What else may be cause of such diverse inclynaciones.


Pauper. For adames / syn and original syn yt we be all conceived in we ben
all i^clyned to sin And therefore god says. Gen^. viii. That the wit and
thought of man's heart is i^clyned to evil from his youth. Sensus et cogitacio
cordis humani in malum prona sunt / ab adolescencia sua. And therefore solomon
says. Prouerbi. xx.c. That no man may say. I am pure and clean without
sin. Neuirtheles al be not enclyned alyke much to sin ne to seknes / but
some more some less / and yt for many diverse causes Su^tyme for wicked
fuffrau^ce yt children be not chastised in her youth. For as salamon says
Prouerbi. xxix.c. The child yt is sufryd to have his will shall shame his modre
and al his kynne / Su^tyme for wicked cu^pany yt they been in / and wicked
example of their elders and mys informacion / Su^tyme for mys use in youth For
salomo^ says. prouerbi. xxii. yt a man in his elde goth not lightly fro the
wey of his youth.


Dives. And yet it is a common proverb. young seint old devil:


Pauper. It is a synful proverb to draw men to sin fro virtue. fro god to
the feende / For holy writ says. Bonu^ e^ hoi^ cu^ por tauerit iugu^ dn^i ab
adolesce^cia sua. Tren^. iii.c. It is full good. says he to a man wha^ne he
has borne the yok of our lord from his youth / And as a poet says Quod
noua testa capit i^ueterata sapit. Which as the pot or the vessel takith
when it is new such it sauoureth when it is old And therefore in holy wryt saint
John baptist / toby. ieremye / sa^pson / samuel / and many other ben prised for
their holiness in their youth For como^ly they yt been good and love god i^
godenesse i^ her youth they make a fulle good end / al if for a time they
falin sin and ben full vein God suffers them to fall for a time for they
should else be to proud of their godenesse / and have disdeyne of other
synful wreches Also su^tyme one is inclyned to one syn more than a another / for
he was conceived and begoten in more syn tha^ne a another / al if ^e were
begote^ and borne i^ wedlock For the man and the wif may sin together fulle
grievously / either by myswyl of their bodies / or by i^temporance if they pass
manner and mesure / or if they comen togyddre in vntyme / as in the time of
seeknesse / or in holy time withouten dread or reverence of the time: ne wole
not spare for the time. Nathelesse the sin is in the axer not in the yelder.
Also they may sin by wicked intencion / as if they do it for a wicked end /
or only to fulfill the lust of the flesh / not to fle fornicacion. ne to
yield the dett of their body / ne to bring forth children to the worship of
god. but only taken head of her own lust Also if they coueite children not to
the worship of god / but for the world to be great / and to make their children
great in this world / Also men ben enclyned to sin on emore tha^ an other by
excess of meet and drink. by myskepynge of his five wits. And for these
same causes. one is i^clyned to bodily seknes. more than a another For syn often
time is cause of bodily seknesse Also by mysdietynge of the modre while she is
with child / or by mysdisposicion of the fadre / or of the modre / or of both.
Wha^ne the child is bigote^ / or by miskepyng of the child in the youth For
children i^ youth wole assay and handle well nigh al thing / And so oftyme they
ete and drink and receive inward much unthrifty thing and enuenym her self
and hurt themself in many wise y^ but the good aungel kept hem they should
perisshe Also god smyteth hem with seknesse of myscheif Su^tyme for the faders
sin / and the moders / for they love them to much / and wole go to hell to
make hem rich and great in this world Su^tyme he smyteth them with seknes to
show his might and miracle / as we find in the gospel of saint John /.ix c.
of him that was borne blind / yt the might of god might be showed in him in
yeuyng him sight Other causes there ben full feel which pass man's wit. for
we may nat^ know all gods domes. Ne these causes here assigned be not
always generalle. For su^tyme a fulle good man has a full shrewyd child / su^me
good su^me bad And su^tyme a fulle wicked man has a fulle good child. For if
the children followed always the fader and the modre. in godenesse. or in
wickedness. / all the godenesse should be arettyd to the fadre and to the
modre / and not to god / And they should be proud / both fadre / modre and the
child and comyne to gidre flesshly to much And i^ the same manner all the
shrewidnesse should be arettyde to the fadre and modre al if it come on other
bihalf / and should they be euir sorry. and fall in dispeyr and not will yield
to them to gyddre the debt of their body And therefore god medlyth so one with
an other / and so modifieth his domes that the good should not presume of him
self ne be to proud / but thank god of all. ne the wicked be to sorry and so
fall i^ despair / but trust in god yt so of the wicked makith the good and of
the unclean makethe the clean


The xxii chaptre
Dives. They say that as children be borne under diverse synes / so ben they
enclyned and disposed to diverse crafts and diverse states If he be borne
under some sign they say he shall be a fissher / and under some a monyour / and
under some a clerk under some a man of arms.


Pauper. Many cu^tries know no monyours ne money neither

And many cuntries alyf have money / yet they have no monyoures For in a full
great realm of six hundred mile on length and ii. hundryd of bread be no
monyoures but in one place assigned by the king. not by the signs ne by the
bodies above The king assigns both the place and them that shall make the
money / not the bodies above And if any wight make money but tho that the king
has ordained / he shall be slain as a traytoure. the signs ne the pla.
netes shall not save his life: And they that be borne nygh the sea. or nigh some
great water / give them to fisshynge and their children also. not for the synes
that they be borne in / but for most oportunyte of their living. Which they
have by the water: that is so nygh. They that been borne fer from the sea give
hem to tylthe of the land. Su^tyme to clothe making if there be plenty of
wolle Su^me been shepherdes / some monyouris / some vynoures. some of other
craftis as the cuntree axith / not aftre the signs ne the bodies above. When
a man has many children he puts thym to diverse crafts to get her living
Me^ of arms put their children to arms And commonly every man yt can ought or
has ought where by he may live / he puttith some of his children in the same
degree to get her leuyng. And thou maiste well se that such diuersitye in
craft. in living ston. dith more in the childs fadre and his friends that
ordained so for him than it does in the signs or in the planetes For if they
should abide the ordenau^ce of the planetes they should dye for hungre for they
teache hem right naught ne ordeyne more for one thanne for another /


Dives. Since such i^clinacion sto^dith little or naught in the planetes / what
is that destenye that men speak so much of / And as they say al thing fallith
to man and woman by destenye.


The xxiii chaptre
PAuper. Foles speak as foles. For as says saint Gregory in his omely of the
epiphanye there is no such destyne Absit a cordibus fidelium vt ali quid esse
fatum dicant. God forbede says he that any christian man or woman / should
believe / or say that there were any destyne But god says he that made man's
life of naught / he rules and governs mannys life and womannes after that they
deserve / and as his right wysnesse / and his mercy axith And man says he /
was not made for ye sterres / but the sterres were made for man.


Dives. The gospel is ayenste the For we find in the gospel / that anoon as
criste was borne. of the maiden / his sterre apperyd in the Eest / in token yt
each man and woman is borne under a certain sterre / and under a certain
constellacion which is clepyde his destyne. for all his living after following
is governed thereby / as sayen these astronomoures.


Pauper. To mayntene folly they say many folies and ben natt asshamed to lie.
For that sterre had no maistrye ne lordshype upon that blessed child But the
child was master and lord of that sterre The sterre gouernyd not the child
/ but the child gouernyd the sterre. The child sought not the sterre / but yt
ster^ the child The child served not the sterre / but the sterre seruyde the
child / and did him full high worship and fulle wonderful service / And therefore
it was clepyde the childs sterre / for the child was lord of the sterre as he
was of al other For he was and is lord of son moan and all sterres and of
al thing / and they may not conferme their lesynges ne the false domes of
astronomoures / by ye sterre. For it was no planete ne sterre of the firmament
/ as says saint austyn and other doctoures / of holy church / and skylle and
reason shewith it.


Dives. How


Pauper. For as seyn these clerks. Minima stella fixa mayor e^ tota terra. The
leest sterre set fast in the firmamente is more than all the earth within the sea and withouten the sea / and every planete also is more than al therth
outake the moon and mercury which be sumdele less than al earth And therefore
sumtyme they lose their light that they have of the son by the shadow and
the vmbre of the earth / when it fallith right between the son and them And
if that sterre had been so much or any such sterre it should have ouirwhelmyd
al earth / for it went fulle low nigh the earth to lead and to wysse the
kings / in their weye Also the sterres of the firmament and the planetes
follow the course of the firmament / and rise up in the eest and goo down in
the west every day naturel That sterre did not so. for it was above the earth
both night and day / and followed not the course of the firmament / but it
held his course as the wey led best into the cite of bethleem for to wisse the
kings in their weye to the son of rightwysnesse / yt there rose out of that
clear firmament the maiden mary / and as the son from under the earth Also
the sterres in the firmament shine by night and not by the day That sterre
shone both night and day Also the sterres of the firmament show them to al
me^ commonly both pore and rich young and old That sterre aperyd not but to the
three kings / and their cumpany Also the sterres of the firmament been
perpetuel and always lastyng / that lastyd but a little while / twelve months
at most / as su^me clerks say and su^me say but fourtene days or less.


Dives. What manner sterre was it than


Pauper. Some clerks sayen that it was an aungel in the liknesse of a sterre
For the kings had no knowing of aungelles / butt took all head to the
sterre Su^me say that it was the same child that lay in the ox stalle /
which apperyd to the kings i^ the lyknes of a sterre / and so drew them and
led them to him self in Bethleem And therefore holy church / syngith and
says. Iacebat in presepio et fulgebat in celo. He lay fulle low in the
cratche and shone fulle bright above in heuene But the common sentence of
clerks is that it was a new sterre newly ordained of god to show the birth
of christ And a noon as it had done the office that it was ordained fore it
turnyd again to the matter that it come fro.


The xxiiii. chaptre.
Dives. How might they know by the sterre that such a child was borne / for
ye sterre could not speak to them ne tell no such tales /


Pauper. That is sothe / and therefore says saint Austyn openly in a sermon.
yt the sterre did naught else / by his apperynge but brought them in wounder
and great study to wit what it might amounte And when they were at their
wits end and knew well yt her craft served them not thanne god showed them
by inspiracion inward or else by an aungel what it betokenyd / and badde them
follow the sterre. And the same says saint John with the gylden mouth. upon
Matheu. They knew well by balames prophecy that such a child should be borne
/ but they knew it not by the craft of astronomye / ne might know by their
craft / neither the time of his birthe ne the place. as the gospel shows
well.


Dives. Why says thanne saint austyn / and other clerks / that the science of
judicial astronomye of children birth was leful unto the time of cristes
birthe since they might natt by that science / know his birthe.xxvi. q^. iiii.
igitur. But as they say it was not lefulle ne grauntyd after his birth.


Pauper. Saint austyn says not that the craft was leful or granted to do. ne
that it was leful to trust therein. For it was alwey false and repreued of god
and of philosophers by skylle and resone But he says that the science of the
craft was leful and granted of god / not the doing that by the science men
might repreue the craft / and the science also. and show by their own
principalles and grounds that the craft is false. and that the science is no
science propirly to speak. but open folly / as it was well preuyd in cristes
birth. And for it was so openly preuyd falls i^ his birth / therefore aftre his
birth it is not leful to use it ne to cu^ne it. but only to repreue the folly
of them that use it The doing of the craft was unlawful both before and aftre
The science was suffryd of god both before and aftre to repreue folly / as the
law shewith well. di. xxxvii. De mensa.


The xxv. chaptre
Dives. Where fyndest thou that god defends the judicial of astronomye.
before cristes birth.


Pauper. Exodi xx.c. In the first precepte of ye first table. of which is now
our speech / where god bad that men should make them no lyknesse yt is in heuyn
But such astronomoures make them self like as / much as they may to god in
heuyn / in asmoche as they take to them that longith only to god. For only god
knowyth wha^ne such things as they make hem wise of should fall and how and
where And therefore god rep^ueth them and says to them. Nunciate que ventura
su^t in futuru^ / et sciemus qr dii estis vos. ysaie xlio.c. Tell ye us
things that been to come aftre this and thanne shall we know that ye be gods
And therefore says ye law.xxvi. q^. iiii. igitur. That they clepid themself
diuynes as they were full of god and knew all gods cou^seyl and by faytre
and falshode coniecte and tell to the people things that been to come / as they
were fulle of godhode and gods felawes. And on this manner they and all such
/ trespass fulle highly against the first precepte For they make them like to
god in heuyn / and the worship that longith only to god they take it to them
self. Such p^sumption and pride lost au^gelles kind / and mankind also.
For as we find. ysaie xiiii.c. Lucifer said in his heart that he should stye
up unto heaven and set his seet above the sterres / and sytt in the mount of the
testament And that he should wend up above the highte of the clouds / yt is
to say above all aungelles and be like to him that is highest. But anon he
fell down to hell. and so shall such astronomoures and wytches / but if they
amend them. For they set their wits and their study and their faith so
much in the sterres. that they wole pass the sterres and al creatures and be
like god that is highest They wole also fytte i^ the mount of the testament /
for they wole be against gods laws / and have forth their domes / will god
nyl god For if their craft were true the testament of gods law should serve
of naught. and so gods law / holy church law / skyl and reason should
serve of naught For there is no man worthy to be punysshid for a syn that he may
not fle / ne worthy to be medid ^or a good deed that he may not leave. But for
that man does well when he might do am^s / therefore he is worthy mede And for
that he does evil when he might do well / and might leave his mysdede and wole
not: therefore he is worthy much pain But if he were nedyd by ye bodies above
to virtue or to vice he were worthy neither meed ne pain. This pride and
p^sumpcio^ lost also Adam and eve and al mankind For when the feende hight
them that they should be as gods knowing good and wicked / they assentyd to
him / and ete of the apple / ayenste gods forbode For they would have be as
gods and like god cu^nyng good and wicked / and have known what was to come
Also we find Deuto. xviii.c. That when god led the children of israel out
of egypt i^to the land of bihest / he forfendyd them the iudicyal of
astronomy^ and all manner wytche crafts / and bad they should axe no cou^seil
of none such dyuynoures ne wiches For I shall says he distroye the nations
that ye gone to for they have used such crafts / and if ye use hem I shall
distroy also you we find also Isaie. xlvii.c. that god repreuyd the people of
Babilonye and the caldeis of their wyche crafts and of their astronomye that
they trusted most in / For of all naciones they yaue them most that time
thereto / and said to them on this wise wydowehede and bareynhede shall come to
the both in one day for the multitude of thy wytches / and for the hardenesse
of thy charmerys / And for thou had trust in such malice thy cu^nyng and
thy science has disceyued the Disease and woe shall fall to the and thou shalt
not wytt fro whe^s it cu^myth Sodeyne myscheif shall fall to the and thou may
not fle Stand says he with thy charmers and with the multitude of thy wyches
/ in which thou haste trauayled. from thy youth Look if they may ought help
the or strenght the ayenste thyn enemies. Thou have failed and thou shalt
fail / in the multitude of thy cou^seyles that thou haste taken of such folk
Let now says he thy dyuinoures of heuyn stand and save the if they may.
They that stare so against the styrres and look after the planetes / and
calculen / and cast years days and months / to tell the things that been
to come / they shall not help the. they may natt help the. For as saint
poule says There is no counseyl against god. Also this craft of astronomy. is
rep^uyd Sapienc. xiii. by the wise Solomon / where he repreuythe them that
weende and said that son moan and sterres were gods of this world / for
governance lo^gith to none vnwytty thing. as son and moan and sterres. been
But governance longith only to wytty things skillful. and reasonable and
understanding / as to god that is souereyn wisdom to aungel and man Vnwitty
bodies with their virtues and their might / and their kinds be naught else
but i^strumentes of gods governance and also of au^gelles gouerna^ce. and of
mannys also if they can well use them Also such judicial of astronomy is
repreuyd by the law of holy church / xxvi. q^. iiii. igitur. and
distinct.xxxvii. legimus. etc. qui de mensa. Also saint poule repreuyth such
craft of astronomye. Ad galathas iiii.c. ye keep says he days and months
years and times. as hethen people does And therefore I dread me says he. that I
have traueilyd in vein about you to convert you all And ye gloss i^ the
same place repreueth such craft of astronomy fulle hard Such science god
repreuyth. as says seint poule in his epystole / i. ad little. i^.c. I shall
says godlese the wisdom of the wise / and the slight of the sligh and of
them that trust so much i^ their cu^nynge / where moreouir saint poule says
thus / where is now the wise man that letythe so well by his wit / where is
now the man of law with all his slyghtes / where is now the seker of nature
and of the course of kind of this world / God says he has turned the wisdom
of this world into folly.


The xxvi. chaptre
Dives. Such science and wysdo^ so for to divine of things to come which
stondeth in the will of god / and often i^ the free will of man or woman I let
great folly There can none astronymoure by his craft tell me my thoughts / ne
what I purpose me to do in time coming ne how I shall led my life They know
not my counseyl / all if they seem and speak with me. How should they know
gods counseyl or what he wol do in time cu^mynge / sithen they se him natt /
and they speak neuyr with him They can not tell before ne be ware of her own
myshappes How should they tell other men or women. or warn them by their
craft of their adventure For commonly such dyuynoures of astronomye ben in
great myscheif and myshap asmoche as other or more / and they know it not till
it fall / And ye more that they worche by their craft the worse they speed.


Pauper. That is no wounder For the more that they trust in their craft / the
less they trust i^ god. And the less they trust in god in whom is all our
wealth. the worse they shall speed And the more that they trust in their craste
the more they trust in folly. And the more that they trust in folly the more
folly and mischeyf shall follow him. There wole no wise man write his counseyl and
all that he thinks to do in ye year following in the roof of his halle / ne
about on the walls. Where all men may see it and know it. No more wole god
write his cou^seil ne what he thinks to do in time cu^myng above in the
firmament / there al foles might know his cou^seyl his thoughts and his domes
Christ hyd many thingis from his apostles and said to them Non estvtm nosse
te^pora vel mome^ta q^ pater posuit in sua potestate / actu um primo.c. It
longith not to you to know times mome^tes and stoundes which the fadre. of
heuyn has reseeuyd in his power And he said by the prophet. Secretum meu^
michi / secretum meum michi. ysa. xxiiii.c. I keep my priuyte to me I keep my
pryuyte to me. And sithe^ he reseruyd such counseyl and pryuyte from his
friends yt were so nygh of counseyl / Much more he reseruyd his counseyl from
his enmyes fool synful wreches


Dives. These clerks say that they may by craft of astronomy lefully tell and
dyuyne of droughte / of rain of tempest. for they fall by common course of
kind and therefore they may by common course of nature know them / and tell
them before


Pauper. As I said first / the course of kind and of planetes stondeth all
in the will of god and do therewith what he wole / as the instrumente stondeth in
the werkmannys will what he wole do therewith And therefore they may not know by
their craft / ne by the course of the planetes as by cause / neither of
drought ne of wete ne tempeste cu^mynge But they may know by the bodies above
/ as by tokenys both of droughte / of wete of tempest. froste / snow wind /
thundre / and such others / and so knowyth the shepeherde in the field. the
ship man in the sea / the bird in their the fisshe in the water / beestes in
the wode / bettre than all the astronymoures in this land /


The xxvii. chapter.
Dives. How may the bodies above be tokenes of such things and not causes


Pauper. Falling of soote in houses is token of reyne sone coming / and yet it
is not cause of the rain / but the reyne is cause of the sote falling For
wha^ne the air wexith moiste / the sote by moisture of the air wexithe heavy
and fallith down And so the falling of the sote is token of great moisture in
the air Also swetynge of water on the stone is token of reyn / and yet it is
not cause of the rain but reyne and moisture of the eyr is cause of the water
Also meltinge of salt when it turns i^ to water is token of rain cu^mynge
but not cause. Also smoke in house when it passith not redily out. is token of
reyne For the air is so thycke and heavy of moisture that the smoke may not stye
up so redily as when the air is dry. and clear Also the broughe or circle
about the candel light is token of reyne And the blewe glowynge of the fire /
is tokene of the froste. but not the cause These and such other ben tokenes of
wedyr cu^mynge but natt causes For they show disposicion of the air whedyr it
is disposed to droughte or to wete. And on the same manner the bodies above been
tokenes of wedyr cu^mynge For by their light and manner of shynynge they show
disposicion of the air wete or dry frost or snow / thu^dre lighnyng wind and
such other. And as the light in the la^terne shewith disposicion and color
of the la^terne / and yet is not ye light cause of such disposicion ne of the
color of the lantern. And as the light of son or moan shewith disposicion
of the glass / yt it passith by / whether it be white or blake / blewe or read
/ yelowe / or grene And yet is not the son ne the moon cause of the color.
Right so they show the disposicion of the air / and yet ben they not always
cause of such disposicion And therefore the moon in one lunacion and in the
same time shewyth in one cuntre great tokenynge of reyne and so it fallith /
and twentye mile thens it she with great toknyng of droughte and so it fallith
/ and yet is it the same moon and the same lunacion And therefore the cause of
that diversity is not in the moon but in the air. For the air in one cuntre
is disposed to rain / and in the other to droughte

Also in one cuntre it shewyth wind and tempest. in an other cuntre not so.
Some cuntre is fulle hot by shynynge of the son / some cuntre is not so hot
One day is fulle hot. and the next day aftre is fulle cold. The son
shewith his light one time of the day / and a another time of the day it shewith
not / which diversity stondeth not in the son / but in the air and other
causes For the son in himself as said these clerks is always at one and
shyneth always alike it is nether hot ne cold But such diversity fallith by
dyuersite of the air / and other diverse means and causes which passen
man's wit. Sumtyme such adventure of hungre of moreyne / of tempest / of
droughte. of wete fall by the ordenaunce of god for mannys sin / or for to
show his might and his worship. Sumtyme by worching of aungellys good or
wicked at gods bidding. Sumtyme withoute^ mean only at his will and his
bidding. Sumtyme by the worchynge of the bodies above at his byddyng For as I
said first he may do wiy the planetes what he wole / and he may do without
them what he wole And therefore by the course of the planetes. may we not know
such auentures as by causes but as by tokenys. For god made them to be
tokenys to man / be. bird / fisshe / and other creatures / as I said
first And therefore we should take heed to them only as to tokenes not to
causes. Ne dyuyne by hem as by causes For we wot not when they been causes
of such things / ne when natt.


The xxviii. chaptre
Dives. The moon as clerks said is cause of flowynge / and ebbynge of the sea. for it folowith the course of the moon.


Pauper. It may well be so But well I wot the course of the moon is token
when the sea shall ebb and flow. and the sea kepith his time of ebbi^g and
flowynge / after the course. and the time of the moon in one cuntre su^ner /
and in an other latter And yet every see does not so but only one part of the

because of tho But in other far cu^trees ne in the greeks see is no such

flowynge thanne the moon allone

But sothe it is that man be and bird / fysshe / the sea the air / tree
and grass / and other creatures use and keep their doing in kind / and
worchen in time that god has ordained to them. Which time they know well by
the course of the son moan and sterres. For as solomon says Ecclesiastes
iii.c All thing has his time ordained of god by wey of kind which time
they know and keep. by the course of the bodies above / which been tokenys to
hem showing what time they should do their kind that they ben ordained to And
therefore god saiy by the prophet Ieremye viii.c. The puttok in the air says
he knowith his time / the turtyl. and the swalowe keep the tym of her cu^myng /
But my people know not the dome of our lord god. For these days men take
none heed to gods domes / but all to the domes of astronymoures and to the
course of the planetes The kind of every creature is ordained by the dome of
god. and what time he shall do his kind which time they know / and feel. by
the course of the bodies above For as says the phylosophre / the bodies aboues
mesure all thing here bynethe as ane^tes time And therefore says David / that
by night when the son is down / than in derknesse begin bestes of raueyn to
walk and seek their prey and their mete. When the son ryseth they wend again
to her dens and bide them than go men out to worche till it be night Not
that the son ne the moon cause hem to do so / but only the law of kind
ordained of god techich he^ so to do and to keep their kyndly time In the da
wynge and spryngynge of the day birds begin to sing / flowers to sprede and
spryng that by night were full close Man / bird and be begin to glade /
for joy of the light / and for the time of their myrthe and of their kyndly
worchyng comes again by the presence of the son / which serves them
principally of light and of time The son rules them not propirly to speak.
but kind rules them in time. by the course of the son and by the course of
the bodies above we find in holy writ Genesis io.c. that the earth at the
bidding of god brought forth trees grass and erbe Trees and erbes brought
forth their fruit / each in their own kind The thridde day er god made
son / moan and sterres And bad the earth and yaue it virtue and nature to
bring forth grass and fruit of many and diverse kind He yaue not the son
ne the moon / ne the sterres that nature.

He made them the fourth. day to shine / and to be in tokenes of time to
all creatures here bynethe in earth.

God yaue grass trees and erbes diverse virtues and wounderfulle nature / to
bud and bring forth leaves fair and grene in diverse form / flowers fair
blossoms bright of diverse shappe and of diverse color that no man by craft
can deuyse. Also he yaue them nature to bring fruit fair and fine some in in
winter and su^me in somer Su^me he ordained in time to lose their leuys and
their grene head Su^me to be grene wi^ter and somer as lorel. box. holme yue:
and many mo / when other herbs sere and dry up / than in the cold wedyr
saffrone begi^neth to spring and with his flowers bringith his fruit Such
dyuersite in kind in tree and gras in be fisshe and foul / virtues so
diverse in stones and other things devised neuir ne made the son ne moan ne
the sterres / But he that made son moan. and sterres and al thing i^ kind he
made and ordained / and he governs and keeps all this each in his own kind
/ and has assigned each creature here byneth his due time / his nature to do
and to show In one land fallith hu^gre / in an other place ple^tye of all
gods. In one land is plentye of wine / in a another none In oo cuntre is
plentye of wolle good and clean / i^ a another little and full vnthende: In one
cuntre plentye of gold and silver / and of other metalle / in an other little
or naught. Sumtyme is moreyne generalle sumtyme percial. in oo cuntre and not
in an other Sumtyme in oo town and not in the next Sumtyme in ye one side of
the street and not in that other Su^me householde it takith up al hole and in
the next it takith noon Su^me dye in youth. and su^me in elde / su^me in
myddel age / su^me well su^me evil / su^me with little pain su^me with much
pain. How should men know or tell al yis diversity by the bodies above or
assign causes thereto / or to such other withouten nombre by the course of the
planetes /


The xxix. chaptre
Dives. It passith man's wit Ouly god that made al he knowith al. They ben
his domes his ordenaunce And therefore I let great folly that men entremette
them so high of gods domes / and namely of things that been to come. Butt I
pray the tell me if the wounders that fall against kind in the bodies above
betokenen.

or show any auentures. that been to come /


Pauper. That fallith against common course of kind betoknethe that some thing
is cu^mynge passing common course of kind / be it well. be it woo But commonly
such wounders fall more against woe thanne against welthe. as come / it is and
sterres brennynge castelles in the air / Eclipses of the son or moan against
kind / me^ in the air armyd or fighting. the raynbowe turnyd up so down /
mysshape things in their birthe ayenste kind These and such other that fall
against common course of kind / betoken that ye people where they appear / done
against kind / and that lord of nature is offendyd with them. and all
creatures ready to punysshe them.


Dives. It may well be as thou say for many such haf apperyd within a few
years / neuyr so many I trow in so little while. And much sorrow and woo
folowyth after. as we feel here and see. But I pray the what betokned that
wounderful comete and sterre which apperyd upon this land / the year of our
lord Athousande four hundryd / and ii. from the epiphany. till two wekes at
after ester. that was the myddel of Aprylle


Pauper. It was open token of the great offense of god. With the people of
england / and that hard wreche was cu^myng but they would amend them of her
falsehode and traytorye / periurye murdre / myspryde. i^ every degree and
ouirdone. couetyse. erroures and herises / blasphemye / and ydolatrye. lichery
and lesynges withouten shame / and other sins. many moo. not only preuy but
open to all cristendome and sclau^dre to all christian people. And for that men
repent them not ne wole not amend them. but put sin to sin / And by
sin of falsehode / murdre. and manslaughter / traueyl to mayntene their old
sins / therefore vengeance fallith as the sterre betoknyd. God of his mercy
smyteth not all at onys / but little and litel / that by the little me^ should
be war of the more Butt allas and welawey that no man wole be ware / no man
amend hi^ / but always do worse and worse.

They give no tale of gods sword / but every cu^tre is glade of others
disease / uneaths any man or woman has pity on other But nyghe every man is
glade of others woe And so I dread me that god will make an end. of this lord
/ for we love no pees we seek no mercy. Butte all our liking is all in were.

in woo. in murdre and / in shedynge of blood / in robbery / and falshode / and
our business / is by night / and day is to mayntene sin and to offe^de god
And more so welaway they have ordained a common law that what man speak with the
treuthe against their falshode / he shall be hanged drawn and be hedyd


Dives. Thy sawes been full soth and open at iye Every state and every degree.
in this land. is now youen to sin and besy to mayntene sin But I pray the
what say clerks of such cometes and sterres / so apperynge against the common
course of kind


Pauper They say that when it apperythe. it signifies moreyne or chaungynge
of some great prince / or destruction of some cu^tre / or cha^gynge of some
realm. or great werre or hunger or / wounderful tempest.


Dives. Werre hunger and tempest and moreyn we have had great plentye / and
many cuntrees in this realm ben distroyed. and chau^gyd into other lordshyp
and nation sithen ye sterre apperyd. And it is full like that in short time
both the king. and all the Realm shall be changed and distroyed.


Pauper. Solomon says that for gyle and traytoury and diverse wrongs and
dispites done to god and to holy church / realms be chaungyd from nation to
nation This matter is full heavy and dolefulle Speak we of sumwhat else.


The xxx. chaptre.
Dives. Al if it be so yt the iudicyal of astronomye. be rep^uyd of god and of
holy church / yet experience shewith that often they tell many treuthes of
things that been to come and of things preuy that been done


Pauper Sumtyme they happen to say such sothes / as the blind man kest the
staf And sumtyme they know such things / by other way than by astronomye /
and that they know by other weye they say that they know it by astronomye
For they would fayner be holden wise / and nerer of gods counseyl / thanne
any other.


Dives. How may they know any such things. on other half.


Pauper. Sumtyme by book of prophecy. sumtyme by conjecture of diverse causes
and disposiciones that gone before As if man give him to wicked cumpanye / or
use suspecte places / men that wot it. Wole coniecte thereof and say that in
time cu^mynge it shall be his confusion. Alsoo if a man mysdyete him and ete and
drink out of mesure / and thing that is not convenient to him men wol say
that he shall be seek thereof And if a man give him to false the kings seal or
the kings money / other will say that he shall be hangyd and drawn / and
commonly it fallith so Also they know things that been to come by coniectynge
of diverse tales and speech in the people / as if common clamoure of the people
be ayenste their king when their king trustith upon them / it is a token yt
the people shall undo him or he be ware And on this manner these days the most
part of the people been prophets and tell things yt been to come / which
things they ben about to perform. in heart word and deed And children alsoo
by that they here. their elders speak ben and have been prophets nigh i^
every house Also they know such things / by discuryng of cou^seyl or knowing
of counseyl of them that purpose such things And su^tyme they be of the same
counseyl and of the assente and helping thereto. And on this manner these
faytoures that been clepyd soth siggers and astronomoures / su^tyme tell
thingis preuy and do come again things that be stole or lost For commonly such
ben theuys / or of these assent And by one sothe saw or two which they know
on this manner / they blind the nyce people and make them to leave al their
lesynges And therefore if any such faytoure did any thing come again that were
stolen / he should be taken as a thief or a theuys feere. And commonly such
faitoures and iapers have masters to have pert of their wynnyng / as tauerners
brewers hostlers / and nedy werkelesse men that go so gay and spend great /
which aspy aftre things that been done in the cuntree / and that yet ben to
be done / and tell them to the faytours to do them have a name And often they
that should most keep counseyl. discure counseyl And so that men wend were
counseyl is no cou^seyl And commonly such faitoures be slye spekers / and
slighly can oppose the shepherde and the plow man i^ the field or su^me old
simple folk or children at the towns end / and axen how stoudith it among
neighbors / and about in the cuntree / And after that they tell them they
make hem wise / as if they knew it by astronomye. or by prophecye. or by
nigromancye And for asmoche as they be unknown / and tell sothes that men
know / the people wenyth that they know all things / and might know what
they would / and so leave in them till they ben all disceyued Su^tyme such
faitoures tell sothes not by their craft but by techyng and flauship of the
feend which is always ready if god suffered him to seche foles for to disceyue
them and other by them


The xxxi. chaptre.
Dives. How may the devil know things that been to come or any pryue syn /


Pauper. Better than any man / For as says saint Austyne / de natura
demonu^.xxvi. q^. iiii. sciendum. The feend is more sotyl of wit and ferther
can se and coniecte than any man. Also he is more light and deliver in steryng
and passinge For he is ten fold lighter than any foul i^ his fleing. Also he
may lightly know what is done in diverse cuntrees and lands He is so so tell
in kind that there may no door ne wall shytte him out of cou^seyl And so he
may here and se what men and women do though it be full pryue Also by long
experience / for they have lived so long they can tell and coniect by wey of
kind many things yt be to come / and can do many things yt pass mannys wit
Also often times that have leave of god for mannys sin for to do wounders / to
cause hidous tempests to enfecte and enuenym the air and cause moreyne and
sickness / hungre and droughte / discension / and werre by destruction of
charity / by myspryde couetyse lichery / wrath and envy / and such things as
they done / and pursue them to do and have done aforne and made other to do
they ca^ ne tell before Also by the signs of the body outward / they know
disposicion of man and woman inward / signs to health or to seknesse / to vice
or to virtue or often by toknes outward they know man's thought i^ward But for
asmoche as they may not not know for certain such things / for only god
knows for certain things yt ben to come / and often time god lettyth them of
their malice / when me^ wole amend them. Therefore the proud spirit will not
tell such things to the people i^mediatly by himself / but medyate by other
that set their feythe / and their trust in him / as been wytches faytoures
astronomoures yt if her sawes be found falls / they shall have the velonye If it
be found true. the feende shall have the worship Also they may know the
things that been to come by book of prophecy which they understand by
naturel wit bettre than any man.


The xxxii. chaptre.
Dives. Sothe it is yt nygh every sin be it neuir so preuy / it is done by
the techyng and tysyng of the feende And therefore wonder it is that any lichery
theft and mychery / murdre / lesinges or other sins may be hid and kept
preuy / sithen the feende knowith it so well / and may know things that been
so preuy by so many weyes as thou haste now seyde.


Pauper. Fulle feign would the feend discure mennys sin and woma^nes to
bring them to shame and velonye. and so to distroye charity and make every
man to sle other But god of his mercy lettith him. for he may naught do. ne
tell but as he has grant of god And therefore as we find in the gospel Mt.
viii.c. The feend might not enter into the swyne that went there bisydes / to
drenche hem / till he had grant of criste Also ^e might not disese Job neither
i^ his body / ne in his catel. till he had grant of god* Job. io. and iio.c.
And alive he could disceyue king Achab with lesynges and fair bihestes / to do
him to fight there he might a lived in peace / yet he might not do it till he
had grant of god. The third book of kings xxii. chapt He knows much
thing by the suffraunce of god / but he may naught do without grant and
permission or suffraunce of god. The feende is so feeble and so faint yt he may
ouircome no man ne woman by temptacion / butt he wole be ouircome of him /

Ne he may not dear the leeste child in the weye but if he have grant of
god. Which su^tyme / grauntyd him power thereto / for the syn of the fadre and
the modre.


Dives. Why suffers god him so much to tempte mankind.


Pauper. To moryng or encresynge of our bliss and of our mede For as says
saint Poule There is noman worthy to have the crown of life / but he withsto^de
the feende in gostly stryf And as he says i^ an other place / god suffers him
not to te^pt us / but as we may well withstonde / if we wole And if we fall he
has ordained to us remedy of penance / sone to rise again and better to fight
if we wol And al our te^ptacion shall turn us to mede if our will be to
withstonde.


Dives. Sithen the feende knows so many treuthes and wot what is done / for
he is at every wicked deed. me merueileth much why he is so ready to lie and
why he is so false


Pauper. For he hatith god that is souerayn treuthe / and for he might not be
even with god in soueraynte of treuthe / ne haf the name of souereyn treuthe
that is god / therefore his likyng and his trauayl is to be sovereign falshede
and souereynly false And therefore Christ says in the gospelle yt the feende
stood neuyr in treuthe / for there is no treuthe in him / when he speaks he
spekith lesynges / by weye of kind / for he is a liar and fader of lesynges.
Io. viii.c. And so whethyr his tale be true or false say he soth or false.
always he is false / always a liar.


Dives. How may he say treuthe and yitt lie. for if he say treuthe me thinks
he lies not.


Pauper. What so euir man or feende does or spekith against good conscience and
ayenste the plesaunce of god in will and intencion for to disceyue man woman or
child. it is a lesynge. and he is a liar yt does it or says it. And therefore
the law she with well.xxii. q^ ii. hoi^es. etc. is aute^ That if a man say a
treuth which treuth he wenyth be false if he say it for to disceyue his even
criste^ / in that he lies And so with a sothe saw / a man or the fend may
lie. as if I say to the that it were not day to let yt of thy journey wenyng my
self that it were not day all though it were as I said yet I lied And in the
same manner the feend tellith treuthis of things that been to come / and other
sothes also / wenyng him self that they be false And so in his sothe sawes he
lies / for he says that treuthe vnwyttyngly for disceit and wenyth to say
false. And if he say any treuthe wyttyng and willing / he says it only for to
disseyue men. and for a wicked end / and for to do folk with one sothe saw
leeue an hundryd lesynges / and so he is always falls and disseyuable. And
sumtyme he is compelled by the might of god to tell treuthes against his will
/ to shame and shenshippe of him and all his / as we find in the gospel Mt
viii. mar. i. Luce iiii. and vii.c. But for such sothe sawes is he neuir the
trewer. but always a false liar / for such sothe sawes ben against his will and
if he may he wole turn hem all to dissayte / and make men for such soth
sawes when they fall to leave al his lesynges And therefore he is clepid in holy
wryt Spiritus mendax spiritus fallax That is to say a spirit liar a spirit
disseyuable And therefore as the fendes had said the treuthe that crist
co^pellyd them to say / anon he put them to silence / as says the gloss in
the same place / for they would else under that sothsawe have told many lesynges


The xxxiii. chaptre
Dives. When he is coniuryd he is so bound. by virtue of holy words yt he
must nedys say truth which he knows if it be axed him


Pauper Such wyches and charmours iapers and faitoures that use such crafts
haf no power to bind him ne to co^plelle him to tell such sothes / ne right
naught for to do ne for to tell. For he may naught do ne tell withouten the
grant of god And therefore such iapers and wytches / bind not the feend but
the fee^d byndeth them full hard in his seruage / and kepith them thralles to
him passing al other / whose bondage is fulle hard to them for to escape
withouten a specyal grace of god.


Dives. Co^tra Often men know ye clerks close hem in rings and in other
things and make hem there to tell and do many wou^ders


Pauper. The The fend fayneth hi^ to be bound with such iapers words for to
disseyue them and other by them And yet is he not closed ne bound / but he
goth abroad as he did before / and when he is clepyd he is su^tyme ready to
answer for he is fulle swyfte / su^tyme he is not ready to answer / ne to
do their will / and often though he would he may not for god wole not suffer
him.


Dives. yet contrate Men wot well that i^ many lands prestes and clerks with
holy co^iuracions and holy prayers ordained of holy church cache wicked
spirytes out of me^ and wymen


Pauper. That is sothe and not only good lyuers. but wicked lyuers in many
lo^des catch feendes out of men and wymen and children by virtue of gods
word / and holy coniuracions and holy prayers ordained of holy church / and
sooner a good man or a good woman shall do that thanne a wyckyde. Such bind the
feend / and do him lose his power and his lordeship to shame and shenship of
hi^ and all his Such seek the worship of god and shenship of the feende and
help of man's soul And therefore they have power of god to bind him and to
compelle him But yet as says the gloss. mar. v.c. super illud Quod e^ tibi
nome^. They that been so traueyled with the feende must first be clean shreuen
as fer as they may and know and tell all the manner of the feendes doing / and
of the temptacion that they have either waking or slepynge by sight by herynge
by feeling. or by any of their wits / or by any thought or fantasye / and
disdiscure elle the feendes counseil But these wyches faitours and iapers. seek
the fendes worship not gods worship / They seek help of the feende and for
sake gods help / and do sacrifice to the feend and forsake god and take the
feend to there lord and make him their god And so the feend has power ouir
them not they ouir the fend.


The xxxiiii. chaptre
And therefore says the law xxvi. q^. vii. non obseruetis. That all such
wyches / and all that axe any cou^seil or help of them / or set any feyth i^
them or bring them to their houses. or go to their houses to have help or
counseyl of them / and all that take heed to dysmale days / or use nyce
obseruaunces in the new moon / or in the new year as setting of mete or
drynk by night on the benche / to feed Al hold. or gobelyn. Ledynge of the
plough about the fire as for good beginning of the year yt they should fare

or to diuynaciones by chyterynge of birds / or by fleing of fowls / or
assente to any such nyce obseruaunces / or dyuyne a man's life or death by
nombres and by the spear of Pyctagoras / or make any dyuynyng thereby / or by
songuary or sompnarye. the book of dremes / or by the book that is clepid the
apostles lottis or use any charms in gadering of herbs / or hanging of
scrowes about man or woman or child or be for any seknesse. With any
scripture or figures and carectes / but if it be Pater nost. Aue or the Creed /
or holy words of ye gospel / or of holy wryt for devotion not for curioustie.
and only with the tokene of the holy cross / and all that use any manner
wichecraft or any misbileue / that all such forsaken the feyth of holy
church / and their criste^dome / and bicome gods enmyes and grieve god fulle
grievously / and fall into dampnacion withouten end / but they amend them
the sooner / And therefore the law commands ye busshopes should be besy to
distroye all manner wychecraftes. And if they found any man or woman that yaue
them to wytche craft but they would amend them / they should chase them out
of their busshopryke. With open despyte xxvi. q^. v. ep^i. And in the same
place the law says that tho wymen which wene by night to ride on diverse
bestes and pass diverse lo^des and cuntrees and follow a glorious queen that
is clepyd Diana / or else herodiana. or any other name and wene yt they been
in her service bodilye with much myrthe / such wymen ben al disseyued and
blent with the feend whom they serve And therefore the feende has power for to
dysceyue them And that they suffer only by fantasy / by dreme / and by iapery
of the feende They wene it were so bodily and in deed and it is not so And al
tho that say or leave that men or wymen might by wychecrafte be turnyd i^to

thereto for to do it should be exiled for euyr And all manner wytches and all that leave on wytche craft should be acursed sole^nely / but they would amend
them. as the law says in the same place / and in the next chaptre following.
and co si quis. As the law says there: c. Contra. If the wytches were bond
men and wymen / they should be bete^ hard and sore If they were free they
should be punysshed i^ hard prison And by the law i^perialle vt.C. de
maleficiis nullus. and l. nemo. and l. culpa. And by ye law canon.xxvi. q^. v.

Dives. I let it a full good deed to take a theif. With his thyfte by what
craft that a man may for salvation of the people and to punysshe or sle a
theif by the law for ensample of other.


The xxxv. chaptre
Pauper. It is not leful to any man for to sle a theif against the kings law
and withoute^ process of lands law and withouten auctorite of his liege
lord. ne without a lauful judge ordained of his liege lord. and yet is ye
theif worthy to die


Dives. that is sothe For if every man might sle a theif at his own will and
by his own doom / men should under color of theif sle many a true man for
wrath couetyse. and hate.


Pauper. Sithen me^ do somoche reverence to the kings laws and lands laws
to fle myscheuys that should fall but if the laws were kept.

Much more reverence should they do to gods law and holy church law / and
eschew to forfete there against / sith gods laws and holy church laws ben
as reasonable and as good. as the kings laws of england Nathelesse the kings
laws if they be just they be gods laws. And asmany pereles and mo should
fall if men took theuys by witchecrafte against gods laws and holy church
laws / as if they slew them against the kings laws and the lo^des laws.


Dives. Show me that.


Pauper. If a man sle a theif not him defendante against the kings law. he
forfetith ayenste his king and is worthy death And if he make him a justice by
his own autorite. though he keep other process of law he is a traytoure to
his king. And asmoche and more forfetiy he against the king of heuyn / yt
takes a theif with wichecrafte. against gods law / sithen god and holy
church has forbode^ it / as does he that sleeth a theif against the kings
law. And sithen he makes the devil and the wytche that been most gods
enemies his judge / and worcheth by their doom in despyte of god that has
forbode^ it hem he is a full high traitor to god And so he does ten fold
more sin / and is worthy to be hanged more thanne a theif. More ouir in
asmoche as the feende is a liar always / ready to lie and with lesynges disseyuethe
mankind. and bringith me^ to murdre and to shedyng of blood / and rather to
sle innocents thanne thieves If such wytchecraftes were vsyd / many innocents
and many a good man and woman should be taken and slain and thieves goo free.
For the feende is more favorable to theuys / ma^quellers / lichoures and to
other synfulle wretches / thanne he is to any go^e man or woman / and more
liking he has to sle a good man or woman if he might / tha^ to sle a theif.
Also god says in the gospel that the feend has euir been a liar / and stood
neuir in treuthe. and that he is a man queller / and fader of liars / and of
lesynges. And therefore al tho that give faith to his tales and do thereafter /
as much as is in them / they make god falls and forsake their god that is
sovereign treuthe / and take them to the devil / that is sovereign falsehode /
and so they worship the feende and dispyse god And if such crafts were suffered
every man might accuse other. of what sin he would / and say that the feend or
the wyche told it him And on this manner every man might kylle other. And
therefore for these skylles and many moo and to fle these perelles and many
other / god has forboden all manner* wytchecrafte for it is not done
withoute^ help of the feend. But these days god of his mercy suffers not the
feend but fulle seldom to sothesawe. for if he suffryde him to soothsawe /
englisshe people. should forsake god all at onys and set their trust and
their faith all in the feend. For natwithstandynge that they find the
feendis tales and his craftis full false. by great and often experience / and
spend fulle great therabout. and lose all that they done and myshappen / yet
wole they not cease for no loss / for no prechynge / for no shame / ne for
no punysshynge. Neuirthelesse it is no great wou^der. for the fend holdith
them fulle hard bound. in his boondes as his churles and his thralles. For
all such done a passing homage / sacrifice and service to the feende / and
forsake god as I said first.


The xxxvi. chaptre
Dives. Such crafts and coniuraciones with holy prayers and they that done
hem been holden fulle good lyuers / and and give them to fasting / penance
doing / bedys bydding and to many other good dedys: and therefore men give the
more faith to them. and leave them ye better. For it is not semely that the
feendes craft should be done with such holiness


Pauper. The more holy thing and the more holy prayer that man or woman vsyth
in the feendes service. the more worship and the more plesaunce they do to the
feend. and the more dispyte and offense do they to god For the worship and
the prayer and the service. that they should do to god they do it to the
feende. And thing that is ordained only to gods service / they spend it in
the deuylles service. And therefore they that use holy words of the gospelle.
Pater noster Aue. or Creed. or holy prayers i^ their wychecraftes / for charms
or coniuraciones / and all that use holy water of the font / holy crysme /
messes singing / fasti^g contynence / wolwarde going and such other in their
wytchecrafte they make a fulle high sacrifice to the feende It has often been
known that wyches with sayng of their Pater noster. and droppynge of the holy
candel in a mannys steps that they hatyde has done his feet rote of.


Dives. What should the Pater. noster. and the holy candel do thereto.


Pauper. Right naught But for the wytche worshypeth the feende so highly with
the holy prayer / and with the holy candel / and vsyth such holy things in
his service / in dispyte of god Therefore is the feende ready to do the wytches
will / and to fulfylle thing that they done it for. and so it sto^deth only in
the devil and in mysbyleue of the wyche not in the Pater noster. ne in the
holy candel / and yet the fools wene otherwise. For the feende would not do
their will but they do him such high sacrifice. For when that they light
ye candel and say Pater noster / to that end / they do it not to god. but to
the feend. And in that they forsake god. and worship the feend as god. and
claim the feende to their fader / saying to him that they should sey only to
god. Pater noster qui es in etc. Our fader that art in heuenes. halowyde be
thy name And all that folowyth they sey it to the feende. And therefore the
fee^d may cleyme hem for his children. and god may skylfully forsake them and
say to them yt he said to the iewys. Vos facitis opera patris vestri / vos ex
patre diabolo estis / et desideria patris vestri vultis facere. io. viii. ye
done says he the works of the feende your fadre / ye been of the fader the
deuel. and the desires of your fadre ye wole do And on the same manner their
chastity / their fasting her penance doing is i^ asmoche as they do it to
plese ye feende and for a wicked end / it is a service and a sacrifice to the
feende And full few men or wymen wole do so much penance for the love of god
/ as wytches do for the love of the fend / and to please the feende / in so
much that sumtyme they cut them self with knyues / and pryke he^ self with
launcettes / and so offer their flesh and their blood i^ sacrifice to ye
feend / as we find i^ the third book of kings xviii chaptre. And therefore
leave friend sithen this manner of sin is so grievous / so hydous and so
abhomynable in gods sight / suffer it neuir to be do by none of your
householde / for no loss ne no thyfte / for no sickness / for no health /
for no welthe for no woe. For if ye do it your self / or do it to be done / or
asse^t to the doing or suffer it to be done when ye might let it / ye been
acursed and offend your god full highly and fulle grievously For all that do it
or assente to the doing / and set their feyth therein / they forfete against
the first commandment full grievously For in that they forsake god / and make
the feende their god / and worshype him as god. And by what thing that they do
their wychecraft / be it fire / be it air. or water / or earth. or deed bones
/ or any other thing that is in their mawmet and that they make simylitude to
god. asmoche as in them is. and worship it as god And therefore god bade in the
first commandment. that man should not make him liknesse that is in heuyn
that is to say / neither in the fir / mament. ne in the fire / ne in the air
And so in that word he forbedyth the iudicyal of astronomye. and pyroma^cie /
that is wychecrafte done in the fire / and aeromancye that is wychecraft done
in the air Also he forbedyth men to make them likeness of any thing that is
i^ earth In that he forbedith geomancy that is wychecrafte done in the earth.
And also nygroma^cy that is wytchecrafte done by deed bodies that been but
earth. and buried in the earth: Also he forbedith men to make them simylitude
of any thing in the water under the earth. In which word he forbedith
ydromancy. that is wychecrafte done in the water He badde that men should
worship none such things as god / ne set their trust ne her faith therein
/ For if they do they make such things like god / i^ asmoche as in them is.
And not oonly they make such things like god in this manner / but alsoo they
make the feendes like god / which duel su^me in the fire. su^me in the air /
su^me in the water / and some in the earth / for to tempte mankind / and been
besy night and day to lose man's soul and womanes.


Dives. Show me su^me example of thies manner of wychecraftes.


Pauper. I am besy for to distroye wychecraft and not for to teache it. But
would god that no man ne woman wyste what it is / ne knew thies ne none other
/ for there ben all to many yt know these and many mo there to / and practyse
new year by y^re / at the feendes techynge / tylle much of this land is
blent and shente with such folly. For ouyr much wychecraft regneth openly /
but much more pryuely / and namely among these old men and wymmen / the
which for age would feign be holden wise. And thanne begin thy most to
dote and to teache their younger / many folyes and many nyce fantasies / that
been verry wychecraftes And therefore both old and young should axe counseyl of
wise men of holy church / and wit if such things and doings as they teache.
be lefulle or not lefulle.


The xxxvii. chaptre
Dives. By common sawes of clerks god in the first commandment forbedyth
three principal sins / Pride that is understand by the likeness above in
heuyn / for there it began. And the proud man and woman. Would always be above
and worship his pride as god For the proud man and woman / wole have forth
their proud wylles nyle god will god And therefore Job says that the proud
fee^d is king of al children of pride And as seint poule says / proud
anticryst shall have him as god. and sytte in gods temple as if he were god
Also they sey that god forbade there the sin of couetice / that is
understand by the lyknes in earth / for myscouetitse stondith most in erthly
thing. And therefore saint poule says. that auaryce is seruage of mawmettes of
ydolatrie For as says saint Jerome / the auerous man makith his money and his
richesses his god Also they say / that by the same co^maundment he forbade
lichery and glotenye which been understand by the likeness in the water
under the earth For as saint poule says Lechoures and glutones make their
womb and there body their god For their most trauail and business is to
please. and serve. their womb and their belly.


Pauper. In asmoche as every sin is ayenste the worship of god / in somoche
god in the first co^maundment forbedith al manner sin in generalle But as I
said by the first co^maundme^t. he forbade i^ special mawmetry. ydolatrye
wychecrafte and sorcery For afterward he yaue the iiii. mau^dme^t specialy
against pride and vnbox^nesse. and the sexte. and the tenthe against lichery /
the vii and the nynthe against avarice and couetise.


The xxxviii. chaptre.
Dives. It is lefulle to use lottes.


Pauper. Su^tyme to break stryf in partynge and yeuynge of thing that may natt
well be departed Or when men been in doubt what is to do and mannys wit
fails. thanne is it leful to use lottes i^ things that been not ayenste the
worship of god. so that it be done with the reverence of god / and holy prayer
before / as thapostles did in chesynge of saint mathie. the appostle / and
eliezar in chesyng of a wife to ysaac abrahames sone. gen^. xxiiii.c. And
therefore solomon says Prouerbi. xvi c. that lottes ben put in preuy place /
and god temprith them as he wole But to use lottes withouten need: and only for
vanytie. or for diuynacion / setting faith therein to wytt thereby what shall fall
/ is unlawful and repreuyd of god and holy church And if me^ set trust and
feyth therein it is a grievous sin.


Dives. Pleyng at the dyce stondeth in lotte and adventure of the dyce / and yet
ye game is lefulle


Pauper. To use that game for recreacion / and only for pley it may be
suffryde. so that it be done in manner honestly. and in place and time
co^uenyent / and natt to much in lesynge of time But for to use it for to win thereby. and put things in adventure. of dice / it is a fulle great
sin and evil gotten good / that men get thereby. And therefore by the law if
it were a man of holy church yt vsyd such pley / he should be pryued of his
benefice. if yt he had any. And if he had no benefyce he should be unabled
/ and disposed thereto but if he would cease. And if it were a leude man. he
should be acursed. disti. xxxv. ep^s Et extra de vita and honestate clericoru^.
co. clerici. And therefore says the law. that no man of holy church should be
at such games.


The xxxix. chapter.
Dives. Sithen there be so many manners of wytchecraftes yt they may not be
told. in specialle / I pray the tell me in generalle. What is wychcraft


Pauper. Every craft that man or woman uses to know any thing or to do any
thing that he may not know ne do / by the wey of reason ne by the worchi^g of
kind. is wychecrafte. And though it be do by wey of kind and the doer use any
charms or nyce obseruau^ces in the doing wenynge that it might not be done
withouten that charm / and such obseruaunce or else such charms only to
blind ye people. that they should trust in him for his charms / and not i^
worchi^g of kind It is wichecrafte al if he say only his Paternoster. in the
doing for to be holde^ a charmer. and to do the people trust in him principally
for charms / although he say no charms but worcheth only by kind / yet he
is a wytche and his doing is wytchecrafte For by such doing. he blyndeth the
people and disseyueth them / and does them trust i^ wychecraft / and so do
worship to the feende and dispyte to god And what soeuir man or woman do by
weye of kind and reason. if he use any craft of iapery and faitre for to blind
the people. for to do them leave that he were a wytche / and that he did it not
by weye of kind / but by charms and sorcery / he is a wytche in gods sight
/ and his doing is wytchcrafte For his craft is to make men worship the feend
in asmoche as he does the people trust in wichcraft / and so spe^de their good
in the feendes service and to seek help of the feende. and forsake gods
help. And he has leuyr him selue to be holden a wytche and the deuylles
servant: thanne to be holden gods servant / and leuyr to take me^nys good
in worshypynge of the feend thanne in worshipynge of god And by the cu^nynge
and grace that god has youen him / and by the might. and virtue that god
has youe^ to things of kind for help of mannys kind. falsely he enha^cyth
the feendes craft in destruction of mankind:


Dives. Tell some ensample.


Pauper. To hele man's wou^des while they be fresshe and clean / black wolle
and oil been full medicynable withouten any charm as experience shewith well
But for asmoche as me^ wene that it were naught worth withouten the charm. and
set their feythe principaly in the charm / therefore it is to them a wyche
craft. But though a man in the doing say his paternoster. or some holy prayer
clepynge the grace of god in his doing it is no wytche craft but it is well
done


The xl. chaptre.
Dives. What if he say Paternost. or other holy words / or some holy prayer
pryuely or aperte / for to do the people wene that it is done by weye of
miracle and for his payer and his holiness / when he does it by reason and
worchyng of kind


Pauper. Than is it a full great ypocrisye and full greuouse syn in him that
does it on that manner and for that end / but wychecraft is it none For it is
no worship to the feendes craft / ne ye people is stired thereby to trust in
the feende but rather in god.


Dives. Is it any wychecrafte. to charm edders or other bestes and birds /
with holy words. of holy writ or with any other holy words


Pauper. If a man or woman take heed i^ his doing only to the holy words and
to the might of god / it is no wychecrafte. But if they use in their doing any
mysobserua^ce and set more trust therein than in holy words or in god /
tha^ne as say clerks it is wychecrafte. And the effect thereof if it fall
comes of the feende / and namely in adders and serpents For the adder was the
first instrument that the feende used for to disseyue mankind / as we find
Genesis. iii.c. And yet by the adder he does men most trust i^ wytchecrafte.


Dives. Is it any perel to man or woman to charge his friend i^ his dyi^g to
come aye^ and tell him how he faryth


Pauper. It is a full great perel. For as says saint poule. the feend often time
makith him like an aungel of light. But he may not last in the beauty ne
brightness. And so lightly the feend might appear to him that were alive in
the lyknesse of him that were / deed. and tell him lesynges / and in case make
him so aferyd that he should lose his wit / and fall i^ wanbileue / as fell
to one with in a few years. And happily he should tell him that he were
da^nyd. though it were not so. Or tell him that he were in bliss. though he
were in byttre pain. and so let him of his almesdede and from holy prayer
and other good deeds by which not on lie that soul should be helped / but many
other with him Also if he aperyd to him / or if he we^de that he appeared to
him he should have the less mede for his believe. thanne he had before For
thanne were he cachyd by experience to know that the soul lives after the
body Also it is not in the souls power to appear to man or woman after the
death of his body / ne man is not able to se a soul. for it is invisible
withoute^ special miracle of god. And so both he yt chargith him to come again
/ and he yt hotith to come again tempten god. And right as god wol that every
man and woman be uncertain what time he shall dye / for that always he should be
dredeful to do amys and besy to do well Right so he wole that men be uncertain
of their fre^des when they ben deed in what state that they been / for that
they should always be besy. to help there souls with messes singing. alms
doing / with bedys byddyng / and other good deeds not only for help of hi^ but
of other that have little help or none Also for encresyng of their own mede
For who so trauayleth well for a another trauaylith best for him self For as
says saint poule. there shall no good deed be vnyolde^ / ne no wicked deed be
unpunished.


Dives. Thy skylle is good. For if men wist yt their friends were out of pain
they would do right noght for them And so they should lose much mede for that
knowing and souls lose much help And if men wist for certain when they
should dye. they should be to bold to do amys in hope yt they should amend them
in their diynge

But yet not withstondynge all thy skylles / sum clerks said that it is
lefulle to men to charge their friends to come again and show them her state
after their death For as they say it is kyndely thing for to desire to know
or to ku^ne. For the philosopher says that every man and woman by wey of kind
desires to know and to ku^ne. Omnes hoi^es natura scire desiderant.


Pauper. They say sothe / and not against me For it is leful to every manand
woman to desire to cu^ne and to know / But it is not leful for to desire to
know on that manner / ne by no mean unlawful not by teching of the feende / ne
by techynge of them yt been deed.


The xli. chaptre.
Dives. How is it that spirytes walk so about. When men be deed.


Pauper Commonly such spirits ben fendes / and go so about to sclaundre them
that been deed / and for to bring the people into error and bacbityng and
wicked demyng that if ye people demyd evil and spoke evil of them before their
death / to do them speak and deem much worse aftre their death and so to bring
the people full deep in sin And su^tyme they gone i^to ye bodies of heym yt ben
deed. and buried / and bear it about to do them vilony. But when spirits goo
on this manner. they do much harm and much disese Natheles by the leave of god
the souls appear i^ what manner god wole to hem that been alive su^tyme for to
have help / sumtyme to show that the soulis live after the body to conferme
them that been feeble in the feyth and bileue not sadly / yt man's soul lives
after his death But such spirytes do no harm but to tho that wole natt leave
them that they have such pain / or wole not redily help hem at their axynge.


The xlii. chapter.
Dives. Is it leful to trust i^ these fasti^ges new found. to fle sodeyne death


Pauper. It is a great folly to trust therein For as I said now late. god wole
that man and woman be uncertain what time they should dye / and in what manner
For god wole that man and woman. be always besy to fle sin / and to do well
for dread of death and always ready what time god wole send aftre them. And if
men were certain / by such fasting that they should not die suddenly but have
time of repentance / and to be shreuyne and houselyde. they should be the.
more rechelesse in their living and the less tale give for to do amys in
hope of amendment in their diyng And therefore god grauntyth them not the end
ne the effect that they fast for For more sodeyn death wyste I neuir that men
had thanne I wyste them have that have fastyd such fastes vii. year about /
ne more dispytefulle and shamefulle. in open punysshyng of their syn and was
their neuir so much sodeyn death so long reignynge in this land as has be
sith such fasting began / we may not art god ne put him to no laws And
therefore we should put all our life and our death only in his will / praynge
to hi^ of his grace that he wole ordeyn for us both in life and death / as it is
most to his worship and help of our soul It is well done tor pray to god
with fasting and good dedys that he save us from sodeyne death / for all holy
church prays so But for to set feyth in such nyce obseruau^ces and wene to
be syker of their axynge for such obseruaunces yt is not lefulle / for we may
not know the will of god in such things without special reuelacio^ of god. We
may pray and owe to pray but god shall grant as him likes / and as he sees
yt it is most spedeful to us and most to his worship And therefore solomon
says. Nemo sit vtru^ amore an odio dignus sit Eccle. ix.c. No man he says
wot sykerly whether he is worthy hate or love And yet we hope / and owe all
to hope yt god would love us and save us if we do our devour Fasting is good if
it be done in mesure and manner and with good i^te^cion / so that men set no
mysbyleue therein / ne ground them in no lesynges ne in no nyce obseruau^ces
But in asmoche as they prefer in their fasting days of their own choice
before tho days that been ordained by holy church to fast / in somoche. they
sin in presumption and do p^iudice to holy church yt ordained such days
that been most co^uenye^t to fast as wednesday fridaye and saturday. De
co^se. distinc. iii. ieiunia etc. sabbato.


Dives. I se no ground ne reason in such fasting / ne why it should be more
medeful to fast all mondayes in the year when the feast of our lady in lent
fallyth on monday / thanne to fast in worship of her wednesdaye. friday or
saturday. For I leave sykerly that the mede of fasting ne the virtue of fasting
is not assigned ne limyted by ye letters of the kale^der ne follow not the
course of the calendar / ne cha^gith not from one day to an other day. al if the
lettres change from one day to a another And so as me thinks such fasting is
groundyd in some lesyng and faytre and in some mysbileue fulle nigh wichecraft.


Pauper. Me thinks the same For all if ye feast fall sumtyme on the monday
/ sumtyme on the tuesdaye. yet the deed in it self fell neither on the mo^day
ne on the tuesday but it fell on the friday For than the aungel great our lady
and than she conceived gods son. lord of bliss And three and thritty year.
after the same time and the same day that is to sa yon good friday about mydday
she saw her dear son diynge for mankind upon the rode tree. And so me
thi^keth that it is more plesaunt to god and to our lady and more co^uenyent
to fast the friday in worship of criste / that dyed for us all that day And
also in worship of our lady that conceived that day her dear son at the
au^gelles greting than to fast either monday or tuesday And in as much as they
wene that such fast should not auayl them to the end that they fast fore but
if they chaungyd their fast year by year after the course of the calendar. and
that it must be do vii. year by year / it is a nyce fantasy and mysbilene
fulle nigh wichecrafte For Christ might grant them that boon aswele for five
year or for six. or eight year fasting as for vii. year. I found neuyr
ground whereof it came ne reason ne auctorite find I none Axe forth if thou
will su^what else.


The xliii. chapter.
Dives. Is it lefulle to set any trust or any feyth on dremys


Pauper. There been ii. manner causes of dremys / Done from inward / a another
from outward Causes of dremes from inward ben three manner: Done is common
stirynge of man's fa^tasye. or woman's in their sleep. and such dremys ben but
fantasye and vanyte And therefore says Solomon Vbi multa somnia: ibi multe
vanitates. eccle. v.c. Where been many dremys there ben many vanyties / for on
this manner one man shall have moo dremys than su^me tuenty other A another cause
from inward is disposicion of the body. For when men ben cold of kind. they
dreme of frostes and snow. And so by their dremys a wise leche may know in
party disposicion of her body / be it to health or to sekenes The thridde cause
from inward is. disposicion of the soul For commonly men dremen of such
things as her soul and their thought is most occupied in while they waken /
either by study / by love / or by hate / by wrath / by dread / by sorrow / by
care pride or couetise Causes of dremys from outward ben two manner / bodily
and gostly Bodily is the disposicion of the air. and of the place about him /
and other things beside him. And therefore in rain wedyr me^ dreme of water
and of fisshes. For often mannys body chau^gith after the disposicion of the
air / and of his abidynge place And for these three causes says the
philosopher. De somno et vigilia. That leches should take heed to the dremys of
them yt been seek. to know thereby how they been disposed. Gostly causes from
outward of dremys been ii. manners. The one cause is good / for that is god by
him self. Or else by aungelles / and that on three manner For some such dreme
by ymaginacion only / as did the king pharo and nabugodonosor. Some only by
vndersto^di^g as did saint poule and balaam Su^me dreme both by ymaginacion and
by understanding. as did saint John in apocalips / and danyel in his prophecy /
which saw wounderful sightes by ymaginacion and vnderstondi^g what tho
sightes betokenyde But pharo and Nabugodonosor understood not the visiones ne
the dremes that they had The other cause of dremes from outewarde is not good
as when it fallith by illusion of the feend for tho principally serve to
wytchecrafte Sumtyme they come of great business and trauayl. that one has
when he is waking. And therefore Solomon says that after business follow
many dremys* for commonly me^ dreme of such things. as they been occupied in
while they wake. Su^tyme they come of ouir done abstinence and of hungre.
Su^tyme it comes of excess of mete or drink Sumtyme of myslikynge ye man
has wha^ne he is waking And in asmoche as the effect of things is toke^ of
his causes / as smoke is toke^. of the fire So such dremys ben tokenes of
causes that they come of And on this manner a wise man may tell by dremys
causes of mennys dremys / and so by causes tell other preuy things that may
fall thereof For oftyme one cause brings forth diverse effects. each after
other.


Dives. Tell su^me examples.


Pauper. Experience shewyth that if a man trete much with a woman and set
his heart much on her by day. in the night following he dremyth of her some
nyce dreme. by which dreme if he told it to su^me wise man. he would say that
he louyd much that woman. and but he with drew him from her cumpany / it should
turn him to velony. And so as say clerks in asmoche as dremys come by way
of kind / in so much it is leful to tell what they signify after the causes
that they come of So that in their tellinge and coniectynge they pass not the
bounds of kind. Also it is leful to tell things that been to come. by
dremys that come by reuelacion of god / if man and woman. have grace to
understand them as Joseph and danyel had. But for asmoche as dremys come on
so diverse manners / and it is full hard to know* on what manner they come /
whether by god. or by kind / or by the feende / or by any other weye. Therefore
it is fulle perilous to set any feyth therein. as says saint Gregoure libro
viiio moru^. super illud Job Terrebis me per sompnia. For sumtyme by dremes the
feende. hoteth men great prosperity and much richesses / to bring them in
pride and hope of things thatt they should neuir have Sumtyme by dremes he
pretendith much aduersite and great disease for to bring folk in sorrow and
dread / and great heaviness / and if he may to bring them into dipeyre. for nyce
fantasies that he brings hem in And sumtyme for men set feyth in such
dremys / god suffers such myscheuys fall them as their dremys pretend in
punysshyng of their sin / for that they set in dremys against the law of
god. But prosperity fallith them none for no such dremynge.


Dives. Where fyndest thou that god forbedyth men to set feyth in dremys.


The xliiii. chaptre.
PAuper. Leuiti. xix c. Where god says thus. Non auguriabimini / nec
obseruabitis sompnia. ye shall not divine / ne make you wise of things preuy by
no wychecraft / and ye shall vayte after no dremys ne take heed thereto / ne
set feith therynne. Also deutronomii. xviii. God forbedith all manner
wytchecraftes and charms / and bids that no man should take heed to dremes
And in the same book xiii.c. god says thus. If it be so says he yt any man
emo^ges you begin to be a sothe sayer and a prophet and say that he had a
dreme and a vision / and tell any wounder / which wounder and token fallith
as he says / if he stire the to mawmetry or to any wytchecrafte / here not
the words of that prophet and of that dremer. For by him god assaieth you /
that it may be openly known whether ye love him with all your heart and soul
or nay And therefore god byddeth that such dremers and prohetes should be slain
and though he went thy own brother by fader and by mother thou should not
spare him in ye caas. And therefore Solomon says that dremys have brought
much folk in error and in folly. and they that trust therein fall to
naught. Ecclesi. xxxiiii.c. For all if dremys come often times by wey of kind
as I said yet it is full hard to know wha^ it c^meth / by wey of kind or by
illusion of the feed And though they come by wey of kind and though a man
know the causes i^ kind of dremes / yet it full hard to tell sothly what shall
fall thereof. For only god knowythe for certain things that been to come / and
he may change and let the worchynge of kind And also though men know the
causes of kind that dremes come of / yet know they not what lettynges ben on
other bihalue / by way of kind.


Dives. Tell some example.


Pauper. When smoke medlyd with fire comes out of an house by the wyndow or
by the louerys / men that seen it from far wole say that house shall goo on
fire. And yitt there may be so good help nighe to que^che the fire / that ye
house shall take but little harm. And many a man by weye of kind is disposed to
diverse sickness. but yet he may so govern him. and use such medicynes that
he shall let ye disposicion in kind and not have such seknesses


Dives. By the same skylle though a dreme come of gods sonde to help of
man's soul. and in warning of myscheyf. to come / he should take noon head
thereto. ne set no feyth therein For he wot neuyr of whens it comes:


Pauper. Withouten reuelaco^n of god he wot neuir of whens it comes. And
therefore when god sendyth such dremys / he shall show to him that dremythe
this / or to some other from whe^s it cu^myth / and what it betokens As he
did to the king pharo by Joseph / and to the king Nabugodonosor. by danyel.


The xlv. chaptre.
Dives. If man or woman have a dreme that styreth him to good and to virtue /
and to flee sin. and to amend his life / may he not set feyth therein. and do
thereafter.


Pauper. Whether it comes of god or of ye fee^d it is lefulle to him to set
faith therein and to do thereafter For it styreth him to thing that that he is
bound to withouten any dreme. And often time both the feend and the feendes
lymes teache well / al if they do evil. But a man so dremynge must be fulle
ware / that for such dremys he take noon head to other dremys that stire him
to vanyte or to curiouste for to know things that been to come / or other
things preuye / or to mysdeme of his even christian / or to hate or to mysloue /
or to vaite after great prosperity / or to dread great aduersite. or death of
friends / or loss of catel / and such other. But in asmoche as they styre hi^
to god and to godenesse / he may follow his dremys and do after them wisely and
warly / for often the feende under color of holiness disceyueth both man and
woman.


Dives. Much folk had leuyr dreme of the feende than of god or of his mother
mary. for as they say when they mete of the feende. they fare well in the day
following / but when they dreme of god or of our lady they fare evil afterward.


Pauper. Such folk fare the worse for their mysbileue and their nyce fantasy.
and sin full grievously. and evil be disseyued by the gyle of the feend. For
when the feend sees that a man shall have disease / he makes him on the
night before to mete of god. and of our lady / and of other seyntes / or of
men of religion / so to make him to have less devotion to god and our lady
and other seintes / and less affection to me^ of religion because of his
disease that shall fall to him after that dreme And so by the bodily disease
that he thinks to bring him in / he traueyleth to bring him into gostly
disese and deep in sin And therefore when me^ wole be foles. and set feyth
to such dremys yt come so by gyle of the feende for asmoche as disease fallyth
to them onys or tuyes after such dremys Therefore god suffers the feende in
punysshyng of their sin and of their mysbileue for to do them dreme often of
such manner / and after to do them disese as they believe to have And therefore
when men had such dremys with disese so following and began to have any
fa^tasy or feyth therein / they should shryue them thereof to some wise man and
tell him the feendes gyle / and they should fare the better. Su^me mete of god
and our lady and of holy men / yt have fare fulle well afterward for they have
no such fantasye ne mysbileue in dremes And some fare full evil after for
their mysbyleue / and often time they fare full evil when they mete neither of
god ne of our lady.


The xlvi. chaptre.
ON the same manner. some man had leuyr to mete with a froude or a frogge in
the way / than with a knight or a squier / or with any man of religion. or of
holy church / for than they say and leave that they shall have gold For sumtyme
after the metyng of a frogge or a tode / they have resceyued gold / and so
they fall in mysbileue and dispysen their even christian For well I wot that
they resseyue gold of me^ or of wymen but not of frogs ne of todes / but it
be of the deuel in lyknesse of a frogge or a tode And they mete with many a foul
frogge and tode in the year and yet resceyue they no gold for ye metyng And if
they resseyued any gold. they should thank god and their even christian / not
the frogge ne ye tode for they may naught give them And these laborers deluers
and dykers that most mete with frogs and todes. been fulle pore commonly And
but me^ pay them their hyre they have little or naught On this manner also some
bileue yt if the kyte or the puttok fle ouir the way before them that they should
fare well that day / for su^tyme they have fare well after that they see the
puttok so fleing And so they fall in wane believe. and thank the puttok of
their well fare and not god But such foles take none head how often men mete
with the puttok so fleing / and yet they fare neuir the better. For there is no
folk that mete so often with the puttoke so fleing as they yt beg their mete

Dives. What say thou of them that divine by the first day of the year.
that is the first kalendes of January. and by Cristmasse day what shall fall in
the year following That if it fall on the sunday / the winter following shall be
good / somer good and dry. plentye of wine Oxen and sheep shall wex and
multiplye / Old men and wymen shall dye. and peace and accord shall be made
that year.


Pauper. I say that it is open folly and wychecrafte / and full high offense
of the majesty of god. For he yt made al thing and rules all thing is not
bounden ne arted to ye course ne law of the calendar He nedith no calendar in
his governance But he governs and demythe this world by treuthe and equity
medlyd with mercy / and after ye men deserve he sendith them woe and welthe /
peace or war / what day soeuir the kalendes of January or Crystmasse fall on.
In the year of our lord a thousand and four hundryd / the kalendes of
January fell on the thursdaye when as they say should follow plentye of all
good and pees also but that year following great hungre / great pestilence /
sodeyn death. War fell within the lord and werre without / dread sorrow and
care / and tribulacion in every degree. The kalendes has chau^gyd sithen from
day to day. and ye year is come aye^ on the thursdaye / but our disease
chaungith not but always i^to worse for our sin. For our sin always moreth
or encreasith and lessyth not And on what day euyr the kalendes of January and
Cristemasse day fall in one land / the same day it fallyth al about. And
yet folowyth it not thereof yt it should be ouir al peace if it fall on the
thursday or the sunday. ne ouir all plentye / ne ouir all war and hungre or
pestilence. if it fell on the saturday.


Dives. Su^me divine by the thu^dryng. and make them wise of all the year
cu^mynge / after the month yt it thundreth in.


Pauper. And that also is an high folly and open wytchecrafte For it is a
kyndly thing in somer time to thundre in may. apryl / Iuyn. july. auguste and
septe^bre But in other months yt been in winter it is not so kyndly to
thu^der as than For when great thu^der i^ winter fallith / it is against kind
and token of the high offense of god and token of vengeance coming: but if
men amend hem And so is every thing / and namely wederynge that fallith
against common course of kind. But for to divine thereby in specyalle what shall
fall either well or woe / peace or war / hungre or plentye / health or seknesse
/ it is unlawful For only god knowith for certain what is to come of such
things / and where and when it shall fall. And god uses not the thundre as an
horn to blow his counseyl about the world


The xlviii. chapter
Dives. It is a common opynion among gentiles. and others also / that all the
year follows the disposicion of ye xii. days in Crystemasse. So yt the first
month shall be such in wederyng as the first day of ye tuelue / the secounde
month as the secounde day / and so forth by and by.


Pauper. That oppinyon is false / and open folly For it is a full kyndly thing
to have frost and snow all the tuelue days. But it were against kind to have
froste and snow all the year following. And sumtyme it fallyth that it is full
reynye wedyr. all the xii. days / but it folowyth not thereof that it should
rain and be wete wedyr all the year after It is fulle kyndely thing that the
su^ne show him not three days or iiii. to gider in cristemasse. but it were
much against kind if the son showed him not three months or iiii. to gyder
namely in somer time And often it fallyth that in all the tuelue days it
rayneth no rain / but every day son shine. and fulle fair wedyr / but it
folowyth not thereof that it should be son shine withouten rain all the year
afte / for than be and man should be in great perel At the beginning of the
world the feend highte adam and eve / yt they should be as gods knowing good
and wyckyde yt was to come / if they would ete of the tree ayenste gods
p^cept. and so he brought them into care and sorrow / and into her folly. And
on the same manner these days he bihoteth me^ to be as gods knowing well and
woo / thatt is to come. by such nyce fantasies yt he techith them till that he
brings them in woe and namely e^glisshe naco^n that most takyth head to his
lore / and most takes head to wychcraft and to them that make them prophets
and make them wise i^ such folyes against the law of god


The xlix. capter.
Dives. Is it not leful to them that can. to make metal gold or silver / and
multiplye gold and silver from xx. pound to xl. pound / and so forth


Pauper. If any man could do it by weye of kind / it were leeful / and full
proufitable to this land But well I woote there is no man that can do it: For
if they could they would first multiplye to them self ward and make them
self rich And commonly all that use that craft but if they have ought else
for to tak to. been full pore and full nedye. But when they may begyle any man
of his good / as they do fulle often. and re^ne away with oeher mennys gods /
and of the rich make full pore men. They hoten them multiplication butt they
pleye all with subtraction and bring folk into great poverty Little nedyd
our king to charge the people with taxes and taliages / if he had so much
folk in his Realm yt could do that craft. to make gold. and silver and so
to multiply it But such iapers and faytoures distroye much gold and silver
in destruction of the Realm / and blind many a wise man / and begyle them of
their good. For the couetouse and the false accord sone to gider And for
asmoche as when men have enough and been not content therewith / therefore god
suffers them to be begiled / and so be sotted for couetise that they can not
cease till they be brought to naught or to ouir great loss / for many a man
has be undone by this craft And therefore this craft is condemned and
forfendyd as wychecrafte by the law xxvi. q^. v. Epu^s


The l. chaptre.
Dives. What say thou of them that wole natt have men of holy church. and
namely men of religion with them on huntyng / for their bileue is that they
should speed the worse because of their cumpany.


Pauper. I pray to god ye evil mote they speed / as often as they take any man
of religion / or of holy church to go or to ride with them on hunting For such
hu^tynge with horn and hounds. and great noise / is forfendyd to men of holy
church. Extra.li.iii. tio vltimo: ne clici. c.i. et li.v. tio xxiiii. De cle.

Dives. What say thou of hem that when they go on hu^tyng or pass by the
way. if they mete with a man of holy church or of religion / and namely with
a friar / they wole leave him on their left hand For by that they we ne to
speed the better / and the wors if they leave him on their right hand.


Pauper. I say that such been of false bileue and wytches ^eres And but they
amend them god shall putt them from his right hand. and put them on his
left hand with them yt shall be dampened at the day of dome / and send them
into the pyt of hell withouten end. I would al such were served as one was
fulle late.


Dives. How was he served.


Pauper. There came a proud gettuer riding from london and met with ii.
freres walking on a dyches brynke. i^ a foot pathe to fle the foulway The
getter came rydyng i^ great haste criynge with much boste. On the leftho^de
friar. on the left hand friar. The friar prayde him full fair to ride forth in
his way and keep the horse way. as they kept the foot way He would not / but
algates he would have the freres on the lefthonde and precyd in with his horse
between the freres and the diche so nigh the diche / yt the friar shoof both
horse and man into a deep dyche And there lay both horse and mantyl that
other passing folk drew him out Right so withouten doubt but such foles
among hem and let be such nyce fantasies / god at the day of dome shall
putt them on the left side into the pytte of hell withouten end / and sey to
them on this wise For ye putt me on your side so scornefully. therefore I put
you now on my liftlonde with them that shall be dampened. And if they say Lord
when put we the on our left hand scornefully or dispytously He shall
answer and say to them as he shall say to other. Quod vni ex minimis meis
fecistis / michi fecistis. That ye did to one of the leest of mine ye did it
to me And therefore we^dyth now on the liftside into ye fire of hell / there
to duelle with the feende and his aungelles with outen end.


The li. chaptre.
Dives. Me lystithe now more to weep thanne any more to speak. For I wend till
now that englisshe nation. had worshipped god passing all other naciones / But
now I se. it is not so For much of my nation is entriked and blent with
such fantasies / many mo than I can tell And so they forfete highly against the
first commandment ye ought most to be chargyd For that techith us how we
should worship our god above al thing And there is neither bushop ne prelate
ne curate ne prechoure. that wole speak ayenste the vices and erroures that been
so high against gods worship And so by mysuse and sleuth of men of holy
church vice is take for virtue / and error for treuthe the feend is
worshyped and god is dispysed Nathelesse as men say. god is in no land so
well served in holy church / ne so much worshyped in holy church. as he is
in this land For so many fair churches ne so good array in churches / ne so
fair service as men say is in no other land as is in this land.


Pauper. As saint Gregoure says in his omely. god takith more head to a mannys
heart than to his yift. and more to his devotion tha^ne to his deed He takes
says he no great bid how much man or woman yeueth or offreth in holy church
/ but he takes head of how much devotion and of what heart he yeueth and
offreth And so a poor man or woman has some time more thank / for the yifte
of an halpeny / thanne some rich man has for tue^ty shelynges If the making
of churches and the ournamentes / and the service in this land were done
pri^cipally for devotion / and for the worship of god / I trow this land
passide all lands in worshypynge of god and holy church But I dread me that
men do it more for pomp and pride of this world to have a name and worship
thereby in the cu^tree / or for envy that one town has against another / not
for devotion / but for the worship and the name that they se them have by array
and ournamentes i^ holy church / or else by sligh couetyce of men of holy
churche^


Dives. What fa^tasy have thou that men do it not for devotion


Pauper. For the people these days is fulle undevout to god and to holy
church. and they love but full little me^ of holy church / and they ben loathe
to come in holy church. When they be bound to come thider / and fullothe to
here gods service Late they come and sone they go away If they been there a
little while them thinks fulle long. They have leuir go to the tavern than
to holy church Leuyr to here a song of Robynhode. or of some rybaudry. thanne
to here mess or matyns / or any other of gods service. or any word of god
And sithen the people has so little devotion / to god and to holy church / I
can not se yt they do such cost in holy church for devotion. ne for the love
of god

For they dispyse god day and night with their wicked living and their wicked
thewys.


The lii. chaptre.
Dives. Me thinks that it were better to give the money to the poor folk to
the blind and to the lame / whose souls god bought so dear / than so to
spend it in solemnyte and pride and making of high churches / in rich
vestmentes / in curyous wyndowes / i^ great belles For god is not helped thereby
and the pore might be helped thereby full much.


Pauper. If it be done for pride. or not with good mesure they lose much mede
If they do it of devotion with discrecion. it is medeful For every man pore and
rich after his power is bound to worship gods house. so ye god lord of al
be honestly and worshypfully served And therefore god bad in tholde law yt his
people should make hi^ a fulle costly tabernacle at his own deuyse And he
had Solomon make him a full costly temple. and yet withoute^ dout there was
many a poor man that tym and both blind and lame among gods people Moses
Dauyd Solomon. ioas. iosies. esdras. judas machabeus and many other both in
the old law and in the new ben prised highly of god for making and
worshippynge and mayntenyng of gods house and his service And as we find in
the gospel yt there was a pore wydowe that offrid to amendynge of gods temple.
but two mytes that been worth a ferthynge And she was prysed of Crist / for her
offryng passing all other that offryd than much more And we find Exodi.
xxx.c. That god badde that in nombrynge of the people every man should pay to
his tabernacle half a sicle / that was five pe^s. and that the rich should give
no more as for thanne. ne the pore no less In token that rich and pore should
be besy to worship. and to meintene gods house and gods service. God bad
that both the rich and pore should pay alyke / in toke^ that the pore man
should hold him self as much bound to god as should the rich and the good
as the wyckyde. The good is bound to god for he kept him out of sin. The
wicked is. for god kepyth him that he peryssh not for his sin Also god badde
both rich and pore. pay even to his tabernacle / in token that they ben
both bought with one price of cristes preciouse blood / and that they should
both hold them self alyke bounden. and that they have both alyke need of
suffrages and help of holy church Also god badde them both give alyke. i^
token that he acceptith their yiftes both alyke / if their devotion be alyke in
their yeuyng that ye rich man should not be proud of his great yift and of
his richesses / ne the pore fall in dispeyre. for his small yifte and for his
poverty Nathelesse who so may best do most is bound to help gods house
what it nedith. and so it is full nedeful to array well gods house / and
mayntene and increase gods service And also it is nedeful to help the pore
folk in their great need / and su^tyme more medeful than is the other. And
therefore leeue friend thou must take heed to the time and other circumstances.
For in time of welthe of peace and of plente when the pore has enogh or
lightly may be helped / tha^ne principally me^ should travail to worship

leuynge In token of this we read. ii: Regu^ vii. and io perali. xvii. and
xxii.c. That god would not suffer the king dauyd to make his temple.
natwtsto^ding that he would full feign have made it / and brought and ordained
full much thing thereto For in his time the lord was in much tribulacion by
war. Within and without / by hunger. moreyne / by discension and debate of
them selue But he said to david that Solomon his son should make him a temple
/ For he said he shall reign in peace and rest / in somoche that he shall be
clepyd king peasible / for in his days I shall give pees and rest in the
land of israel And David when he was in peace and rest and had discou^fyte his
enemies / thanne he began to ordeyne for gods temple and would have made it
God could him much thank for his good will but he would natt suffer him to
make it / for he was not in so good rest. as he wend to have been in. For
after that began great war against him / as we find Secundo Regum vii. et
viii.c. And therefore god said to him / Thou shalt natt make to me an house /
For thou haste shed much blood. and thou art a man of blood shedynge before
me That is to say I have ordained the for to fight against mine enemies. and to
slay them and so to make peace. And I have ordained thy son aftre the to make
me an house / in peace and rest / that I shall set him in by thy fighting and
thy doing.

But it faryth these days. by much folk as it did by Judas the traytoure.
We find in the gospel Io. xii.c. ye mary ma^deleyn anointed the blisfulle feet
of our lord Ihesu with a precious oynemente not for any great need that
Christ had thereto / but for love and devotion that she had to him. Judas
bare heavy thereof and grutched and said. Why is this oynement thus lost. It
might have been sold for three hundryd pe^s. and be yeuen to the pore folk.
But as seint John says in that same place Judas said not tho words for the
love that he had to the pore folk / but for he was a theif and robbyde Christ
and his disciples of money that was yeuen them. And therefore he would that the
oynement had be sold for three hundryde pens. and youen to Christ which
louyd well pore folk / that he myghat have myched the money away / for he bare
the purce. And for that he had not his purpose of the three hundryd pens /
therefore he sold Christ for three hundryd pens. that was thretty plates and
pieces of silver. For each one of tho thrytty was worth x. small pens. On the
same manner / these days su^me folk gruche for deuociones and nedeful cost
that men done in holy church / and say as Judas said / yt it were better to
give it to poor folk But many of tho give fullytel tale how evil the pore
people fare / for they do fullytell to the pore folk or to holy church either.
But by ypocrisye and symilacion of almesdede / they with drawn mennys devotion
from god and holy church / and from pore folk also. And so they rob holy
church and the pore folk. For they done little them self / and let other yt
would do And if they do alms to the pore blind and lame / they do it to have
a name / and for to exclude or put behind greter almesses that they been
bounden to / as to worship holy church. and in case good minysters i^ holy
church / and hem that trauayl holy in gods service. and study in gods law
night and day and preche it to the people i^ deed / a word / and have need of
bodily alms / of the which Christ says in the gospelle. Luce. x. That
such werkemen and traueloures ben worthy their mede And saint poule says yt
Christ has ordained them that teache the gospelle and gods law / for to
live by the gospel / and by their prechynge / not as passing beggars by the
weye / but honestly. and worshypfully as gods knights / as saint austyn
says. super illud p^i. Producens fenu^ iumentis And therefore they that repreue
nedefulle making of churches / of vestme^tes and books and nedefulle making
of belles. and gruche ayenste the holy service of god in holy church / ben
foles and in Judas caas / For they mayntene worldly worship. and let gods
worship Natheles the waast cost of all these things and other in holy church
done for pride and vaynglorye or envy of one parisshe against a another / or for
couetyce of the minysters in the church seculer or religious is greatly always
to be repreuyd.

The liiii. chaptre.
Dives. God byddyth in the gospel Mt. vi.c. that when man or woman should
pray he should go into his chamber / and shytte the door to him. and so pray
the fader of heuyn


Pauper. In tho words Christ techyth us not oonly where we should pray / but
he techyth us how we should pray For the chamber that we should enter in is our
heart / for in our prayer we should gadre our inwyttes and our thoughts to
gyddre in our heart / and set our heart only in god and take heed to our
prayer. The door that we should shytte been our v. Wits outward to flee
distraction. For tha^ne we should keep well our sight our heryng our feeling /
our tastynge and semellynge. that there come no distraction into our heart by
any of our five wits. And he badde alsoo in the same place / that men in
their prayer should fle ypocrisye. and vain glory. And to flee all this it
is fulle spedefulle to man and woman when they may not goo to church / to go
to their chamber / and into their oratory. and say there their prayere and
deuociones But if they dispyse gods house and leave gods service for such
pryue prayer / they sin grievously / and lose mede of their priuey prayer And
therefore the law byddyth that they that haf pryue oratories or chapelles by
leave of the busshop. to here in their mass and their service / that in the
great festes as Ester. Cristmasse / epiphany / ascencton / penticoste / saint
John baptyst and other such / they should go to church. and no pressed should
thanne sing in such oratories or chapelles withouten special leave of the
busshop / and if he did he should be put from his mass. De consecrac. distinc.
i. si quis. extra. Both pryue prayer and open been good if they be done in
due manner. and in due place. and in due time Prayer is good in chamber and in
oratory / but it is better in holy church with the comunyte / when time is of
common prayer / and when me^ may well attend thereto with fervent charity
Synguler prayer of one person is good in chamber / and in oratorie and better
in church. With eue^ charity. But common prayer of a comunyte i^ church is
bettee thanne a singular prayer if every party of that comunytie be in charity
For Criste says in the gospel / that if ii. or three be gadryd to gider in his
name that is charity / there is he in the mids of them / that is to say in
their hertes to help them in their prayer. And if ii. of you says he consent
to gider by charity i^ her prayer / what euyr they axe it shall be do to them
Mt. xviii. And therefore says saint ambrose. super illud ad To. xvi. adiuuetis
me in orationibus vestris. That when many small been gadryd to gidre they ben
fulle great And it is not possible that the prayers of much folk in charity
should not speed. And therefore says the prophet Joel iio.c. Halowe ye your
fasting. clepe ye cumpany to you / gadre ye the people to gydre And when ye be
gadryd make ye you holy and clean of sin / take ye the old folk with you and
gadre ye to gider the young children souking al to prayer For right as a voice
of a multitude is myghtier and ferther may be herd / than the voice of one
person alone / so is the voice and p^yer of a multitude sooner herd tha^ is the
voice of one person al one and sooner getith grace. and therefore the prophet
says Laudate d.o. gentes / et collaudate cum om^s populi. All folks pryse ye
the lord / and all peoples pryse ye him to gydder And saint Poule Ad
colocenses iiii.c. Byddeth. ye men should give them to prayers and wake in
prayer and tha^kinges in that they should pray all to gidre.


Dives. Much people. lie seek in their bed / and much in prison / many one
on the sea. and in other nedefulle occupaciones / and may not come to church /
and men duelle in many diverse lands. many thousa^de miles atwynne / how should
they pray and pryse god all to gider.


Pauper. Al if they may not come to gyder in one place / ne in one church /
yet they must cu^me to gyder in charity / that ye multitude of christian people be
of one heart and of one love and of one feyth.


The lv chapter.
Dives We make many gadrynges to gidre many general processiones and prayers in
common to pray for the pees / and yet have we no peace / but every year more
war thanne other and every year speed worse tha^ other


Pauper. If men came to gidre and made their prayers in lownes / clenesse and
charity. god should here them For he says if ii. or iii consent to gydre in
charity what they axe to the worship of god. and to help of their souls it
shall be done to hem of my fader But our prayers and processions be against
charity / made with great pride For all if men go on procession for the peace /
and sing and say with their mouth Da pace^ domine. Lord give us pees / yet
with heart men pray all against peace. For they would no peace have / ne desire
peace / but always to have werre and to shede criste^ mennys blood For not
withsto^dynge all the myscheif that the people is in because of werre / and
that we have the worse on every side / yet the people says that it is beter to
have werre than pees and they have leuyr to here of were than of peace. And they
say that they may natt live withouten werre And when god sent he^
worshipfulle peace on every side they dispysed pees / and slew he^ that made
peace for that they traueyled to make peace. And the people had leuyr pay great
taxes for shedynge of man's blood / thanne for to pay small taxes for to
have peace. And sith they love no peace / ne desire peace and wole not have peace
though god would give them pees withouten doubt they pray not for ye peace For
no man prays for a thing that he wole not have And so in their prayers and
processiones they scorn god / and more provoke him to vengeance tha^ne to
mercy Also they make their prayer not with lownes / but with great pride / for
they wole not be know of any myscheyf. They hold them selue so strong and so
wise that as them thinks. they have no need of help. And therefore though god
here us not in our prayer / ne help us it is no wounder. For with our mouth
we axe peace / but with our heart we axe werre / with our mouth we say Kyrieleyson.
Lord. have mercy on us / but with our heart we pray him to help us. to sle
our even christian that would live in peace And so our prayer is all out of
charity / and our living is fulle synful. and full highly ayenste the
plesaunce of god.


The lvi. chapter.
Dives. It is a common proverb. that a short prayer thyrleth heuene. Oration
breuis penetrat celu^. And therefore says Christ in the gospel: Mt. vi.c.
Orantes nolite multu^ loqui. When ye pray says he. nyl ye speak much.


Pauper. It is a common proverb of trua^tes that sone be weary of prayers and
have more haste to tavern thanne to holy church and have more liking in the
world. than in god Natheles if it be well understand / the proverb is soth
good and holy For every thing is clepyd short. When the ends been nigh to
gyder. And the ferther that the ends of any thing is atwynne / the le^ger is
the thing And so it farith by prayer For the one end of our prayer is our
heart / and the other end is god. And therefore says saint austyn that prayer
is a styenge up of a mannys heart to god And on this manner the nigher that a
man's heart is to god in his prayer. by love and lowness and devotion and
right inte^cion / the shorter is his prayer And this manner of prayer thirleth
heuene / for as holy writ says. the prayer of him that loweth him in his
prayer. thirleth the skies or the clouds. For the more that man loweth him in
his prayer. the more he nighyth to god / for than god of his mercy bowythe
down to him And therefore Crist says yt he that so lowyth him self in his
p^yer he shall be highed up to god. And therefore saint James says ye god
withondith the proud. and to the low and meke of heart he yeueth grace And on
this manner speak a man neuir so much / as long as his heart is nygh to god by
love and lowness / and right intencion and devotion / so long his prayer is
but short. though he speak neuir somoche with his mouth And as long as he may
continue his prayer so in devotion / it is leful and medeful / to speak in his
prayer. But wha^ne his speech begynnyth to let him of his devotion it is good
to cese of his vocal prayer / that is i^ his own free will But if he be bounden
thereto by a vow or confession or by order / or by office / than he must say
his bedys that he is bound to and do his debt And he must say distincly / not
to yerne ne to atrete. For if he say to yerne he may lightly ouirskyp. And if
he say to atrete / he may fall into great distraction and lose much time. and
leave thereby many good dedys that he might else do / and bring him self in
lothynge of prayer and lettyng of devotion of him self / and of the people also
/ that would here his prayer and his office.


The lvii. chaptre.
Dives. Why badde thanne Christ that men should not speak much in their prayer.


Pauper. Christ had not utterly yt me^ should not speak much in their prayer /
but he had that me^ should not speak much in their prayer as hethen men do.
For they wene that god should natt here them but if they spoke much. Also he
badde us not speak much in our prayer as ypocrites done. to be holden holy
and so get mennys good For as crist says i^ the gospel. Luce xxiii.c. Such
devour wydowes houses by feynynge of long prayer For as the gloss says ther^
/ they pray longer thanne other / to be holden more religiouse and holyer
thanne other. And therefore their prayer turns into sin. i^ somoche that
they may neither well pray for themself ne for other. And for such prayer.
they shall the more be dampened. as christ says in the same place Mar. vii.c.
This people worship me with their lyppes / but her heart is full far fro me For
god is in heuene / and their heart and thought al in earth It is a common
proverb / that who so spekythe unwisely and veynely / or in evil manner / he
spekyth to much And therefore as long as a man or woman prays wisely.
devoutly and with good i^tencion. so long he spekyth not to much But if he
pray unwisely with pride and wicked inte^cion / he spekyth to much though he
speak neuir so little And therefore ye pharise spoke to much in his p^yer / for
he spoke all with pride. And petir spoke to much / for he spoke unwisely /
and therefore crist repreuyd them both. Also they speak to much in their
prayer. that set their heart and feyth more in sownynge and sayng of ye words.
than they do in god. or in the thing that they pray for and say again and often
again wenynge that god herd them uatttyl when by such iteracions they been
weary / and leave many deuociones that they should say

And therefore says the wise man / Non iteres verbu^ in oro^e tua. Eccle. vii.
Sey no word again in thy prayer For such doubt is lettynge of devotion. for
such speak ouir much / and make their prayer in wanbileue

For if man's heart be to god ward. god herith his prayer long or he speak it
with his mouth.


Dives. Sithen god is ouir all present / why pray we more i^ holy church than
in other place.


Pauper. For asmoche as he is ouir al / therefore i^ every place he owyth to be
worshipped But for asmoch as we may not worship him in due manner in every place
Therefore is holy church ordained that men should fulfill there ye they leave in
other places. And therefore in every law god has ordained certain places of
prayer where he would be worshipped in / passing other places / and yt for many
skylles. First for common prayer and prisynge is more plesaunte as I said
first Also to fle erroures and ydolatrye For if each man or woman drew him
alone always in his prayer. the feende should disseyue him. by illusions and by
iapes / as he does commonly them that fle cu^pany. and love to be much
solitary. Also for to exclude sloth in gods service / yt man and woman
should fall in For but they were bound to come to gider in some certain
place. to worship her god and to here gods law / they would else trouant.
and worship god i^ no place but full seldom And they would excuse them by
vncu^nyng if they did amys. Also holy church is ordained for common prayer and
gods service that each man and woman may bear wytnes of other at the day of
dome / ayenste the feend / that he did in that as a christian man ought to do
and served his god. For as saint poule says / us must all have witness of
our feyth by dedys and tokens outward.


The lviii. chaptre
Dives. Whereto should we pray to god for any thing for he is not chau^geable.
And he may naught give us but that he wyste well before the begynni^g of the
world that he should give us


Pauper. We pray not for to change his endless ordenau^ce but for to get by
prayer that he ordained wtouten end to gra^te us by prayer For sith he is our
lord / and we may naught do. ne no thing have withoute^ hi^. he wole that we
pray to him as to our lord / and in our prayer knowledge him our lord And
he wole not grant us many things that us nedyth / but we pray him therefore


Dives. Why pray we to god with our mouth / since he knowyth all our
thought. all our desire / al our will / and what us nedith.


Pauper. For as I said first god wole that we knowledge him for our lord and
knowledge our need yt we may not do / ne have no thing withouten him / which
knowlegyng must be done with the mouth. For saint poule says if a man. or
woman wol be saved / he must have right bileue in heart i^ward and knowledge it
outewarde with his mouth. To. x.c. Cord enim creditur ad iusticiam / ore autem
confessio fit ad salutem. More over leave friend ye shall understand / that
there is ii. manner of prayer / one is common. another is singular Common prayer is
the prayer of the ministres of holy church and of common persons. in holy
church / which prayer. they make in the name of all the people. And this manner
of prayer must be done by mouth / that ye people may know that they p^ye for
them And therefore it is ordained by the law that such prayer should be said /
and sumtyme sunge openly with high voice. that the people may here it But
singular prayer that is done but of one singular person / may be done with
heart alone withoute^ voice of the mouth Nathelesse sumtyme it is good to him
thatt prays to pray by mouth And that for many skylles / First to excite
his heart to more deuocio^ by outward tokenes And therefore as long as man or
woman. is stired to devotion by speech or vocal prayer. by knelynge / loutynge
fasting / or any other obseruaunce reasonable / so long it is well done to
use it. in his prayer / but if he be lettyd thereby from devotion and / fall
thereby in distraction / it is better to leave it for a time than to use it. For
we find primo regu^ ii.c. That anne spoke in heart to god with bitter terys /
and yitt there herd no man her voice Also me^ pray with the voice of the mouth
in yeldynge of debt For man is bounden to serve god with every might and
virtue yt god has youen him / with heart word werk with all his might with all
his wit And therefore holy church syngith and says. Os lingua niens sensus
vigor confessione^ personent. Mouth tunge wit and might / make knowlechynge
and praisynge to god And on this manner bedys biddynge is party of satisfaction
for sin. Also men pray with voice of the mouy for great devotion yt is i^warde
in heart which brekith out by speech of the mouth / as says Criste in the
gospel. Luce vi. Ex habundancia cordis os loquitur. The mouth says he.
spekith of such things whereof is plenty in the heart. And therefore the
prophet says. Cetatu^ est cor meu^: et exultauit lingua mea. Mine heart says
he was merry and glade ynwarde / and a none my tunge made joy outewarde^ Also
men pray with voices in speech to the more confusion of the fee^de / for he may
not know me^nys devotion i^ward. but but by tokenes outewarde. And the more
devotion and love that he sees men to have to god / the more is his confusion
and his pain And therefore is he so besy these days to tempte men i^ holy
church to pride / to couetise to sleuth / glotony / and lichery. to let holy
prayers in holy church / which is to him verry confusion and sorrow And
therefore says the prophet of him when he herith holy prayers and sees men
devout. Peccator videbt et irascetur: dentibus suis fremit et tabescet. The
synful wreche the feende of hell shall se mennys devotion: and he shall be full
wroth He shall crosche or gnaste with his teeth. and be full evil a basshed For
the desires of deuylles and their disciples that would let holy prayer shall
perisshe and come to naught


The lix. chapter.
Dives. In the beginning of holy church and i^ the time of the apostles. Was no
such service and solennyte in holy church as now is


Pauper. Than were but few christian me^ / and neither they might ne durst
make such solennyte for tyrauntrye of the hethen people. Their will was good
/ but they might not / but as they mighten they did worship to god. and
encresyd gods service. And therefore we read i^ the life of seint clement that
by his p^ching and teching within one year were made seventy churches in oone
little isle of Cersone. not withstondyng that there were ii. thousand of pore
christian men outlawyd and dampened to fulle hard trauayl / and might have be
releuyd fulle much releuyd with that that tho churches costyd. Thanne holy
church was i^ his youth and in his beginning. as says saint Ierom i^
prologo super actus aplo^ru^. Now holy church is wexyd. and the feyth sprung
and spredde and stabled in peace fro tyrauntes And therefore now we must
worship our god with all our might. and our cu^nynge / for we have none
excusation as they had. And for to avoid ydelnesse of prestys our faders
before this time ordained the prayers in holy church to be said after a
certain form / after the custom of diverse cu^trees keep their our after the
ours of the day / as matynes at morrow and mass afterward. and euynsonge
against even: so that god shulbe prysed of the priests all times of the day.


Dives. Me thinks yt it were better to say gods service in holy church
withouten note thanne with note and hackynge of the sillabes. and words in
our prayer and prisynge as as we do. For who should tell the king of England
a tale or make his prayer to him and made so many notes and hackynges in his
tale / he should have little thank.


Pauper. The king of heuyn is above ye king of England / and otherwise we
must worship him thanne the king of england For us must worship him with all
our might. and all our heart / and al our wytt / as him that is maker and
lord of all thing. And so may we not worship the king of england It
nedyth now to speak to the king of england and to every erthly man distincly
/ for they know not mannys heart ne his will But god knowyth it long or we
speak it with our mouth And therefore when we sing in our prayer with
cle^nesse of lif and devotion of heart we plese god in asmoche as we worshipe
him with our power of voice and tunge For every note so sunge to god in the
church or in other convenient place for devotion in our self / and to engendre
devotion in other is a praisyng to god. And therefore david says. Cantate
exultate et psallite. Sing ye and make ye merry outewarde / and sing ye to god
craftily. Iubilate deo omnis terra: seruite dn^o in leticia Introite in
co^spectu eius in exultato^e All ye that duelle upon the earth make ye hertly
joy to god. serve ye our lord in gladness Enter ye in his sight with joy and
myrthe. For many skylles leave friend / song and melodye was ordained in holy
church First to the more worshipyng of god. Also to the more excitatione of
devotion of the people Also to put away heaviness and vnlustynesse / as says
saint Bernard For many man hay more liking more likyng to serve god i^
gladness than in heaviness And therefore gods office should be said lively /
distincly / devoutly with gladness of heart For if the office be said or
sunge so hauely and dedely and so drawn alonge ye it loathe both the synger or
sayer and the herer / and brings folk into heaviness or distraction / it is
evil said or song For that manner of syngyng is lettyng of much godenesse /
and cause of ydelshyp and of much folly. for it makes me^ to withdraw them
fro gods house and from gods service. and so want grace. De con. di. v.
no^ mediocriter. Also we sing in church to co^fourne us to seintes in heaven
which pryse god and serve god aluey with high voice. and sweet syngyng / as we
find in the apocalipse. and many other places in holy writ And therefore david
says. Cantate dn^o canticum nouum: laus eius in ecclesia sanctoru^. Sing ye a
new song to our lord. for such is his prisynge in the church of al seintes
And therefore song in holy church is good when it is sunge devoutly in
clenes of life / roundely not lettyng the devout prayer of the people / as does
this curiouse knackyng. sunge of the viciouse mynistres in the church. and
specially in great and rich churches For it is often seen that the singers in
such places. and other also ben fulle proud. glutones and lechoures also.

And the melody of such men is no plesaunce to god / but harmeth themself and
many other.


The lx. chaptre
Dives. Why been now no martiris as were wont to be.


Pauper. We have these days martires all to many in this land.


Dives. How so.


Pauper. For the mo martires. the more murdre and manslaughter and the more
shedyng of i^nocentes blood / the more vengeance shall fall therefore.


Dives. Much folk is slain these days / but that they should be martires I
can not say.


Pauper. All that been slain for the treuth patiently in charity ben martirs /
in asmoche as they wytnessen the treuthe and stand therewith unto their death
For martyr in latin is a witness in englisshe It is no worship to any land or
nation to have many martres of her sleynge / but it is an endless shame. And
therefore the jews that slew Christ and his disciples. and prophets and made
martres without nombre / ben in dispyte and repreef all about the world.
And therefore Criste said to hem that all the rightful blood which they had
shed from ye beginning of the world should fall upon them and hard
vengeance therefore should come to hem And the romans that slew petyr and
many martres in every land there they had lordshyp now they have lost her
lordship and ben wretches of wreches / and both the cite and the temple semyth
acursed And now englissh nation has made many martires They spare neither
their own king ne their busshopes / no dignyte / noon order / no state ne
degree / but i^differe^tly slay as me^ lyketh. and so vengeance and wreche
folowith them / and grace and worship has forsaken them. Was it neuir worship
to them yt they slew saint Thomas. their busshop and their fader. ne that
they would by common clamoure and comen assent have slain their own king.
Martyrdom is worshipful them that in charity suffer the death / and to them
that hold with them in their treuthe. But it is shame and shenshyppe to them
that done them to death unrightfully. And for asmoche as ye multitude of shrewys
is so great / and falshode is so mighty ye the treuthe is ouirsette and borne
down and true folk so martryde. We should weep and not joy for that we have
so many marters / and night and day cry mercy to let wreche If hethen people or
other nations had made our martirs we might rejoice us of our martris But i^
yt we have slain them our self we ought be ashamyd.


The lxi. chaptre
Dives. Sith they be martirs why does god no miracles now for them as he did
for martirs / and other seyntes i^ the beginning of holy church.


Pauper. If a lord have but a few true servants. he wole prise them and
magnify them / and do them worship. both to hold them stylle in his
service. and also to draw other to his service by ensample of them And the
same does the master in scole. to the children that learn well. And wha^ne
the mother has but one child she cheriseth it the more. and kepith him the
more derely. Right so Criste in the beginning of holy church had but few
good disciples or true servants / and therefore he worshipped. and magnified
them with great miracles to comfort them i^ the feyth / and for to draw
other to the feyth For but god had she wyd thanne great miracles and many /
they yt were in the feythe. should have forsaken the feythe and few would have
come to ye feyth And it farith by holy church and by the feyth as it does by a
tree. When a tree is newly set me^ water it and set stakes and poles about to
strenght it against the wyndes blastes / for storms should else brise it or
break it / and fell it a down. But when it is well rotyd and como^ly wexen
than men cese of wateryng and take away the stakes and the poles. Right so when
holy church and cristendome was in the beginning / criste watryd holy church
with great yiftes of grace / and of devotion / and underset it with great
wounders and miracles / which he showed that time against the hard storms of
persecution that was that time against the feyth of holy church But now holy
church is spru^ge and spread and the feith is stabled in me^nys hertes / and
therefore such miracles cese. And if any such miracles fall in any land
among christian people it is a token that su^me of them be not stable in the
feith and that god is not al apaide with the people For seint poule says ye
tokenes and miracles ben not youen to folk of right bileue. but to folk of
false bileue And the mo miracles that men se / ye less mede they have for her
feith as saint gregory says in his Omely And so multitude of martirs and of
miracles prove natt godenesse of the people that they been done among. but
rather they show and preue the malice of the people. When god should distroy
the kingdom of israel and of judah for ydolatry and other sin that nigh all the people was fallen in / he sent his famous prophets as hely / and helisee.
ysaie. ieremye. danyel / ezechiel and other xii. prophets which taught the
people gods law and warnyd them of mischeyf cu^mynge but they would amend
them And they co^fermyd their prophecy with many great miracles / and yet the
people was worse than euir they were before At the last christ came to preche
and to teache them and did many wou^ders / and helyd all manner sekenesses and
sent his apostles also among them / which did many wounderful miracles. And
yet the people was thanne wors thanne euir they were aforne In somoche that
they slew not only the prophetis and the apostles and cristes disciples / but
they slew criste himself gods son of heaven. lord of al thing. Which had
done hem so much worship and done so many wou^derful cur^s among them.


The lxii. chapter.
Dives. I trow that if me^ were now as holy as me^ were thanne / they should
do miracles now as they did thanne


Pauper Though they were as holy or holier they should not do such miracles
For they be not now so nedefulle as they were thanne / ne it were not
profitable to the people. as I said right now And I hope that they ben as
holy that do no miracles as many of them yt done miracles. For such doing of
miracles. stondith not in the holiness of him that does the miracle / but it
stondith in the clepynge. and the virtue of gods name to the profytte of
other / and often to dampnatio^ of him that so clepith gods name and does the
miracle As says the gloss. super illud Mt viio Dn^e no^ne in noi^e tuo
prophetauimus.


Dives. It semyth thereby that shrewis and wicked lyuers may do miracles


Pauper Criste says so himself Mt. vii.c For as we read there. at the doom
many that shall be dampened. shall say to Criste O lord we prophesied in thy name
and castyd out feendes and did many toknes and miracles in thy name. But he
shall say again to them.

Wendyth hense fro me ye worchers of wickedness. I know you not for none of
mine. And as says saint John Crisostom in tractatu. Nemo leditur nisi a
semetipso. That Judas the traitoure had power of god for to do and did many
great miracles / yet is he dampened Also doing of miracles is no syker tokene
of godenesse neither of the doer ne of people there that they ben done / but
only charity and good living been syker token of godenesse And therefore
Criste taught us to know the good prophets from the wicked. not by her
miracles ne by their prophecy / but by her good dedys and charity Thereby says
he men shall know that ye be my disciples if ye have charity among you / not
by miracles ne by prophecy For judas did miracles / and cayphas and balaam
fulle cursed wreches. prophesied fulle truly And saint John baptiste that was
so holy did neuir such miracles by his life And therefore Christ badde yt we
should take heed to mennys dedys and know them by their fruit.


Dives. Ipocrites and heretics do full many good dedys and yet be they shrewys


Pauper. Such manner of folk have ii. manner of dedys / one in priuey. another
in apert or open. Their dedis in apert be not theirs but they ben clothinges of
sheep under which they hile them or cover them as wolves to disseyue good
sheep And therefore crist byddith in the gospel yt we should be ware of false
prophets. that yt come to us in clothing of sheep / for they ben inward
wolves of raueyn. If their dedys be wicked / it is her own clothing whereby
they may be known but her priuey works and their pryuey teching ben their
own fruit which como^ly ben full wicked And so by that that they do and teache
privily men may best know what they been.


Dives. I I may well assent to thy speech for so many wounders have fall in this
land within a few yer^s in su^ne moan and sterres / i^ land i^ water in the
air / that we read i^ no book yt euir fell so many in so litel time And as me^
sey full wicked lyuers do many miracles and prophecye. and yet we want grace on
every side / and the hard vengeance of god is upon us night and day /
showing that god is grievously offe^dyd with us


Pauper. As says the gloss. super illud. ii. ad thessalo. ii.c. In signis and
prodigiis mendacibus. For asmoche as the people is out of charity and wole not
know the treuth / but trust al in lesynges and in falshede Therefore god
suffers false shrewys for to do wou^ders and miracles for to disceyue the
people. and to hold them still in her error. I have said as me thynkethe say
forth what thou will.


The lxiii. chaptre
Dives. What seyst thou of them that wole no solemnyte have in their buriynge.
but be putt in earth anon / and that ye should be spente about the buriyng
they bydde that it should be youen to the pore folk blind. and lame


Pauper. Commonly in such prive buriynges ben full small doles and little alms
youen And in solemn buriynges. been great doles / and much alms youen /
for much pore people come thanne to seek alms But when it is done privily
few wit thereof. and few come to axe alms / for they wot not when ne
where ne whom they should axe it. And therefore I leave sikerly that su^me falls
executoures that would keep all to themself. biga^ne first this error and
this folly


Dives. And yet men hold it a great perfection these days.


Pauper. Though men bury their friends privily. or ayertly / it is no harm to
the deed ne to the living But if the worship of god be withdrawn. and the
alms of the pore nedy and the holy prayers and suffrages of holy church /
which ben ordained to be prayed and done for the deed and the quick that have
need thereof But it is a great folly and also a great sin to forsake solemn
buriynges / yt be done principally for the worship of god and for the proufyt
of the deed / spendyng his gods to nedeful releuyng of holy church / and the
pore nedye people yt been of no power to help them self. for that is a
custom of falls executoures that wolden make themself rich with deed me^nys
gods / and not dele to the pore. after deeds will / as now all false
executoures use by custom. And so they that forsake worshipful buriynge as I
have rehersyd before let the prisyng the worship / and the sacrifice and
offrynge that should be done to god. They do also dispyte to holy church / in
that that they forsake the prayer. and the suffrages of holy mynistres of holy
church. Also they offend all the souls of purgatory that should be releuyd
by messes singing / holy prayer and suffrages of holy church / which ben
ordeynyde in buriynge to help of all christian souls And they please the
feende that is besy night and day to let gods office ^ gods worship and
holy p^yer Also they offend mankind. and god that took mankind. of a woman
/ in asmoche as they put their body in such dispite and pryue it of the due
worship For the body of a good man / or of a good woman that is knytte to that
preciouse soul yt Christ bought so dear. With his precious blood / with which
soul it shall rise apen at the dome / and live in bliss withouten end
brighter than the son / it is of full great dignyte / al if it be here in
great myscheyf for a time for ada^mes sin. Mannys body is of fulle great
dignyte in that / ye god took our body of a woman alone / and bicame man
withouten part of man / and bodily in our kind reigns god and man above
all creatures And therefore by wey of kind and for worship of god that took
our kind / it owes to be worshipped / namely in his death / for than is no
dread of pride. And therefore says the wyseman. Eccle. vii.c. Mortuo non
prohibeas graciam. withdraw not thy grace. and thy mercy from the deed. That
is to say withdraw not ne let natt he due service and worshipful cerymonies
that long to the body / ne the suffrages and prayers that long to the soul
as says. the the gloss And in a another place he says thus Son weep thou on
the deed man with bitter teres and great sorrow / and after his state as right
is hile his body / dispyse not his buriynge. make morning one day or.ii. after
his deserte Eccle. xxxviii c. For by the law of kind. by law written. by law
of grace and every time worshipful sepulture after mennys power has be due
debt to mannys body and womannes. In the law of kind have we example of
Abraham Isaac and Jacob / and her wives / which had full costly buryinges. As
we read in holy writ Genesis lvi.c. And in the law written have we example. of
Samuel / David: salomn / iosaphat / ezechie. iosie / tobie / and of the
machabeis / whose buryinges were costly and worshipful In the law of grace /
that is in the new law have we example of our lord Ihesu Christ / which not
withstondynge that he suffcyde spytefulle death for mankind. yitt he would have
/ and had worshypfulle and costly sepulture and buriynge. As we find in the
gospelle Io. xix.c. whereby as the gloss says there he yaue men example to keep
worshypful buriyng after ye custom of the cuntre And therefore he co^mendyd
mary mawdeleyn / yt she came before his death to anoynte his body so preciously
and costly into the sepulture. And many seyntes were buried worshipfully by the
doings of au^gelles / as saint Clement. seint katheryne / saint agace / and
many other And seint poule the first hermete was buried worshipfully and
wou^derly / by worchinge of lions / and of wild bestes / i^ tokenyng that
mannys body and woman's owe to have worshypful sepulture For sithen aungelles
and wild bestes did such worship to mannys body after his death Much more
mankind should worship mannys body: after his death / and do worship to his
own kind. And so men should releue pore folk in their myscheyf / and
specially in their diynge by alms yeuyng Butte they should not for that do any
wrong by their living to their even christian for to make them rich to do much
alms at their ending For as the law says. there should no man be made rich
with wrong and harm of a another. Locupletari non debet aliquis cum alterius

The lxiiii. chaptre.
Dives. What say thou of them that hold markettes and feyres in holy church
and in sanctuary /


Pauper. Both the byer and the seller and me^ of holy church that mayntene hem
or suffer them when they might let it ben acursed. For we find not that
euir Criste punisshed so hard any sin while he went here in earth / as he did
byynge and selling in gods house as we find Io. xi.c. On a time he came
i^to the temple of Jerusalem / and there he found me^ biyng and sellyng oxen
and sheep and doves to be offryd in the temple / and chaungers of money also to
be offryd in the temple. He was highly offendyd / and made a scourge and bette
them out of the temple / and said to them on this wise Mine house should be an
house of prayer / and ye have made it a de^ne of theuys. Bear ye out said he
this marchau^dise Led he^s these bestes and make ye not my faders house an
house of marchaundise and a de^ne of theuys. And as saint Matheu tells and
other gospellers / he drew down her bothes / and ouirturnyd their stalles
and their setis and shed their money. And as seint mark says. he would not
suffer no vessel that was not lo^gynge to the temple. to be borne through the
temple And sithen. Christ would not suffer thing be sold in the temple / that
was only for the worship of god. and help of the temple Much more he wole not
suffer thing to be sold in the temple that longith not to the temple. but
only to seculertie.


Dives. Sithen god was so offendyde for that men sold therein that was nedeful
to the temple. and for easement of hem that came fro far cuntrees what should
he have do / if he had found them biynge and selling thing of seculerte Or if
he had found them in bacbi^yng and glotony / dronkenshyp / lichery / i^ song
and speech of rybaudrye. as me^ use these days i^ holy church.


Pauper. Saint austyn says. that as he trowyth he should haf cast them to the
pytte of hell.


Dives. How might Christ yt was so pore a man have cast out such a multitude
of people. It is a wounder yt they withstoden him not.


Pauper. For as the gloss says there came such a light out of his face by wey
of his god hode as long as he would yt they were al aferid of the sight of his
face and fled away. And for the same skyl in time of his passion wha^ they
came for to take hi^ he said I am he yt ye seek / twyes they went bakwarde.
and for dread fell down to ground.


Dives. Why said he that they made his house a de^ne of thieves


Pauper. For who so is about to begile any man or woman of his good / he is a
thief And in biyng and selling either of them is about to begile other / and
in that they been thieves. And for yt they do it in gods house and there
cast in their heart how priuelye and how slighly they may begile her even
christian / therefore they make gods house a de^ne of theuys:

And commonly in such fayres. and markettes where so euir it be holden / there
ben many thieves mychers and cut purses.


Dives. And I dread me that fulle often by such fayres gods house is made a
tavern of glutones / and a bordelle of lychoures: For the merchants and
chapmen keep there with them their wives and le^mannes. both night and day.


Pauper. And if any man comyne ther^ flesshely with his wife or his le^man the
church and the church yerde also ben pollute And if it might be preuyd there
should no preeste sing ne say no mess therein / ne body be buried till it were
recou^seiled again by the busshop. De con. di. i. Si motu^. etc. significasti /
Et io. in su^ma sua. lio iiii. tio CCxliii. vtru^ liceat / Et durandus in sm^a
sua. lio.ii. per: i. di. viii / q^ xxxiii.


Dives. And what if the p^lates and the curates of the place take money of the
chapme^ for ye place yt they sto^de in by covenant made before / is it any
symonye so to sell the lord of the seyntuary.


Pauper. It is symonye full great for to selle any ground in the sanctuarye.
for buriyng. as the law shewith well. xiii / q^. ii. q^sta. and co seq^nti.
Much more to selle it or to let it hyre for marchaundyse And therefore such
marchaundyse in holy church is forfendyd / natt only by the gospelle / but
also by the common law / xvi: q^. vii. Et hec diximus / For men of holy church
by such symonye / and taking of things that they have no right to / ben
bicome strong theuys / and make the chapmen theuys in that / that they do hem
occupye the place in sanctuarye against gods will lord of the place And so
they make gods house a duellynge / and a den of theuys:


Dives. Sithen men of holy church do somoche dispite to god and holy church /
though they be i^ dispite themself / it is no wounder


Pauper. That is soth For god says in holy wryt Primo regu^. ii.c / who so
worshippeth me says he / I shall make him worshipful / And they that dispyse
me shall be in dispyte.


Dives. I thank the with all mine heart For that me thought sumtym no sin /
now I know well that it is a fulle grievous dedly sin For the sins and the
erroures that we have now spoken of / ben openly against ye worship of the high
majesty of god / and against the first commandment that most ought to be
charged / And thy skylles ben so great and thy speech so open / yt ignorance
might not excuse me ne any wight else that can reason And yet the people by
myscustome and ignorance of me^ of holy church and of themself also by
couetise and pride of ye clergy is so ble^t that they thynk them no sins.
And so we wander in sin blent with folly and want grace.


Pauper. Wicked custom aggregith syn and not excuses sin. And therefore the
law says that every wicked custom should be do away.


Here endith the first pcepte. and begins the secounde precept.
The first chapter
Dives. I pray the enfourme me nowei^ ye secou^de conmau^dme^t.


Pauper. What doubt haste thou therein


Dives. In the secounde maundemente god byddeth that we should not take his
name i^ vein For who so does shall be gilty and not pass unpunished


Pauper. In three manners gods name is taken i^ vein. That is by myslyuyng. by
mys speech / and by mysheringe First by myslyuyng / for when man or woman is
cristned. ther^ he forsakes the feende and all his works and his lordshyppe.
When his god fader and his god mother answer for him sayng. Abrenuncio. that
is to say I forsake And there he knyttyth him to criste. and makith couenaunte
with him to be his true seruau^te withouten end And there he takethe the name
of Christ upon him and bicometh christian For all christian people is named after
christ and he is our principal godfader For christian cu^myth of criste. and so
all christian people bear ye name of criste upon them. And so in asmoche as we
been clepyd criste^ and gods people. in that we bear the name of god upon. us.
And therefore says the prophet / Tu in nobis es dn^e et nome^ sanctu^ tuum
inuocatum est super nos: ne dereli^quas nos domine deus nt. Ieremye xiiii.c.
Lord says he thou art among us / as a lord among his servants / and
thyn holy name is clepyd upon us / lord our god forsake us not But if it be so.
yt we live natt after our name / yt we have taken of christ ne live not as
christian men ne as gods servants / but forsake him and turn again to the
feende and live not as christian folk / but as iewys sarsyn or paynym / or else
worse. than take we gods name in vein. for our name and our life accords
not. And as saint poule says / wicked christian folk with their wicked dedys
and their wicked living forsake god And therefore all wyckid lyuers and namely
ypocrites that bear the name of holiness and of cristes servants. and with yt
they be yt fee^des servants / they take gods name in vein / and do great
dispyte to gods name And therefore crist says to such wicked christian people.
Per vos tota die nome^ meu^ blasphemar^ in ge^tibus. ysaie lii c. Et ad To. ii:
c. My name is despised by you all day among other naciones or hethen men. For
by the wicked living of criste^ people ye name of crist is shamyd And therefore
we say in our prayer. Sanctificetur nome^ tuum. Halowyd and worshipyd be thy
name. That is to say grant us grace no thing to do / ne will. ne to speak yt /
whereby thy name should be vnworshipyde or shamyd in us.


The secounde chapter
ALso gods name is take in vein by mys speech / and that in many wise First
by namynge of gods name i^ vein tales telling / in iapery i^ scorn For in
such vanyte gods name should not be named.

Dives. Tell su^me example


Pauper. As if one said to the in scorn when he is wroth with the / god make
the a good man. And su^me say of a another i^ scorn that god has forsaken him
/ and iapers and disoures como^ly name gods name i^ vein in this manner /
though they swear none oath. And al such take gods name in ydelship / that
teache any erroures or herisies against faith and against god / or preche or teache
the treuthe only for couetyse or for envy / or for vain glory and not for
health of ma^nys soul ne for worship of god And therefore the prophet says
thus. Peccatori autem dixit deus / qua re tu enarras iusticias meas: et assumis
testamentum meum per os tuu^. God said to the synful man / why tellyst thou my
rightfulnesses / and takyst my testament and my law by thy mouth and so often
namyst my name. For although that teache well and speak well. and wole not do
thereafter: they take gods name in vein Also gods name is taken i^ vein by
cursyng and weriyng / as when men or wymen in wrath or else in nyce myrthe
say to a another. god give the myschau^ce / god give the evil grace / evil death
Also it is taken in vein often time. by vows making / and that i^ diverse
manner / First if man make any vows to any creature. For vows making is a
dyuyne worship that owyth to be do only to god and to no creature. And therefore
the prophet says. Vouete and reddite dn^o deo vestro Make ye your vows to
our lord god / and yeldith them to hun. Also it is taken in vein when
folire keep not their vows that been lefulle: but break them retchesly / or by
freyltie wtouten need and withouten authority. of their soueraynes / which
have power to dispe^se with hem or change their vows. Also if men make vows
vnlefulle. against charity. and to do any thing against gods law As if thou
made a vow to sle thyn even christian / or yt thou should neuyr do good to
pore men / for paraue^ture su^me poor man has aggreued the. Also wha^ne men
make vows unwisely lightly wtoute auysement and by common custume of speech.


The.iii. chaptre
Dives. And such vows ben made these days full many For with much folk be
they ones spoken. they been no more thought on. For they be so common in their
mouth.


Pauper. Therefore they sin full grievously / so taking gods name in vein
For there should no vow be made but for a thing of charity / and with a good
auysement. We find in holy writ Iudicum xi.c. that there was a leder and a
judge of gods people / whose name was Iept And when he should go to fight
against gods enemies the folk of amon / he made his vow to god that if he
yaue him the vitorye of his enemies wha^ he came home again what lyui^g thing he
met first of his house / hold in his cu^mynge hoome / he should sle it / and
offer it up to god i^ sacrifice After this as god would he had the maistree
and came home with great worship / when his daughter herd these tidings she
was full glade and took her timber in her ho^de and came in great haste first
of all the household daunsynge pleynge and singing against her fader for to
welcome him home. When iept. saw his daughter so cu^mynge. against him he
bithoughte him of his a vow and wexte full sorye for he had no child but her
/ and he louyd her fulle much Alas daughter / allas said he. Whatt haste thou
done / why cu^myste thou so sone against me. I have opened my mouth to god.
and made a vow ayenste the / for I must by my vow slay the / and offer the
up into sacrifice to god But the woman his daughter yet clean maiden was so
glade of gods worship / and of her faders worship / and that gods enmyes
were so slain / that she made little sorrow or none for her death and said to
her fader Iept Since thou haste made such a vow and god has sent the victory
of his enemies / fulfill thy vow. For I take the death gladely. But I pray the
of one boon or I dye Let me go with other maidens my pleyferes and morn and
bewail my maydenhode among the hills and the mounteynes.ii. months / For
it was that time repreef to a woman to dye wtouten issue of her body And iept
grauntyd her bone After ii. months. she came again to her fader iepte / and
mekely suffryd ye death for gods sake and for the love of her fader And thus
leeue friend that woman's death which was clean maiden betokneth cristes passion
For right as she took the death wylfully for salvation of gods folk / and
destruction of gods enemies / So criste clean maiden ye neuir was defouled
with sin: and neuyr did amys. Wylfully suffryde bitter death for salvation of
all mankind and destruction of the fee^des power.


Dives. Was not his vow lefulle.


Pauper. It was not lefulle For by his vow if he had first met with a cat
or an hounde cu^mynge against him he should have made sacrifice to god thereof /
which sacrifice should have been abhominacion to god for neither was able to be
offered in sacrifice. And for asmoche as he made his vow so unwisely. god
suffryd him to fall i^to yt mischeyf to sle an i^noce^te his own daughter
ayenste gods law. For god says Innoce^te^ et iustu^ non occides. Thou
shalt natt sle the innocent / ne the rightful man ne woman And so by his
vow so folily made / he did full grievous dedly sin. and forfettyd full highly
against gods law And therefore says the master of the stories and Josephus
alsoo that he was a fool in his vow making and wicked / and ouir done cruel
in the fulfillynge. And therefore says ye great clerk ysodorus. in synonimis.
li.ii. Et xxii. q^. iiii. In malis promissis rescinde fidem / in turpi voto
muta decretum / quod i^caute no uistine facias / impia e^ promissio. que
scelere adimpletur. In wicked hestes kytte away feyth that is to say /
fulfylle no wicked biheestes / keep no faith to do amys For in shrewyd
bihestes it is betr^ to be holde^ falls tha^ true For who so fulfilleth them is false to god In the vow says yt he is foul and vnlefulle change thy dome /
and that that thou haste not wisely auowyd do it not For it is a wicked
biheste yt is fulfilled and done with sin.


The iiii. chaptre
Dives. I assent / say forth I pray the.


Pauper. Also gods name is take i^ vein by blasphemye and spiteful speech of
god / as when men grutch against gods domes in seknes tribulacion and disease
/ and sey that god is vnrightful and cruel or grutche ayenste his mercy.

When they may natt have vengeance of their adversaries. as they would have
/ and say that god is to pacient and to mercy able And they also that fall in
wa^ hope / and say that god wol not foryeue them their sin. And they also
that presume to much of gods mercy / and wole not amend them / for they
say that god wole foryeue it them at the first word. Also su^me say that god
slepith when he helpith them not as they would. All that speak thus or say
any other thing of god. that is against his worship and his godhode / take
gods name i^ vein by blasphemy. Also gods name is taken amys and in vein
by mys speech of oaths swerynge For who so wole lightly swear for a thing of
naught or of no charge / or custumably or falsely wyttyng well that he sweryth
false. or dispitously / or disseyuablye. or swerith any creature / or uses any
nyce oaths / or unlawful oaths all these take gods name in vein. For there
owith no man ne woman swear but for a treuthe of charge / and wha^ne it nedith
to swear to witness of treuthe. And when a man shall swear he shall swear by
his god / and by no creature.


Dives. Much folk is so brought in custume. of swering that uneath they can
speak three words to gidder but they suere by god or by some creature / or some
great or nyce oath


Pauper. As I said before wyckid custume excuses not sin but accuses and
aggregith syn And therefore it is to dread yt they swear so custumably and so
lightly yt they syn dedly swear they sothe swear they false And therefore
solomon says Iuracioni ne assues cas os tuu^. etc. Ecclesi. xxiii.c. Let not
thy mouth says he be used to swering / for many hard happes and fallinges
been in such swerynge And name not to often says he gods name with thy mouth
in swerynge / ne be natt vsaunt in sweryng to meddle the with seyntes names For
if thou do thou shall not be clear of folly swerynge / ne clear of sin For
what man says he swerith much / he shall be filled with sin. and shreudenesse
/ and tribulation and disease shall not pass fro hi^ and his household. For god
says yt who so takes his name in vein. he shall not pass vnpunysshyd Such
swerynge and dispisyng of gods name is so orryble a sin in gods sight /
that as solomon says in the same book the xxvii.c. When that men herd such
swerynge. the here of the head should arise for dread / and they should stop
their erys and not here such irreuere^ce and dispyte of gods name. Loquela
multu^ iura^s horripilationem capiti statuit / et irreuerencia illius obturatio
aurium.


The v. chapter.
Dives. Folk these days in iii. manners excuse hem of swerynge. Su^me say yt
they swear so often for the love yt they have to god to have him often in mind
Su^me say why may not I swear for I swear soth Su^me say but I swear there wol
no man leeue me


Pauper. These been no excusationes / but grievous accusacions and aggregyng of
syn. For as for the first point it is false For such falls swerers love not
their god / for they keep not his commandment And they have him full little in
mind and swear many an horrible oath in vanytie and shrewydnesse because of mys
use / wha^ne they think not of god And therefore that excusation is an open
scorn / and high blasphemye to god For if thy servant had done a thing that
thou had forboden him the ofter that he did it the worse thou would be
paid. And if he scornyd the and said yt he did it for thy love to have yt in
mind / thou would hold it a full great scorn / and be much the more
offendyd with him / namely if thou were his liege lord and his king Mochmore
than god yt is lord and king of al things is offe^dyd with them yt so swear
against his forbode / and excuse them so scornefully saying that they do it for
to have god in mind And therefore is for to dread that they shall be put out of
mind from among gods chosen For crist pleyneth him of such folk to his
fader in heuene / and says thus Qm^ que^ tu percussisti persecuti su^t: et
super dolore^ vulneru^ meoru^ ad dideru^t. Fader in heuene says he for asmoche
as these wicked swerers / have pursued with their wicked tongues. him that thou
smytest and sendyst to suffer death for salvation of mankind / and put new
sorrow above the sorrow and ye bitter peynes of my wounds / that I suffryd for
her sin and their sake / therefore fader put thou sin to sin. That is to
say. let them fall fro sin to sin / and let them not enter into thy
rightwysnesse for to be sauyd Put them out of the book of life / from among
them that shall be in bliss withouten end Let them not be written with the
rightwyse folk that shall be saved These ben crystes words plenyng him to the
fader in heaven of such foul swerers. p^o. lxviii.


Dives. It semyth herby that such swerynge is fulle orrible sin and full
perilous. But what say thou of the secunde excusation.


Pauper. We ben bound neuyr to lie. and no thing say but sothe Nathelesse we
ben not bound to say all the sothes / ne we owe not to swear for eurry sothe /
that we speak For as says saint Thomas. deveritate theology. Both he yt
forswerith him against the treuth and he that swerith with the treuth withoute^
great cause both they take gods name i^ vein For he that forswerith him
wytingly he names souerayn treuth / and that is god and dispiseth it And he
that sweryth withouten great cause takith his name i^ ydelship For he swerith
withouten good cause / and when him nedith not And so both little or naught set
by gods name / and so they take it in vein


The vi. chaptre.
Dives. In how many cases is it lefulle to swear.


Pauper. In vii. cases clerks and leude folk may swear lefully First for to
save man or woman from harm of his body. and and fro lesynge of his good /
wha^ne the treuthe may none otherwise be preuyd Also for confirmacio^ of peace
Also to keep feith and treuthe among mankind. Also for to keep obedience.
and ordinal subjection of the subgettes to their soueraynes. Also for to save
fredome of holy church Also for purgation and salvation of mannys name. and of
his fame Also for assoylynge from a curse Extra lio i^ de elect. significasti
And i^ every oath me^ must have three things. Which been treuthe dome and
rightwysnes. as says the prophet jeremy iiii.c. For who so shall swear he
must have treuthe in his conscience / yt he wot well he swerith treuthe. For
if he be not syker / but only wenyth to be syker. he shall not swear yt it is
so / but that he wenyth that it is so as he says Also he must have with him
dome that is a good and a discrete auysement or he swear / that he swer^ not
but treuthe. And for need. that he to whom he sweryth wole not else bibeue
him i^ thing of charge that is proufitable to be bileuyd but he swear. Also he
must have rightwysnes / that ye thing that he swerith for / and the manner of
sweryng be rightful honest and leful. Extra lio ii. de iure iurando Et si xp^s.


Dives. I would feign fle such oaths / but as I said first. men wole not
leave me but I swear.


Pauper. If it be a treuthe of charge right profitable to be leuyd and men woll
not leave the for thy simple word thanne it is leful to the to swear as I have
said. But if it be a thing of no charge ne nedefulle swear thou not For if
thou use the to swear como^ly for a thing of naught / thou sinest grievously and
make other of wanbileue / yt they should no more leave the for thine oath than
they do withouten oath / And wise men wol the less leave the for thyn oaths For
commonly great swerers and vsa^t swerers been fulle false.


Dives. Why so.


Pauper. For in yt they take gods name so in vein. they ben false to god in
their swerynge And sithen they been falls to god in their sweryng / they give
little tale to be falls to man or woman in their swerynge / or to begile them
with oaths And therefore if thou wylt ye men leave the. by yhe. or nay. use the
to speak truly discretely and flee oaths And so worship gods name. and be
true to god in biyng and selling in speech and in living And than men should
leave the redily. Withouten any oath. Do so and speak so that men may hold the
a true man And than men shall leave the by yhe and nay. better tha^ other with
their greter oaths. And if thou be variynge and vntrusti in thy word and in
thy deed / men wole neither bileue the by oath ne withouten oath.


Dives. Therefore su^me say ye christ forbad al manner sweryng wha^ne he said
in his gospel. Ego aute^ dico vobis no^ iurare oi^no Mt v.c. I say to you yt ye
swear i^ no manner.


Pauper That is not ye englisse of cristes word But this is the englisshe. I
say to you that ye swear not i^ every manner / that is to say for every cause
not light line custumably Also he badde by tho words. yt men should not swear
by creatures / as for wytnes / neither by heuyn for it is gods trone Ne by
earth. for it is the stole under his fete Ne by ierlm^. for it is the cite of
the great king. Ne by thine head / for thou might not make one of thyn herys
white ne blak Let your word be yhe yhe. nay nay. Mt v.c.


Dives. Must we than say twyes yhe. and twies nay


Pauper That thou must if thou wylt be true. For the same yhe yt thou say
with thy mouth thou must say it with thyn heart And ye same nay that thou say
with thy mouth. thou must say it with thyn heart For thy mouth and thine heart
must accord togydder For if thou say yhe with thy mouth. and nay with thyn
heart / thou art falls and do against cristes lore.


Dives. yet Contra te Saint James says Ante oi^a fre^s mei nolite iurare. etc.
Iacobi v.c. Before al things my leave brethern / wole ye not swear. neither by
heuyn ne by earth. ne by any other oath / whereby it semyth yt it is not leful
to swear.


Pauper. Saint James forfe^dith us not utterly for to swear. But he byddeth
that men should not be in will to swear any oath for men should not but for need


Dives. yet Contra te Crist byddeth in the gospel Mt v.c. That our word should
be yhe yhe / nay nay Quod autem his habundancius est / a malo est. For what is
more than this in spech it is of evil. Whereby it semythe that if men say more
than ye. or nay by oaths swerynge / they do amys


Pauper. Crist said not yt it was evil to say more than yhe or nay / or to
swear when itt nedith But he said it is of evil that men swear and say more
than yhe or nay For it comes of wa^byleue of him that wole not leeue his even
christian / but he swear Also it cu^myth of falshode of ye people / ye much folk
is so false. ye uneaths men may leave them withoute^ oath or by oath


Dives Where fyndest thou yt god badde me^ swear / or that it is lefull for to
sweere.


Pauper. In the gospel that thou allegist against me Mt v.c. Where crist says
thus. Reddes dn^o iuramenta tua. Thou shall yield to thy lord god thyn oaths
That is to say thou shall swear by him and by none other / and therefore he
says. deuteronomy. vi Thou shall dread thy lord god and serve hi^ alon^ and swer^ by
his name


The vii. chapter.
Dives. Why forbidith crist men to swear by creatur^s


Pauper. There is ii manner of swerynge. One is a taking of witness of thing.
that a man sweryth by / and so it is not leful for to swear by any creatur^ For
saint poule says. Hoi^es per maiore^ suu^ iurant. ad hebre. vi. Me^ swear
says he by their more / yt is to say by him that is more of credence and of
reverence than they been them self But only god is more in dignitye and more
in order of kind than man. for he is both god and man And therefore he wole
that we take in sweri^g no witness but only of him / for he is sovereign
treuthe And therefore such manner swerynge is a divine worship that longith only
to god and to no creature For god wole that wha^ne men may have no witness of
treuthe yat is nedefulle and profitable to be bileuyd / yt they take him to
witness and swear by him as by sovereign treuthe and by no creature For such
manner swerynge is a divine worship that lo^gith to god and to no creature. As
says the gloss Mt v.c. sup illud. No^ piurabis. And as austyne says. i^ the
same place / who so swerith by any creature / he swerith by god yt made that
creature And therefore criste bad. yt men should swear by no creatures. For if
they do lightly they fall in double syn. both in ydolatrye and in perjury.
First in ydolatrye. for the worship yt longith only to god. they do it to
creatures Also they fall often so in periurye. For men dread less to lie and
to forswere them when they swear by creatures than when they swear by god
allone.


The viii. chaptre.
ANother manner swerynge is by execration and imp^cation / that is when man or
woman in his sweryng prays openly or privily against hi^ self. or against any
thing that he louyth / or any other thing but it be as he says. And thus
su^me man sweryth by his head / su^me man by his thedame For as saint austyn
says / he that sweryth so he byndeth him self and leith his head and his
thedame / in plegge to god. and prays to god that he leese his head and his
thedame. and neuyr thryue but it be as he says. or but he do as he says or
hotith Su^me swear by their soul / by their chaffare and by all the good yt
they have / and so bind them to lose their soul / their chaffare and al their
good. and bind their soul to the fire of hell withoute^ e^de but it be as
they say. Su^me swear by faders soul and moders. and so asmoche as they may
they bynd their faders soul and moders to the peyn of hell withouten end / but
it be as they say / or but they do as they hoten Su^me in their swerynge pray
openly against themself / as wha^ they say so help me god. There they forsake
the help of god but it be as they say Su^me say else the devil brenne me / god
give me else myschaunce / and such other. And of this manner sweri^g is that
solemn oath that me^ make i^ dome and out of dome / when men say. so help me
god at the holy dome / or else so help me god and the holy dome. In this
oath me^ forsake ye help of god and of our lady / and of all the cumpany of
heuyn at the day of dome / but it be so as they say And ouir that if they
swear falls. they clepe god to witness. of a thing that is false. and sayen
that god whose name is treuthe beryth them witness of a thing that is false And
so they lie on god and do him great velonye. for he was neuir falls witness.
ne neuyr shall be For he is sovereign treuth that not disseyueth ne may not be
disseyued. And that shall these falls jurors feel at ye day of dome / but they
amend them.

Dives. Why ley men their hand on the book when they should swear before a
judge.


Pauper. For that men should charge their oath the more. For when he leith
his hand on ye book. he forsakes all the feith of holy church / and all
the holy prayers written in the book. but it be as he says Also he forsakes
all the joys of heuyn written i^ the book / and byndeth him to all the peynes
written in the book / but if it be as he says. And i^ that he leyth his hand
on the book in his swerynge / he forsakith all the good dedys that euyr he did
or euyr shall do / but it be sothe that he swerith For in holy wrytt by the
hondes ben understand works And in yt he sweryth so with his mouth. and
kysseth the book. he forsakith all holy prayers and good words that euyr he
spoke with his mouth / or euyr shall speak but if it be as he says / and but
he swear sothe. And if he forswere him with his mouth / he makes it unable to
resceyue the holy sacrament of the auter / that is crist him self sovereign
treuthe / under form of bread.


The ix. chapter.
Dives. What say thou of them that though they swear sothe / yitt in sligh
words they disseyue their even christian which understand them not.


Pauper. Such be forsworn. For in ii. manners a man may be forsworn in
swerynge soth. First if he swear soth in gilous words and slighe for to begile
his even christian For as says. Isodorus xxii. q^. quinta. quacu^que. What
craft or slighte euir thou use in thy speech and in thine oaths to disseyue
thine even christian / god that knowyth thy thought and thy conscience. takith it
not as you menyst / but as he understands it / to whom thou sweryst so in
disseyte. And as he says thou do double syn so swerynge For both thou
take gods name in vein / and also thou disseyuest thine even christian.


Dives. Tell su^me example.


Pauper. We find in the life of saint Nicholas that a jew lent a christian man a
great su^me of gold unto a certain day and took no sikernes of him but his
feith / and saint Nicholas to borowe The day passide and ye criste^ man paid
not. Wherefore ye jew chale^ged his gold of the christian man before a judge / for
he said falsely that he had paid him. When the judge should sytt on the cause.
the criste^ man bithoughte him of gile and feynyd him seek and came lenyng on a
staff before the judge / in which staff he had putt all the gold yt he ought
to the jew and more thereto / for ye staff was holowe And when be should ley
his hand on the book / he took the jew the staff in his hand / prayng him
to hold it while he made his oath The jew thought of no gyle / but took the
staff to hold as he prayed him And than the false christian man leyd his hand
on the book and made his oath on this manner. By god and seint Nicholas and so
help me god at the holy doom I took the all the money yt thou chalengist and
more thereto And he said soth / for he had taken it him that time in the
staff. The jew was wroth and said to him Now as wysly as you have forsworn
the by god and saint nycholas. I pray god and saint nicholas yt was thy borowe
/ yt hard ve^geau^ce come to ye The criste^ man took aye^ his staf of the jew
and went homwarde again lenyng on his staff There fell such an heaviness of
sleep on him that he leyd hi^ down i^ the way to sleep a little from the cite
where he had made his oath / and leyd the staf with the gold fast besides him
Came a carte and went upon him / and slew him and brak his staff. till the
gold scateryd all about Anoon the people and the jew also ran for to see.
What was fallen. And when they saw the staff broken / and the gold so
scateryd about they knew how gylefully he had sworn. and thankyd god. and
seint Nicholas. that the treuthe was tried and shewid The jew yaue that gold
to pore folk / and bicame a christian man.


Dives. This ensample is open. Now I se that gyleful oaths been full perilous
Say forth I pray the


Pauper. Alsoo a man may be forsworn sweryng sothe unwittingly and wenyth to
swear falls to disseyue his even christian As if I swore to a another that it were
not day to disseyue him and let him of his journey / wenyng my self that it
were day / al though it were not day but fer from day yet I were forsworn. As
the law shewyth well. xxii. q^. ii. c. io Also if a man swear a treuthe with a
blasphemye of gods name. As if he swore by gods body. heart / iyen /
wounds / or any such other / if he be customyd thereto / he is forsuorne /
whether it be sothe or false that he sueryth.


The x. chapter.
Wherefore leave friend ye shall understand that in vi manners a man is forsworn
First if he swear ayenste his conscience. as wha^ he swerith false wyttingly
though he do it for dread Also if he swear a thing unlawful and against charity
/ as if he swear to sle a man or defoule a woman with his body / or yt he shall
neuir do alms to pore men / ne come in his neighbors house Also if man do
against his oath which is leeful all though he do it for dread of death / if
the oath turn to none evil end Also if he swear treuth for disseyte and gyle
as I said now late Also if he swear unwisely / as says Durandus in summa
sua. extra. de iureiurando c. sicut. etc. tua. And if he do it with auysement or
vsau^tly / it is dedely sin. And he says there that every oath made unwisely
is periurye. Also if he compelle. a another to swear wyttyng well that he wole
forswere him. As the law shewith well xxii. q^. iiii Inter cetera. And saint
austyn also i^ a sermon that he makes in the decollacion of saint John
Baptyste. Where he tellith. That on a time a good simple true man had lent a
certain money to a false man / which forsook it. and said that he lent him
none / wherefore the true man prouokyd him to swear. Wyttynge well that he would
forswere him and so he did. and the true man lost his money And the night
following the true man thought that he stood before a great judge. Which said to
him on this wise why did thou that man swear sithen thou wyste well that he
should forswere him Lord said he for he denied me my good. Thanne the judge
said to him. It had be better to the for to have lost thy good / thanne to
slay his soul that god bought so dear with his precious blood. And anon he did
him beat hard and sore / in somoche that wha^ne he awoke his back apperyd
fulle of wounds and al forbeten full blake and blo. But when he repentyd him
and axed mercy. his sin was foryouen him

The xi. chapter.
Dives. It might well be so / for both took gods name in vein / and did
dispite thereto / the swerer in that that he forswore him willing and wyttynge
/ and he that made him swear For wyllyng and wyttynge he did he forswere him
and despise gods name / and so he asse^tyd to periure And by the law both he
that does the sin. and he that assentith thereto been gilty of the sin and
ben worthy the same peyn But I pray the what say thou of them that swear so
dispitfully and horribly by gods body. heart blood and such other


Pauper. That manner swering is open blaphemye and great dispyte to god And if a
man or woman be vsaunt thereto / swear he soth swear he falls. he synneth dedely
For not only such take gods name in vein but also in great dispyte. And
therefore it is forfendyd by the law xxii. q^. prima Si quis per capillu^. There
should no man swear by the here of christ / ne by his head / ne by no part of
criste / ne use such blasphemye ayenste god in any manner wise. And if he did.
but he would cease and amend him if he were a man of holy church he should be
deposyde and degradyde. And if he were a lewd man he should be acursed and
pursued by censure of holy church. till he would amend him. And by the law
imperial as the gloss says there / such foul swerers should be punysshed
with ye vtterest pain and turme^t / save death And therefore in almayne. such
ben punisshed shamefully in diverse cu^trees. And therefore in tho cuntrees ben
used none oaths / but it be before a judge or else for great need. There is
their speech as the gospel techith. yho and nen. that is ye and nay on
englisshe. And they keep more treuthe for yho and nen / thanne we do with all
the great oaths that we use in this land Of such foul swerers spekith
seynte poule sayng that asmoche as in them is they do gods son often on
the cross / and have butt a iape and scorn of his passion. Rurfu^
crucifigentes sibimet ipsis filium dei and ostentui. i. irrisio ni habentes. ad
hebr^. vi. For they can not speak to an vnskylful be / but if they to re^de
crist with their oaths / and day and night rerep^ue crist of his shameful death
yt he suffride for their sin and her sake And there yt they oughte^ to take
most matter to love him and to worship him / they take most occasion of
unkindness to dispyse him. For ne had he dyed bitter death and shameful for
our gylte our sin and our sake / should we neuir else have sworn by
gods death / and ne had he wept salt terys with his eyn for our gylt and
not for his own should we neuir else have sworn by gods iyen And ne had
he be stu^ge to the heart / and shed his precious heart blood to wasshe us
from our sins / should we neuir else have sworn by gods heart / ne by
gods blood. And ne had he suffryde the deep wou^des and bitter peynes i^ his
body and i^ his bones to save us from hell pain / should we neuir else have
sworn by his wou^des / his body. ne his bones. ne his blood And so against the
endless love yt he showed to us we show hi^ great unkindness / and against the
great worship yt he did to us and brought us to endless worship / we do him ouir
great velony. We find in the miracles of our lady that sumtym there was a
justice rightful in demynge / but full gyltye in such oaths swerynge Sumdele he
was devout to our lady. and grette her every day with certain auyes /
wherefore our lady by night apperyd to him and showed him a child all blody.
The iyen were put out of the head / and henge down by ye chekys / the heart
was rent out of the body / and henge a down. by the side. and all the body
was for torn and wrappyd in blood Thanne she said to him / thou art a
justice give me now a rightful dome: what is that man worthy that thus has
arayede my child. The justice aunsweryd and said He is worthy to be hangyd by
the neck in the fire of hell withouten end Tha^ne our lady aunsweryd
Forsothe. thou art the same man / For I had neuir child but this allone.
Which was borne of my body for salvation of al ma^kynd.

And thou asmoche as in the is have put out his eyn / wha^ thou swore by
gods eyn / thou rentyst out his heart when thou swore by gods heart. Thou
haste all to rent him with thy foul oaths. And therefore amend the or thou
shall have the some dome that thou have youe^ and hang by the neck i^ the fire
of hell withouten end.


The xii. chaptre
Dives. What say thou of them yt swear by the cock for god / su^me by god
and by ye haldam. for god and the holy dome su^me by laken / for by our lady
su^me by cocks body / su^me by their hode some by their tepat and cap / and
many such other nyce oaths. men use now these days.


Pauper. If they swear any such oaths for to begile their even christian that
understand he^ not / they sin dedely and been forsworn And for to couple to
gydder god and the holy dome i^ sweryng in ernyst or in game / it is a grievous
sin. and dispyte and scorn to gods name.

And if they swear such oaths not for disceyte. but for to fle greter oaths:
yet they sin full grievously if they be vsaunt thereto. For they do against
cristes lore. that byddeth us swear by no creature / ne to swear but for great
need and great profyt / and else not / but our word should be yhe yhe. nay
nay. And if a man be compellyd to swear he shall swer^ by his god. and by noone
such nyce oaths. Moreouir leave fre^d wha^ne yt man sweryth by his cap or by
his hoode / or by any such other either he swerith so by wey of witness
taking or by wey of exetracion^ If he swear so by wey of witness taking he
does him self foul velony For he makes his hode of more worship. and of more
credence than himself. For as saint poule says there should no man swear for
witness taking / but by his more. and by his better And he offendith god full
highly / for the worship that lo^gith only to god / he does to his hode For why
swerynge. ^s for witness is a divine worship that longith only to god. And if
he swear by hode by weye of execration. so yt he mote lose his hode but he
say sothe / It is an ouyr scornfulle oath / for it is no great loss a man to
lose his hode to win an hu^dryd pu^de.


Dives. And yet such ben more true of their word thanne other that swear
greter oaths.


Pauper. Sumtyme it is so For the fee^de temptith them less. and to the less
sin for to hold them stylle i^ the greter / and so draw other to the same
sin that they perceive not. For more syn it is to rub god of his worship.
than to rob be a man of his catel But such as swear by hode: do divine worship
to hoode / and take it from god and make other to do more worship to hode than
to gods holy name And often such so sweryng keep treuthe in small things and
common / to disceyue me^ in greter things of more charge And therefore I pray
the use not such nyce oaths / Butt let thy word be. yhe yhe. nay nay. as
crist byddeth it / so that it be said with lowness and reverence And if it
need you to say more / say yhe truly / nay truly / or sikerly or sothely / for
that manner of spech is none oath For it is naught else to say. but I say ye
truly / and not falsely. I say yhe sykerly / and not disceyuably / and use none
oaths but thou be compellyd by thy sovereign / or for a thing of charge / and
men shall leave the well by thy yhe yhe. and nay nay / withouten any more.


The xiii. chaptre.
Dives. Is it not more syn a man to swear him by god than by his hode


Pauper. It is more sin. For the holyer that the thing is that man swerith
by. the greater is the sin and the periurye / as says ye law And more syn
it is a man to forswere him by god than by creatures / or by falls gods or
mawmettys. And though if you swear by any oath or by any creature / that is not
lefulle to swear by / thou synnest grievously swear thou sothe swear thou false
/ But yet perjury. by god is more sin thanne by creature.


Dives. If a man swear by his hode / is he bounten to keep his oath.


Pauper. yhis if his oath be leful and speed fulle. or else he does sin to
sin.

As the law says.xxii. q^. i. Mouet te.


Dives. Is it lefulle to a christian man to take an oath of an hethen man that
swerythe by his false gods.


Pauper. yhe. if he may none other sykernesse have of him. But it is not
lefulle to a christian man to stir him to swear so. Example of this have we
Gen^. xxxi. Where Laban swoore to jacob by his false gods


Dives. Wha^ne servants ben sworn to their lord that they shall be true to him
and warn him of his harms / been they bound to tell him all the myscheuys
falsededis. and vilonyes. yt been done to the lord in householde or out of
household if they know them


Pauper. If the lord be fell cruel and baratous or suspecte ayenste the
person. that is giltye I trow the servant by yt oath be not bound to tell
the lord thereof / for to accuse the persoone. for so his oath is vnlefulle. For
so in keeping of his oath he should led the lord to grievous sin And therefore
he should not have made that oath at the begi^nynge / for it was semely yt much
disease might come thereof if it were kept. Nathelesse if that servant that so
swore knew any wight berynge or taking away or wasting the lords good that
he has in keeping / he owith to warn the lord thereof / but if he may the more
peasibly have it again / and save the lords profytte And every servant is
bounden to warn the lord of the harm yt is done to the lord in his office
for good feithe and salvation of his own person / if it may not else
peasibly be redressed And anentes other defautes yt touchen not his office / if
he may prove hem he is bound to tell them to the lord / if the lord be
pacient and skillful and not to cruel If he may not prove them / he is not
bound to tell them. As the law shewyth well xxxv. q^. vi. Ep^s in synodo. et
ii. q^. i. Si peccauerit et q^. vii. Pleru^que. vi. q^. ii. Si tm^ For if the
servant when he made that oath thought to bynd him to tell his lord all the
harms yt he knew / though he might not preue it / his oath was not lefulle
and therefore it byndeth not Every servant is bound by hisothe and by his
feith to be true to his lord and warn him of his harm and of his velonye in
common manner / but he is not bound for to accuse in special / but if he may
preue it / but it be full pryuely to such one that wole profytte to the person
and not harm him ne defame him / but only amend him For by accusyng in
special but if the pleynt may be preuyd fallith hate / fightyng / ma^slauter

to do or to keep a certain thing in time cu^myng / if their successoures do
it not / ne keep not their covenant / been not their successoures forsworn.


Pauper. Nay. For that oath byndeth the persons that swore and not their
successoures / as for periurye Nathelesse the successoures ben bounden by good
feyth for to do and for to keep. that their predecessors bound them to so
swerynge / if it were leful / and have the same proufyttes therefore that their

Dives. If a man make an oath to an other man / may not that other man that he
makith it to unbind hi^ from that oath / and forgive it him


Pauper. If it be so that oath be made principally in favor of gods worship
/ ye man yt he made it to may natt assoyle him ne unbind him from ye oath ne
none other may but by chaungyng i^to some thing better. but need or vnpower
excuse him. If the oath be made principally in the favor of the man yt he
swerith to / that man may well unbind him fro his oath And if he made that
oath in favor of an other man / only that other man may unbind him from yt
oath. but any condition put in the oath let it As I swore to the that I should
give thy fader x shelinges thou might not unbind me fro yt oath But thy
fader might well vnbynd me thereof


Dives. Whether is a man harder bound. by vow or by oath


Pauper. The vow byndeth harder For our vow byndethe us by our feythe and
the treuthe that we owe to god to pay to him our bihestes Our oaths bind us
principally to be true to our even christian for reverence of gods holy name.
As says iohe^s in su^. con. li.i. ti. ix. q^. xiiii. quero.


Dives. If a man or a woman have do dedly sin / of which he is shreuen and
contrite / may he swear sikerly yt he is not gilty. of that sin / for to
avoid scla^der of him self and of his fre^des. and of other that wole not leave
him in that but he swear


Pauper For asmoche as he knowyth not sykerly that he is sufficiently co^trite
/ he is natt syker whether his syn is foryouen him or natt. And therefore he
should for no mischeyf swear so folily Much more he should not swear it of his

The xv. chapter.
Dives. What is a vow propirly


Pauper. Vow is bihotyng of su^me good thing made to god with a auysement. As
says Reymu^de.


Dives. When man or woman in anguysshe and disease makith a vow to be helped /
been they not bounden to fulfylle that vow though a^guyssh and disease catch.
or stir them thereto


Pauper. yhis forsothe if they thought on the cause why they made it. and were
in purpose. than to bind them if they had their desire and help / in that
need. so yt by keeping of their vow. they ben better disposed to keep gods
commandments / for thereto should al common vows deserve And the wife that in
peril of child beryng or of other seknes makith a vow al if she ought none
to make / withouten leeue of her husbonde / yet she owythe not to do ayenste yt
vow by her own dome / ne withoute^ dome of her souerayn / if she feel her
helped by the vow. Nathelesse I trow that her husbo^de may unbind her
therfro / and her confessoure also / by chaungynge into some other good deed /
and namely if ye keeping of ye vow should turn i^to p^iudice of the husbo^de.
or lettynge of the better deed. For wives owe not to make great vows that
should be in disese and p^iudice of their husbonde Ne children within age.
should make none a vow / withouten assent of their fader or of their tutoure
Ne the seruau^te i^ p^iudice. or hyndrynge of his lord or of his master And
if he do / his lord or master may revoke it / and so may the fader the childs
/ and ye husbonde the wives Other vows that been no prejudice to ye husbo^de /
the wife may make as to say certain bedys But of no great pilgramage / ne of
great abstinence / ne of continence / ne to give great alms / but if her
husbonde be mys disposed i^ his wits / or not rulyde of custom by reasone.
For if her husbonde be vnpitous of nedy people she may make a vow to yef to
porefolk to the plesaunce of god after her power saving their both astate


Dives. Whethir is more medful to do a good deed with a vow or withoute^ a vow.


Pauper. With a vow / for vow maki^g is one of the highest worship yt man may
do to god Quia est actus latrie. Also by vow man lowyth him most to god. and
yeueth to god the most yifte yt he may give that is his free will. As he
yeueth a greter gift that yeueth the tree with fruit / tha^ne he that yeuyth
the fruit / and reseruyth to him the tree Also by vow ma^nys will is more
stabled in godenesse Nathelesse for asmoch as man and woman ben fulle frayl and
chaungeable / therefore me^ should not make vows but few and with a good
auysemente For brekynge of vows is great dishonor to god.


Dives. What if a man make a vow only under condition.


Pauper. If the condition fall or be he is bound / else not. And if a man
bind him by diverse causes / if the one fall he is bounden though the other
fall natt. As if I made a vow. to goo to Saint James in hope to find there
my brother / and also to have rede^pcio^ of my si^nes / though I wyste after
certainly that I should not find my brother ther^ yet I were bound to go
thither. for the other cause.


Dives. For how many causes is man or woman unbound from his vow.


Pauper. For iiii. causes First if the principal causes of his vow making
fail As if a man make a vow to fast all the satdayes to have health of his
child if the child amend not he is not bound thereto. Also if it be made under
condition / yat is not ne fallith not Also if he souereyne unbind him thereof.
Also by vnpower if may not keep it.


Dives. Thanne if a maiden make a vow to live in mayde^hode all her her life /
if she be corrupt and lose her maydenhode. she is unbound from her vow. for
she may no le^ger live i^ maydenhode


Pauper. Al if she may no longer live in maydenhode. yet she is bound to
contynence al her life / and to keep her vow in asmoche as she may And so it is
of other vows yt men may natt all do / for they ben bound to do that they
may do. Moreouir ye shall understand ye su^me vow is of need / as the vow yt
we make in baptym / to forsake the feende / and to keep the feyth of holy
church. And other vows of free will. as when man byndeth him freely to do a
good deed. Withoute^ which he may be saved as fasting contynence pilgramage.
Two things be nedeful in chagyng of vow. Rightful cause. and autorite of the
soueraynes In dispensacion of the vow of abstine^ce or such other must be
taken head to the richesses or the poverty of the person

For a poor man i^ caas owith to have asmoche dispensacion. for a penny or for
right naught. as a great lord for an hundryd mark Su^me condiciones been
understand in vows though a man say them not / as I shall do if I live / if
god wole. Other conditions ben more special / as I shall visytte seint thomas if
I go into kent By both manner of these conditions if they fayl man is excused of
his vow / if it sto^de full in that condition The husbonde may not enter into
religion / but his wif make first vow of perpetuel contynence Neither the wife
ne the husbo^de may make vow of contynce withoute^ other assente Solemn vow
of contine^ce lettith matrymony done. and for to be done. If it be not solemn
if the person wedde the matrymony holdith. He must yield the debt of his body
to his wife / but he may not axe it of her Solemn vow is made by taking of
holy order / or by enter into religion Though a man or woman break his fast
bicaus of seknes / he brekith not his abstinence. Extra lio vto de regulis

The xvi chapter.
Dives. What if a man or woman swear a thing in hastiness / which oath he
would not have sworn if he had auised him.


Pauper. If his oath be a mean to keep the better gods commandment / and
to fle thee by more syn and love the more god he is bound to keep his oath.
and not else


Dives. If children swear to do a thing leful while they be within age / may
their fader and their mother revoke that oath.


Pauper Fader and mother and his tutoure may revoke the childs oaths and their
vows / as soon as they know thereof And so may the husbonde of his wife. and
she is bound to obey to his reuocacion But if he go forth when he wot thereof
/ and revoke it natt. at the beginning / afterward he may natt by the law
revoke it / ne the fader the childs oath ne vow.


Dives. I suppose he revoke it afterward.


Pauper. Both the wife to the husbonde. and the child to the fader while he is
within age owyth to obey Auyse him of the peril that so reuokith.


The xvii. chapter.
Dives. Whether is periurye. more sin or manslaughter.


Pauper. Perjury is more. For as says saint poule Ad hebreos vi.c. Men should
swear by their better and their greter / and of every contrauersye / that is to
say. of every cause that is in debate to conferme the true party. the last
end is an oath For every such cause is termyned and endyd by an oath And
sithe^ it is so yt the cause of manslaughter and of every open sin touching
mannys dome must be termyned by an oath / periurye must be taken for a
passing sin and so it is. For who so forswerythe him wyttyngly he forsakith
his god And therefore perjury is greatyst syn of al sins next ydolatrye For it
is against the secou^de commandment / and i^mediate against god / and dispite
and forsaking of god But manslaughter is i^mediate against man And though man with
manslaughter greuyth god full highly / yet he forsakith not god ne dispiseth
hi^ / ne dishonors him so much as he does by periurye. And as the phisopher
says. In principio metaphisice. Among hethen me^ oath has euir be
worshipful For every sect. jew sarsyn. paynym. flees to swear falslye by his
gods name / as most incouenient And if manslaughter were more syn than
periurye / it were but a folly to try the cause of manslaughter by any oath For
it is semely yt he that was not aferide to do the great sin of manslaughter
/ should litel dread to forfete i^ the syn of perjury if it were less And thus
saiy seint thomas in qo^e. de quolibet and Io i^ su^. li.i. ti. q^. xxiiii
vtrum.


Dives32. If all men chargyd perjury and falls oaths as thou do many man
had been hangyd and drawn and slain in otherwise yt yet live and farewele It
is full hard so lightly to sle a man with a word / when his life may be saved
with a word For a man costith full much or he come to be a man


Pauper. Therefore men should bisily fle periurye and false oaths For there is no
thing that causith so much manslaughter and shedynge of blood / as does
perjury.


Dives. Show me that I pray the if thou can.


Pauper. Salamon says Eccle. xo.c. The kingdom is flyttyd and chaungyd fro
nation to nation. for wrongs. vnrightfulnes and despites done to gods name
in diverse gyles But periurye is cause of all false domes and wrongs / and of
all vnrightefulnesse / cause of gyle and treasone / and of great dispites /
yt been done to god and man For as I said first every cause must be endyd by
witnesses or by questes / which been sworn to say treuthe / and also by a
judge which is sworn to god. and to the king to deem rightful doom. And if
they that been chargyd to say the treuthe give no tale to forswere them. and
to lie / they shall disceyue the judge / and do him give a false dome Such
periurers rob men of their good / and disherite much folk They save strong
thieves / and slay true men Such rob folk of their good name. such ben falls
to god to the king / to prelates of holy church. Such been cause that this
lord is in point to be lost and to be changed to a another nation and i^to a
new tu^ge And yt may not be without shedynge of much blood and
manslaughtere. And so periurye is cause of much manslaughter. Also periurye
is cause why we have so many thieves and ma^quellers in this land For they hope
always to be saved by periurye and falshede of questmongers / yt for lytelle
good wole forswere them. And therefore i^ hope of perjury they ben so bold in
their sin / to rob sle. and brenne / for though they betake^ yet they hope
to escape by periurye And if they were siker that there would no man ne woman
forswere hi^ to save them / they would neuir be so bold to sin And al other
should be the more aferyde to sin / if they wyste well that true dome should
pass withoute^ periurye. Such synful wretches as says the prophet ysaie
xxiii.c have put their hope al in lesi^ges and in perjury / and by lesinges
falshede and periurye / they been mayntened. and not chastised Also it is syn
all against kind to save a thief i^ dispyte of god / whose name they forswere
against his co^mau^dme^t For he byddeth that there should no man take his name in
vein Also he says Non suscipies vocem mendacii / nec iu^ges manu^ vt pro
impio dicas fal^u^ testimoniu^. Exodi xxiii. Thou shalt not take the voice of
lesynges. ne join thine ho^de in making of couenaunte to bear false wytnes for
the wicked man to save him. Malificos no^ pacieris viuere. Exodi xxii. Thou
shalt not suffer wytches and open malefactoures and felones live / but sle
them in chastisynge of other Sle one and save many one. Also this is a syn al
against kind and ouir great folly / a man to sle his own soul withouten end to
save a thief that neuir would wait him good turn / but ready to rob him and
paraue^ture to sle him when he may A great folly to offend god by periurye to
plese a thief a ma^queller / that offendith god and all the cuntre Such been
like the jews yt sauyde barraban the strong thief and ma^queller: and slew
sweet ihesu sovereign treuth yt neuir did amys. And as holy doctoures say a man
should rather suffer the most dispitous death of body than he should forswere
hi^ or do any dedly syn. Much more he should not forswere him ne do no dedly
sin. to save a thieves life / that god. and lands law co^mannde to sle. It
fell late in this land that a Scott appelyd an englisshma^ of high tresone /
wha^ne he should fight before a judge in their cause / the judge as the manner is
putt them both to their oath. Wha^ne the scotte should swear he said to the
judge. Lord I came not hyder to swear I came to fight. for my challenge was to
fight / and thereto I am ready / but swear wol I not / for I made no challenge to
swear The judge said yt but if he would swear. that his appele was true / else
he should be taken as a co^uycte and a taynt traytoure / and be hangyd and
drawn without fighting And so he was / for he would not swear wittynge well
that his appele was false / and made only for malice as he knowlechyd er he
dyed. This man might have sworn. and happily have had the better of his
adversary and escapid the death. With worship in this world But yet he had
leuyr dye dispitefully / thanne do dispyte to gods name / to swear falsely
thereby / and leuir to dye bodilye. than to do that periurye to god. and sle his
own soul. For he held it as it is a greter sin tha^ ma^slaughter And
though he would aue^ge him on man for rancour of heart / yet on god he would not
venge him by periurye. And so god saved them both fro perjury and ma^slaughter
and yaue them grace to dye i^ charity / and do a sees both to god and man.


The xviii. chaptre.
Dives. Sithen perjury is so great a syn / what pain is ordained thereto by the
law.


Pauper. As the law says xxii q^. i. p^dica^du^. Asmoche penance should be
enjoined for perjury / as for manslaughter and auoutre. And they should neuir
more be taken to swear or to bear witness in any dome / but be forsaken in
every dome. as taynte falls. and alwey suspecte of falshede. And by lands law
in many cuntrees if they be taynt forsworn before a judge: they should be
disherytyd for euir. and their house be drawn down / their wodes hewyn down
/ and their trees also man's hight above the ground The stocks sto^de stylle
to endeles repre of them and of al their kynred. For their is no sin so
noyous to a reme and to every comynte as is perjury For yt is cause yt yer may
no syn be punysshed / ne malefactoures ne felones chastised / nee wrongs
redressyd Men of holy church should be degraded / and lewd folk accursed.xi.
q^. i. co^spirationu^ etc. co^iuiationu^. All other sinners wha^ne they have
done penance for their sin and been amendyd / ben by the law restored again
to their fame / so yt they may be witnesses in dome. and their oath owyth to be
resceiued But periures yt ben taynt / shall neuir be restored to their fame: ne
be taken for witness / ne his oath acceptyd in no dome / As says hostiensis.
li.ii. Ru. de testibus S. qs possit v. excipit. and. v. hoc ide^ Et extra
li.ii. de testibus. c. expert / and vi q^. i. quicumque. And if he be teynt
forsworn before a judge / he is not able to be any p^late either in holy church / or in the laifee neither king ne busshop abbot ne prioure / prince
ne duke. or any chifteyne of worship


Dives. Why is periurye so hard punysshed by the law


Pauper For the sin is ouir grievous and ouir much hauntyd / and for it is
most openly ayenste the substance of treuthe and witness and most
maynteneth falshede and lettith most treuth and rightwysnesse. As says the
same clerk hostiensis in the same place. Such periurers may say that is
written. ysaie lix c. Concepimus et locuti sumus de cord vba mendacii etc. We
have conceived false contryuynges. and we have spoken of heart words of lesynge
And therefore rightful dome is turnyde bacwarde / and rightfulnesse stood from
far.

He durst not put forth his head / and treuthe fell down. openly in the
streets He was borne down openly / and no man would help hi^ up Equity says
he ne euenhode in shiftyng. and in demynge might not enter / for treuthe is al
foryeten And he yt fled from wicked / was every man's prey.


Dives. Now I se that perjury is a fulle greuouse sin and fulle perilous to
every comynte / and cause of much ma^slaughter / and shedyng of mannys blood
and lesynge of realms. For as I have red. the Realm of england for perjury
and falshede was translated from britons to saxones Afterward it was
tra^slatyd for periurye from saxones. and englisshe men to the danys.
Afterward wha^ne englisshe me^ had the kingdom again by ye death of the danys
/ they kept it but two kings times / seynted ward and horaldes / and anon
it was translated again for periurye unto the normaynes by wylliam duke of
normandy / which slow up nigh all the cheualrye. of this land / and chaungyd
the lordship and the prelacy of this land nigh all unto the french me^ And
what mordre and sheding of blood fell for these periurers in these three times
and chaunginges is fulle hard to tell. And now alas newly in our days we
ben fallen in periurye in the highest degree / not one but nigh al And what
blood has be shed sith / because of our periurye / no tunge can tell And
this land by shedyng of blood is so feblysshed i^ every state that we be not
of power withoute^ special miracle of god longer to withstonde. And so it is
full much to dread yt this Realm in short time for our periurye shall be
translatyd again to the britones / or else to su^me other tunge. I pray the
say forth what thou will


The xix. chaptre
PAuper. Ferthermore I said yt gods name is taken in vein by mysheryng For
if thou have liking to here great oaths of other men / or any mysswerynge / Or
if thou wate natl vein oaths ne art not myspayed when thou heryst them / thou
take gods name in vein For thou doste no worship thereto: as thou ought
to do For as solomon says a ma^nys here should rise for fere / and he should
stop his erys when he herd gods name so despised And if a man swear to the
sadly i^ gods name and auysely / thou art bou^de^ to lene hi^ for worship of
gods holy name / but you have ye more evidence to ye contrary. And but thou
accept his oath and give credence thereto but ye know ye contrary / else
thou takyst gods name i^ veyn For thou doste no due worship thereto / but
great dispite / in that that thou wylt not leave so worshypfulle a wytnes as god
is / whom he takith to witness so sweryng For many a simple man would be
myspayed if thou forsokest him for witness of treuth


Dives. If I find a man often false in his oaths / though I leave him not I do
god no dishonor.


Pauper. That is soth / for thou may well wete that god sovereign treuth beryth
him no witness i^ his falshode And therefore do worship to his oath and to
gods name and repreue his falsehode and dyspyte. that he does to gods holy
dame Moreouir if thou here men swear or blasphemegoddes name / or name gods
name in vanytie / if thou have likynge therein / thou takist gods name in
vein. And but thou snyb or rep^ue them if thou have power ouir them / and
gruche again a their synful speech / else thou takyst gods holy name in
vein. by heryng Also if thou have liki^ge to here erroures against the feithe
of holy church to consent to hem or shrewyd tales / or vein tales medlyd with
gods name and dishonest speech / against the worshipful name of criste and of
cristendome / which speech no good christian man ne woman owith to here / thou
takyst gods name in vein by hering For if thou love well thy god thou
should natt here patiently any speech yt sowneth dishonor to his holy name
For if thou louedyst well any man or woman / thou would here no speech sownynge
against their name and worship ne that might be causes of their offense. or
velonye.


The xx. chaptre.
ALso gods name is taken in vein by brekynge of couenaunte made in gods
name / and co^fermyd by swerynge in gods name. As when peace and covenant is
made bitwene kings and realms / between comynties / and bitwene persons /
and bitwene comynte and person / and is confermyd by swerynge Than every man
and woman that knowith it should fle to forfete in word or deed against the
couenaunte and the pease / for reverence of gods holy name by which it was
confermyd. And all tho that wyttyngly breken such couenauntes / or procuren by
word or deed or assenten thereto. that such covenant should be broken / if
the covenant be leful / al if it be not plesaunte they take gods name in veyn
And all tho that know of the couenau^te and of the oath / if by retchleshede
of speech or of deed ben cause of brekynge of peace and of such couenau^tes
whether it touch them or not / they take gods holy name in vein and do
dispyte thereto / sithen the pees and the couenaunte was made i^ gods holy
name / and confermyd also. We read also in holy writ / Iosue ix. chapter.
That when Iosue and gods people biganne to conquer the land of biheste /
the folk of gabaon in gyle sent messangers to iosue to make peace with Iosue
and with gods people. The messangers in gyle did on old clothes cloutyd /
old shone patched and all to torn They took hored bread i^ their scrippes.
sour wine in their botels. and lodyd asses with old hored bread in old sackes
/ and came so to iosue / and made a presaunt to him of old vitayles and said
to him your name springs fer and wide that there may no king no nation
withsto^de you Therefore we be come to you for salvation of our lives to make
peace with you Thanne iosue and the people said to them If ye dwell in the
land that god has yeuen to us / we may no peace make with you Thanne iosue
axed them what they were and from whe^s they came Sir said they we ben thy
servants and came to the fro fulle far cuntrees / sent fro the lords and
the leders of our land to make peace with the Thou may see by our array yt we
be come fro fer For when we come out our clothes and our shone were new /
they ben al to torn and all to rent. Our bread was new baken / now it is
hooryde Our botels and our wine weren new / now our botelles be nigh
brusten / and the wine is sour. and our vytales and the p^sau^t that we have
brought to the ben nigh lost for elde And thus they lied almoost every word
and disceyued iosue / for they duelte little ouir xx. mile thens Iosue took
their presaunte / and made peace with hem And he and all the princes of gods
people swoore to them yt they should have their lives and their gods / within a
few days after Iosue came to gabaon / and began to fight against the cite
Anoon they came out and showed her charter of pees

And how that Iosue and the princes of gods people. also had sworn to
them. to save their lives / the people would have slain them because of
their gyle Thanne iosue and the princes said to the people / we may not sle
them For we have sworn to them in the name of our lord And if we forswere
us god shall take vengeance of us.

Dives. I trow yt clerks these days would say that they were not bound to
keep that oath / sithen they gate that oath of them with so great gyle.


Pauper. If they auysed hem well they would say as iosue said For as I said
first. a man owythe to keep his oath if it be leful though he made it for dread
of death For every oath leful owyth to be kept though it be neuyr so much against
heart. And that shewyth god well afterward For as we find the secounde book
of kings xxi.c. Three hu^dryd year after. Saul king of gods folk slew all
the gabionytes yt he might find to plese his people / which hatyd always tho
gabionytes for their gyle God was myspayed with ye deed / and let the king
saul soon after be slain i^ batayl / and al his housebolde / and much of
gods people After in time of Dauyd yt reignyd next after saul / there fell such
an hungre in the land of israel three year to gidder yt much of gods people
perisshed Dauyd axed of god what was the cause of that hungre God said that
the death of the gabionytes which saul had slain was cause thereof. Dauyd sent
after the gabyonites that were left. and said to them. I know well yt for
you this hu^gre and myscheif is fallen in my realm Axe ye amends what ye wole
and I shall do it Thanne they said we axe neither gold. ne silver / ne no
mannys death of israel / but only vengeance on saul and his kynrede that so
wyckydly opp^ssyd us and destroyed us. We axe that every man of his kynred be
slain. and that none be left of his kynrede. Dauyd might not grant that
axynge for thothe that he had made to Ionatas the son of saul to save his
kynred Thanne they axed vii. men oonly of the kynred of saul. to ha^ge hem on
the gebettes against the son / and to sle them dispitously i^ punisshyng of
ye spite yt saul had do to gods holy name / i^ yt he did against the sole^pne
couenauntis yt his p^decessoures had made and co^fermyd swerynge by gods holy
name For i^ that saul took that oath and gods holy name in vein. As says
the master of the stories. When this was done the hu^gre ceased. and anon
began reyne and ple^tye of corn and fruit.


Dives. This example is full good and shewith well that every oath lefulle
should be kept And that every man and woman should fle to do dishonor or
spite to gods name Also it shewyth well yt periurye and dispisyng of gods
holy name is cause of shedynge of blood / of hungre / and of myscheyf / And
that god wole not suffer that his name be dyspised ne taken i^ vein


Pauper Therefore god says that every man and woman that so takith his name in
vein. I shall do to the as thou haste had swering in dispyte. and chargyste
not to break covenant / therefore thou shall bear thy sin and have dyspite
yerfore Eze. xvi.c. Also he says thus by the prophet If ye wole not here ne
set in heart to give worship to my name / I shall send in you hungre and
need and myscheyf And I shall curse your blessings / and take your might from
you / that ye shall not withstonde. Malachie ii.c.


Here endith the secounde p^cepte and begins the thridde
Dives. I thank the much. For now I know better tha^ne I did before / How
the secounde commandment should be kept And what peril it is to take gods
name i^ vey / ne. Now I pray the enfourme me in the thridde co^maundme^t.


Pauper. In the thridde commandment god byddeth that thou should bithynke
the. and have well in mind to halowe thyn holiday. Six days thou shalt
worche and do all thine own works. In the seuynthe day is the sabot / that
is to say. rest of thy lord god In that day thou shalt do no seruyle werk
/ neither thou ne thy son thy daughter / ne thy servant. man ne woman / ne
thy be / ne ne the stranger. that is within thy yate.


Dives. Why badde god that the seuynth day should more be hallowed thanne the
syxte day.


Pauper. For as god says there In six days he made heuene and earth and see /
and all thing that is therein. And in the seuynthe day he restyd and ceasyd
of his works And therefore he blessed that day and halowyde it / and ordained
that in that day man and beeste should rest / And that man that day should
specially thank god. For all the creatures that he made before i^ vi. days he
made to help and service and solace of man


Dives. Why says holy writ that god restyd the seuynth day. sithen he
trauayled neuyr For as seint austyn says he made all things withouten
trauayl / and as holy wryt shewith Genesis primo.c. He said butt this one
short word Fiat. and badde that it should be done / anon it was done as he
would.


Pauper. When holy writ says that god rested the seuynth day / he
understands thereby yt in the seuynthe day he ceasyde to make new creatures
For every thing was made before i^ the vi. days either in the thing him self
/ as aungel / light son moan sterres / either in his kind and i^ his
simylitude / as man best fysshe foul and grass / and tree / either i^ his
causes / as thing gendryde of corruption / and thing made by craft For god i^
his godhede. Was neuir in trauayl but always in blisful rest withoute^ end.
And therefore holy writ says not that he restyd after his werk ne in his
work / but yt he restyde from every work that he had made For he had no
travail for any work / and he was natt helped by his work / for he made no
thing for need but al for love


Dives. yet contra te. Christ says in the gospelle Io. Pater meus vsque modo
opera^. et ego operor. My fader worchith unto this time / and I worche also
Therefore it semyth that god ceased not the seuynth day from every work


Pauper. Two manner of werk is long to god. creation and governance From the
werk of creation he cesyd the seuynthe day / and tha^ne principally began the
work of governance and of keeping which work he co^tynueth and shall
continue withoute^ end. And of this work of governance spekyth Christ the
words in the gospelle / not of the work of creacion.


Dives. Ben there any mo skylles. Why god had the vii. day be hallowed


Pauper. Six skilles there been as sayen these clerks. First for god the vii.
day restyd / that is to say / he ceased fro creation of new creatures Also in
tokening that god in the vii. day delivered the children of israel from the
hard seruage of egipte / and led them through the read see dry foot / i^
to the rest of the land of bihest As we read in holy wrytt Deuteronomy. v.c. which
deliverance was token yt mankind should through cristes passion and by his
blood. yt he shed upon the rode / be delivered out of the feendes seruage /
and come to the endless rest. of the land of life The iii. cause is yt men
should yt day principaly give them to holy meditacione. and to thank god of al
his yiftes and his benefices / and to learn gods law and to pryse god The
fourth cause was to be token that criste the vii day should rest in his grave /
after yt he had traueyled vi. days to refourme again mankind that was lorne
through adams sin. The v. cause was to be token yt us must all cese from
vices and the vii. sins / if we wole be saved. As the prophet says.
Quiescite agere perverse / discite been agere. ysa. i.c. Rest ye to do amys.
and learn ye to do well The vi. cause is to betokene the endless rest that we
shall have from syn and pain in heuyn bliss / for ye good works that we do
the vi. days of our life / that is to say all the days of our life / and the
vi. ages of our syf. and for fulfillyng the vi. dedys of mercy which criste
names in the gospel. For as we read in the apocalips xiiii.c. The holy ghost
to whom this p^cepte is applied says that me^ after this life should rest from
their travails / for their good works follow them.


The ii. chapter.
Dives. Sithen that god badde the vii day should be hallowed / why keep we ye
viii day. that is sundaye. and natt the vii. day.


Pauper. God in the old law yaue three manner of p^ceptes For su^me were
cerimonyal / su^me judicial / and su^me moral The cerimonialles were but figure
and shadow of things that were to come And therefore when tho things were
fulfilled that the cerimonyalles be tokenyd / the cerymonials cesyd and
vanisshed. away / as the shadow vanyssheth away by light of the son
Judicial precepts were in punisshynge of sin / and iustifiynge / of which
su^me ceased / su^me duelle yet stylle. Butt moral p^ceptes yt teache us to love
our god. and our even christian / and to flee sin / and to love virtues. tho
last always / as the x. commandments and such other. And for asmoche as
this p^cept is cerimonial in party as anentes the time / and in party it is
moral / in asmoche as it techith us to worship our god / and to rest from
vices / Therefore in asmoche as it is moralle it is kept / but in y^ that it is
cerymonyal / it is chau^gyd into su^day as for the better. For that that it
figured and betokned is fulfillid That was ye rest of criste in the sepulcre
i^ the vii day / after the great travail that he had vi days before in
reformacion and redemption of mankind All be we bounden to worship god now
in ye new law / but not in that manner ne i^ that time that they were bou^de^
in the old law.


Dives. Why is it more chaungyd in the sunday thanne into an other day.


Pauper. For the great benefices and the great worshipful wounders that god
showed that day to mankind For on the su^day the world began / and light
and aungelles kind was made. That day god sent aungelles mete manna down
the the children of israel in deserte / and fed them so xl. year That day
god yaue moses the law in mou^te of synay That day criste was borne of the
maiden mary to save mankind That day christ rose from death to life / yeuyng us
example and hope. to rise from death to life That day the holy ghost lighted in
cristes apostles. and in his disciples. That day god shall come to dome / as
says a great clerk dockyng / super deutronomiu^. And so that day was the
first day and shall be the last day that neuir shall have end But it shall be a
day of endless bliss to al yt shall be saved For right as christ rose up from
death to life on the sunday / and neuyr dyed after ne shall dye / So shall al we
in the last sunday yt shall be ye last day / rise up from death to life and
neuir dye after / but live in bliss withoute^ end / if we make here a good
e^de This day is so worshipful that no bishop may be sacryd but on the su^day.
As says Reymu^de li.io ti. de feriis. And right as the saturday was hallowed i^
the old law for the rest ye god made in the saturday after the creacion and
the works that he made in the vi. first days / so holy church through
techynge of the holy ghost has ordained the sunday to be halowyd for the rest
that mankind shall take after vi ages of this world on the sunday / which
rest and sabott shall neuir have end Their sabott that was on the saturday
turns always aye^ to trauayl / but our sabote that is in the su^day at the
last shall turn into endless rest joy and bliss Sabot in ebrewe is rest i^
englisshe And every day i^ the woke is clepyd sabott and ferie yt is rest in
englisshe For every day we ben bound to ferie and to rest from syn Also all the woke is clepyd sabbot as there. Ieiuno bis in sabbato. And Mt vlti^o. The
sunday is clepyd the first day of ye sabbottes / as there. Vna sabbatoru^. And
Mt vlti^o. it is said. Prima sabbti^. For it is first not only i^ order of
days / but it is also first in dignite For the sabot and the rest in the
sole^pnyte of the saturday of the old law is now chau^gyd into the su^day /
for syn of the jews which slew christ on good friday / and so putt our lady
saint mary and al holy church in sorrow and care and great travail both
friday and saturday while criste lay i^ his grave. But for asmoche as he rose
from death to life on the su^day and apperyd to his mother and to his disciples
vii sithes ye day / and so on the sunday began the first joy bliss. and
rest of the new law / Therefore by gods rightful dome ye iewys sabot on the
saturday / turnyd them to sorrow and care and much travail. and our sundaye
turnyd us into great rest and joy and bliss And as the saturdaye was hallowed
by the old law. for god granted that day first rest to mankind after his
damnacion to perpetuel travail for adams sin / so is now the su^day halowyd
/ for than criste gra^tyd first rest joy and bliss to ma^kynd in the new
law after his passion and the salvation of mankind and the redemption / and
tnyd the sorrow that holy church had on the saturday by malice of the jews /
into rest and bliss on the su^day And so it is fulfilled yt the prophet
Ieremye said.xxxi.c. Redemit dn^s populum suum God has boughte again his people
with his p^ciouse blood / and has delivered his people out of the feendes
power I shall says god turn their mournyng into joy / I shall glade them of
their sorrow and conforte them. And by the prophet Osee he said yt he should
make the joy of iewys sabotes / and of al their solennyties. and of al their
feestes to cese because of their sin Osee.ii.c.


The iii. chapter
ALso for halowyng in the saturday was cerymony al For as we find i^ diverse
places of holy wryt. and namely Ezechielis xx.c. Halowyng i^ the saturday was a
special token youen to ye iewys whereby they should be known from other people
/ and so was circumcision. and many other obseruau^cis and cerymonyes god yaue
them to be known from other people And therefore right as the circumcision and
other obseruaunces / yt were bitaken them of god for toke^ of distinction from
other people ceasyd in cristes passion / so cesyd halowynge in the saturday in
Crystes passion For why. although it be a moral p^cepte to halowe the vii. day
/ yet it is not moralle ne byndeth us to halowe the vii day in the saturday And
therefore we read Exodi. xxxiiii. and xxxv ca. That wha^ne moses had been in
the mount of synay with god forty days and xl nights withouten mete or
drink / and spoken with god and there taken the law of him in two tables of
stone / two stemys and bemes of light risen out of his face / as it had be two
horns so glysnyng and so bright / that the people was a dred of him and durst
natt speak with him / and therefore he put a veyl before his face wha^ne he
should speak to the people / and tell them the laws and the will of god And
wha^ne he had so hid his face with the veyl / the first law that he yaue them
in gods name was to halowe the saturday And he spoke no word than of the
other ix. precepts / but told forth other obseruaunces and cerymonyes which
longed only to the iewys / and were but figure. and shadow of things to come.
Which cesyd all in cristes passion And so he showed well that halowyng in
the saturday was cerimonyal / and should cease with other cerymonies in cristes
passion And therefore when he bad them halowe the saturday / he put the veyle
before his face in toke^ ye halowyng on the saturdaye. and other cerimonyes and
laws yat he yaue them that time were but a veyle hilynge gostly understanding
/ under figures of things that were to come. And when tho things were
fulfilled by the passion of Christ / ye veyle and mystihede of figures should
be done away and cese. And in token thereof in time of cristes passion. the
veyle of the iewys temple to rent and cleef in ii. parties that men might se
all the priuey things that were in the temple / which were before hyd fro the
sight of the people by that veyle Also the same text of the commandment
shewyth well / that halowynge in the saturday should be translatyd into the
sunday / that is clepyd the day of the son. For all though god cesyd in the
saturday from making of things of new kind / yet in the saturday he made
the saturday as he made each day before in the same day But in the sonnedaye
next following he made no new day in kind / for that was the first day / and
so he restyd more in the sunday from worchynge. thanne he did in the saturdaye.
Also after great trauayl owith to be more rest. But criste gods son had
more travail in recreacion and rede^pcion of mankind thanne he had to make
all this world For in making of all the world he had no travail / as
saint austyn says. but only he bad it should be done. and it was done anon what
he would But in recreation and rede^pcion of mankind he traueyled so that he
swat blood for anguisshe / and dyed for travail and shed his heart blood / and
cesyd not of trauayl till in the morrow tide of the son day when he rose
from death to life to comfort all mankind yt would leave in him And he shewid
openly than that he was and is lord of al thing. And said to his apostles. yt
all power in heuene and earth was youen to him in his manhood. And therefore
the su^day is clepyd the lords day. Dies dominicus. And therefore sithen god
would yt the saturday should be hallowed in the old law / for god ceasyd
thanne from creacion / and so in manner began to rest / much more he wole that
the sonneday be halowyde in the new law / for god cesyd than from ye great
traueyl of our redemption and our salvation and recreacion.

The iiii chapter
FIgure of this we have also in holy wrytt. Leuitici xxiiio. where we find
that god badde the children of israel keep principally vii feestes in the yer^
of the which the last was clepyd. Festum tabernaculorum. The feast of
tabernacles He bad them take bows and branches of palm trees and of other
trees the feyrest that they might find and make hem tabernacles and logges and
duelle therein vii. days to gidder / i^ mind that god made them to duelle i^
tabernacles and logges xl. year in desert and there he sauyd them and kept
them and he had yt the first day and the viii should be full holy. By this
feast of tabernacles yt came last after ye other festes of the jews ben
understand the festes of ye new law / which came last in the end of the
world. after the old law. For all the festes of the new law been festes
of tabernacles For wha^ne god came to be man / he made first his tabernacle in
the maid mary which tabernacle was arrayed. and dight with the fairest
branches and bows of grace and virtues and of good thewys. that might be
found in any creature / for she passyd al creatures in grace and godenesse. Of
this tabernacle spekith the prophet. p^o. xviii. In sole posuit tabernaculu^
suu^ et ipse tanquam sponsus procedens de thalamo suo. He made his tabernacle
in the son / that was our lady maiden and mother brighter tha^ne the son. He
came out of her as an husbonde out of his chamber Another tabernacle god made
him in our ma^hode and in our kind / that was the blisful body. Which he
took of the maiden mary For as the tabernacles were made of the fairest
branches and bows thatt might be found / so the body of christ was made and
gadryd to gydder of the clenest drops of blood that were in our lady.
saint mary clean maiden withouten spotte of sin In this tabernacle god was
boorne of the maiden on Cristmasse day. In this tabernacle he was circumcided /
worshipped of three kings. and duellyd with us i^ earth i^ our pilgramage xxxii.
year and more.

In this tabernacle he died for mankind / and rose from death to life on Ester
day / and styed up i^ to heuyn on holy thursday. very god and very man / and
there sytteth on his faders right hand above all heuenes in this tabernacle
lord and king of al thing. In this tabernacle he shall come again at the dome /
to deem the qicke and the deed And all the feestes that we hold of any
seynte. We halowe them and hold hem for the good dedys that they did while
they duellyd here in the tabernacle of their body / i^ hope to come to endeles
tabernacles full of joy and bliss withoute^ end Of which tabernacle god
spekith in the gospel wha^ne he byddeth the rich me^ make pore me^ their
friends / that they may resceyue them into endless tabernacles / of which
spekith David. Qm^ dilecta tabernacla^ tua dn^e virtutu^: co^cupiscit et
deficit ai^a mea in atria dn^i. Lord of virtues how lovely and how lyki^g been
thy tabernacles / My soul says he desires and longith. to enter into the
halles of our lord And for his desire is delayed / he fails and feynteth for
sorrow. And so the sole^nyte yt euir shall last. shall be a sole^nyte of
tabernacles / wha^ne we shall duelle in endless tabernacles. With endelesse
rest joy and bliss. There the first day and the eight day shall be full holy
/ which day is ye sonneday For that the first day and it is the viii. day and
shall be ye last day euir lasting in joy and blisse^ And therefore in the
feestes of the new law that been festes of the tabernacles is the sunday
principaly hallowed / as god bad tha^ne For it was the first day and it is the
viii. day / and shall be the last day euir lasting i^ joy and bliss.

The v. chapter
Dives. Why bad god that we should think to halowe well the holiday and the
sabot.


Pauper. There is three manner of sabottes / that is to say. of rest or of
halowynge. Scilicet. pectoris temporis et eternitatis That is to say of rest
of heart / of time / and of endelesse resting. By rest of heart and of thought.
men come to rest of time. And by rest of thought and of time. men come to
endless rest. So withouten rest. of heart and of thought / may no man come
to endelesse rest that the sabot and the holiday betokneth And therefore god
bad us that we should principaly travail to have sabot and rest of heart and
of thout withoute^ which rest and sabot we may not well halowe any holyday And
therefore Christ said in the gospel. yt out of the heart wha^ it is out of rest
/ come wicked thoughts ma^slaughters / auoutryes / lechery / theftes / false
witnesses / dispyte of god. Mt xv.c. which sins distroye charity. and peace
/ and been causes of much vnreste in this world / and let rest of time / so
that uneaths. may any time be rest And therefore god says. think that thou
halowe well thine holiday. Be think the if thou be in charity and rest of
heart with god and man And if thou be stired against thyn even christian by wrath
hate or envy. or have any heavy heart against thy brother / go as god bids i^
the gospel and be first reconseyled to thy brother / and than come and make
thyn offryng of holy prayer of thanking of prisyng / and of thy gifts to god
And butt thou do so and put away all rancour and heavy heart / else thy
halowynge and thy sabot is not plesaunte to god Also bithenke the if thou be i^
dedly sin / and repent the and be shreuen as soon as thou might in good
manner / and so offer up thy self to god by charity / and by sorrow of heart and
make thy self holy / and tha^ne art thou able to halowe well the holiday For
as long as thou art i^ dedly sin by will or by deed. so long thou halowest
not thy haliday For thou doste seruyle work of sin / and doist dispyte to
the haliday. Which is ordained that men should tha^ne amend them / and serve
god more specially thanne in the woke day. And as long as man or woman is in
dedly sin / he serves the devil and not god to plesaunce Also god bids
that me^ should bethynke them to halowe well the haliday For in the halidaye
namely on the su^day men should draw their wits to giddre from the world and
bethynke them if they had ought trespassed / that woke by recheleshede or
by couetise / or by lechery / or any other wise / and axe god foryeuenesse.
Also think on the speed and benefices that god has sent them that woke. or
euyr before / and thank him thereof. Thank him of his endeles mercy / and his
endelesse charity that he showed to mankind Thynk hou he made man to his own
liknesse to be air and citezen of heuene. Think how he made all thing for
man. Think what bliss he has ordained to man and woman if they do well. What
pain if they do evil.


The vi. chaptre.
Therefore says Origenes. super Leuiticum xxviii.c. On the sunday thou should
do no worldly things / but oonly give the to god and gostly things. Thanne
says he come to church / ley thine ere to gods word / think heuynly
things think on the life that we hopen all to have in endless bliss. Think
on the last dome hou hard it shall be and how strait Take thanne none head to
this world ne to things visible. But on the haliday have thy go stely iye
principally to things. that been to come / and yet ben invisible. He that thus
does says he. halowith well his halidaye. and he makes ye sacrifice of ye
sabott And therefore the law says thus. We have ordained yt all sundaies be
kept with all manner worship from even to even / and that me^ absteyne hem from
al manner unlawful works. that there be no markette holden on the sonneday / ne
plee / ne no man dampened to death / ne to pain. ne oath taken solemnly / but
it be for peace or for some great need. Extra li.ii. ti. de feriis. Omnes dies
dominicos. The law says that men should naught do on sunday / but give them
to god / ne do no seruyle work. But that day should be occupied in prisynge
and worshipynge of god and in goostly songs. De con. di. iii. Ieiunia Me^
should on the haliday serve god with heart mouth and werk. With heart. thinking
as I have said / with mouth well speaking in prayer prisynge and worshipynge
of god / and good i^formacion of their even christian. In work also of deeds of
alms. i^ peace making and according of neighbors and such other. But
now alas is fulfilled that Ieremye said. Trenorum.io.c. Viderunt eam hosts
et derisetr^ sabbata eius. The enemies the feendes see mannys soul and
woma^nes how it was defouled with sin on the haliday / and scornyd his
halidaies and his sabotes For ye haliday was ordained in confusion of the
feende and i^ worship of god / and for salvation of man's soul / but now it
is turned to she^ship of ma^nys soul to dispite and offense of god. and i^
plesaunce of the fend. For in the sunday reigns more lecherye. gloteny /
manslaughter / robbery / bacbityng / perjury / and other sins / more than
regnyd all the weke before And when men come to church / they leeue bedys
bidding / and spend their time in synfulianglynge. For there they cast gyle
against their even christian There they hold their pervys of many wrongs.
Which they think to do. And therefore god may say to them yt he said to the
iewys. It is written said he ye mine house shall be clepyd an house of prayer / and
ye have made it a de^ne of thieves / i^ ye that ye co^tryue her gyle and
falshede / to rob your even christian of his good of his right and of his fame.
And therefore he says by the prophet. Isaie i.c. My soul hatith your
sole^pnities and halidayes. They ben full heavy to me / I have traueil to suffer
them But therefore says he / when ye shall lift up your ho^des to me I shall
turn mine iyen away from you. And when ye multiply your prayer to me I shall
not here you / for your hondes be fulle of blood yt ye have shed and fulle
of syn. And your cu^panyes and your gadrynges to gydder been fulle wicked.
Iniqui sunt cetus vti.

The vii. chapter.
ALso leave friend god bade that men should thynk to halowe well the holyday For
man and woman should so bethink them before i^ the woke day and so ordeyne their
occupacions / yt they should not need to break the holiday. For if a man nedith
to break the holiday / and that need come of his own folly and of his
misgouernau^ce before / he is not excused by that need. Much less thanne is
he excused if that need come of purpose and of couetise. And therefore they yt
wole not go ne send to market in the woke day to bye their necessaries / but
abide till on the sunday. for sparyng of time / they be not excused though tho
things ben nedeful to them Men should study and dispose hem as besily to
serve god on the sunday. as they study before to traueyl for them self on the
woke day For god has granted vi. days to man and woman for to traueyle for
them self / and the seuynth day. he has reseruyd to his service We read in
holy wryt Numeri. xv.c. That a man went in the sabot day and gaderyd styckes
He was taken and led to moises / and he putt him in prison til he had an
answer of god what he should do with him. God had moses yt he should be
led out of gods castelles yt were clepid the duellinges and te^tys of
gods folk / and there all the people should stone him to the death And so he
was slain spitefully / for he bithought him natt before to halow the haliday /
for he might have gadryd styckes in the day before And sithe^ he was so
spytfully slain for gadering of styckes to make therewith his fire yt was
nedeful to him Much more should they be punisshed that on the su^day gadre to
gidre bro^des of sins of couetyse. of lechery perjury. and bacbitynge / to
brenne with their souls in hell withouten end but they amend them.

Dives. What clepith god seruyle works.


Pauper. Every dedly sin is seruyle work. For as Criste says in the gospel
who so does sin he is servant of sin and thral to the feende Qui facit
peccatum seruus e^ pct^ And such servile work god forbedith every day / but
most on the haliday For who so does dedly sin on the haliday he does
double sin. For he does yt syn and thereto he brekith ye haliday against gods
precepte Also seruyle work is clepyd every bodily werk don pri^cipali for
te^porel lucre and worldly winning / as biynge and selling. erynge sowynge /
mowynge / repynge / and al crastes of worldely wynnyng Also pledynge / motynge
/ markettes fayres sytting of justices and of iuges / shedi^ge of blood and
execution of punisshynge by the law / and all the works that should let man
from gods service / and dispose him to couetise or to the feendes service.
Natheles if erynge and sowynge repyng mowynge cartyng and such other nedeful
works be done purely for alms / and only for heuynly mede / and for need of
them that they been to. in light holidayes they been tha^ no seruyle works /
ne the holyday thereby is not broken Nathelesse in the sonnedaies and great
festes such works should natt be done but full great need compelle men thereto


The x. chaptre.
Dives. Why bad god that both man and beeste should rest and halowe on the
holiday


Pauper. For as salomo^ says. Sap^. vi. and xi.c. God loves al thing that he
made / and has cure of all things that he made. And therefore he ordained
rest i^ ye holidaies not only for his own worship and for gostly help of
soul / but also for bodily help both of man and best But the couetise of man
were refreyned. by rest on the holiday he should neuir rest / But with
trauail sle him self / his seruau^tis his subgettes / and his bestes And
therefore both to save man and be and for great profit of man / god bad
rest on the holiday For both man and best nedith rest after travail / and
shall be the more freysshe all the woke after to travail if they have rest on
the holyday And therefore it fallith often that they which wole not rest on the
sundaye / been made to rest al ye woke after / either for seknes that they fall
in by ouir trauayl. or by sekenes / or by feebleness of their servants / and of
their beestes / or else by death. For often they sle their bestes by ouir much
travail / and contynuynge of trauayl And therefore in the beginning of the
world wha^ne Adam sinned in the sixte day. by etynge of appyl against gods
forbode. And that god had dampnyd him and al his to perpetuel trauayl for his
syn

After this of his great and endelesse mercy he tempryd and slakyd his hard
dome / and ordained rest both to man and best in the seuynth day And therefore
says holy wrytt Gen^ ii.c. That god fulfillyde his works in the vii day /
not only for he maade than the vii day and cesyd of creacion / but also
principally for he showed thanne first mercy against sin granting and
bidding rest in the vii. day both to man and to best which he dampened in the
day before to perpetuel traueil for adams sin / which mercy was fulfyllyng
and perfection of al his works Quia miserato^es eius super oi^a opera eius.
For as dauyd says gods mercyes be^ above al his works. And saint James
says. Mercy enhau^sith rightful dome And but god had endyd his works in mercy
in ye vii. day / and slakyde his hard dome ayenste mankind for Adams syn /
else his works had not been complete ne parfyte / in asmoche as the principal
creature for whom he made al thing was lost. For wha^ne the fynall cause of
any work fails / that werk is not complete ne parfite. For this mercy that
god showed to man wha^ne be ordained rest in the vii^ day that was clepyde
sabott. figure of endless rest of mankind Crist says in the gospel. that
the sabot was made for man / not man for the sabbotte. Mar. ii.c. But synful
man is so blent with couetise / yt he turns his dampnation and his pain.
into likynge / and has leuyr to travail to his undoing. and unto his
dampnacion / than to rest to his salvation And has leuir to follow the hard
sentence of god to his punysshyng / tha^ne to take his grace and his mercy. to
be esyd Such ben like oules and backs / which hate the day and love the
night / like to the feendes of hell that neuir have rest ne for malice wole
seek rest.


The ix. chapter.
MOreouir leeue friend we find iiii. manner of sabottes in holy writ One
sabot of days that was the vii / day ordained of god for rest and ease.
both of man and of be Alsoo we find a sabott of months. ordained also of
god for rest both of man and be that was ye vii. month that man and be
should rest them thanne. after the great trauayl that they had in the ii.
momethes before. i^ which was their heruyste to gadre corn / wine and oil
and other fruit The seuynth month was Septembre. for thanne in that hot
cuntre heruyst was al done Also we find a sabott of years. that was the
seuynthe year For that year the land restyd that it might bear the better and
the more ple^tuously after / for that year was no land sown Also we find a
sabott of sabottes / that was the fyfte year ordeynede of god for rest of the
land / of be of man / and namely of them yt were in travail of
tribulacion. For thanne outlawed men might come again home in surety. Thanne
bond men were made free and dettes foryouen Than men resceyued again their
heritage By the sabott of days / is understand rest from vices in the life
actyf / that has six days to worche By the sabbot of months is understand
rest. ye men have in the life conte^platyf / both from vices and te^ptaciones
For that month was much holy / but not all holy. Right so they that have
the life co^templatyf they have more rest from vices and temptacions / than
they that have the life actyf / but fulle rest have they not in this world By
the sabot of years wha^ne the land restyd the seuynth year. is understand the
rest. that our souls shall have in bliss / whiles the earth of our bodies
shall rest in the grave By the sabotte of sabottes that was the fiftithe year
is understand the rest withouten end / that we shall have in heuyn / when
we shall we^de again both body and soul / to our heritage yt we lost through
Adams sin / when al our travail and tribulacion shall cese and all our
woo turn to well by virtue of cristes passion

The x. chaptre.
Dives. Sithen the sabott of days was most sole^pne i^ the old law / for it
was not leful to go that day ouir a thousand paas / ne to dight their mete /
and more ouir that day were offryde two lambren passing ye common sacrifice that
was done every day / sithen thanne the solempnyte of the sabbotes is
tra^slatyd in the new law* into the sonneday / why is not the sonneday as
worshipfulle in the new law. as was the sabotte in the old law. For as that
was clepyd the sabott of our lord / so the sonneday is clepyd the day of
our lord passing other days. And yitt we have in ye year many days more
solemn thanne the sunday.


Pauper. All the feestys of the new law ben the days and the sabotes of
our lord For all tho been of him self in him self / or else of him self in
his seintes In the old law was no feeste of our lord but only the sabot /
which was hallowed i^ mind of the creacion of the world / and i^ mind that
god the seuynth day cesed of creacion. And also than to thank him for his
endelesse godenesse yt he showed to mankind i^ his creacion / when he made al
bodily and visible creatures to serve man / and man to serve him here in grace
and after in bliss withoute^ end Other festis of the old law were but
sole^pnitees / and minds of auentures and prosperites. that fell to the iewys
in time of the old law And therefore the sabot among them was most sole^pne.
And among us also the su^day is most solemn and holy for the great dedys
and wou^ders that god did in the sunday But for asmoche as it commyth often we
make it not always like solemn For it fallith the su^dayes in which god
showed his wonders / as Ester day and wytsonday / to be more solemn: than
other common sundays Other festes also as Cristmasse day / and epiphanye day /
in asmoche as they been our lords days and come but ones in the year
Therefore we make more solennytee. in tho days / than we do commonly on the
sunday And so we do i^ many other festes / for all they be festes and days of
our lord Nathelesse there is no day so solemn in the self as the sundaye For
that is always solemn / for the wounders that god did therein. Other days ben
sumtyme sole^pne / and sumtyme natt solemn. after that the festes fall therein
by chaungyng of the year So that other days have no solempnite of hem self by
custom ne by law / but only by falling of festes as the year chaungith The
thursday was sumtyme as holy as sunday / for criste that day styed up to the
heuyn. And thanne biga^ne the procession that we use on the sunday For thanne
Crist went in procession with his disciples out of Jerusalem into the mount
of Olyuete / and there styed up in sight of them all. And the cross that is
borne before us in processione / betokens ye Christ dyed on the cross.

And after roose from death to life. And on the holy thursday went before his
disciples ledyng

them vnto^ the mount of oliuete But for asmoche as many new festes comen on
/ and it was greuouse to keep two days solemn every woke / therefore the
solennyte of thursdayes ceesed. and the procession in mind of cristes
ascension was translatyd into the su^day.


Dives. Therefore me thinks that the sundaye should be the more solemn.


Pauper. So it is / and so it owith to be most halowyde though holy church
do not always than most solennyte For that day is ordained for rest i^ the new
law both to man and to be / as the sabotte was ordained for rest in the old
law.


The xi. chaptre
Dives. Been we bounden by this p^cepte to keep the holidayes that holy church
has ordained in the new law.


Pauper. yhe forsothe For all though the p^cepte passyde in y^. that it was
cerimonyal as anentes time / yet it duellith in that it was and is moral / and
byndeth us to fle vices / and serve our god one day more than another / which
day is the sunday i^ the new law by ordenau^ce of god and holy church For as
the gospel says. Mt xii.c. Dn^s e^ eni^ filius hoi^s and sabbati. The maidens
son crist ihesus is lord of the sabot. And for asmoche as it was so evil
kept in the old law / and so much blood was shed i^ the sabot and christ
him self suffryd so much despyte on the sabote Therefore he was myspayed and
said by the prophets Isaie.i.c. and osee ii.c. That he should no longer
suffer their sabbottes / but as a lord of the sabbottes he chaungyd that rest
and solennyte of their sabbottes i^to the sunday / for the skylles which I
said before / which day al if it be the viii. day in the first order of days
/ yet is but ye but the vii. day in obseruau^ce of the p^cepte For we have now
vi days to worche in / i^ token that god i^ vi days made al ye world and the
vii day we halowe as god badde us / in token yt god the vii day cesed of
creation and ordained rest in the su^day As saint poul in his pystle / Ad
colocensis ii.c. says openly that the sabott and other feestes of the old
law were but shadow and figure of the new law And therefore after cristes
passion tho festes cesyd and no man owith to keep them. And who so kepith
them in that he forsakes ye Christ was borne of ye maiden / and dyede for
mankind. And seynte gregoure in his pystle Ad To. says That all that halowe
the saturday / for it was so holy in the old law / ben antecristes disciples
For a^tecrist shall do men halowe both sunday and saturday Sunday / for to
draw christian people to his sect For he shall feign him deed and to arise again
fro death to life on the sunday And the saturday to draw the jews to his
sect. De con. di. iii. Peruenit /


The xii. chapter.
Dives. Why would god make the world more in the nombre of vi. days thanne in
any other nombre of days.


Pauper. For as Solomon says god made al thing in nombre weight and mesure He
made no thing to much ne to little But he made every thing parfytely in his
kind / and endyde al his works in perfytnesse. And for the nombre of vi. is
the first nombre even that is perfyte / therefore he made all the world in
no^bre of vi. days


Dives. Hou is the nombre of vi. more parfyte tha^ne another no^bre.


Pauper. For all his parties yt mete him if they be taken to gidder make even
vi. As one ii.iii^ make even vi. and these three nombres mete hi^. For six
sithes one is vi. and thries two is vi. and twies three is vi. And this
perfection is in no nombre within x. but in vi / And fro ten. to an hundryd is
none butt xxviii And from an hundryd to a thousand is but this even no^bre.
four hundryd lxxx / xvi. The next is viii thousand an hundryd and xviii. And
thanne no mo such butt one within an hundryd thousand And who so wole find
that he must study After an hundryd thousand be^ mo such than all the clerks
under su^ne tan tell / mo thanne any heart may think or tu^ge tell and yet it
is fulle hard to find one. And for that vi. is the first parfite nombre in
this manner. Therefore god would make this world in the nombre of vii^ token
that al his works were parfite And therefore says holy writ Gen^. ii / c. That
heuyn and earth and al their array were parfyte. And for the same skylle god
made man the vi day as for a parfite and a noble creature / For the same skylle
in the vi age of the world bicame man And on the vi day good friday the vi /
our of ye day i^ the vi age / he bought again mankind with his p^cious blood
in token that al his works were parfyte And that same nombre of days god has
grau^tyd us to worche in / in token yt all our works should be parfyte and
good / and no thing do amys / that we should for no couetise do to much / ne
for no sleuth do to little / but always hold us i^ a mean and in euenhede For
god grau^tyd us no time to syn. Therefore he wole always yt we be even with god
and with our eue^ christian / as six is always even with his parties to giddre.


The xiii. chapter.
Dives. Why bad god rest on the seuynth day more than a another day.


Pauper. In toke^ that as seuyn cu^meth next after the parfyte nombre of six
days of worchynge / so after parfite works in this world shall follow
parfyte rest in the other world Also he badde rest in ye vii. day for that
passith the parfyte no^bre in token that he wole no thing be done passinge
perfection And therefore al sin is co^p^hendyd in vii. dedly sins. For as
vii passith the parfite no^bre of vi. so every sin passith perfection and is
out of perfection of all good works Also god badde rest on the vii. day /
for he wole ye men rest them than both gostly and bodily. Gostly from
business and thought of the world Bodily. from bodyly travail. For why vii.
is made of four and thre^ Four betokneth bodily things made of iiii.
elimentes. Three betokneth man's soul made to the likeness of the holy
trinite And therefore he bad rest in the vii. day / yt me^ should than rest
both body and soul. Also god badde rest in the vii day / in token / yt after
perfyte works shall follow endeles rest both of body and of soul For this
no^bre vii. in asmoche as all time and all duracion is co^p^hendyd i^ vii
days. therefore it betokneth endless lastyng And therefore rest on ye vii. day
bitokneth endelesse rest Also friend god ordained rest i^ the vii day rest /
in token of vii. blisses which we shall have for parfite works yt we do here
i^ vi. days and vi. ages of this of yis world For ane^tis the body we shall
have four blisses / brightenesse and beauty withoute^ any spotte For as Criste
says in the gospel / men and wymen shall shine i^ heaven / as bright as the
son Also men shall have there i^passibilite and health of body / withouten al
manner sekenes No thing shall dear them ne disease them. Also they shall have
deliuerhede of body and lightness withouten letting / for they should be as
light as thought / and in tuynklyng of an iye be where they wol Also they
shall have soteltie of body. Withouten any withstondynge / for there shall no
thing withstonde hem But as ye son passith the glass without letti^g of the
son / so shall they pass ouir wall and every thing. at their will withouten
any disease or any lettynge And anentes ye soul we shall have the blisfulle
sight of gods face. brennynge love to god / and to our even christian / and
always have him that we love / and what we desire. There all our love shall
be in joy / withouten woe dread and sorrow In this world every love is medlyd
with woe / in tokene of these vii. blisses that we shall have in endelesse rest
for our parfyte works. Therefore god bad rest in the seuynthe day.


The xiiii. chaptre.
Dives. How long owyth ye haliday to be kept and halowyd.


Pauper. From even to even / As says Reymounde and the law also. Extra li.ii.
ti. de feriis. c. Ome^s dies dn^icos. And holy wrytt also and god himself
Leuitici xxiii. A vespera vsque ad vesperam celebrabitis sabbata vestra. From
even to even ye shall halowe your halidaies Nathelesse su^me begin sonner to
halow after that the feast is / and after use of the cuntre. Extra e. quoniam.
But that men use in saturdaies and vigilies to ryng holy at midday conpellith
not me^ anon to halowe / but warnythe them of the haliday following. that they
should think thereon. and speed them / and so dispose hem and their
occupacions that they might halowe in due time.


Dives. Is it leful for any caas in the sunday to gadre in corn. fruit or hay.


Pauper. Such need it may be that it is excusable as if they may not in other
days gadre it in for enemies / as in time of werre / if they should gadre it
they have rightfulle cause to withstonde their adversaries Also if corn or
grass be field. and should be lorne but it were dight and gaderyd / it is
leful in the halidaies to save it and keep it / so that gods service be not
left therefore But for to mow / or to repe carte or to sow in the su^neday I
hold it not leful but i^ full great need. Principal festes should always be
halowyd / butt right great need compellyd men to worche / so that great need
excused hem For as the law says Extra li.v. De regulis iuris. Need makith
leful that else is unlawful by the law For need has no law De con. di. i.
sicut et di. v. discipulos. Extra de furtis. Si quis per necessitatem Also it
is lefulle to fisshe after he ryng on the sunday and other fisshe also. that
may not be taken but certain ceson of the year / for which fisshe men must go
far on the sea and long abide. Extra de feriis. c. Licet. It is leful al so
to do rightful bateiles on the sunday / and in other halidayes. for salvation
of the co^myntie It is leful tha^ne to save that else should perisshe both
man and best fruit corn and other things always with reverence of god and of
the haliday. It is leful thanne to leches to help the seek folk It is leful to
dyke wall. defense towns castelles / and to array men to battle in the
so^neday when need compellith / and peril of enmyes Thus says Io. in su^.
con. li.i. ti. xii. q^. vii. So that in all these and such other / need and
pite excuses men Christ helyd men in the sabotte. and repreuyd the iewys that
were mispayed therewith / and said to them. Sithen a man takith his circumcision
in the sabotte / why have ye i^dignacion to me for I have made a mn a hole in
the sabott / Io. vii.c. And in an other place he said to the iewys / who is it
of you that has a sheep and it fall in the diche in ye sabot / yt he ne wole
go and lift it up out of the diche But forsothe man is better tha^ne a sheep
/ and therefore said he / it is leful to do good deeds i^ the sabot and i^ the
haliday. Mt xii.c. Another time christ helyd a woman of an hard sickness that
had holde^ her xviii. year / she went stoupyng al down. and might not look
upward Thanne the master of the law and of the synagoge was wroth and said
to the people There ben vi. days to worche in / come ye thanne and be ye helyd /
and not in the sabott. Criste aunsweryd to him Ipocrite / each of you vntithe
his ox and his ass from ye maunger or crache in the sabott and ledith it to
the water. Much more it is nedefulle to unbind this daughter of Abraham i^
the sabott from the hard bound in the which sathanas had holden her
bounden xviii. year And al tho ypocrites were ashamyd By these examples Christ
showed that dedys of pitee and of alms / and namely p^chinge and techynge /
by which man's soul is losed out of the feendes bonds. been medeful and
nedeful in the haliday. And he excused dauyd by need. that he ete of the holy
looues yt no lewyd man should have eten of by the law. Also he excused his
disciples yat they g^yddyd the eerys i^ the feld in the sabotte / and ete the
corn. Mt xii.c. For as he says there. god loves better mercy and pytee /
thanne any sacrifice.


The xv. chaptre.
NAthelesse. natt withstondynge all / this every man and woman should besily
halowe the halidaye / and not lightly for no small need break the haliday. For
god chargyd this co^maundment full highly / when he said Think that thou
halowe well the haliday And in a another place. Deu. v.c He says look yt you
halowe well the halidaye And i^ an other place of holy writ he says Look ye
keep well my sabott and my day / for that is toke^ bitwene me and you / who so
defouleth that day or does any seruyle werk in that day / he shall dye. Exo.
xxi. Leuitici. xvi. et xix. Ite^ ieremye xvii. Ezechielis xx. and xxii. and
xxiii.c. By ye law bochers / tauerners / and other vitailers may lefully dight
i^ the sunday vitayles to be sold i^ the moneday / if they might not dight
them i^ the day before. to save them and their vitailes / so yt it be done
principally to gods worship / and for the common profytte Also merchants yt
leden their marchaundise in the su^day and other halidayes to feires in far
cu^tre by land or by water ben excused if they may not led them in other
days. Also messangers / pilgrymes / and wayfering men / that may not well rest
wtouten great harm ben excused. so that they do their deuer to her^ mass and
matyns if they may For long abidinge i^ a man's journey is costful and
perilouse Also they that let to hire horse and carte / or ship to pilgrymes.
and to passinge folk in the sunday. to speed them in their iournaye. if they
do it principaly for ease and speed of them that so hyretheim. they ben excused
But if they do it principaly for lucre or for couetise / they be not excused
Also if men for hastiness do them shave or do their horse sho in the su^day
when they may not well abide / ne might not well do it before / they ben
excused / if need compelle them thereto / and not couetise ne sleuth. Mylwardes
craste by wind and water is leful in the sunday / after custom in the cuntre
/ for so it may be do with little traueyle. But for to do it with draught of
be in the su^day / it is not leful. for it may not be done so without great
traueyl Thus says Io. in su^. con. li. i. ti. xii. De feriis et tabula iuris.

The xvi. chapter.
Dives. Is it not leful me^ to begi^ne great iourneys in the su^nedaie / of
long pilgrymage or of fer passing


Pauper. If they do it of custom or withoute^ need / they sin grievously al
though they here their service er they wend / and namely men of holy church.
that should in halidayes most occupy hem i^ gods service / and devotion and
techynge of gods law / and give the people good example to halowe well the
haliday. Prechoures that travail from town to town in the sunday and great
festes to teache the people gods law ben excused and win much mede But be
they ware that under color of prechyng they re^ne not to much about in vein
in the sunday.


Dives. Is it leful in great halidayes to travail about making of holy
church as in carriage liftynge of stones. gadyng of stones and such other.


Pauper. As for a brayde it is leful / but not to do no long traueyl ne ouir
great yt should bring men to werynesse to let them fro gods service For the
haliday rep^sentith endless rest and halowynge withouten end. And therefore I
hold it unlawful to make great cariages in the sunday. or any principalle feste.
for any church making.


Dives. Is it not leful to help men of holy church in the great halidaies to
housynge in carriage and other travail.


Pauper. If they be pore. it is leful as for abrayde to help them in housynge
But if they be rich enough to pay therefore. in the work day / it is natt
leful to travail for them in sundaye and other great festes.


Dives. Is it lefulle to vitaylers and other chapme^ to ride or go fro town to
town in the sunday for to sell vitayles or other things in the church or in
the church yerde or at the church yate.


Pauper. Nay forsothe For there should no such market be holden in ye su^ / day
/ neither in seintuary / ne out of seyntuarie. Extra de feriis. Omnes dies
dominicos. And therefore ben market days ordained i^ other days that men should
than bye and selle / and halowe i^ the sunday But it is leful to vytailers to
sell vytailes i^ their own place / so that they do it principaly for alms of
their even christian / and here their service. Auyse hem that than bye.


Dives. Is it leful to worche in the sunday when euensonge is said and when
me^ have herd gods service.


Pauper. Not but the greter need compelle them to worche as I said first For
else men bounde^ to halowe from even to even. And therefore wha^ euensonge is
done by mydouyr / none in the sunday / yet it is not leful to worche And though
the euensonge be said in the saturday by mydouirnone / yet it is leful to
worche till the son goo down Nathelesse so little the work may be yt it is no
sin to do it thanne.


Dives. How should men know how much work is leful to do in the haliday /
and what need excuses man of traueylynge in the sunday / and in other great
festes / for couetise and wanbileue yt men trust not to god / but wene that
god should fail them / put folk in dread of need / when there should else. be
no dread of such need.


Pauper. Therefore if they might redily have their busshop / they should axe
him cou^seyl / or else their curate / or some other good wise man And if the
need be great and open / their own conscience owith excuse them For they may
thanne worche by authority of the law. And if a man or woman axe counseyl in
things of doubt of him that he wenythe skylfully should give good cou^seyl /
though the cou^seylour fail in his counseyl yeuynge / yet the axer is excused /
but he know yt the cou^seyl is not good. or else did not his deuer to know
that And for he lowith hi^ to axe cou^seyl and forsakith his own wit and his
own will he gettith much mede.


The xvii. chaptre.
Dives. When servants traueyl in the sunday by compellyng of their
soueraynes / ben they excused before god by their masters bidding.


Pauper. If they trauayl and do their masters biddynge principaly for dread
and for obedience. that they owe to their souerayn. and not for couetise ne for
none other evil cause / and the manner of traueyl be leful in the self / than
they been excused For as holy wryt says God loves more obedience than
sacrifice. But ware the sovereign that co^pellith his servant / in the sunday
or any great feeste withoute^ great need. For to the souereynes is halowyng of
haliday principaly bode^ For withoute^ their will her servant ne their best.
shall do como^ly no seruyle work


Dives. Steracles pleyes and daunces. that are used in great festes. and in
sundays / are they not lefull.


Pauper. Miracles pleyes and dau^ces that been done principaly for devotion
honestye and myrthe. to teache men to love god the more. and for no ribaudrye /
ne medlyd with rebawdrye ne lesynges. been leful / so that the people be not
lettyd thereby from gods service / ne fro gods word heri^g and that there be
no error meddled in such miracles and pleyes against the feith of holy
church. ne against good living. All other ben forfe^dyd both haliday and
werkday. De con. di.iii. Irreligiosa Et extra li.iii. ti. i. cu^ decore^. Where
the gloss says that for to rep^sente in pleyng at Cristmasse Heroude and ye
three kings. and other process of ye gospel both tha^ne and at ester. and in
other times also / it is leful. and co^me^dable.


Dives. Than it semyth by thy speech yt in halidayes men may lefully maken
myrthe.


Pauper. God forbede else For as I said the haliday is ordained for rest and
releui^g both of body and of soul And therefore i^ law of kind / i^ law
written / in law of grace / and euyr from the beginning of the world. the
haliday has been solaciouse with onestie / both for soul and body / and for
worship of god whose day is that day / solaciouse in clothinge in mete and
drink / in occupacion / honesty with myrthe making And therefore the prophet
says. Hec dies quem fecit dn^s: exultemus et letemur in ea This is the day yt
god made / make we now merry and be we glade.


Dives. Contra. Saint austyn says yt it were less wicked to go at the plough
and at the carte / and card and spynne in the sundaye than to lead daunces.


Pauper. Saint austyn spekith of such dau^ces and pleyes as was used in his
time / when christian people was much medlyd with hethe^ people / and by old
custom and example of hethen people used dishonest daunces and pleyes that by
old time were ordained. to stire folk to lechery and to other sins And so if
daunsyng and pleynge now on the halidayes stire men and wyme^ to pride to
lechery glutonye and sleuthe / to ouir long waking on nights. and to
ydelship on the werk days. and other sins / as it is right likly yt they do
in our days than ben they unlawful both on the haliday and on the work day And
against al such spoke saint Austyn But against honest dau^ces. and pleyes done
i^ due time and in good manner i^ the haliday. spoke not seint austyn.


Dives. Co^trate. We find in holy wryt yt god badde his people turmente their
souls and give them to sorrow and mourning in the halidaye. Dies expiationu^
erit celeberimus et vocabitur sctu^s. affligetisque ai^as vra^s in eo Oi^s ai^a
que afflicta no^ fuerit die hoc ^peribit de ppli^s suis. Leuitici. xxiii.
Thanne is semyth that god wole ye men give hem rather to mournyng in the
haliday tha^ to mirth or to welfare.


Pauper. Salomo^ says. Spes que differtur affligit ai^am. Prouer. xiii.c The
hope the desire and the longing yt is delayed turmentithe the soul. For the
more that man or woman longith after a thing the more it is disease / till he
has his disese and his longyng. But now it so that the rest the mirth the ese
and the welfare / that god has ordained in the halidayes. is toke^ of endless
rest joy and myrthe and welfare in heuenes bliss that we hope to have
withoute^ end. For there men shall halowe withouten end / from al manner
travail thought and care. And therefore as I said first god wole that we
think on the haliday of the rest joy and bliss yt the haliday bitokneth.
and have it in thought / in desire in lo^ging and hope to come thereto And so
turment our souls by longing and by sorowynge By longing after the
endelesse rest And by sorowynge ye for sin our desire is so long delayed
In this manner god wole that every man and woman turmente his soul in haliday /
by love longing to god ward / and by sorowynge for gods offense Not to
show great heaviness outward / and to do bodily penance in any great
haliday Moreouir leave friend god badde not that the iewys should turment their
souls in every haliday / but only in one solemnite that was clepyd the fest of
clensynge and of foryeuenesse For that day god foryaue the iewys the great
sin that they did when they made them a calf of gold. and silver / and
worshipped ye calf as god / and clepyd it their god not withstondynge all the
wou^ders that god had shewid hem a litel before / ledyng hem through the read
see dry foot / and dre^chyd king pharo and al his oste and spoke to them
openly by voice of aungelles from above the mount of synay in thundre and
lightnynge in fire and smooke. and clouds / full grymme i^ voices of trumpe and
of clarion full dredeful to here And for asmoch as that grievous sin was first
foryouen them in that day / and they were first that day maade clean from that
great sin / therefore god bad them halowe that day for joy of foryifnes. He
bad them also that day turme^t their souls for sorrow of ye greuouse sin /
and for their unkindness that they should have mind of their sins and be
ashamed thereof And also have in mind gods godenesse against their
shrewydnesse / and thank him thereof. This day was the tenthe day of
Septembre.


The xviii. chaptre.
Dives. Where fyndst thou that god badde men make merry and farewele in the
halidaye


Pauper. In the same place of holy writ. Leuitici. xxiii. Where we find that
god bad ye children of israel take branches and bows of palm trees and of ye
fairest trees ye they might find. and make them tabernacles / and duelle
therein seuyn days to gidder every year onys / and there make merry before
their lord god. in the mind yt god made them to duelle in tabernacles i^
deserte xl. year and there sauyd them and kept them fro woe And Esdras the
prophet said to gods people This day is halowyd to our lord god. Weep ye
not ne mourn ye not / ete ye good metes and fatt / and drink ye good drynkes
/ and ye that may. send ye part to them that may natt / ne have no power
whereof to dighte them mete or drink. Be ye not sorry for it is gods holy day
Gaudiu^ eteni^ dn^i est fortitudo vestra. The joy of our lord is your
strengith / that is to say. God is glade that ye be strong glade and merry.
Neemye viii.c. And therefore is fasting forfendyd in the sunday. Di. xxx. Si
quis tanqm^ etc. si quis prisbiter. Where fasting is forfendyd in the sunday
And also there should no fasting be used much from Ester to pe^tecoste yt is
wytsontide / for joy of cristes resurrection and of our salvation. Di. lxxvi.
Ieiunia. Et de co^. di. i. Ieiunium.


Dives. Where fyndest thou in holy wrytt ye dau^ces and songs ben leful and
plesaunte to god.


Pauper. We find Exodi xv. That when the children of israel were passyd the
read see dry foot / so yt the water stood in either side of them right up as
a wall and god had drenchyd king pharo and al his oste / than moses made a
merry song and prysynge to god / which song begins thus in latyne.
Cantemus dn^o gloriose: eni^ magnificatus est. Tha^ne mary the suster of aaron
took her timber in her hand / and al wymen ye might took her tymbers i^ her
hondes. and went daunsynge and syngyng the same song prisynge and worshipynge
our lord god. We find also in the secounde book of kings in the vi /
chaptre that wha^ne dauyd should fetch gods hutche into ierlm^. Dauyd and all the people of israel went there with and pleyed in all manner mynstralcye / song
and dau^cyd and skypped for joy. and so prysed and worshipped god But michol
saules daughter and Dauydes wife scornyd dauyd for his dau^synge and for his
skyppynge / and said. that it was not semely to a king so skippe and dau^ce as
a knave. before the people and before her maidens. Dauyd said to her. I shall
pley and dau^ce before my lord god ye has chosen me to be a king. and put
thy fader and al thy kyn from ye crown I shall pley before my lord god / and
put me in lower degree for his love / and below and meke in mine own sight to
plese god yt made me king And for yt mychol scornyd so dauyd for his skippynge
and his dau^synge and his lowness / therefore god made her bareyne / yt she had
neuir child as says the book there. Also god gladyd his people yt was in
care and much tribulacion / and said. yitt shall mayde^s make merry in song and
daunsynge / and old folk to gider For I shall turn their care into joy. and
glade them and conforte them of their sorrow. Ieremye xxxi.c.


Dives. It may well be as thou say For myrthe and gladness. conforteth men
in gods service / and heaviness dullith and lettith al manner lykyng


Pauper. Therefore dauyd says. Seruite dn^o in leticia. Serve ye our lord in
myrthe and gladness But two things leave friend must be kept in gods
service. and in good living / sadness and gladness. Sadness in chere and in
doing. Gladness in heart thynkyng. Sadness withoute^ sorynesse of malice / of
wrath hate / and of envy. And gladness withouten folly and ribaudrye.

And therefore leave freende I pray you saddith well / butt baddith not Be
always glad. but neuirmore mad by no folly Always sad / always glade / so yat
your gladenesse and your sadness be always medlyd with likynge and love of god
/ and with devotion.


The xix chapter
Dives. Why been these iii. precepts clepyd the p^ceptes of the first table.


Pauper. For when god yaue moses. the law in the mount of synay he took
him the x commandments written in ii. tables of stoone In the first table
were written ye three first co^maundmentes which teache us how we should worship
our god. and love him above al thing And therefore they ben clepyd the
p^ceptes of the first table / both for worthynes of them self. and for they
were written in the first table. In the secounde table were written other vii.
commandments / that teache us to love our eue^cristen as our self / and ben
clepyd the p^ceptes. of the secounde table And so all the x. p^ceptes ben
co^prehendyd and closed i^ the ii. p^ceptes of charity. The first precepte of
charity is this / yt thou shall love thy lord god with all thyn heart / with
all thy soul. With all thy mind / with al thy might. When he says thou shall
love thy god with all thine heart / he excludes al manner of ydolatrie / that is
for forfe^dyd by the first co^maundme^te. that no man set his heart / ne his
feyth ne his trust in no creatur^ more than in god / ne against gods
worship. For who so loves well another / he has kyndly a trust and a feith
in him And after that he loves. so he trustith And ther^ he trustiy most /
como^ly he loves most. And therefore god badde yt thou should love him with all thine heart / yt is to say with al thy feithe so that thou set al thy feith
and thy trust in him before al other as in him that is almightye and may best
help at need And therefore the first p^cepte of thies iii. is applied
pri^cipaly to ye fader almighty. Also god bids yt thou love him with all thy
soul / that is to say as seint austyn saiy with al thy will. Withoute^
co^tradiction / yt thy will be not contarie to his will / but alwey conformed
to his will. And in that he byddeth yt thou take not his name i^ vein But as
thou haste taken the name of crist / and art clepyd christian / so confourme thy
will. thy life. and thy speech to the will of Criste. yt thou wole no thing ne
do no thing. ne say no thing. ayenste his will by thy will. and thy wyttynge
/ ne make none oath ne vow against his will. and his worship. And tho that thou
haste made to his worship keep them / and hope sikerly yt if thou fulfille
gods will here in earth he shall fulfill thy will in heuyn. And look that thou
spend all thy lif and thy being to his worship and in his love And thanne
love thou him with al thy soul. in which principaly is thy life and thy being
And therefore if thou spend not thy lif and thy being in his love / thou love
him not with all thy soul And thereto thou take his name in vein. for his
name is. Qui est. That is to say / He that is. For all thing yt is takith his
being of him And therefore if thou spend thy life and thy being in sin and
vanity. thou takyst his name of being in vein Also look that thou spend al
thy wit in his love. yt thou study to know the treuy yt is cristes name For
he says Ego sum veritas. And so study to fle falshede and folly by help of
criste gods son yt is al witty And therefore the secou^de commandment is
applied to the secou^de person in trinyte / yt is the son al wytty Also he
bids yt thou love him with all thy mind / withouten foryetynge of his
benefices and of his yiftes to the. and to mankind And in that he byddeth the
keep well the halidaye. Which is ordained principally yt me^ should than
withdraw her thoughts and their mind. from the world / and think thanne on
god and on heuynly things Than think on their own unkindness and of gods
godenesse as I said first And therefore he says Meme^to. Thynk that thou
halowe well the halyday That is to say / love god with al thy thought and with all
thy mind / that thou be in will no thing to think against his plesaunce / and
that thou have lykyng to think of him by grace of the holy ghost / to whom
the thridde commandment is applied / withouten whom as saint poule says. We
may think no good thought The first p^cepte is applied to the fader almighty
yt may best help at need. For mawmettes and ydolatry may not help The
secounde p^cepte. is applied to the son alwytty. Whose name is treuthe and
sovereign wisdom For he knowith al he may not be disseyued And treuthe should
natt be taken in vein / but always worshipyde and wisely mayntened The third
p^cept is applied to the holy ghost which is clepid. paraclitus. yt is to say
comfortoure. For the halidaye is ordeynyde. to comfort both of soul. and of
body / to comfort a man and and best And the holy ghost co^fortith us in
sorrow and care / and he is bote of every bale. He yeueth rest after trauayl /
He is so lace in disease / and he abatith careful thoughts / and yeueth pees
and rest in heart And therefore the prophet says to him Logitacio hominis
confitebitur tibi. et reliquie cogitationis diem festum agent tibi Man's
thought shall be aknowe to ye his myscheuys / and the remenau^tes of his
thoughts shall make a haliday to the in the sunday and other festes. Secundu^
multitudine^ do loru^ meoru^ in cord meo: consolationes tue letificaueru^t
alam meam. Lord says he after ye multitude of sorrows in mine heart / so thy
confortes have gladyd my soul For the holy ghost bids that me^ rest from
their traueyles here in the halidayes. and after in endless bliss.


The xx. chapter.
ALso leave friend / as the gospel says Mar. xii^c. ye shall love god with all
your heart with all your soul / with all your mind / with all your might.
that is to say / as seint Bernarde says / ye must love him. dulciter.
prudenter / fortiter / Swetely. Wisely / mightily / Swetely wiy al your heart
/ with all your. soul / that ye have likyng i^ him passinge al other. Wisely
with all your mind and with all your thought / yt ye study and be besy night
and day to do his plesaunce. and to fle his offense Also ye must love him
mightily and steadfastly yt neither well ne woo deperte you. from his love And
therefore seint poule says yt no tribulacion hunger ne thruste / hete ne cold
/ life ne death / ne no creature should depart us from the charity in crist if
we louyd him as we should love / ye shall love your god with all your heart / so
that ye love no thing but for him and in him. ye shall love him with all your
soul so yt ye spend al your will. and all your affection in his love. ye
shall love him with all your mind / so that ye spe^de al your thoughts in his
love. ye shall love him with all your might. so that ye spend al your
mightes in his love / so that ye assente to no thing / ne think no thing ne do
no thing / against his plesaunce / ne yt should let his love. ne depart you
from his love The first co^maundme^t techith us to love him mightily The ii.
techith us to love him wisely. The third techith us to love him swetely in ease
and rest of heart By the first co^maundment god techith us feith and right
bileue By the secou^de he techith us hope For as he says by the prophet Qm^
in me sperauit liberabo eu^: protegam eum qm^ cognouit no men meu^. For he
hopyd in me I shall deliver him. and I shall defend him for he has known my
name. Beatus vir cuius e^ nome^ dn^i spes eius: et non respex it in vanitates.
et insanias falsas. p^o. xxxix. Blessed be that man whose hope is in the name
of our lord / and has taken head to no vanities ne to no false witnesses to
forswere him / and to take gods name in vein. For as saint poule says /
there is no name in which we may be sauyd / but gods name sweet Jesus And
therefore they that have gods name i^ worship / may have siker hope to be
sauyd And tho yt have it in dispite owe to be in great dread. By the thridde
commandment. god techith us charity For charity and good love is rest in
every woe and trauayl For love makith traueyl light and easy / that should else
be full diseasy. By the first precepte of charity we be bounden to show love
to god in heart / in word / in work And therefore god bids that we should
love him with all our heart / with all our soul and mind / yt is to say with al
our speech For speech outward is toke^ of thoughts i^warde Also he bids us
love him with all our mightes / that is to say. With al our works. And so the
first p^cept of the first table techith us to love god with all our heart
The secounde techith us to love hi^ with all our word / and show him love i^
speech For who so loves well a another / he wole speak good and worship of him
that he loves / and be glade to here of his good name and speak him good. and
worship / and sorye to here his name despised and diffamed By ye third
co^maundmente we ben taught to show love to god i^ deed / yt is to leave our
own occupacions on ye haliday and give us pri^cipaly to serve god and to be
occupied with hi^ / and no thing do but for his love and to his worship / or for
great need of our self For who so loves well a another / he wole seek a time
to speak with hi^. and dele with hi^ And therefore god bids us halowe well the
haliday and than atte^de to hi^ and occupy us with hi^ as with our dear love / yt
made us of naught / and bought us with his blood full dear / and saves us / and
kepith us / and yeuethe us all that we have of any good and fyndeth us all that
us nedith and much more And if we love him in this manner with all our mightes
and our dedys / and our works / and halowe thus the haliday and the sabot yt
he has boden us halowe / He should give us a sabot and rest in heaven bliss /
where as says ysaie the prophet. shall be sabott of sabottes. that is to say
endless rest betok nyd by temporel rest in the halidaye. And month of month
/ yt is to say endless myrthe betoke nyd and figured. by temporalle myrthe in
the haliday. ysaie lx^ vi.c. Amen.

Here endith the thridde p^cepte / and begins the fourth.
Ca. i.
Dives. As me thinks thou haste declared the co^maundmentes of ye first table
full well and parfitly to man's soul Now I pray ye for gods sake perform
that thou have begu^ne. and declare to me ye commandments of the secund
table / yt I may the betr^ know gods law / and the more plesauntly serve my
god / in keep me the more peasible in charity with mine euencristen. For as I have
understand / all the seuyn co^mau^dmentes of the secounde table be knytte in
the secounde percepte of charity which bids us love our eue^criste^ as our
self


Pauper. Mankind has ii. begynnynges The first beginning and begynner is
god. The secounde beginning and begynner. is ye fader and mother By the first
commandment of the first table we be taught to worship god above al things /
as him that is beginning of us and of al creatures. By the first commandment
of the secounde table we be taught to worship fader and mother yat been our
beginning next after god And therefore he says i^ ye first commandment of
the secounde table. Honora patrem tuum et matre^ tua^. That is to say /
worship thy fader and thy modre. By the precepts of the first table he
taught us to love god above all thing. By the precepts of the secou^de
table. he techith us to love our euencristen as our self. And for asmoche as
charity is most showed by worshipynge and helping of our euencristen /
therefore he begins by teching of worship that owith to be done to them that
we owe by weye of charity most to worship after god and most to help that
is fader and mother And therefore he says. Honora patrem tuu^ et matrem tuam.
Worship thou thy fader and thy mother. By which commandment we ben bounde^ to
help our bodily fader and mother at need and be to them buxum and meke / and
fle their displesaunce. not despise them / not a^gre hem vnskylfully / not
ba^ne ne wary them / ne harm them ne scorn them for none age / for none
vnclenesse / for no wanwyt ne folly that they say or do / but supporte them i^
their age and feblenesse / as they supportyd us i^ our youth / and help us.
and kept us in our feblenesse / wha^ we could not ne might not help our
self. We find Genesis ix.c. That Noe had three sons. Sem Cham and Iaphet.
When the floode was done it happyd yt their fader noe drank so wine. that he
was dronke / for he knew not the might of the wine. For before the flode men
drank no wine ne ete no flesh. And wha^ne noe was thus dronke / his myddel
son Cham fond him liggynge bare / so that he might se his preuy membris And
anon he laughed his fader to scorn / and would not hile his fader / but went
and told it to his brethern iapi^g and scornyng his fader But his brethern
would not se that nyce sight / but turned their face from their fader and cast
a cloth upon him and hiled him onestly. Wha^ ne noe awoke. and wiste whatt his
myddel son Cham had done to him. he was wroth with him and cursed his
Canaan and all that should come of him / and made him thral and bond to Sem and
Iaphet / and to their children after them And thus for scorni^g and vnworship
y^ that the son did to the fader / began first bondage and thraldom and was
co^fermyd of god.


Dives. Sithe^ Cham did the sin and not chanaan which was yet but a child
why cursed noe the child chanaan. and not cham the childs fader.


Pauper. Noe would natt curse Cham in his persoone / for god had blessed him
in his person with his brethren anoone after the flode And therefore he cursed
his son / and him in his son / and punysshed him in his son / and all
that should come of him For it was gods dome that right as he had do shame
to his fader / so his children should be shame and shenship to him And as noye
had no joy of hi^ so should he have no joy of his children.


Dives. The skylle is good and rightful / say forth


Pauper. Therefore Solomon says. Oculum qui subsannat patre^: et despicit
partum matris sue / suffodient eu^ corui de torre^tibus and demones / prouer.
xxx.c The iye that scornyth his fader and dispiseth the birth of his mother /
rauyns of the brokes / thatt is to say. feendes of hell brokes. shall delue out
and pyke out ye iye. And therefore he says in an other place. Honora patre^
tua^ et gemitus matris tue ne ob liuiscaris. Memento qm^ nisi per illos non
fuisses: et retribue illis quomodo ilu tibi. Eccle. vii.c. worship thou thy
fader / and for yette not ye sighinges of thy mother. ne what pain she had wha^
she bare the of her body. Thynk that but by them thou had not been / and
yield them and do to them as they did to the. And god bad him self in ye old
law yt who so cursed or waried his fader or mother / he should be slain
Leuitici. xx.c.


The ii. chapter
Dives. Many children would full fayn se their fader and their mother deed / yt
they might have her heritage / and live at their own governance And often
wha^ne they may natt have it by their good will ne by their death / they wole
have it by plee. and by maistrye.


Pauper. Such children fulle late shall thryue. and they shall have full little
joy and worship of her children / but much shame and shenshyp For as salomo^
says He that cursith his fader or his mother or disesith them / his lantern
shall be quenchyd i^ the mids of derknesses. that is to say either he shall none
air have / or if he have he shall be withoute^ worship For the heritage says
he to which children hasten fast in this manner / shall want blessyng and
grace of god in the last end. Prouer. xx.c. And in a another place he says /
yt who so withdrawith any thing from his fader and from his mother. and says it
is no sin / he is as wicked as a manqueller. Particeps homicidie e^. Prouer.
xxviii.c. Also we find in the secounde book of kings xv.c. yt absolon the
son of David would have put his fader david out of his kingdom / and he drove
him out of the cite of ierlm^ barosote For he came so suddenly on him that
david was besy to fle. and save his life Sone after absolon yaue battle to his
fader in the field. But as god would he was discounfited / and much of his
folk slain / both by sword. and by the wild beestes.

Thanne absolon fled riding on his mule. discheuele. yt is open heded And as
he rode under an oak / his here that was full long and full feyre smote up
among the bows / and there fastenyd so that ye mule passyd forth in his
re^ne But absolon henge stylle by the here. till that Ioab. that was cheefteyne
and prince of the oste of david came to him and smote him through the heart with
three sperys / and did stoone him full up to the death / that was the most
dispitouse death in the law And so absolon that was tha^ ye fairest man
lyui^g / for haste that be had to the eritage and did such wrong to his
fader / he lost both his heritage and his life Also adony his brother would
have been king while his fader david lyuyde / and david priued him of the
kingdom for euir. and made solomon king / that was tha^ne not xi. year old
And afterward adonye was slain for he would have been king against his faders
ordenau^ce Therefore god bad i^ the old law Deutro. xxi.c yt if there were any
vnbuxu^ child and wrawe yt would not obey to his fader and mother / they should
led him to the rulers of the cite. and say to them in this wise Our son is
stout and proud / he wol not here our techyng ne our biddyng / but he yeueth
him to riot glutonye and lechery / and to great festes and fare And god bad yt
all the people of the cite or of yt town. should sle that vnbuxu^ child with
stones / in example of all other For when young folk. Wexe rebelle to fader
and mother and give them to such riot and welfare / and ydelship / but they be
chastised and withsto^de i^ the beginning / they shall she^de the comyntee of
the people / by robbery. murdre and manslaughter / by colisions and wicked
cumpanyes and make rebellion and risynge against their soueraynes / and so be
cause of destruction of the land of the cite and of the comynte Also Mt xv.c.
Criste in the gospel repreueth al tho that by ypocrisy. Withdraw nedful living
from fader or mother / under color of gods worship and holy chirch And he
repreueth tho men of holy church that so enfourme the children to say to their
fader and mother. that they may not worship god and holy church for ye cost yt
they do to sustain them self / and so make fader and mother to live in
myscheyf / yt me^ of holy church may live in delice.


The iii. chapter.
NOt only by the precept of god ben we bounden and taught to worship and help
our fader and our mother / but alsoo by example in kind as tellithe the
master of propirties. That when the stork that is clepyd Ciconia. in latin
has brought forth her briddes to flight / both the male and the female be^
woxen fulle feeble for travail yt they had in the bredyng and bringing
forth of their briddes / and so feeble that they may natt well help them self
For both the male and the female sytte by diverse times on the eyren / and
change their traueyle in bredynge of their briddes / and in fetchyng of mete
and drink for them self. and for their briddes. And therefore when the
bryddes been woxe^ and may fle / they fetch mete to their fader and mother into
the nest as long time as they traueiled to bring forth their birds / till
they be releuyd and may traueyl to help them self. Also he tellith yt there is
a bridde that is clepyd a pellicane. Pellicanus. And there is a great enemyte
bitwene the pelican and the addre The addre waits when the pelican has
briddes / and when she is out of the neste to get mete to her and to her
briddes. the adder crepith up into the neste and sleeth the briddes. When the
pelican comes again / and fyndethe her briddes slain on this manner / she
mourns three days and three nyghtes for death of her briddes. The thridde day
she settith her again ouir her briddes. and with her bylle she smytethe her
self in the side. and spryngithe the blood on her briddes And by the virtue of
the blood she rayseth them fro death to life. By the bledyng she wexith so
feeble yt she may not traueyl to feed her self.

Thanne some of her briddes for love and pitee put them to traueyle and feed
their mother / and some give no tale of her but only feed them self. When the
mother is amendyd. and woxen strong / tho briddes that helpyd her she loves
and cherissheth. And the other yt would not help her / she betith and bylleth
and castith them out of her cumpany.

The iiii. chaptre.
Dives. This precepte biddithe us worship fader and mother / and yt we may do
withouten any cost and with lityl travail / For we may rise a yens them.
knele to them and take there blessing and speak to them with reverence and so
keep ye commandment /


Pauper The commandment byndethe us not only to worshipe. fader and mother
with such reverence doing but also to worship them with help at need /


Dives. Where find thou that help at need is cleped worship.


Pauper In the first pistle that sei^t poule wrote to ye bubssop tymothee.v.c.
where sei^t poule bad that he should worship verrey widewis. That is to say he
should sustain them with godis of holy church And he clepith there varrey
widewis. that had no good to be sustained with of there own / And if that she
had children or fader or mother or whereof to live. he bad that she should
learn to rewle her household and help fader and mother as they helped her / And
in the same chapter he bids that prestis and men of holy church that rewle
well her sugettis. should have double worship of the people. That is to say the
gloss that the people should obey to them and do them reverence and find them
all that them need. and namely to them that travail in prechinge and techinge
of the gospel


Dives. It is only folly. When folk for age and feblenesse may not ne can not
help them silf ne govern them silffe tha^ne to be take to there childre^s
governance of the howshold. and put them silf in keeping of there children and
there governance.


Pauper. More semely it is that they put them in her childrens governance
and keeping than i^ straungeris Namely if they have found them good and kind
to them before But for any trust in there children I would not counsci^e them
fully dysmytten them of her good / But alwey reserve the lorship to them silf.
and there children in dau^gere / And therefore salamon says / Audite me magnati
and omnes ppli etc. Eccle. xxxiii. ye great men and gouernouris of holy church
and ye al people list now to my saw give to no man ne woman power up on the by
thy self Neithir to son ne to doughti ne to brother ne to friend give not awey
to other me^ thy good and thy catell For happily it may repent the. and tha^n
shall thoupreye to have help of thine own good and thou shall noon have.
Melius est vt filii tui te roge^t quamte respiccre in manus filioru^ tuorum
Eccl. xxxiii.c. It is better says he that thy children pray the and axe help
of the: than thou look i^to ye hands of thy children for help. I find that an
old man bitoke to his son his household and yaue hi^ all that he hadd to keep
him well in his age / First he lay with his son in the chaumbre. at the last
he was put out of the chau^bree and laid him bihynde the spear at ye haldore
For he cowght and row ghide so: his son and his sons wife might no rest have
by him in the chanmbre / And when he lay so nigh the halle door he had much
cold and clepyd to hi^ his sons son a litel child: and badde him goo to
his fader: and axe of him some cloth to keep hi^ with from cold / The child
ded the erande: and the fader took ye child an old sack / Have said he: and
bid him lay this on hi^ Nay fader said the child. butt kytte it in too. and
send ye him the half: and keep ye to you ye other half: till to the time when
ye be old that ye may tha^ne hill you therwithe and keep you fro cold / Not
long sith this caas bifel in colchestre There was an old man sumdel lettred:
which bitoke his son in his age al ye household / and yaue him all that he
hadd for to keep hi^ well in his age First he lay in chaumbre with his son /
after he was putt aloone: in an out chaumbre in the yerde: and was seruede
fulle cudl both at bed and at board On a day he prayde his sons wife to
lene him half a busshel to mete by a certain thing / Butt he would not tell her
what he should mete / She took hi^ half abusshel having great wondre what he
should do therewith / He wentte into his chaumbre and shett the door to him /
He took a sewe pe^s and halfpens and ferthingys / that he had: and put them
into the craueises of the half busshel And sone aft he took her a yen her half
busshel / She looked besily in the half busshel: to know what he had mote
thereby / And thanne she foonde that money hanging in the crauises and cliftes
of the half busshel: and she wend that he had mote money by the vessel: And
went and she wide it to her husbond / and he wend the same For his fader kept
eu a great hutche besidis his bed well lockid Right heavy it was. but his son
might not wete what was therein But after this deed he hopi^e yt there hadd be
therein much money And in hope of that money He and his wife kept well and
onestly his fader in to his death. Wha^ne he was deed: he brake up the hutche
for keie fond he non thereto. And thanne fond he in yt hutche but earth and
stones and a betyllyinge over it with a scrowe thereon in the which was wreten in
this manner / whith this be til be they beten that her children her good shall
letyn: and give away al there thing and goon them self on beggynge.


Capitulu^.v.
Dives yet contrate. Crist says in the gospel. Qui non odit patrem suum et
matre^ suam-non potest meus esse discipulus. Luce.xiii.c. He that hatith not
his fader and his mother he may not be my disciple / But that we be bound to
hate we be not bound to worship ne to help / Therefore thanne we be neither
bound to worship fader ne mother: ne to help them at need


Pauper. Crist said tho words when nighe all the world was hethen and of
false bileue: when nighe all the faders and moders were in false bileue and in
deedly sin / And therefore criste said tho words. Not that children should
hate the persons of yer faders and moders But they should hate their false
bileue / and their wicked living. and so us must al if we will be saved / we
should love every man and woman and hate their sin / And in as much as fader
and mother with stand us in gods weye: we should hate there maleice and
forsake there wicked living and follow godd and be besy to draw fader and
mother after us in gods weye by good techynge and ensaumple /


Dives. yet contrate Crist says in the gospel. Deni seperare hominem aduersus
patrem suum et aduersus matrem suam mt.x.c.


Pauper. In gods cause and in truth man and woman owthe to forsake fader and
mother if they wythestonde gods cause / and hold a yens the truth / And so
Crist came for to depart man and woman fro there fader and mother: that stood in
false bileue a yens god / Criste came not to put full hate bitwene man and his
fader and mother: But for to make man and woman to forsake fader and mother for
gods sake: If they will let the^ from godde / And therefore he says in the
same place. He that loves fader and mother more than me he is not worthy to
come to me / we should love fader and mother and help them at need / thou they
be hethen and neuir so wicked but we should love god more than them And if we
may not please godd and them also: we should offend thyem and please god: and
alwey love there person and hate there sin / And be bisy to a mende them by
good enformacyon with love and lownes and reverence.


Dives. yet contra te Seint poule says. Non debent filii parentibus the
saurizare sed parents filiis.ii. ad little.xiii^.c: Children owe not to
tresoure ne to gadre to gidre to there faders and moders: but faders and moders
owe to tresure and gadre to there children. Therefore thanne it seems that
children should not care for there fader and mother: but fader and mother should
care for there children


Pauper. Erhe of them owe to care for other / But more the fader and mother for
ye child: thanne the child for fadef and mother


Dives. Why so


Pauper. For the child is toward and by common course of kind is semynge longer
to live thane his fader or mother / And his chldren should be his fadris
children children and his moders / And so fadere and mother care not only for
there own children: but also by wey of kind: they care for yer children
children: and have effectio^ more to there children: than there children for them
/ And more care for there children: than there children for them / And therefore
right as the rote in the tree by wey of kind yeueth more moisture and virtue
up to the tree and to the croppe / Thanne the tree or the crope yeueth down to
the rote: so by wey of kind the fader and the mother most be more besie to
help there children: and to ordeyne for them. Thanne the children for fader
and mother that sooner by wey of kind should dye / Netheles right as the crop
refresshithe the rote by moisture of dew and of reyne and bisshadewth the
root fro the hete of the son: so owth the children refresshe there fader and
there mother in there need: and keep them from messhefe as much as they may in
good manner and keep them well and onestly / Not for to make them rich: ne
norisshe them in deliciis.


The sixte chapter.
Dives. Wha^ne man or woman entrethe into the religion: he is deed a yenste the
world / Therefore thanne it semethe that bihis religion he is vnb^u^de from
this pecept / And he that is not bound to help his fader or mother at need /
For when he is professed in religion he may not give / For he yt naught have
naught may give.


Pauper. Man and woman by this precepte is bound to two thingis: to reverence
fader and mother and to help them at need / As for the reverence the religiouse
is as much bound or more as ye seculere in time and place when and where he
may do it. But as for ye secunde point that is to helppe them at need if his
fader and mother have not whereby to live: ne be of power to get there living
onestly-the son owthe not to enter such religion: there he may not help the^
for if he do he may be cause of there death: But if his fader and mother have
enoughe to live by: he may enter religion thowe fader and mother forbede it him:
He shall not spare for love: prayer: for blessing / ne for curse / For as
saint austen says in epla^ ad letum. This precepte byndethe there that things
of more charge and more profit let it not.


Dives. yet contra te. If the religiouse keep not this precepte by cause of his
religion: he deed a mysse in taking of his religion


Pauper. That is sothe.


Dives. I suppose yt he se never after his fader ne mother: ne do the^ no help
ne reverence: Houe keeps he thanne this precepte:


Pauper. Thou he se the^ never after: ne help them at need ne do to them
reverence: if his will be good to help them at need: and to do them reverence
if he might come to them him silfe: or by mean person: yet he keep the p^cept
/ For thou this p^cepte byndeth alwey man and woman: yet it byndeth not for
alweye. as say these clerks not for eu^y time ne for every place: ne for every
cause. butt only for such cause: time and place when they may do it lefully
/ And thus bind al preceptis affirmative / But preceptys negative bind every
time and for every time /


Dives. What if fader and mother fall in mischief after yt there sone is
professed in religion: owe not her son to forsake religion. and help his
fadar and mother in there mischief.


Pauper. Some clerks seye yt for as much as he is deed a yenst the world by
his profession therefore he is dischargyd fro cure of fader and mother. as he is
dischargyd thereof by bodily death / And he owe not to goo out of his religion:
but dwell still under obbediens of his prelate / Netheles he owe to do his deuor
to help the^ saving his obedience and onestee of his religion. In su^. co^.
lio. iiio. tio. xxxiiii. q. CC. xlix.


Dives. As I said first. He ye naught have naught may give. but the
religiouse makes so his profession yt he may no thing have in propre / Hou
should he than help either fader or mother: or any other of his kyn


Pauper. If he be a religious mendinau^t: he may beg for his fader and mother
as he does for him silfe: and so releue and help them by mennys alms / And if
he do so: with out doubt god shall send him enoughe by cause of his charity
And he shall fare the bettre for them both in body and soul / And if he be a
religious possessionere endewyd by temporal gods he may releue them in the
same manner. Or else by alms of the house. Which is endewed principhly to
help the nidy. and namely fader and mother / For seint poule says that who so
have not cure of his next: he is wors than jew sarseyn or paynym.


The seuenthe chapter.
Dives. As they say the gods of holy church may not be aliened: ne youen in
God to the use of seculeris.


Pauper. forbid else / For all that holy church has. it is youen to holy
church. or ellis purchasyd by substance of temporel lords to help christian
people in mischief / And therefore holy churchys goods ben cleped the goods
of the pore and of the nedy.xvi. q. i^. decime et co. quio.


Dives. These religiouse possessioners endewed in so great richessys: say that
they be the goods of the house: And therefore noon of them may give any thing
of the goods wioute common assent of the covent And leave of there sovereign /
And so me thinks that it is full hard to any religious possessionere to
help either fader or mother by goods of his house / For the religiouse may
scarsely help them sylfe by goods of his house: he shall full evil or may releue
fader or mother by goods of his house For redely he shall find both his
prelate and his covent aye^s him: alegginge dilapidacion and wast and poverty
and great need with out need / For yet there is no house that will say yt
they have enoughe.


Pauper. A sorry lordship is thanne the lordshipp of religeouse that may not in
so great richessys passing dukes cerlis barons. releue the mysshef of their
own fader and mother. But sothely they show well that al there besinesse is to
spare to purchase to beg of lords and ladies. and of other men lands and
rentys gold and silver. Not for help of the pore: but for to maynteyn there
pride and there lust fare Saint benette often with good consience yaue to the
couentys good to folk i^ mischefe For we read po. lio. dialogorum. That there
was a good simple man disesid for he ought a man twelve shillinges: and he had
not wherewith to pay / He came to seint benet and prayed him of help Sei^t benet
said that he had noght thanne wherewith to help him. But come a yen said he
to me: after too days: and tha^ne I shall help the if I may / Seint benet for
petie that he hdde on that man praide to god for help / And sodynly be foond
ligging threttene shyllinges on the hutche of the covent that was full of whete
/ which money seint benet took and yaue to that sorry man / and bad him pay
twelve shillinges for his det / And twelve pens ou^ he bad him keep for his
living And with out doubt if seint benette had had so much money of the
covent: He should have do the same with the couents money with out assent of
the covent / For we find in the same book that there was a great hungre in
that cuntre ye seint benette dwelled in / And when he saw folk at mysshefe:
he yaue a way nigh all the gods of the couentt so that therere was no thing
left in the covent whereby to live but a litel oil in a glass / There came a man
to him whose name was agapitus: And prayde him for gods sake to give him
alytyll oil / Seiut benet bad the monk that had the oil in keeping: deliver
that oil to that nedi man The monk for negardship and for that it was the
couentys good would not deliver it to the nedy man / For if he yaue that a wey
there should noon leeue to ye couentt / Seint benet was myspayde: and badde
another monk take the vessel of glass with the oil and cast it out at the
window: for yt the monk was so vnobedie^t for the oil / when it was cast
out: it fell down more than an hundred foot on cragges and stones For the
hou se stood upon an high hyl / and nether ye glass brake ne the oil spylt.
Tha^nee sit benet bad the monks take it as it was / and give it to ye need man
And thanne before all the monks he vndername the cellerer of his pride and of
his wanebileue Thanne saint benett with his brethern prayde to godd that he
would send them some oil whereby to leave / And anon a tu^ne that lay there
beside void suddenly was so full of oil that it ran over in the flore / we
reden also in the life of saint gregory that the re came a man and axide saint
gregory alms for goddis sake For he had lost al his good on the sea: and
onneth he escaped with lif Saint gregori that was than but abbot: bad his
awmener give him six pens / And he did so The same day he came again: and axide
alms: and had as much / He came again the third day and aleggide great
pouertye: yt he had lost much good: and gate but litel a yen Seint gregory
bad his procuratour and rewler of the couentis gods that he should give him his
almsse / He answerde and said that there was non thing left: but adisshe of
silver in which his mother was wontt to send him mete / Saint gregory bad him
give the poreman that disshe / And so he deed This poor man was gods aungel:
i^ ye lekenes of a poor man / and for this alms god made seint grery
afterward pope of Rome / we find also i^ the life of saint frau^ces That he bad
his brethren take the clothes of our ladies ault. and give the^ to ye pore
folk.viii.c.


Dives. the religeouse say that the gods of the covent ben all their goods
in common. And therefore may non of them give out awey without assentte of
them al: For by common rewle of the law: that touches al most be approved of
al / Quod ome^s tangit: ab hominibus approbari debet. And by a another rewle.
there may no man give any other right: but such right as he has him self /
Nemo potest plus viris transfer in alium qm^ sibi co^petere dinoscitur / And
therefore since no person of the covent has any right in godis of the coue^tys:
therefore non of them may give any alms of the couentys gods ne non other
good with out assent of them all: or of the more part / For what thing is
any monckes of the covent: it is the couentis / And what so he gets. it is
the couentys. Quia qc quid adquiritur monacho: ad quiritur monasterio.


Pauper. By such ipocrise under the color of poute they mainteyn there pride and
there avarice: and occupye gretter lordshipys than do many dukes eerlis and
barons to great hindrynge of the land and great disease of the pore people /
For ye god ordained to be common to help at need all men at need: they say that
it is there is and no ma^nis else / So that four men of religion in one house
might spend xx. thousend mark by there will and by there common opinyon / all that good should neythir turn to help of the land ne of the pore people but all
to help the pore covent


Dives. Say to my skillys.


Pauper. Thy skillys be not worth / For the gods of religiouse should be more
common than other men's godis: to help the land and the pore people / And
therefore says ye law: yt common life is nedeful to al men / and namely to them
that will follow the lif of cristes desiples / For as the air: or the light of
the son may not be deperted: ne approprid to one place more tha^ to a noyer /
So says he should al these worldly gods be common in need.xii. q^. i.
dilectissimis / And therefore they y^ have most need: have most right to gods
of the rereligeouse And the lorship is no more aproprid to the religiouse than
to the seculeris / Fr both seculers and regulers should be helped thereby But
dispensinge governance: And keeping of the goodys of holy church: is a
proprid to the religeouse and to other men of holy church / And therefore
says holy writ that in the begynyng of holy church al things were common to
the multitude of al criste^ people not only to the apostlys: but to al christian
people. Actuum. quartum. capitulu^. and. xii. q^. i. dilectissimis. And
therefore if religeouse mispe^de the gods that be taken to them. and help not
the nedy people: they do criste^ people great wrong For they withhold them her
right: and make propre to them yt owthe be common to al It is a shame and an
over great abusion: yt aman of religion shall ride with his tenth su^me or with
his twenty su^me on an horse of ten pound in a sadel al gold bigon And for
pouertye that he byndeth him to in his profession as they say he may not give
an halfpeny for goddys love ne help his fader and mother at need withouten
axyng leeue of his souereyn / Sith god that is souereyn of al bad them help
fader and mother at need / For goddis biddi^g is most to charge And seint peter
says / Obedire oportet domino magis quam hominibus Men must obey to god more
than to man / And therefore god may say to such folk of religion that
witholden alms from fader and mother and from the pore people to make her
house and her coue^t rich. yt he said to the masters of the law and to the
phariseys that were men of religion that time Quare transgredimini mandatum dei
propr tradicionem vestram why break ye gods commaundenent for your statutys
and your lore mt. xv.ix.c.


Dives. It is long sith I hard the speak of this matter. pass forth and
speak more to purpos


Pauper. Also we be bound to worshipe fader and mother / not only in reverence
doing and helping at need but also in obeiyng to her biddyng and her lore / For
solomon says / Audi patrem tuum qui genuit te / et ne co^te^pnas cum seuuerit
mar^ tua prove. xxiii.c. Here thy fader that the begat and despise not when
thy mother is old. That is to say / For any age dispice her not / but be low
and meke to her and set her teching i^ heart Iudicium patris audite filii
dilecti etc. Eccl. iii.c. ye dear children here ye the dome of your fader: and
do ye so that ye be saved He that worshipth his mother: he makes hi^ a tresoure
in ye world coming / He that worshipth his fader: he shall have joy of his
children / And he shall be hard of god in his prayer: and he shall live the
longer good life / And he that obeith to his fader: he shall refressh his mother /
He that dread god: he worshipe fader and mader And he shall serve hi^ that
bigate hi^ as his lord i^ word and in deed and in all patience worship thy
fader says he: that gods blessi^g may comto ye The fadirs blessi^g says he
makethe stable and seker ye housis of her children: and the modris curs
distroith her housis dou^e to ground He is full of wickide fame that:
forsakethe his fadris obedience / And he is a cursed of god yt angrethe his
mother and will not do her biddi^g / Al these ben salomonis wordis eccle. iii.c
And therefore god bad that children vnbuxum to fader and mother should be stoned
to death deuteronomy. xxi. We reden jeremy xxxv.c. That ionadab bad his children that
they should never dri^ke win make house ne sow land ne set vine / And for
that they kept her fadris bidding: god seyde to them by the prophet ieremye /
For that ye have obeide to the p^cept of ionadab your fader and kept al his
co^maundeme^tis: therefore ye ki^red of ionadab shall not fail his
commandments. Therefore the kynrede of Ionadab shall not fail / but al
days that kynred shall be in my sight / and I shall have iye to them and help
them But the wicked people of judah. and of ierlm^ that would not obey to my
co^maundmentes I shall distroye. Therefore seint poule says Filii obedite
parentibus vestris. etc. ye children says he obey ye to your faders and
moders for that is rightful thing. Worship ye fader and mother for this is the
first co^maundment and biheste / that ye may be well in living long upon
earth And ye faders says he provoke ye natt. ne styre ye not your children to
wrath vnskylfully / but noryssheth them in good lore and i^ vndernamynge of
our lord god. Ad ephe. vi.c. Criste gods son god and lord of al thing
bicame subgett to mary his mother and to joseph his keeper / yeuyng us al
ensample to obey and to be buxum and meke to fader and mother And solomon
says. Audi fili mi disciplinam patris tui. My dear son here ye lore of thy
fader / and forsake not the the law of thy mother / and tha^ne thou shall have
grace and worship. Prouer. i.c. And as he says in a another place. He is a
fool ye scorneth his faders lore. And he that kepith his faders vndernamyng
shall be the more wise and the more slye. Prouer. xv.c. Also us must worship
fader and mother with good living For as solomon says. Dolor patris filius
stultus. The child fool is sorrow and shame of his fader. Confusio patris de
filio indisciplinato Of the son evil taught cu^meth shame and shenship of the
fader. and his daughter fool and evil taught shall lose his worship / and the
wise daughter shall be good heritage to her husbo^de to save him. And the
daughter that shendith her husbonde is in great despyte and shame of her fader.
that bigat her Eccle. xxii.c. The wise son gladith his fader The son yt is
a fool in living is his moders sorrow Prouer. x.c. Ira patris filius stultus:
et dolor mri^s q^ genuit eu^. prouer. xvii.c. The fool child is wrath and
tene of his fader / and sorrow of his mother. that bigatte him.


The x. chapter.
And therefore salomo^ says. Virga et correptio tribuunt sapi^am / puer au^t
qui dimit titur voluntati sue confu^dit matre^ sua^. prouer. xxix.c. That is to
say The yerde vndernymyng yeuen wit and wisdom to the child / and that
child yt is leten have his will in his youth shendith his mother and al his
kynrede. Example we have in the first book of kings. of hely that was highest
busshop and priest. of gods law / and of his sons ophny and phynees. That
for their fader vndirnam them not ne chastised hem of their wicked tatches /
for the children syn and for his mys sufferau^ce. god took from him his
dignyte. and from al his kynrede for euyr / and slew his children and nigh al
his kynrede in batayl. And so the wicked taches of his children vnworshipyd him
and all his kynrede for euir / and brought them to end less shame And his
mys suffera^ce was cause of their death and of his shenship and shame to al her
kynrede. The sin of his children was pride letchery lusty fare and glutonye /
and sleuth and rechlesnesse in gods service and in gods law And therefore
good friends and good children I pray you all that ye be buxu^ and meke to
fader and mother / and worshipe them not only with reverence doing in deed and
speech / but principaly with your good living. and your good berynge. For
that is the most worship that ye may do to them / and the most velonye if ye
do amys And do ye so yt your faders and moders and your kynred may have joy
of you / and than shall ye have joy of your children. For the wise man says
Qui honorat pre^m suu^ io cu^dabitur in filiis suis Eccle. iii.c. He ye
worshipeth his fader shall have joy of his children. And who so worshipeth
not his fader and mother in this manner / but does them wrath and tene by his
mislyuynge and evil taches / he is a cursyd of god Maledictus qui non honorat
patre^ suu^ et matre^ sua^. Deutro. xxvii.c. Acursyd be that child says he
that worshipeth not his fader and mother with his good living / but
vnworshipeth them with his myslyuynge. For all the myscheuys of the child turn
to vilonye and shame of fader and mother. And all the godenesse and all the good
beri^g of the child / turn to great worship of fader and mother / and of all the kynrede A great worship. is to fader and mother wha^ne me^ bless them and
pryse them for godenesse of their children and say. blessed be ye fader that
the child begatt / and blessed be the mother yt him bare Therefore says the
wyseman that god worshypeth the fader in his children. When he sees them
good children. Eccle. iii.c. It is great vilonye to fader and mother when me^
curse them and deprayue them for wickedness of their children And therefore
the wise man says. Non iocunderis in filiis impiis Have thou no joy ne
likyng in thy children if they be shrewys and dread not god It is better says
he to have one good child / than a thousand children shrewys / and better to
dye withoute^ / tha^ne to leave after them shrewyd children. Eccle. xvi. c. For
as he says. Sapi^e. iiii. c. All the children yt come of wicked folk shall
be witnesses of wickedness against their fader and mother / when they shall be
chalengyde of their wyckydnesse at the dome For the fader and the mother shall
answer tha^ne for their own wickedness / and for their children wickedness
But the wise man says / if thou have children tech them well / and bow them
and make them souple and meke in their youth. If thou have daughters. keep
well their bodies and honestly / but show them no glade chere / be not to
homely with them Eccle. vii.c. While a tree is a small spring it may be
bowyd as men wole have it Butt when it is full woxen / it wole not be bowyd So
may the child in the youghe with a little twygge be chastised and made low and
meke But wha^ne he is woxen and rotyd in pride and mysuse of living / it is
full hard to low hi^ or to amend him. And therefore the wise man says. Qui
parcit virge odit filiu^: et qui diligit illu^ insta^ter erudit Prouer. xiii.c.
He that sparith the yerde hatith his son / and he that loves his son
techith him and chastifeth him bisily. Example we have in kind of the egle.
Which of al fowls may se ferthest / and is mightiest in sight / in somoche
that he may se and look against the son when it shyneth most bright without
blemysshyng of the iye. And when she has briddes and they be full woxen / she
does hem look against the son And tho ye look well against the son with out
blemysshynge of iye / them she loves and cherissheth. And them that wole not
ne may not look against the son / or blemissh their iye in lokynge ayenste the
son / she betith them and bylleth them. And but if they amend them / she
castith them out of the neste / and puts them out of her cumpany as for
noon of her briddes. Thus should faders and moders teache their children. to
have their iye up to god / that is son of rightwisnesse: and take heed to
gods law by exaumple of tobie: which said to his son / All the days of
thy life have thou god in mind: and be ware that thou assentte to no sin ne
leave not goddys commandment. Tobie. iiii.c. And therefore solomon says. Eccle.
vi. That the wicked man that looks not up to the sun of rightwisnesse is so
blent with derkenesse of sin / that he woot not what is good: ne what is
wicked / And therefore says he in the next chapter wisdom with richessis is
more profitable than with out richessys: and it profith most to them that
sethe sun. that is to say to them that have iye to the su^ne of right
wisnesse. that is god / For as solomon says. Ocu^ sapientis in capite eius.
Eccle. iio. The iyen of the wise man be alwey in his head. That is to say in
crist that is head of holy church and of al thingis / And david says. Sict
oculi seruorum in manibus dn^o rum fuorum et sicut oculi ancille in manibus
domine sue: ita o culi nostri ad dominum deu^ nostrum donec misereatur nostri.
As the seruantys have there iyen to the hands of there lord: and as the maid
in chaumbre has hyriyen to the handys of her lady: So must us have our iyen
up to our lord god til he will have mercy on us.

The eleventh chapter
Dives. Reason yeueth that men should teache there children gods law: and good
thewis / and for to take heed to god yt made us al of naught / and bought us so
dear. But no we men say that there should no lewed folk entirmete them of
gods law: ne of the gospel: ne of holy writ: nether to kun it ne to teache it.


Pauper. This is afoule enour and full perilous to mannys soul / For every man
and woman is bound aftir his degree to do his besines to know goddis law that
he is bound to keep. And faders and moders godfadres and godmodres be bound
to tech there children gods law or else do them be taught / And therefore god
says. Erunt ^ba hec. etc. These words yt I bid ye this day should be in thy
heart. Thou shall tell them and teache them to thy children / Thou shall the^k
thereon sitti^ge i^ thy house amougys thy folk: And when thou go by the way.
When thou go to sleep. and when thou a risest thou shall bind them as a
token in thy hand in thy deed: i^ thy work they should be alwey styrring
before thy iyen of thyn heart / Thou shall write them in thy thressheolde and
in thy dorys of thyn house that is to say when thou come in: and when
thou go out. i^ thy beginnynge and i^ the ending of every deed / alwey look
yt thou ne noon of thine forfette a yens gods law by cause of the. Deuto.
vi. c. And in another place of the same book he says thus / Thou shall teache
my wordis to thy children: to thy folk. and to thy kinnesmen. Deuto: iiii.c.
And saint austen says that each man in his own hon should should do the office
of the busshoppe in techynge: and correctinge of common things / And therefore
says the law That the office of techinge and chastisinge longs not only to
the busshop: but to every gouernoure after his manner / and his degree. To the
poor man gouning his pore housolde / To the rich man gouerni^g his folk / To
ye husbondman gouernynge his wife. To the fader and mother gouerninge there
children To the justice gouernynge his cuntre. To the king gouernynge his
people.xiii. q^. iiii. duo. and q^. v. no^ putes. And oon neighbore should
teache another / For saint Peter says. Every man minestre on to other the grace
that he: has taken of god.i. petri iio.c.


Dives. My fader and mother be deed: And therefore I let me dischargid of this
commandment.


Pauper. Thou they be deed: yet art thou bound to do them worship and to
help there souls with holy prayers and alms dedys if thou myghteste Also
thou art bound to worship them with thy good lyuinge: as I said first / For
the wisman says That he that techeth well his child: he shall be praised and
worsshiped in his child amongis his kynred he shall have joy and worsship in
his child / The fader of the well taught child i^ some manner is deed: and i^
some manner is not deed. For he left his child like after him / For all if the
fader dye bodily: yet he live and is worsshipped in the goodness of his
children / Est mortuus et quasinon e^ mortuus. Eccl. xxx.c. And in the wicked
lyui^g of the child: the fader is vnworshiped and deed. While he gothe upon
earth / Also by this commandment we be bound to worship godfader and godmoder.


The xii. chapter.
ALso to worship god: that is fader of al thing that is cleped fader of
mercyes: and god of al conforte. Pater mi^arum. et deus tocius consolacionis.
He is our fader for he made us of naught. he bought us with his blod he
finds us all that us needs and much more: he saves us. he keeps us. he
ledeth us he fedethe us: he medeth us. He is our fader by grace / For by his
grace he has made us eyrys of heaven bliss / was there never fader so tender
over his child: as god is te^dre over us / He is to us both fader and mother /
And therefore we be bound to love him. and to worship him above al thing. as I
said in the first commandment: But he may say to us as that he said to
the unkind iewis / Filius honorat patrem: et seruus dominum suum timebit. etc.
The son says he by wey of kind worshipith his fader / and the servant shall
dread his lord. Sith thanne I am fader of al. Where is my worship And sithe I
am lord of al where is my dread: Neither ye worship me as a fader: ne dread me
as a lord Malach. i.c. Nunqd non est pater vnus omniu^ vestru^ Nunquid non
deus vnius creauit vos: Have ye not says he al oon fader. and oon god made you
all / why thanne says he despise ye each man other. That is his brother by
pride and ouerledi^ge and brekynge the commandment of your formfadris:
Malach. ii:c. Also for ten^re love yt he has to ma^kynd: he clepc^h hymsylfe
our mother saying to sin^ul soul: wenest thou says he: that ye mother may
foryete her young child that she bare of her body: and have no reuthe ne petye
thereon: And thou she foryete her child and have no petye thereon: yet I shall
not foryete the to show the mercy. ysa. xlixo.c. And therefore he says. Ego
matter pulcre dilecci onis etc. I am mother of fair love. of love dread. of
knowing of holy hope. In me is al manner grace of truth and of life / In me is
al hope of life of virtue of mercy alof al manner goodness Eccle. xxiiii.c. And
thus by this precepte we be bound to love our god and worship him above al
thing as our principal fader and mother / And that principaly for the mercy
and pety that he shewthe to mankind i^ his governance and keeping By the first
commandment we be boande to worship him above al thing for he is endless might
as god and beginner and shaper of all thing.

The xiii. chapter
ALso we be bound by this commandment to worship our gostly fader that has
cure of our soul: as pope. and our busshop our prelate. our person. our
vecary. our curate. our co^fessoure / And our mother that us must worshipe is
holy church. Of this manner fader and mother says solomon / Audi fili mi
disciplinam patris tui: et ne dimittas lege^ matris tue. Mi dear son says he
here the lore of thy gostly fader: and forsake not the law of thy mother holy
church. prou^. i.c. Of these manner faders spekethe also holy wryt / Lord
says he here before thou made choson faders. and made them full holy.iio.
macha..i.c. Prelates of holy church be cleped faders / For there office is to
gendre folk in right believe: and to norishe the^ in good thewys: and virtuous
living / And therefore saint poule says / Per euangelin^ ego vos genui. By
this gospel I begat you in crist / Such faders be worthy double worship: as
saint poule says / For they be worthy to be reverenced of there sutgettis: and
to have there living / Therefore they owe to have tithes and offeringys of there
children: that be under cure / For as saint poule says in the same place / The
werkeman that well traueilethe io worthy his mede.i. tymo.v.c. But now god may
say. Regnauerunt sed non ex me. Prelatys have reigned in holy church: and not
of me ne by my plesaunce I made them not I chase the^ not And therefore saint
poule says that thou men have ten thouse^d masters yet they have but few
faders / For prelatis for the most part seek more there own profyt tha^ profyt
of mannys soul. Ome^s que sua sunt queru^t no^ que Jesus cristi / Such prelates
and curatis be not fadirs of the people: but wolves of rauyn that devour gods
people. Sicut esca^ panis Of such prelatis and curatis speak ysaie the prophet.
Ip^i pastores ignoraueueru^t i^tellige^ciam. etc. Such shepeherdis prelates and
curates know not goddis law ne the understanding of gods law / Al they
bowed awey from gods wey i^to there own wey of false confience from the
higheste to the lowest. ysaie. lvi.r. And for that said he. that the
shepeherdis prelates and curates of holy church deed so folyly: and will not
seek up our lord god to please him and to serve him / Therefore they have lost
vndersto^di^g and wit to teache the people / And so al there flock is disperplid
by eresie debate diuiso^n and disce^cion Jeremy.x.c. who says god by took
the shepherdes and p^lates yt thus disparplen and al forrende ye flock of my
pasture or lesewe yt is christian people. jeremy.xxiii.c. And therefore saint
gregori in his omelie. ome^.xvii. Ve signauit dominus. Makes his moan and
says thus Pray ye to god that he will send true werkemen into his corn. That
is to say amo^gis his people / For there is much corn and much people to be
taught / But few werkemen of prechours to teache them and to till mannys soul.
For thowe there be folk to hyre / There be few to seye or to teache / we se
well says he that the world is full of prestes / But full little any of them
worchethe in gods corn / For we take says he the office of presthode: but
we fulfill not to do the work of the office.

The xiiii. chapter.
ALso by this precept we be bound to worship our eldre. that be our faders
in age And therefore god says. Coram can^ capite consurge. etc. Rise up says
he before the whytheryd man: and worship you the person of old man or woman:
and dread thy lord god / That is to say For dread of god worshype thou thyn
elders: and despise the^ not for no age forno febilnesse. leuitici.xix.c. And
therefore saint poule bad the busshop tymothie that he should not under nyme his
eldre ne old folk to shrapely ne to proudly: but prai them as faders to
amend them. young men as brethern. old women as moders. young women as
systers in all manner chastytye i. adtimo.iiii.c.

Dives. Often time old folk be more sherewys than other and be full hard to a
mende they be so roted i^ si^ne And therefore as me thinks them ne death to be
hard vndernoman and sharply / For god says. yt ye child of an hundred year
shall dye and the sinner of an hundred year shall be cursed. ysa. xlv.


Pauper. Some old folk be virtuous and not customable to fine Such owe to
be worshipped: and if they do some time amiss: for that y^ they be not
customable to sin / therefore there prelatis should the more spare them and mor

saint poule byddeth the people do worship and obey to there souereyns. And he
says thus. Serui obedite dn^is vestris carnalibus. ye servants obey ye to
your flesly lords with dread and trimelyng in simpleness of your heart: as
to crist / Serve ye the^ not only at ye iye to plese them: but as crystys
seruantis: do ye the will of god of heart with good willferuynge them of our
lord god. Not as men. That is to say: serve ye them truly for ye dread of god
and for the love of god And thenke ye that the service that ye do to them: ye
do it to god. And he principaly shall yield you your mede / For wete ye well
says he that every good deed that man or woman does: be he free be he bond:
he shall take his mede therefore of our lord god / And ye lords and souereins
says he do ye the same to your seruantis: and foryeue them your thretnynges
and thenke ye and wete ye it well yt god i^ heuin is god both of you and of
your seruantys. and so ye and they have both oon lord oon god that accept no
man for his person. but yield each man and woman after he deserves. Ad ephesians.
vio.c.


Dives. By these words it seems that seruantys for her true service: shall
have much mede.


Pauper. That is soth For he that does gods byddi^g god shall yield him his
mede / And it is godges biddynge and gods will: that they serve truly and
lowly there souereyns / And therefore says the gloss: That sithe crist biddethe
the servants serve truly: if they serve truly: they serve not only man ne
woman but pri^cipaly they serve criste /


Dives. Why byddeth the apostle that the servants should obey and serve to
flesly and carnal lords


Pauper. For the gloss says: Them most by gods law obey not only to good
lords: but also to shrewys / Therefore saint Peter says Subiecti estote oi^m
humane creature propter dm^ etc. Be ye sugettis says he to every man and woman
that is your souereyn not for them sylfe: but for god. Be ye sugettis to
kings to dukes and to temporal lords and the^k ye thatodg has ordained them
to veniaunce of wicked doers and to preysinge of good folk / For thus is the
will of god that with your good dedys and your meke service ye stop and make
still the vnkunnynge of the unwise folk / Serve ye as fre men: that is to
say: not only for dread of. man: But for dread and love of god as gods
servants / Dread ye god. and worship ye your king. And ye servants be ye
sugettis and meke in all dread to your lords that is to say not only in
seruyle dread. but also in love dread for gods sake / Be ye sugettis for
gods sake: not only to good lordis and well reuled: but also to shrewys and
tyrauntis. Non tantu^ bonis and modestis sed ecia^ discolis / For than / ne is
man and woman worthy thank of god. When for conscience and gods sake he
suffers patiently disese with out gylt / If ye be beten and bofeted for
your sin and your trespase: ye be worthy no thank neither of god ne of man
/ But if ye do well. and with that suffer patiently disese vngyltly Than be ye
worthi much mede of god And for to do thus criste yaue you ensaumple when he
suffered pacie^tly bitter death withuot gilt that ye should follow his steps
and patiently suffer woo with out gylt / Theyse be the words of saint peter
in his first pistle. iio.c. Here to accordethe saint poule in his pystle. Ad
rom^nos. xiiio.c. Where he says thus Every soul. that is to say. every man
and woman most be suget and meke to the power above them and to his
souereyns. For there is no power ne lordshype but of god and of gods
ordinance: And therefore says he. Whoo so withstondeth the lorship and the
power of his souereyn: he wythstondeth gods ordinance and getthe him
dampnacion wytheoute end / For why says he princes and lords be ordained of
god to dread of wicked work: not to dread of good work / wolt thou not dread
the power of thy souereyn? Do well and thou shall have preysing of him / For if
he be a good lord: he shall love the the better / And if he be a shrewe thou
shall have the more preisi^g of god yt thou do well under a wicked souereyn
as says the gloss / Thy king thy lord is godges ministre ordained of god to
thy good If thou do amys dread thou For he beryth not the swerd without cause
For he is gods mynistre: to venge the wrath of god in him that does amys And
therefore says he. be ye sugettys and meke to your souereyns as to the nedful
ordinance of god not only for to fle wrath of your souereyns: but also for
conscie^s And therefore ye give tributes to your princes and lordes-for they be
gods mynestres and serve therefore in defendyng and governance of the people
/ And as the gloss says. in that ye yeuen them tribute ye serve god: for they
be gods mynistres.


The xvi. chapter
Dives. When saint poule said tho words: emperors kings and nyghe al
princes and temporal lords upon earth were hethen and of false by / leave: bou
might they be gods minystres or gods seru^antys?


Pauper. Eueri creature is suget and servant to god: or with his will: or
with out his will. And therefore saint austen up y^ psalm. Exoudi deus
oracione^ meam. says thus wene ye not yt god suffers wicked folk to be in
this world with out cause? For every wicked man says he either god suffers
him to live for to amend him. or else that good men may be amended by him.
and win mede by him in that that they suffer his malice patiently: and
travail for to amend him / The malice of shrewys is purgatory to good folk
and shrewys be gods scourge: to chastyse gods children which he had
ordained to the kingdom of heaven. and to punysshe and purge the sins of
them yt god loves. and also to punyssh other shrewys / And therefore god said
to the synful iewys For ye will not here my words ne keep my lawys: Therefore I
shall send after my servant nabugodonosor king of babyloyne: and bring him and
al his people upon this land: and distroy this land by cause of sin.
Ierei^e. xxv.c. This nabugodonosor king of babyloyne was an hethen man a fyn
shrewe and had no love to god ne knew him for his god / He was a wicked
tyrant and destroyed gods law and gods people and gods temple in ierlm^.
And yet god cleped him his servant / For he was gods yerde to chastise
shrewys and to punisshe the sins of gods people And as ye se that when
the fader has beten his child with a yerde he castith the yerde into ye
fire: right so when god has chastysed and scourged his children by wicked men
and by wicked tyrauntes that be gods yerde. but if the tirauntes amend them
he shall cast them into the fire of hell with oute^ end / And therefore he says.
Ve assure virga furoris mei et baculus ipse e^ etc. Woo be to the people of
assure and to his king: for they be the yerde and the staf of my wrath:

I shall send them a yens the false people And ayenste the people to which I
am wroth I shall bid him distroy the people: rob the^. and sle them / But he
weneth not so but he witethe it al to his own might. and he does of malice
and I bid hi^ do my rightfulnes ysa. x.c


The xvii. chapter.
Dives. Sith it is so that al lordship and power i^ earth comes of god: me
merueleth much why god yeueth wicked men such power in this world?


Pauper. The power comethe of god: but the malice and wickedness and wicked
couetise comethe of man.


Dives. God knowith there maleice and what they will do. Why yeueth he than such
lordship and power to shrewis


Pauper. For common sin of the people / For synful people rebel and false is
worthy to have no good lord merciable ne benygne But for to have cruel lords
false tyrauntes like the people / And therefore job says. Regnare facit
ypocritam propter pcta^ ppli^. God makes an ypocrite a wicked liver to regne
for sin of people. job. xxiiiio.c. And therefore say the holy wryt that god
yaue his people a king in his wrat such as should disese them. Osee. xiii.
Dabo eis regem in furore meo.


Dives. The phylosofre says iiiio: ethi. that the wicked man is worthy no
worship: and only ye good man is worthy worship / For as he says there /
worship is mede of virtue / And so he that is not virtuous and vicious as
tyrau^tys be: is worthy no worship


Pauper yt is soth


Dives. Why byddeth than god and peter and poul as thou have said yt me^ should
do worship and obey not only to ye good lords but also to the wicked


Pauper. As I said first we should obey and do worship to them not for
themsilfe but for god and for power yt god has youen them And for that they
represent gods person in earth we should worshype them not there own
persons but for the dignity yt god has youen them and made thie^ our
souereins And they be good and virtuous we should do them worship and obey to
them not only for her dignite: but for there virtue and our own profyt / And
the rfore saint poule says. Obedite prepositis vri^s. etc. ad hebr. xiii.c.
Obey ye to your prelatis and souereyns and be ye meke and suget to them: For
why says he they be full besy and traueil to save your soulis. as they that
should give answer for your soulys at the dome.


Dives. Many of them care full little for mannys soul / They care more to get
money and mannys good / And many of them be full febyl lyuers.


Pauper. When they be such take no ensaumple of there wicked living. do not
as they do. but as they sey when they tech well. and reverence them for there
dignite and for there order. for so bedeth criste in the gospel.


Dives. I suppose that they neither do well ne teache well: for many of them be
full lewed /


Pauper. yet as long as they be thy souereyns or thy curates thou shaltt obey
to them in all thing reasonable and leful that longs to her office. and do them
worship for there dignite. not for there person but for god. Whose person they
present in messis singing in shrestis hering and in other sacramentis yeuyng
and in gouernynge.


The xviii. chapter.
Dives. I suppose that my liege lord the king bydde me do athynge. and my
master or my souereyn bydde me do the contrary or if my curate bid me do
athing contrary to my bisshoppis byding to whom shall I obey


Pauper. In that cas tou shall obey to thy king that is thy souereyn. and thy
maystyrs souereyn also. and thou shall obey to thy busshop that is thy curatys
prelate and thyn also. if the kings bidding and the busshoppys be not ayens
gods worship And if thy king thy pope: or thy busshope: or any other
souereyn bid the do any thing that thou knowist well that it is aye^s gods
worship and ayens his law thou shall not obey to the^ i^ y^ but to god yt is
there souereyn: and thin also. And therefore says saint peter to the iewis
Obedire oportet mages deo qm^ hoi^bus It bihoueth to obey to god more tha^ to
men: If it be rightful to her^ you rather tha^: god: deem ye. and ye law says
that if oni souereyn bid his suget any thing that is contrary to god: the suget
shall not obey ne do any thing vnrightful and vnonest: ne that should harm ye
comontye for his biddinde if he know well that the biddinge be not leful.i. q^.
iii. no^ semper


Dives. I suppose that the sugette be in dout whether it be gods law or nay.


Pauper. Than shall he obey to his souereyn: and he is excused / but if it be in
such thing yt he is bound to know and to kun As if he bid him any thing yt
is openly ayens gods commandment or ayens the feyth. or aye^s gods law
or law of holy church / that he is bound to know thanne shall not he obey in
any wise to his bdidi^ge.


Dives. Is the suget bound to obey to his souereyn in all thing leful.


Pauper. Seruage and subjection came i^ amongys mankynge for pride and other
sin / But as says a great clerk. seneca.lio.iiio. de beneficiis. This
seruage wentt not into al men ne in all women: But the better parti of man and
woman that is the soul is out takyn from such seruage and only ma^nis body
and womans is bound to seruage of tenmporall lords and of there souereyn. and
mannys soul and woman's is fre so that he may have his thought his love. his
will inward as him like. With out leave of his souereyn / And thereby he
offe^deth not his souereyn ne pleseth* but only god yt knowth suerly mannys
heart / But only in the dedis of ye body the suget is bound to obei his
souereyn.


Dives. In which dedys?


Pauper. In such as long to rewle and governance and in such things as he
has made him suget into his souereyn: in such the suget owthe to obey to his
souereyn / As knight in arms is bound to obey his chefteyn and his leder in
things that long to arms / The bond man to his lord i^ doing seruyle works
in duty of his bondage: the son to his fader: in thing that longs to good
norture and rewle of his household: the wif to her husbo^d: i^ thing yt long to
matrimony and social living / not in works of vileyn siruage / And if the wif
obey more than she is bound to. And do more dedis of lowness i^ plesaunce of
her husbonde than she is bound to: she is more to praise. and the more he owth
to love her and have her in worship as his own flesh / And if she do it for
gods sake: god shall be her mede thowe her husbound be full unkind. But in
things that long to the king of mannis body: man ne woman is not suget to his
lord ne to his souereyn temporal. but only to god / For all men in things that
long to kind of body be even: as i^ substance of the body: in bringing forth
of children / And therefore the servant may wedde without leave of his lord.
and the son without leave of his fader / And the servant may keep him chaste
without leave of his lord and a yens his bidding. and the son a yens tie
byddyng of his fader and wedde a yens his bidding and if him like. Netheles it
is good that young folk in such things follow the counseile of fader and mother
and of there friends: but if there counseile be to let the^ from god / For this
skill also husbond and wif as ayens using of there body be even and each of the^
has power over others body.


The xix. chapter.
Dives. Is the people bound to obey to the Pope to there busshop to there curate
in all thingis what they will bid them do?


Pauper. In all thing that longs to keeping of feythe and of gods law: and
fleing from vicys to which thingis they bound them in there baptem: they be
bound to obey / And in all thi^gis of the which the governance longs to men
of holy church by common law grounded in gods law to govern the people not
i^ other things that long not too men of holy church: ne in there preceptis
not grounded in gods law / And i^ the same manner clerks be bound to obey to
there prelates in thinyes that long to there office grounded in gods law and
religious to there prelates i^ things that long to keeping of religion /


Dives. I suppose yt lordship or prelaci be occupied unrightfully by might and
falsnesse. by symonye gyle and treso^ be there sugettis bound for to obey to
them?


Pauper. If they obey to them in thingis leful it is medeful / Netheles some
clerkis sai that such cas men be not bound to obey: but for to fle slander
and the more desese. Petrus in scrip. super ii. sent. d. vt. and sm^.
confess.lio iii. tio. xxxiii. q^. v. But for as much as god yeuethe often times
the realms and ye lordshippis of this world: and prelacye also not by mannys
law ne ma^nys dome. but by his own preuy dome and he is souerayn might lord
of lords and king of ki^gges therefore it is most sure to obei to such lords
and souereyns as long as god sufferith them For god yeueth lordship and
prelaci in this world: both to good and wicked / And therefore as we find in
danielys prophicie: god made nabugodonosor the wicked tyrant king and lord
of the great part of this world: And after for his pride he took his kingdom
fro him: and made hi^ in wit like a best. that he wend to have be a best
half lion half ox. and so he went on all four and fed him amongis bestes
i^ the forest seven monethis till he knew yt god was pri^cypal lord of every
ki^gdome and yt he yeuethe ki^gdom lordshyp to whom yt he will danielys.iiiio.c.
And therefore god said to sedechye that was king of gods people: and to other
kings in the cuntre beside I made earth man and best upon earth in my great
might: and I have youen the lordship to hi^ that me lyketh / And I have youen
al these lands and kingdoms here a boute to nabugodonosor my servant king of
babiloyn: and al nacyons chulen serve hi^ and his son and his sons son /
and what nation or kingdom will not serve him ne obey him: I shall distroy ye
nation by swerd hu^gre and moreyn and who so will serve hi^ and obey to hi^ I
shall late him dwell still in his own land / And therefore serve ye him mekely
and obey ye to him and ye shall live and fare well. jeremy. xxvii.c. And crist
in the gospel said. Reddite que sunt cesaris cesari: et que sunt dei deo.
yield ye to the emperor of Rome: that is the emperors and yield ye to god
that is gods / And yet the emperor of rome had no right to ye lordship that
he occupied: but only by the yeft of god and by swerd


Dives. I suppose that the busshop bid a pressed curs a man which man the pressed
holds vngilti and the multitude of the people also.


Pauper. Either the busshop bids the breast denounce him a cursed. or he
bideth him a curse him / If he bid the priest denounce him acursed in the
busshoppis name. if he may not well put it of / But he shall by wey of charity
excuse that man i^ as much as he knowth him unguilty. And also excuse the
busshop: saying that he is mys informed: and if he had konwe the truth: he
would not have cursed him / And he shall counsel that man to suffer it lowly for
help of his soul And he shall enfourme the busshop as soon as he may of that
mannys vngyltynes / But if the busshop bid the priest acurse hi^ the pressed
most take heed whether his vngiltyede is openly known or is i^ doubt: or it
is certain but not openly known / If his vngyltyede be openly known: the
pressed shall alegge to ye busshop that he is unguilty and prove it by witness And
if he fail i^ his proof he shall obey to the busshoppis bidding thowe he know
that the man is unguilty / And if he may preue him unguilty: he shall not curse
him. thou the busshop bid him never so fersly If it be i^ dout whether he is
gilty or nay: Tha^ the pressed shall obey to the busshoppys bidding. Sm^. conf.

Dives. When the officerys of the king know well that a man or woman is
dampened to the death vngyltly: shall they obey to the judge that bydde themsle
man or woman without gylt?


Pauper. If the officer be seker yt he is unguilty: he shall not sle him: but he
shall obey to god that bids him sle no man ne woman unguilty / But if he be
i^ doubt whether he is gilty or unguilty: thanne he shall obey to the judge and do
his biddind / And he is excused by his obediens. Kay. li. ti. ix. de iuramento
and periurio. C.xiiii. quid de iudice. Netheles ye sugettis most beware in
such doutis. yt they p^sume not to much of there own wit / For full often a man
weneth to know a thing and be in certain of his knowinge and yet he is
deseyued: and it is not as he weneth / And it is fulperelous to the suget to
repugne the dome of his souereyn: and to rep^ue ye wit and the sete^ce of many
wise men / And therefore I counseyle the sugettis and the offyiceris i^ such
things to stond to ye consiens and the ordinance of there souereyns and obey
with sorrow of heart having pety of ma^nis death and of his disese and no
lyking in cruelte And therefore god bad in holy writ: yt men should follow the
sentence of there iugis and do there bydding And who so would not obey them. he
should be slain. deuto. xvio.c. The kings justice representhe the kings
person in fulhighe degree / And therefore men most be more adred to withstond
his sentence and his dome / For his dome is cleped gods dome: and as solomon
says / Sicut diuisiones aquarum it a cor eius in manu dn^i. etc. As the watris
says he may lightly be deperted and drawn in diverse perties: so is the heart
of the king and of iuges: and rewlers in the hand of our lord / He shall
incline it wheder he will / For the dome that semethe unright / full to mannys
wit: is rightful in gods sight / And thowe the dome be rightful in goddis
sight and thowe the man be worthi to dye. if ye judge wene that it be vnrightful
and he yeueth the sentence wenynge sekerly / that it be vnrightful: he senneth
dedly. thou his sentence be rightful / For as saint poule says All that is not
done of feyth and of good consience it is sin / If the man be gilty: the law
and his mysdedis slay him / If he be vngyltly slain by falls dome of the judge
or ^i a false queste or by them y^ myse informed the queste they sle him and
not the officerys. but if he do it wetingly a yens the worship of god: when
the falshede of the dome is openly known. or if he do it with liking in
crueltye.


Dives. Is the religious man or woman bound to obey his prelate: when he
byddeth him to any thing ayens his rewle


Pauper. In all thing that longethe to very observance of his rewle or is
nedeful to good and true keeping of the rewle: he is bound to obey. but he
have reasonable excusacion / In other thyngys that be i^pertinent to the rewle
and to his profession or contrary to the rewle: he is not bound to obey / For
if he were bound to al such byndyngis: his year of nouycere should serve of
naught. For his prelate might so agregge the hardness of living in religion in
double more than he made his profession to. and bind him to more penance
without comparison than ever he thought to bind him to: and put hi^ i^ another
manner living. that he made never his profession to: ne know in the year of his
assaye i^ his nouycery / And by the law every vow is set in some certain /
But if the religious were bound to obey in all thing: his profession were al
uncertain and unassayed in his nouycery / Netheles it is a great perfection to
obey in all thingys leful after ye man or woman may do saving his rewle and
gods worship And if his prelate bid him do any thing ayens his rewle: he
most take heed whether his prelate may dispens with ye point of rewle or nay /
If he know well yt he may dispe^s with yt: he owth to obey his biddi^g. But if
he know well yt he may not dispens with ye poi^t of the rewle: he shall not obei
to him i^ that: and he shall also obey if he be in doubt whether he may dispense
or not


Dives. Tell me some exaumple


Pauper. In fasting in waking: in silence keeping / and in diverse obserua^ce
of religion: the prelate may dispense and i^ cas he owth to dispens ayens his
sugettis will: when he seethe that his sugett may not keep such poyntis of his
rewle with out undoing of him silfe or without hinderinge of other thingis
that be more to gods worship And often times the sugettis will do more than
they may do: and put them to more than they may perform / And than there
prelate as a good fader ouwthe to take heed thereto: and for saluaco^n of his
suget dispe^ce with him and put hi^ i^ discrete gou^na^ce for salvation of the
person. and for ye worship of god / And the sugette owth to obey his biddyng
and sto^d to his ordinance: with good conciens / In some things the prelate
may not dispense: as in the princiapal poi^tis of every religion. that is to
live in obeidence: in pouerte and i^ chastity / And many other thingis ben
exempt by lawis of religion in which ye prelate may not dispense / And therefore
if the prelate bid the suget do any thing that is ayens ye three principal
pointis of his rewle or a yens such thingis i^ which he may not dispense: his
sugett owth not to obey his biddynge

Dives. If the busshop bid a clerk give his book to his nece or neuewe or
resign his church / and his benefice that ye busshope may give it to his nece
or neue we: or to some of his kyn: is that clerk bound to obey ye bidding of
the busshop:


Pauper. Nay forsooth / For it longs not to the busshop to bid such things
/ Netheles if the clerk have good books and is unable to profit in book / and
the busshop bid him lene the book to a another clerk that is able to profit
in book and to help holy church: he is bound to obey / If he gate tho books
of holy church godis or by cause of holy church: as if it were youyn or

is not bound to obey that biddyng

in that she obeyth to god which bids her obey to his husbond / And so in yt

vow xxxiii. q. v. no suit More over leave fre^d ye shall understand that as
says saint bernard i^ epla^ ade mdch. Su^me things be puerly good of the
silfe: and to such we be bound by gods law. as ten co^mau^dme^tys / Su^me
be full wicked of the silf / and tho we be bound to fle by gods law
wythouten any bydding of any souereyn under god / And therefore in such things
stondeth not properly the virtue ne mede of obedience to man or woman / Other
things there be that may be good and they may be wicked. and well do and evil
do. and i^ such things stondethe properly obedience: yt men owe to there
souereyns: For in such we should stand to there will and to there wit more than
to our own / For in such stondeth properly the virtue of obedience: yt we owe
to man for gods sake And the hatder that the precepte be: if it stond with
reason: the more medeful is the obedience / For the more yt man or woman
forsakes his own will for gods sake the more is his lowness. and the more
is his mede.

ALso leave friend by this commandment we be bon^d to worship holy angels and
saints in heaven: for they be our faders in age in worship in cure and i^
keeping of us / For they longen after us that there noumbre and there cumpany
that was lessed by the pride of lucifer might be restored again by salvation of
us. And therefore night and day they prayen for us to god for help and grace
nedful to us. Of these faders spekethe saint poule in his piste: and says thus
I knele and pray for you night and day ye fader of our lord Jesus criste of
whom is named al manner of faderhede in heaven and in earth Exquo omi^s paternitas
nominar^ i^ celo et in terra. ad ephesians. iiio.c. For as the gloss says there
disposicion the angels be our faders in heaven ordained for us and in earth
p^latis be our faders having cure and keeping of us / And so both prelatis in
earth and angels in heaven ben our faders / And therefore as say al these
clerks Each man and woman has two angels assignyd to him of god oon another
of the fend / For ye fend sathanas at gods sufferau^ce assigns to him a
wicked aungel to tempte him and to lose him / But god of his goodness assigns
him a good aungel to save him and to keep him / Of which good aungel criste
says in the gospel. that they se alwey the face of the fader in heaven: for
they be alweye in his presence and speak for us and pray for us. And therefore
says saint ierom up on the same word of criste ye angels bear our prayer
and our good dedis into heaven and keep and defend us ayens the malice and the
sleyght of the fend And therefore the au^gel raphael wha^ne he had led the
son of tobie in to fer cuntre and sauid him from many perelys and brought him
again in great wealth: he said to thobie / when thou preydyste with bitter
terys and beriediste the deed bodies and leftest thy mete and haddeste deed
bodies by day in thyn house and be^ieiste them by night for gods sake ayens
the will of the wicked king senacherib: Thanne offered I thy p^ier to our lord
god. tobie. iiiio.c. Also we read i^ the fourth book of kings the vi. chapter.
That ye propheete helesiee was suddenly by night byseged in the cetye of dothaym
with the ost of the king of sirie In the morrow the servant of helisee saw
the oste about the cety and he was full sorry: and said to his master helisee
Alas alas alas what shall we do: we be so byseged with our enemies that we may
not escape Than heu^se said to hi^ Dread ye not For we have more folk with us
thanne they have with the^ Thanne helisee prayde to god yt he would open the
iyen of that seruant-that he might se what help helisee had with him / And
anon he saw the hillys about helise full of horse and charettys bre^nyng as
fire and a great people arrayed to bateil that was the ost of aungeles sent of
god in to keeping of helyse through whose help the prophet helise led al ye
oste that byseged him into the cety of samarie amongys all there enemies / For
they were so blentt that they wist not whether they went / They come to take
helise and helisee took them with help of angels: and did with the^ what he
would / And therefore david says. Monte in circuitu ^ius et dn^s in circuitu
ppli^ sui. The hyllys: that is to say angels be about the good man and the
good woman to keep the^ / and god is about his people to save them And therefore
saint Ceci^le said to her husbonde valerian / I have gods aungel that louethe
me fulwel and keeps my body with great cheerte that no man shall defoule me /
And if thou will by foul love defoule me: he shall sle the / And if thou love
me with clean love and will keep my maidenhode hool and clean* he shall love the
as well as me / And wha^ne thou art cristened: thou shall se him / Anon her
husbond valerian by her counsel went and was cristened of the busshop saint
urban. And when he was cristened he came again and fond saint cecily prai^g i^
closet: and the au^gel sto^di^g bisidys her with wingis and feathers fulbright
and his faceshon and glymered as the flame of fire He hade in either hand a
garlonde made of rosys and lelyes full fair and fressh and fulswete i^ smelling
/ He yaue unto saint cecile one another to valerian and bad them keep them in
clennes both of bodi and of soul / For why said he. I have brought them out
of paradise / And ye shall know by this token / For they shall alwey be grene
and fresshe and neither welke ne fade: ne lose there sweet sauore-and no man ne
woman may se them: but they that love clennesse and chastyte: as ye do we read
also in the life of saint agnes yt wha^ne she was but threttene year of age:
suffered death for the love of god: and for the love of chastity. for the would
not assent to be wedded to the great lords son of rome: for he was hethen /
And also for she would keep her maydenhode to crist / She was made naked and
led to the bordel house: to be defouled of synful wretchis / But suddenly her
here wey so much: that it hilled and hid al her body / And wha^ne she came
to the bordell house her good aungel was ready: and brought her a clothe as
white as snow full mete to her body: and bylapped her with so great light that
there might no man look upon her: ne no man durst entreye place / Thanne the
lordis son as fool hardy ran into that light for to defoule her / And anon
the fend whom he would have served him: slough him / But saint agnes with her
prayer to god and help of her good au^gel raised him from death to life. to
shame and shenship of al hethen people / For anon he went out of that house and
cried openly that there was no god but crist: and despised her mawme^tys and
there falls believe Also when saint agace was beryed her aungel in the liknesse
of a young man clothed in cloth of silk with an hundred young men al clothed
in white: that were angels also or else holy soulys: came to the beriyng and
said astone of marble upon her grave with a writing of great confort to all the
contre: and went not thens till all the beriynge was do and never after was se
any of all that cumpany / Also the good au^gel brake the whelis that should have
slain saint kateryne And wha^ne she was deed for gods sake the angels took
her body and bare it i^ the earth into ye mou^te of synai and there beried it
worship fully / And therefore leave friend I pray you yt ye have saints in heaven
and holy angels i^ reuernece and devotion: for they be to us fader and mother
as I said first worship ye our ladi mother and maid above al: next after god
and thanne other saints both man and woman and holy angels: as god yeuethe
you grace. Whorship ye them: not as god but as our tuters defondours and
kepers and our leders and gouernouris under god and menis between us and god
that is fader of al and soueren judge to que me him and to pray for us to get
us grace to do well and foryeuenes of our mysdede And therefore david says Pro
hac. id est pro missione pcci^ orabit ad te oim^s scu^s in tempore oportuno /
Every saint shall pray to the lord in byhoful time for mercy and foryeuenesse
of sine / And leave friend p^y ye hertely to your aungel as to him yt is next
you and has most cure of you and is most besy to save you under god And if
ye will follow his governance and trust i^ him i^ al goodness and with reverence
and cle^nes p^y ye hi^ faitfully pleine you to hi^ and speak ye to hi^ homely
to be your help as he is your tuter and keeper assigned of god and say ye often
that holy prayer / Angele qui meus es etc.

The xxiiii. chapter /
Dives. Thy speech pleseth me well and thy wordis be good and devout: but I
pray the say forth of this commandment if thou can more.


Pauper. Also by this commandment men of holy church be bound to worship there
patrones / For the patron of the church is fader of ye church and of the
benefice i^ that that he begynnethe it of naught xvi. q^. vii.. pia in glosa.


Dives. For which thingys is a man cleped patron.


Pauper. For three things / For fundacion that is yeuyng of ground: for the
first dotacion: and for making of ye first church. Patronum faciu^t dos
edificacio fundus.


Dives. What worship owe men of holy church to do to there patrones: and what
right longs to ye patron


Pauper. It longs to him for to present a person able and give the church
and the benefice by wey of alms to whom he thenketh able by assent of ye
busshop Also it longs to hi^ to mainten ye church and to keep it fro
dilapidacion and from destrucco^n and from al manner wrongys as a good fader and
a good tutoure and as a true aduoket to keep and defend the church and the
mynystrys of the church from al wrongis and disesys up on his power / And if
he find person veker or curate or any other clerk or prelate mysusynge the
benefice i^ which he is patroun: he owthe to amend them in fair manner if he
may And if he may not be owth to tell the busshop thereof: or sum of his
officeris. to whom longethe the correction of such defautys: And if the busshop
do not his devour ne his officeris: he shall tell it to the archebusshop And but
he do his devour he shall tell it to ye king: xvi. q^. vii. filiis And therefore
men of holy church that be auau^ced by there patrouns most nedely do there
patrou^s worship and have them in reverence by weye of kyndnesse: and for need
of help to be mayntened in there right / And also for dread of there offens /
For if they misbere them there patrou^s may depryue them of there benefice by
assentt of the busshop: and in case ayens the busshoppis will / Also it longs
to men of holy churh to sustain there patru^s and there chidren when they
fall to need / And if they be taken prisoners to help to pai there ransom.
xvi. q^.viio q^cu^que Ex. lio iiio. de iure patronatus.c. nobis fuit Et xii. q^
i. aplicos etc. sacrorum. et ibidem q^.ii. aureu^. And it longethe to men of
holy church to do there patrones worship i^ sittinge in goinge: and put them by
fore in sitting in goinge xvi. q^. vii. pia mentis / And it lo^geth to ye
patron to have ye pri^cipal place and sytt principaly i^ his church. Tabula
iuris: dicci one patronatus / And for worship of the patron: and his ese the
priest may singe two messys i^ one day Extra. lio.iiio de celebraco^e missarum
co^suluisti And when the patron presentethe a person to the busshop: which
person he will auaunce: the busshop is bound to reseyue that person: but if
he be proved and know for a wicked man and unable xvi. q^. vii. monasteriu^ /
Also the patron may in his fundacion before the halowyng of the church reserve
to him a certain rent by year by assent of ye busshop to reseyue it of the
church. Ex. de iure pato. t. p^tea. Et hostiensis i^ sm^ sua lio. in. c. tio.
Also if a p^late be chosin in a church collegiat: as in an abbey piory
chauntry: he shall by the law be p^sented to the patron: or that he be
confermed and if he be unable: he may and owth to withstond the confirmacion.
Ex. de iure patronatus. co. nobis fuit and xvi. q^. vii. filiis. Also he may
in his fundacion of the church collegiat reserve to him to be in the elleccion
of the p^late of the church with assent of the busshop or of the pope by the
same law: but he most show that written wha^ne he will use it / Hostiensis
lio.iiio. Ru. de iure paro^a^tus / Et tabula iuris diccione pro^natus Et extra
de iuro patronato nobis fuit in glosa


Dives. Patrou^s find full often there auau^ces full unkind to them and full proud
/ And therefore many a patroun may say Filios exaltaui et enutriui: ipsi aute^
spreuerunt me. ysaie. io.co: I have auaunsed children and brought them up of
naught and they have despiced me.


Pauper. Such unkind men of holy church but they amend the^ they shall have
gods curse: that he yaue to al such in the same chapter. Ve genti
peccatrici pplo^ graui iniqtate: semini neqm^ filiis sceleratis / woo be to the
synful people heavy through wickedness. to ye wicked sede. to the unkind synful
children.


Dives. If a church be destroyed: and a man do it make again of his cost: shall
that man be cleped patroun of the church


Pauper. ye thowe he do make it again of the same matter that it was made of by
fore / And the patron that was before patron only by making of the church or
yeuyng of the ground leseth his right of the patronage But if he were patron
by dotaco^n he leseth not his right of patronage. In tabula iuris patronatus.
If the patron vary in his representacion presenting first one and sithe
another: it stondeth in the dome and the will of the busshop to reseyue which he
will / Thowe the patron of laife present a person unable: he leseth not his
right of representacion ne owth to lose it But if a college present a person
unable: in that he lesethe his right of presentacion for that time / And if a
clarke present apersone unable he is worthy to lose his right of presentacion
for ye time. Extra de eleccione. cu^ i^ cu^ctis / The patron of ye laife may
abide but four monethis of his presentacion / The college and the clerk
patron may abide six monethis: and if they pass there time by retcheleshede or
by bryge: the busshop shall ordeyn for ye church and benefice / No man owthe to
present himsilfe / The patron may lefully present his son: his neuewe. and
any of his kyn: if they be able and power: And if apatron be pore and nedi the
busshop may give him that benefice in which he is patron: and he may take it
of his yeft: so that yefte come only of the busshopys free will: with out any
procuringe of hymsylfe: Hostiensis lio.iiio de iure patronatus.


The xxv. chapter.
Dives. I tha^k ye for thou have told me more of this commandment than ever I
hard before / But yet me meruelethe much why ye god bids not me^ do
almesdede to strau^gerys and to other folk at need i^ non of al ye ten
co^maundementys / For but men be bound thereto by gods commandment: I hold
it no dedly sin to leave it: Ne men should not be dampened for they deed it not


Pauper. By this commandment pri^cipaly we be bound to help all nedy folk
upon our power / For by this precepte we be bound to show pety to al me^


Dives. Contra God speaks in this co^mau^dme^t only of worship yt lo^geth to
fader and mother


Pauper. That worship stondethe in two thingys: i^ affection of heart
thenki^ge: and in deed doing / By affecto^n of heart we should love al men and
weme^ with dread to offend them vnskilfuly By deed doing we should do al men
reverence after there degree: and help them in need as we would be help our
silfe: And therefore saint peter bids us worship al men / And saint poul
bids yt each man and woma^n should put other before i^ worship for each man
owth to hold with other his fader i^ su^ degree.


The xxvi. chapter:
Dives. Why so?


Pauper. For each man passith other i^ some degree of worship / and in that he is
his fader / Or in being or i^ wisdom: or i^ goodness / In being we have many
faders / For su^me be faders of our first being as our bodily faders and
moders: yt us bigate / Su^me be faders in well being: and that in two manners:
for su^me gostly su^me bodily / In well being gostly: be our faders p^lates of
holy church and all that have cure of our soulys. In well being bodily be our
faders all that have cure and governance of our body and of our living in
this world as kings princes: lords and such other: Also all that be elder in
age and had there being before us: be our faders / Faders in wisdom be
prechours techers: men of law clerkys and men of age: which by long
experience know more tha^ there younger / Faders in goodness be al holy men: and
all that pass us in goodness / And for that each man owth to deem other: better
than himsilfe: therefore each man owe to worship other as fader in goodness: but
if open malice make him like a best and noman. And therefore saint poule says
Superiores sibi i^uice^ arbitrantes Every man and woman deem other his souereyn
in goodness. Ad philip^.iio.c. / For as the gloss says there: Thowe we seem
soueren to other by some goodness and dignyte that is in us openly known: yet
there may be su^ goodness preuely in a another of lower degree: in which goodness
he is our souereyn in gods syghto. /


Dives. Why is this commandment youen with a biheste of health and welfare
more than any of the other co^mau^deme^tis / For he says thus: worship thy
fader and mother: that thou may live long upon earth and fare well in the land
that thy lord god shall give the. Deuto. vi.c.


Pauper. For sithe god hoteth so great mede for keeping of this p^cept: that is
most natural: and whereto man and woman is most inclined biwey of kind: he
shewthe well that men should have much mede for kepi^g of other p^ceptis that be
not so natural / And by the mede assygned for kepi^g: god shows well what
peine man and woman shall have for the breking: yt is to say short life upon
earth. and evil fare: both here and in land of death: and after lose the land of
life without end and wend to the land of woo and of derkenes / Terra^ misery
et tenebrarum. And for that this p^cepte is principal of the secunde table and
in manner includes al six following. therefore to this commandment he knitteth
the mede for the keeping of al: and pain for breki^g of al For after he hoteth
many diverse medys to them yt keep his hestys: and many myscheues to them that
break the^ / And al they be co^p^hended i^ this short bihest knit to this
commandment For the biheste is most convenient to this commandment / For
as saint poule says: ruth pety and almesdede is good for all thi^gys and has
his mede both in this world and also i^ the the other world that is coming


Dives. Show me that.


Pauper. For it is good reason that they live long: whyth maynteyn well them
that be beginnynge of there life: that is fader and mother / For when the rote
of the tree faylethe by defaute of the tree above thanne ye tree shall sone fail
and sere up. And it is not worthy that he live long ne farewell that worshipeth
not them ne help them: by who^ he lives: and has his life and his welfare /
And he that worshipeth not the beginning of his his being: is worthisone to
lose his being / And he that helps other with his good to live long good
life: is worthy to have good and good life.


The xxvii. chapter:
Also leave friend ye shall understand yt god says these wordys not only to
every person by himsilfe: but he said the^ to all the people and to every people
as to one person not only for worshipping of there fleshly fader and mother: but
also for worshipping of there souereyins i^ there degree as I said before / For why
as long as any people is buxu^ and meke to there souereyns: and will follow her
good governance. and worship men after there degree: and every man be paid with
his own degree and do the dute of his degree: so long the people is able to keep
yt land that god has youen them to live go de life / But when they will
rebelle ayens there souereins and will not stond to there ordinance but every man
will be his own man: and follow his own fantasies: despice his souerei^s there
dome and governance: ne give no tale of goddis law ne of londis law ne of
holy chyrchys law: ne have men of v^tue and of dignyte i^ worship: but for
pride have the^ in despite and be besi to worship the^silfe i^ hindering of
other that people is able to the sword: and able to lose his land / For as ye
se at the iye i^ time of tempest: thou the bowys of the tree beat the^silfe
togydre and altobrest and full down as long as ye rote of ye tree keeps him
fast in his place and ryseth not: so long ye tree shall not fall But wha^ the rote
begin to rise out of his place: anon the tree begin to fall / Right thus it
fares by ye people of a land / Thou tempest of pride of couetise: of envy: of
lechery fall su^time i^ the croppe of the tree: yt is to say a mongis lords and
souereins and the great me^. if the pore people yt is rote of the tree and of all the comonte keep the^ still i^ lownes: and do mekely there dwte to god kepi^ge
his co^mau^deme^tys and the good preceptys of there souereins: so long is hope
yt ye people shall fare well after ye te^peste and not be destroyed / But if they
rise ayens god by customable dedly sins: and ayens there worldly souereins:
and will entermete them of every cause of that land and of holy church: and
termine eu^y cause by there wit body and crop of ye tree shall fall / For it is
not possible that the rote should be so high as the crop of the tree: but the
tree fell Ne yt the foot should be above the head: but the body fell

Dives. This is full soth we se it at ye iye For p^de and rebellion of ye pore
people is cause of destrucco^n of this lo^d / For sithe they aresen ayens there
souerei^s: was there never stabilite i^ this lo^d: but alwey syth^e ye tree of
ye people of this lo^d and the realm: has stond in falling


Pauper. Vnbuxu^nesse and pride was principal cause of lesing of londys and of
realmys / And pri^cipaly the cause of salvation of realms londys and comontees
is obedience and buxu^nesse: yt each man in his degree obey to his souereyn and
worship hi^ as fader / and therefore leave friend I pray you for gods sake that
ye worship al your faders and moders: in there degree: as I have said And have
ye old folk and feeble i^ worship: while ye be in young age: and worship ye the
age that ye draw to and have no scorn of the old folk for feebleness and
uncleanness that ye se them in / But thenk ye that such shall ye be if ye abide
there age: feeble vnourne and loath to the sight / For such as ye be now: such
were they su^time It fares by age of man and woman as it does by a precious
stone yt is cleped crisolitus / This stone as says the master of ki^des i^
the beginning of the day it shyneth bright as any gold / But as the day passes
so passes his brightness / And the nyer even the more it fades: so that by
even it is like a clot of earth / Thus it fares by man and woman in this world
/ For in there youth and i^ there beginning they be fair: read and rody and
fresshe as rose in may: full lusty to the iye But as youth passes so passes
there bewte / And as they old: so they fade: till at the last the day of there
life comes to an end / And than be theye but a clott of earth full vnourne and
ghastly to the sight


Here ends the fourth p^ceptt and here begynnethe the fifth precept.
The first chapter.
Dives. As me thenketh: thou haste informed me well in these iiii.
co^mau^dementis Now I pray the for charity yt thou wolt enfourme me: in the
fifte


Pauper. The fifth commandment is this Non occides that is to say. Thou shall
nou slay In which precept god forbedth us al manner manslaughter unlawful both
bodily and gostly / He biddethe us yt we slay no man ne woman unrightfully
ayens the law. neither with heart co^se^ti^g to his death: neither by wrath
and hate For as says saint john Qui odit fre^m suu^ homicida est / He yt
hates his brother is a mansteer: For of wrath and hate comes ma^slaughter /
Also by this p^cepte he forbyddeth beting fighting and mayni^g p^sonyng
banisshi^g outlawinge / For these and such other be a manner of death and
despose to dethward / and therefore it should not be do to ma^ne to woman without
great gylt / Also he forbiddethe yt we sle no man ne woman with our tunge:
him hyndering and procuringe his death: ne favor yeuynge: ne false witness
beringe: ne lesynges making: ne by diffamyng ne bacbityng For bacbyters and
wicked spekers. be manquellers. And therefore solomon says: that much folk
has fall by the sword: but not so many as have be slain by the tunge. Eccle.
xxviiio.c. And therefore he says prouer.xviiio.c. That life and death be i^ ye
ho^dis of the tu^g yt is to say in the might of ye tu^g For by hondis i^ holy
writ is understand might and power And therefore david says Li^gua eoru^
gladius acutus. The tunge of the iewis and of other wicked spekers: is a sharp
sword. For the iewys slow criste with there tunges. not with there hondes /
For they procured his death by false witness: and by excili^g of the people /
But paynyms slow him with there hondys and did him on the cross / And yet as
says saint austen the iewys were mo^e gilty of cristys death than pylate that
dampened him to the death: or the knightys that did hi^ on the cross For with
her tunges the iewis slow him: and were cause of his death / And therefore says
the law. that he that sleeth his brother with his hond and he that hatethe his
brother and he yt bacbyteth his brother. al three be mansleers. De pe.di.i.
homicidiarum. The bacbyter sleeth three at onys / He slethe himsilf by his own
malice. and him that hereth him: and him that has lykyng in his false tales
and him that he bacbytethe / For he makes him to lose his good name: and
perauenture his life / He makes him also to lose charity: wha^ he knowth his
wekid spech yt he has said byhind him And so by lesinge of charity he leseth
god that is his life of his soul And therefore the wys man lickenethe the
bacbiter to the adder yt byteth and styngeth in stylnesse Eccle. xo. A shrewyd
adder is the bacbiter that sleth three with oon breath / Therefore solomon says
Keep ye you from bacbytyng of the partid tu^ge For wekid word said in preuy:
shall not pass in vayn and with out woo / For the money says he that lyth
sle the soul. Sap^ / i.c.


The secunde chapter.
Dives. Is flaterynge any gostli ma^slaughter


Pauper. In so much as it slethe the soul both of him that flatereth and of
him that is flatered: i^ so much it is gostly manslaughter.


Dives. Is every flaterynge gostly man slaughtyr and dedly sin?


Pauper. Nay. For flatering is a speech of veyn praysi^g said to man or woman
with intencion to plese them / And that may be do in three manners: as praising
man or woman i^ goodness and in good that he has. Or else praysinge them in
goodness and good yt they have not. Or else praising them in threw idnesse and
falsnesse: of which manner flatering speaks david and says. Qn^i laudatur
peccator in desideriis anime sue et iniquus benedicetur / Forsooth says he ye
sinner is praisid in desiris of his soul: and ye wicked man is blessed of
folys / For when shrewis have forth there will in shrewednesse: thanne the
world praises them and worship them / The first manner of praisynge if it be
do only to plese man and not god: it is sin. and in cas dedly sin / And
therefore saint poule says that if he would only plese man and not god: he were
not cristys servant / But it be do to plese god and for a good end it is
commendable and medful / For in good folk virtue ye is praised wexeth Virtus
laudatur crescit / Butt this manner praysinge is no flatering The secunde manner
of praising if it be do for god and for a good end it is sufferable: and in
cas commendable and medeful / But if be do wetingly: only to plese man and not
god. it is dedly sin. The third manner of praysynge if it be do willing and
wetyng it is dedly sin And therefore david said. Oleum pcco^ris non i^
pinguet caput meu^. Lord god says. let not the oil of ye sinner make fat
my head ye si say. late my heart never have no liking ne joy in false
flateri^g For as saint austen says ye tu^g of ye flaterer do more harm yan
the sword of the enmye pursui^g Therefore solomon says: it is better to be
under nomen of the wise man: than he deseyued by flateri^g of folis. eccle.
viio. This sin of flateringe is so great and grievous ye if any man of holy
church were customable therein: he should be degraded / Also if he were a
traitor or a teller of shrifte. distince. xlvi. clericus / God yeueth curs to
al false flaterers saiinge in this wise. Ve qui consuunt puluillos sub omniu^
cubito manus et faciunt ceruicalia sub capite universe etatis ad capiendu^
ai^as. Who be to them ye sow small soft pelowis under every elbowe. and make
pelowis under the head of every age to take the sowlys of my people / They
^ckened soulys ye were not quik but deep in dedly sin: and so defouled me by
fore my people. For by cause of there slaterynge they youen no tale of me: ne
dreded me: ne worship me / For an handful of barley says be and for a go bet of
bread they slow soulis that were not deed: and they q^ckened soulys that lived
not making lesingys to my people that loved lesingys / And they conforted
sinners in there sin and in there falsnesse: and dyconforted good folk in there
goodness and in there truth. Eze. xiiio.c.


The third chater.
Dives. This vice of flateringe regneth full much in this land For the people is
so ble^t with flaterynge and lesinges: yt they se not the mischef ye they be i^
And therefore they live forth in pride and not low them to god ne pray to god
for help as they should do: if they knew there mischefuousnesse that they be in.


Pauper. Therefore god says Popule meus q te beatum dicu^t ipsi te decipiunt
et viam gressuu^ tuorum dissipant / My people they that se that thou art
blessed and in wealth: they disseyue the and distroy the wey of thy goinge: that
thou might not forth ne have no speed in thy werkys for defawte of grace. ysa.
iiio.c.


Dives. What in understand by the pillouis ye god spekethe of a yens flaterers


Pauper. As saint gregrory suyth. moraliu^.xviiio.c. super illud. job. xviio
Donec deficiam no^re cedam etc. He that preyseth man or woman in his wicked
work he leyth his pyllowe under his elbowe / And he that gladdeth ye heart of
the sinner in his sin he leyth a pelowe under his head For by the head is
understand the heart / For why by such flateringe they rest softly and sleep
i^ there sin and dye gostly with out pain and perseyue not her own death /
And therefore salomo^ says. that he that iustifithe the wicked man and dampneth
the rightful man: both they be abominable to god prouer.xviio.c. Therefore god
lycknethe flaterers to them that playstren and palten wallis and wowys with out
For thing that is foul they make it to seem fair and make folk to have
lyking i^ there sins. Therefore god says that the sinner makes the wall of
sin between him and god. But flaterers playsteren and paynten the wall of
sin. Eze. xiiio:c. Al so flaterers be lickened to an adder that is cleped
dipsa which as the master of kinds says. lio xviiio he is so litel yt thou a
man trede thereon he may not se it But his veni^ is so violent that it sleethe a
man he feel it and he death with out pain / Right to flateringe seems but a
small sin and yet it is full venomous and sleth ma^nys soul or he feel it /
And with out pain brings him to endless pain / Flaterers be lykened to an
adder that is cleped tyrus. Which is leest of al edders: and yet his venym is
not curable as says the master of kind in the same place / Right so
flaterynge seems but a full lytyl sin and yet it is so venomous that it will
not be lightly helyd / For wha^ne man or woman has lykinge in flateringe and
rewlethe his life after flateryng tunge: it is full hard to that man or woman
to be saved / For as long as men preysen him in his sin: so song he is
bold in his sin / And if men begin to lack him: he falls into sorrow
and dispeyre / Therefore saint james says that the tunge is but a lityl membre:
and reyseth up grate desese it is a wickid thing that has no rest full of dedly
venym. iac.iii.c. And the prophet david says. Acuerunt linguas suas sicut
serpents: venenum aspidum subsabiis eorum / They have sharped there tungys as
addris: the vnym of addyrs is under the lyppes of flaterers and wicked spekers
/ And if a man do his dedys only for to be preysed and flatered of the people:
flaterynge is his mede / And when flaterynge ceseth and the wind turnethe a
yens him he has no longer liki^g in good dedys / and so as the gospel says.
for that he seeks thank in preysinge only of man for his good dedys and not
of god: therefore al such be lyckened to the five maidens folys ye would mete
with there husbond criste jesus at the dome with lampis withouten oil / That is
to say with good dedis with out gostli merthe and joy and conscience For they
had no joy in there good dedys: but in preysing and flateringe of the people
/ And therefore criste says in the gospel they have take there mede in this
world and at the dome they shall be shet out of heaven bliss from endless mede
both flaterers and they ye have liking in flaterynge and do there dedys only
for flateryng and preysing of the people / But the five wys maidens as says
the gospel hadden oil i^ there lau^pis that is to say gostly joy and lyki^g i^
there good dedys And therefore they shall be received of there husho^d crist into
the bless with outen end / And as saint austen says in his sermon by oil is
understand both gostly praysyng

and worldly praysynge and myrthe. Gostly preysyng and gostly myrthes is cleped
the oil of the holy gooste / But worldly preysing and worldly merthe is cleped
the oil of sinners / And therefore he says that flaterers selle oil to the
maidens folys that is to say to sinners as often as they flater them and
preyse them in there folly and in there pride for to have mete or drink or money
or worship. or any temporal lucre. and so bring the^ in error and folly and
plese and praise them in there sin / But as david says. Deus dissipauit ossa
eorum qui hominibus placent. God has dystroyed and shall distroye ye bonys of
them that plese men in dyspite of god and disseyue men and Women by flateringe
/ wicked tunges do much harm and sle many souls but the flateri^g tunge is
worste of al / And therefore the wise man says. Susurro et bilignis erit
maledictus a deo Ecle.xxviii. The musterer and the double tungedman shall be
accursed of god. For be troubles much folk that have pes The third thunge
says he has stired and moved much people out of pees and disparlid them
fronacion into nation.


The fourth chapter.
Dives: What is susurro and yt is cleped a musterer


Pauper. It is a preuey towner: that pryuely tells false tales a mongis the
people for to make discencion and debate a mongis the people: and tell tales
preuely which / he dare not tell openly ne may not a vow them / Of which folk
saint poule says Susurrones detractores deo odibiles. Ad ro^. i.c. Such
musterers and bacbyters god hates them / For susurro is a preuy bacbiter and a
preuy liar that makes debate among friends / And as the wise man says. God
hates al tho y^ sown discord a mongis brethren and friends. prouer.vi.c. And
as he says in a another place. such preuy musterers defoule there soul. and
they shall be hated of ol both of god and of all the court of heaven Eccle. xxi.
And therefore god says. Non eris susurro nec criminator in populis. Thou shall
be no musterer a mo^gis the people to let love and pees: ne thou shall be no
tale teller ne blabbe to defame man or woman falsely or any sin that is preui
Leuitici. xix.c. Soche preuy musterers and bacbyters make discencion and
heuinesse in every comonte. in every household in every cumpany / And therefore
when they be know for such they should be put out of cumpany: or else
chastised / For the wise man says wha^ne the wode is withdraw: the fire
abateth and is quenched. Right so says he withdraw such preuy musterers and
bacbiters: and put them out of cumpany: and chidinge and debate shall cese.
Prouer. xxvi.c.


Dives What ie bilignis that thou clepest a double tu^ged man


Pauper. Biliguis and ye double tu^ged man is he that say the one with his
mouwthe: and thenketh another in his heart: and he that sphekethe good before a
man: and bihynde him he speaks him evil: he that says a truth one time: and
another time he forsakethe it he that is unstable in speech: and now says
one and now another / Of such god speaks and says. Os bili^gue detestor.
prouerbiorum. iiio.c. Iwlate and loathe the mouth yt is double tunged.


Dives. What clepethe the wise man the third tunge that does so much woo.


Pauper. The third tunge is ye flaterynge tunge: which is the worste of all /
For every flaterer that flatereth man or woman in his sin: he is a flaterer
he is a / bacbiter: he is double tunged: and so he may be cleped in latey^
trilinguis: that is treble tunged in englisshe / The flaterer blyndeth so folk
that he flaterethe: that they take no head to them sylfe ne to god: ne know
not the^silfe and way so proud yt they give no tale of there euencrysten /
Also the flaterer lacks and bacbiteth al tho that he heteth: whom he
flatereth so to plese him: and hi^dereth another mannys name to enhaunse his
name: and so makes discord and discencion Also flaterers be double tu^ged For
as lightly as they preysen man or woman: as lightly they will lack them. if
they fail of there purpose and have no lucre by there flateri^ge as they wend
have had For commonly graete preysers be great lackers: and as much as they
preyse man or woman out of mesure by flateringe: as much they willacke him or
another by bacbytinge / Therefore seneca says: Lauda parce vitupa percius.
Preyse scarsely. but lack more scarsely / For these skyllis solomon says:
that the third tunge has stired much i^to pride: and so made them fall i^
shame and shenship and dysperpled the^ fro nation to nation It has destried
walled towns: and dolue up the housis of great forbis: It has kyt a weye the
might and the virtue of people that were full strong and made them feeble For
flaterers make towns nations and fordes bold to begin werrys: plees and
debate: by which they come to naught / For they be so blent by flatering and
over preysinge: that they know not themsylfe: but wene to ouerlede al men till
at the last they be destroyed themsilfe / Also as the wise man seyth: the
third tung has cast strong women: that is to say good women syker and
virtuous out of there virtue: and priued them and put them from there trauayls
/ For wha^ne a good woman has traueyled much of her life to plese god and to
have a good name: comes a false flaterer in gyle and with flatering words and
fair bihestis of matrimony: or of richessys bryngethe her to sin and does
her to lose her good name and brings her to shame and veleny / And therefore
seythe the wise man in the same place. Eccle. xxviii.c. that who so takes bid
to the flaterynge tunge. that is the third tung: to have lykinge therein: he
shall never have rest / And he shall have no friend in whom he may rest ne
trust / For flaterers be no true frendys: but all blind so men ye they may
not know there frendis ne take heed to the speech of there fre^dys that would say
them the soth and warn them of there harm.


The fifth chapter.
Dives. That many a good woman is deceived: and destroyed by flatering: men
know well / But that flatering destroyed cetyes: lords houses nations and
desperpled them from nation to nation I se not: but I pray the tell some
exaumple:


Pauper. As we find i^ the fourth book of kings and the book of ieremye / For
the children of israel would not here the wordys of ieremye and of other true
prophetys: ne do thereafter: but had lyking in flateringe of falls prophetis
which bihight them wealth and prosperity for to plese the people: therefore was
the cetye of jerusalem destroyed and nigh al ye cetyes and castellys of the
land The hynge sedechie was take and his children slain before him: and after
his iyen were put out / All the lordis and the gentilis of the land either
they were slain: or else led prisoners into babyloyne / The people was sleyn
with hungur moreyn and sword And al tho that were left a live after that the
cetye of jerusalem was taken were desparpled in diverse nations: and slain in
diverse manner: for they trusted alwey in flaterynge of false prophetys: and
slow ieremye and other good prophetys that said them the truth and would have
saved them And I dare say that flateringe of false prophetis and prechours: and
of other spekers that blind the people with plesaunt lesi^ges: ne will not undo
to the^ there wickedness: is pri^cipal cause of destruction of many realmys and
londdes people: and cetyes into this day: as we might se at iye if flateringe
and lesi^ges blent us not


Dives. Men prech these days full well a yens sin.


Pauper Su^me do so: but a yens the great sin that all the land is entriked in
and al cristendome knowth and is open cause of our myschefe ayens that no man
precheth but nighe al be about to mai^ten it.


Dives. Which sine is that


Pauper. Often have I told the: but thou beleueste me not / Go over these: and
there men shall tell it ye if thou axe / we find i^ the third book of kings:
that the king of israel whose name was achab was styred to be sege the cetye of
ramathigalaad and so begi^ne werr^ ayens the king if sirie / This achab sent
after four hundred falls flatering prophetys of his land which were wont to
plese him and to flatere him: and axed them counsel and how he should speed:
They flatered him al and badde him go and fight: and said that he should speed
right well and take the ceti and destroy all the lo^d of sirie / Thanne at the
counseyl of iosephat the king of judah that was come to help him: he sent for
mychee gods prophet to know what he would say / And as he came towardys
the king the masse^gere said to michee ye prophet Al other prophetys with
one mouth tell our lord the king good tidings and say yt he shall speed right
well. I pray the say as theye say / Thanne the prophet answered what my
lord god says to me: that shall I speak to our lord the king And when he
came by fore the king he said to ye king achab. I saw by viso^n all the people of
israel desperpled i^ the hillys and scatered about as sheep without a
shepeherd Anon the king was wrath and said that he told him never good ne
welthe / Thanne the prophet said / Here the word of god. I saw our lord
god sittynge on his sete / and all the often of heaven stondynge bisydys him on
the right side and on the lift side / Thanne said our lord god: who shall
deseyue achab ki^ge of israel to do him go and fight in ramothgalaad and fali^
fight Anon a wicked sprite stood forth: and said I shall desseyue hi^ Than
our lord axed him hou he should disseue him I shall seide he go out and be
aspryte liar in the mouth of al his false prophetys / Thanne our lord god
seide Thou shall deseyue him and thou shall have the maistri of hi^ Go forth
and do as thou haste said / Thanne the king was more wroth: and commanded
hi^ to presone / The king left the counseile of the prophet michee and
followed the counseile of his false prophetis: and went to bateile and was
slain: and his people discoumfyt.


Dives. David speaks much in his book of the gylous tunge: that is cleped in
lateyn. lingua dolosa.


Pauper. The gylous tung is the flateri^g tunge / For commonly every gyle in
spech is meddled with flateri^ge In gilous spech be two thingys sleyght and
flateringe. And therefore gilous spech is lyckened to an anglyng of fysshe / For
in the anglyng be two things: the hoke and the mete on the hoke / The hoke is
the sleyght in spech: the mete on the hoke is flaterynge yt drawth man woman on
to the deuelys hoke Thus adam and eve were desseiued with ye fendes speech: For
slyly he axed Eve why god bad that they should not ete of every tree i^ paradise
/ And wha^ he saw her unstable and douti^g he put thereto the mete of flateri^g
and said: that they should not dye but be as gods kunnynge good and wicked /
And so by flateringe the fend lost all mankind / Figure hereof we have i^
ye secu^d book of kings xx c. where we fi^d ye ioab gitiously slough the noble
prince amasam with a knyfe craftily made lyghtlye to go out of the sheth /
And wha^ he should steke him with the knife he took hi^ by the chyn and said
to to him heyle my brother And for his flaterynge and fair / wordis: amasa tok
no head to the knyfe / And in the same manner when judas betraide crist he
said in flaterynge and gyle Aue rabi Heile thou master.


The sixte chapter.
Dives. Thou have well declared the myschefe of flateringe tunges Say forth what
thou wylt.


Pauper. Also god forbedethe us by this commandment that we slay no man: ne
woman by our bid: him a mys doing or him hurtinge / And so by this
commandment he forbids us wrath: and wretch chiding. despisynge:
smitynge scornynge: and al such means and motyues to manslaughter.


Dives. As thou well saidest god forbyddethe not al manner manslaughter: but only
manslaughter / vnrightful and aye^s the law For god had that men should not
suffer wicked doers live in dysese of the people. Malificos non pacieris
viuere. exo. xxii And also he had that we should slay no man ne woman rightful
and unguilty. Innocentem et iustum no^ occides. exo. xxiii.c. Therefore I prai
the tell me in how many manners a man is slain unrightfully.


Pauper. On three manners First if he be slain without gilt Also if he be slain
with out order and process of law / Also if he be slain without lawful
justice ordained of his liege lord to whom god has youen life and lyme and the
sword to punyssh sherwys: as saint poule shows well in his pystle: Ad
romanos. xiii.c. Also if he be slain by enmite hate and crueltye: for to have
vengeance: not for salvation of the truth and of the people.


The seventh chapter.
Dives. Thy speech is skilful say forth


Pauper. Also if any man or woman dye for defaute of help: Thanne all yt
should have holy them and might have holy them and wyste thereof and would not
help them be gylty of manslaughter / And therefore says the law. Pasce fame
morientem si non passis occidis. did. lxxxvi. pasce. That is to say Feed him
that is i^ point to dye for hungre / If thou will not feed him when thou
might: thou sleeste him / Much more thanne they be mansleers that by
extorcioun: raueyne and o^ledinge by might fraud and gyle rob men of there
good: or wytheholde / men of there good whereby they should live: and bring them
so in thought: sorrow and care and so haste there death Therefore god says that
such manner folk as tyrauntes extorcioners and false men devour his people as
the mete of bread / Deuorant plebem meam sicut escam panis And therefore he
forbids them and says to them / Lystne ye princes and lords: and leders
of the people to you it longethe to know ryghtfulle dome to deem what is good
and what is wicked: what is truth and what is false / Butte now ye hate good
thing and love wicked thing and loathe goodness: And love shrewednesse / By
violence and might ye hilde men and take there sins from them and take there
flesh from the boonys: These ete the flesh of my people and hylde awey there
skinnis fro above them and break there bonys Mychiee. iiio.co. And so al such
be man slears in gods sight. For they haste mannys death by myschefe: and
sorrow and care: that they bring them in


Dives What is vndertonde here by the ski^ne flesse and boonys


Pauper. Three things be nedeful to euy man and woman living hyli^g lyfelode:
and help of friends in feebleness and dissease By the ski^ne ye hyleth and
clothe the flessh is understand: clothinge: houseyng armure: by which man is
hiled and defended fro tempestis: cold and hete and enemies and many desesys /
By flessh is understand mete and drink: whereby the flesh is norisshed / By
the bonys yt bear up the flesse and strenthe the flesh ben understand ma^nys
frendys: which help him at need: and bear him up and strenth him in
febblenesse and disese But these tyrau^tys and extercioners and false folk
take aweye the ski^ne of the pore folk / For they rob them of there housinge
and of there clothi^g And they ete awey there flesh: for they take aweye there
lyflode: whereby there flesh should be sustained / For they pille them so and
make them so pore: that they have neither house ne home: ne clothinge to there
body: ne mete ne drink to live by Also they break there bonys: For they pursue
there friends yt would help them: and put them i^ such dread that theye dare
not help them and often beat them and break there bonys and mayme them Exaumple
of this we have i^ ye third book of kings: where we find that there was a
true man dwelling besidys the paleys of achab that was king of israel: and
the poor man was cleped naboth / And for he would not selle his gardeyn to the
king at his will: the king was wroth / And by false dome and false witness he
did him be stoned to death and so by fraud and manslaughter he escheted to hi^
the pore ma^nis gardeyn / wherefore the king afterward was slain / And the
queen iesabel for she assented: and halpe to the death of the true man: and was
slain also / And houndys ete her flesh: and her boonys and lycked up her
blood in vengeance of the death of naboth / The king was slain in werre /
His wife iesabel was cast out of her soler window and trod to death with
fete of horsys / And other two kings of her aliaunce: and nighe all her
kynred was slain afterward in vengeance of the death of naboth / Achab had
syxty sons and ten living after his death and they were byheded in
vengeance of the death of naboth.iiiio. regum.x.co:


The eight chapter.
ALso they be gylty of manslaughter: that defraude servants of there hyre /
Therefore the wise man says: That he that takethe away from the servant /
his bread and his lyflode: has got in swyncke: and sweet: is as wicked as he
ye sleethe his neyghbore / And he that shedethe mannis blood and he that does
fraud to the hired man be brethern: that is to say they be like in synue: and
worthy in like pain. Qui effundit sanguinem et qui fraudem facit mercenario
sunt fratres. Ecclesiastici. xxxiiiio. And therefore saint James says thus to
the false rich couetouse men Se ye hou the hire of your work men and
laborers that have reped your feldys is defrauded by you: and not paid
criethe to god for vengeance / And the cry of them is entered in to the erys
of the lordis of ostys. Iacobi. quinto capitulo. And the wise man says that
who so offerethe sacryfyce of the pore mannys good: to like him that sleethe
the son in the sight of his fader / And he that defraudethe the poor man of
his good is a mansleer. Homo sanguinis est. Ecclesiastici. xxxiiiio.

Dives. This point of manslaughter touches much men of holy church / For as
the law says: The tithes of holy church be tributes of them that be in
need: / To reuele them in there need And all that men of holy church have: It
is the pore mennys goodys / And there housys should be common to all men at
need. Theye should be besy to reseyue pylgrymys: and keep hospitalite after
there power.xvi. q^. i. decime. etc. qm^ quicquid. Wherefore me thenkethe: if any
pore folk perissh by there defaute and for that they would not help them: they
be gylt of manslaughter.


Pauper. That is sothe And therefore criste said thries to saint petyr. Pasce /
That is to say feed my lambys and my sheep that be yo soulys that criste
bought with his blood / For prelatys and curatys / of holy church most feed
there sugettys by good ensaumple yeunge: and by help at need / And therefore
criste said twies to saint peter: feed my lambis but the third time he said:
feed my sheep / For as long as they be lambis they give neither milk ne wolle.
but when these be waxen shepethey. give both milk and wolle And so criste
in his wordys badde that prelatis and curatys of holy church should have double
cure of the pore people: to feed them gostly and also bodily: with bodily
help at need But they be not bound to feed the rych folk: but goostly: and
the^ that have no need: with holy churchys goodys / And of the pore folk
give they no tale: but to pylle them: and have of them: and get of them what
they may by ipocrisie: by fraud: by dread and violence / And therefore god
vndernymethe them by the prophet ezechiel: and says thus to them / De
pastoribus israel woo be to the shipherdis of israel: that is to say to the
prelatys and curatis of holy church: which should be shepeherdys of goddys
sheep: and of the soulis that criste bought so dear: woo be to the shepeherdys:
ffor they feed theimsylfe and of the pore people give they no tale / ye ete
says he the milk and clothed you with the wolle And that was fatt ye slow
to feed well your womb: But ye feed not my flock of my people: that was
feeble: ye helpyed it not ne conforted not: / And that was sore and syk ye heled
it not. And yt was broke: ye bound it not again that was cast a weye and
fordreuen: ye fetched it not again: ne led it a yen / That was perysshed ye
soght it not: but with feernes and hardness and by power wytheoute petye ye
commanded to them many great things and grievous and reigned amongys them as
emperors / And so my sheep be scatered / For there is no shepeherde: that
yeuethe any tale of them. Ezechielis.xxxiiiio: And in another place he sayethe
thus / woo be to the shepherdys that thus descaterne: and forrende the flock
of my leswe: and of my pasture. Jeremy.xxiiio.co. And therefore god acceptethe
not ye prayer of such me^ of holy church: For they be with out charity and
full of crueltye in pylli^ge of the pore people / And therefore he says to
them. Cum extenderitis manus vestras etc. When ye shall lift up your hondys
to me: I shall turn my iyen aweye fro you: and wha^ne ye should multiplye
prayers to me: I shall not here you: ffor your hondys be full of blood.ysa.i.c.
Upon which wordys thus says the great clerk grosshed.dicto xxiiio. An
unjust scheder of mannis blood has blody hondys: ffor blood shede out is in
the hondys of him that is ye sheder out. as the effeccion of the work is in
the cause: For the hond of the sheder is cause of blood shed / So thanne sith
bodily fode: is cause of blood of mannys body by which his life transitorye is
sustained: he that wythdrawethe sustynaunce fro the poor in myss^efe: he
wythedrawethe from the poor man his blood: whereby his life should be sustained
/ And therefore god says that the blood of the pore folk is in the hondys of
them: in whose ho^ds ye thi^gis be withhold unjustly / By which thyngis or by
the pryse of thoo nedy folk should be sustained / Also all tho that wythholde
pore me^ there good either by violence or by fraud or theft or oni deseyte by
which good the pore folk should live: they have there ho^des defouled with
blood of pore folk. And in that that they fare delycatly with pore mannys
good they ete and drink the blood of the pore folk / And there clothi^g is
defouled with blood of pore folk / And if they housen and bylden with the
pore mannys good they ground there housyng in ye blood of pore men.


The nynthe chapter.
ALso every man and woman and namely men of holy church that draw folk to
sin by mys entysynge or by wicked ensaumple: or by false lore: theye be gylty
of manslaughter gostly / And therefore saint gregori says in his omelie: that
men of holy church be gylty of as many dethys: as they draw soulis to dedly
sin by there wicke exaumple: and there wicked liui^ge And therefore christ
byddethe in the gospel: that there should no man sclaundre the lewed simple
folk / For who so does it: it were better to him that he were cast in the se
with a mylstone about his neck / with word as says ye gloss is specialy
said for me^ of holy church / And therefore saint poule says to al christian
people: and namely to prestys and clerkis. Neponatis offe^diculu^ fri^bus vel
sca^ / balu^: yt is to say as says ye gloss Do no thing yt may be cause of
falsi^ge and perisshi^g of your brethern ne cause of sorrow and heuines Ad
rom^. xiiiio. and therefore the law bydddethe that wha^ne busshops and there
officerys go a boute for to visit: That they should do no tyrauntrye: In
taking of there costys but visyte with charity: and lownes with out pomp of
great array and of great main besi to amend the defautys: and to preche
gods word and to win ma^nis soul. not to rob the folk of there good but
take there costys in esy manner So that they sclau^dre not there brethern ne there
sugettys: ne be not greuouse to them: x. q^. iii. cauend. / All men and namely
men of holy church most besely fle sclaundre: yt they give no man ne woman
occasyon of slaundre ne of sin: butt often time life the harder and absteyne
them fro mani things leful to fle sclau^dre / For as says saint ierom: super
mycheam All that give occasion of sclau^dre be gylty of although that perisshe by
ye sclau^dre.i. q^. i. hii. quosquu^que Et nota pro vitando scandalo in rebus
licitis. ad ro^. xiii. et p. ad little viiio. For these causys god says to men
of holy church by the prophet osee / ye be made snare to me^ lokyng a fer: and
as a net sprede abrede on the hylle of thabor: and ye have bowed down
sacrifices i^ to the depnes: that is to say y^ y^ ought to be ware lokers to
worche well: and warn men of perel of sin: be made a snare and a net in holy
church: that is the hyl of thabor: to take folk in sin and draw them to
folly / And so ye have slain soulis and bowed the^ down into the depnesse of
damp^cion and so made sacrifice to the deuel of the soulys that god took you to
keep. Osee. vo.c. Also men of holy church sle there suget tys gostly that mys
eggyng miscounseyle: and mys enformacyon bring them in dedly sin: and in
eresie or else let them from good dedys that they would do and so slain good
purpose and good will that man or woman is in: and in manner sleyn there faith
wherbi they should live. For the prophet says / Iustus ex fide viuit. The
rightful man lives by feyth. And saint. James says that faith without good
works of charity is but deed / And also prayer. Without devotion is but ded
as sey these clerks.

Dives. Than nyghe all the prayers that men make: be but deed For commonly in
our prayere we be destracte and thenk on other things And it is not possible
to us alwey to thenke on what we say. For there is no thing so change able
as thought / and thou we the^k on that we sey. yet it is not in our power
without special gift of god to have deuocioun therein


Pauper. Take it not so strait For it is understand thus Preyere witheoute
devotion is butte deed: that is to say Prayer made ayens deuocioun is but deed.


Dives. How a yens devotion


Pauper. As when men prey ayens the salvation of our soulys or other souls:
and not for the worship of god but for ipocrisi or o^li for wordly lucre Or
wha^ me^ preye ayens charity: as for to have ve^geau^ce of there enemies: or for
any thing ayens goddis worship: and in there prayer submytt not there will to the
will of god Every prayere that is made to the worship of god by weye of
charity and for a good end with purpose to plese god: that preyer is made
with devotion: tho we he that preyeth be distracte: and thenkethe not on his
wordys: and perauenture vnderstondethe the^ not: ne has but little liking there
in / Nethelesse man and woman oueth to do there devour: to the^ke on god / and
of that that he sei^ the in his prayere.


TTe tenthe chapter.
Dives. Thy speech please me: seye forth what thou will


Pauper. As I seide first all that let man or woman of there good dedys: and
good purpose and tyse them to sin and folly and bring them in error or
eresie by mys techyng be ma^sleers and lymmys of the find. Which as criste
says in the gospel is a manqueller from the begi^ni^ge of the world For
through his mys counseyle: and his fodinge: he sloughe al mankind both gostli
and bodily at the beginning of the world / Also he sloughe himsilfe through
pride and many thousandys angels that assentyd to him / And yet he sesethe not
to sle mannys soul: by false suggestiouns and temptaciouns: and that by
hymsilfe and when men se him not / And su^tyme visibily in the lickenesse of
sum visible creature: and so he tempted criste: eve and saint martyn: mani
other / Sumtyme he temptethe and slethe mannis soul by his li^mes that be
wicked men and wymen: Also men of holy church sle men and wymen gostli of
gods word and of good techi^g For as crist says No^ i^solo pane viuit homo:
sed in omni verbo quod procedit de ore dei. mt. iiiio.co. Man lyuethe not only
in bodeli bread: but much more he lives in every word that comethe of gods
mouth: that is to say i^ the wordys of the trwe prechour For every trwe
prechoure sentte of god: is cleped gods mouth And therefore god says to the
prophet / Si seperaueris preciosum a vili quasi os meum eris. Iere. xvo. / If
thou depart precious thing from thing that is foul and of no pryse: thou
shall be as my mouth / For it longs to ye prechoure of goddis word to
commend vertuis and despise vices to ^hese truth and let falshede to
commend heaven bliss: and gostly things and repreue pomp and pride of this
world and flesshly things / And tha^ne is ye prechoure as gods mouth and
spekethe with gods mouth: and his word is gods word by the which man
and woman lives gostly: and escapes endless death. And therefore david says
Misit verbum suum et sananauit eos: et ^ripuit eos de intericionibus eorum /
God has sent his word and has heled his people from gostly sekenes: and
delivered them from there diynge when they should have dyed: through sin
and hell pain And therefore he says in the gospel. that who so keeps his
word: he shall not ataste the death with out end. Sithe that gods word is
life and salvation of ma^nys soul: all tho that let gods word: and let
them yt have auctorite of god and by order take to preche and teache that they
may not preche and teache goddys word ne gods law: they be manslears gostli
and gilty of as many souls as perisshe and dye gostly by such lettynge of
gods word: and namely these proud couetouse prelatys and curates that
neither kunne teache ne will tech: ne suffer other that ku^ne and will and have
auctoryte to teache of god and of the busshop that yeuethe them there orders:
but let them for dread that they should have the less of there sugettis or
else the less be set by: or else that there sins should be know by prechyng
of gods word / And therefore lever they have to lose the soulys that criste
so dear bought tha^ to here there own sins openly repreued generaly among
other me^nys si^nys As saint austen says goddis word owth to be worshipped as
much as cristys body And as much sin does he that lets gods word and
despises goddis word or takes it retchelesly as he that despises goddis
body: or through his neccligens letethe it fall to the ground.i. q^. i. int
rogo vos / There the gloss shewethe: that it is more profitable to here gods
word in prechynge: than to here any mess: And rather a man should forbere his
mess than his sermoun For by prechynge folk be styrede to contricion and to
forsake sin and the fend and to love god: and godenes and be illumined to
know there god and virtues from vices truth from falshede: and to forsake
errors and eresies / By the mess be they not so / But if they come to mess
in sin: they goo awey in sin: and shrewis they come: and shrewys they
wend. And also the virtue of the mess stondethe princypaly in true by / leave
of the mess: and specialy of criste that is there sacred i^ the ost But that
may man learn by prechinge of gods word: and not by hering of mes / And i^ so
much berynge of gods word: trwly preched is better than heringe of mess /
Nethelesse the mess profits them that be in grace to get ye more grace and
foryeuenes of venyal sin: and encressing of mede: and lessynge the pain of
purgatory. And the pressed maibe so good that his prayer for reverence of the
sacrament shall get grace of amendment of him that he preyeth for Both be good
but gods word owth to be more charged and more desired tha^ heringe of mess
For when the people disspiseth gods word / and loath gods word / that is
gostly fode to man: that people is but ded in gods sight: and nyghe to the
yatys of hell And therefore david says: Omnem escam abhominata est anima eorum:
et a propinquaueru^t vsque ad portas mortis / There soulis have lothid al gostly
mete: that is to say al trwe preching and techi^g of goddis word and so they
be neyghed to the yatys of death.


The eleventh chapter.
ALso tho prelates and curatys be gylty of ma^slaughter gostly: that know there
sugettys in dedly sin: and will not snybbe them ne speak ayens there sin.
di.xliii. epheseis: And therefore god says to every curate and prelate of holy
church and to p^chours of gods word / I have made the a daiwaite to the
people of israel: that is to say to christian people and thou shall here the word
of my mouth and tell it the^ i^ my name And if I say to the synful yt he shall
dye and thou tell it him not: ne speak not to him that he may amend him and
turn him fro his wicked wey and life that synful wretch for thy defaute shall
dye in his sin: And I shall seek the blood and the death of hi^ of thin hond:
and thou shall answer for his death. Ezegie. iiioc. Also they be called
me^sleers: yt de fraud and take awey holy church goods.xii. q^. ii. qui
xp^i: etc: qi abstulerit / Also that preeste is a mansleer gostly that denies
the sacrament of penance to man or woman in his last end and will not assoyle
them when they repent them: and axe absolucion / For so they put folk in
despeire ayens ye goodness and mercy of god that is endless: and alwey ready to
all that seek mercy as long as the soul and yebody be knyt to gedre: Exaumple
of the thief that henge on the right side of crist: the which for pain
knowleched his sin and axed grace and gate the bliss of paradyse: when he
said lord have thou mind of me when thou come i^to thy kingdom / And a
non criste rightful judge that best knew his heart said to him: I se^ ^e for
sothe: this day thou shall be with me in paradise. xxvi. q^. vi. si presbit.
and co agnouimus / where the law says that they that be so hard up on men in
there dying: do not else but put death to death Death of soul to death of body

Dives. Much folk presume so much on the merci of god: that they give no tale
to live in there sin much of al there life in hope to have mercy in last end.


Pauper. And yet if they ax mercy in due manner: they shall have mercy: as the
law says well in the same place: and holy writ in many places / For god says
by the prophet. Ezechielis xxxiii.co That in what our the siner sighith for
his sin and ax mercy I shall foryeue him his sin and foryete his sin
Netheles I dare not hot such folk yt they should have grace stead and time
to axe mercy as the^ needs to axe For commonly such manner folk be desseyued by
soden death or else in there diynge they lose there hedys and there wyttys: and
begin to rave. Or else they have so much pain in there body and so much
business with the world. that they thenke neither of god ne of the^silfe /
And as seith saint austen in his sermon de innocentibus Iusto dei iudicio
agitur vt moriens obliuiscatur sui: q du^ viueret oblitus est. It is goddis
rightful dome yt he foryete himsilfe in his diynge that has foryeten god in
his living. As fell in england besidys oxenford / There was a tyrant in ye
cu^tre that dredde not god ne had petye of man / Often men preched him: and
cou^seyled him to good He had despite of there words: And said that if he
might have three words before his diyng: he should be saved as well as the best
man leuynge / At the last it byfel that he rode by the weye to be on aqueste
before a justice / And he bygan to sleep: his horse stomblid: and he fell down
and brake his neck / And in his falling he said with great heart. Ore vaunte
a deblis. that is to say in englisshe: Now forth to the devil And so he had
three wordis to his dampnacion: not to his salvation / Therefore the wisman says
De propiciatu pcto^rum noli esse sine metu / Be not without dread of
foryeuenesse of thy sins: ne put sin to sin: ne seie not yt the mercy of
god is great: he shall have mercy on the multitude of thy sins / For mercy and
wrath also hastli come fro him nighe to mankind / But his wrath looks to
sinners that will not amend them: and his mercy to them that will amend them
Neterdas conuerti ad dominum etc. Therefore let not to turn the to god and
delay not from day to day For if thou do: his wrath shall come suddenly and
destroy the. Eccl. vo c. For such folk that be so bold in there sin in
hope of the merci of god and do the wors by cause of his godnes: they scorn
god and seek ve^geaunce: and no mercy / They take heed to his mercy: and not to
his rightfulnesse. David says. Universe vic domini misericordia et veritas.
All the weyes of god and al his domes be mercy and teruthe: If thou seek mercy
it were aye^s his rightfulnesse but he showed mercy: and but thou seek mercy
rightfulnesse most dampne the Seek mercy: and mercy and his rightfulnesse will
save ye: if thou seek it in due manner.


The xii. chapter.
Dives. These words be good and comfortable and reasonable: Say forth what thou
wylt


Pauper. Also he is a man / sleer gostly: that makethe any man or woman to
forswere the^ For he sleth his own soul and hs soul yt he does so forswere
him.xxii. questione.v. ille Al so men sle theymsilfe as often as they assent to
wicked thoughtis in heart: and turn them aweye fro god in whom is al our life
And therefore solomon says. Auersio paruulorum interficiet eos prouer.io. taht
the turni^g away of the little children sle them / For they that sone be over
come in temptacion and sone assent to the fend: be lykened to young children
that be feynt and feeble to withstond oni thing / Of such children god says
that y child of an hundred yete shall be acursed of god isa.lxvo c. Also they
slay there soulys that gedre foul lustys and unlawful desires in there heart and
will not redely put them out Therefore ye wise man says. Desideria occidunt
pigru^ prouer.xxi.c. / wicked desiris sle them that is slow to put them out
/ And therefore david says Beatus qui tenebit et allider peruulos suos ad
petram Blessid be he that shall hold him with god and smite down his small
young thoughtys and desirys to the stone: that is christ. Blessed is he that a
non as he begynnethe to have such wicked thoughtys: anon begin to the^ke on
cristis passion: and of gods law as says saint ierom in his pystle. Ad
paulam et eustochium


Dives. It folowethe os thy wordys that who so does any dedly sin: he is a
mansleer: And so every sin is forbode by this precepte. Non occides Thou
shall not slay / why yaue than god ten preceptis. sith they be al co^prehendid
in one


Pauper. For dulnes of ma^nys wit: it needs to give mo than one to declare
ma^nys sin: that he may know when he synneth: and how he may fle sine All the law and all the prophycie as criste seith in the gospel hangethe in two
preceptys of charity which teache us to love our god above al thing: and our
even christian as our silfe / But yet god would declare tho two preceptys by ten
preceptis that man and woman should the better know them and plese him: and the
more fle his offe^s


Dives. Why declared he them more by ten preceptis than by twelve or by nine /
For he might have youen many mo: when he yaue but ten /


Pauper to give ou^don many was not prophitable ne to give oudon few / And
therefore god yaue his heestys in the noumbre of ten / for as ten is noumbre
perfyte: and conteyneth al noumbrys: so gods law is parfyte: and al is
comprehended in ten hestys that be so knytte togedre and of so great accord:
(...) who so trespasethe in one he trespasethe in all / And therefore says
saint James in his pystle: yt thowe a man keep all the law: and he offend in
one: he is gilty in all For why says he: god that bad the do no lecherye: He
badde the not slay / And therefore says he: Thowe thou do no lecherye and thou
sle: thou brekeste the law. Iacabi.io.co. For as says saint austen. in libro
de december cordis. All the ten co^maundeme^tys be contained in the two preceptys
of charity: And the two preceptys of charity be contained and knyt in this
one precepte of kind. Quod tibi non vis fieri: alterine facias. to bie.iiiio.
That that thou will not be do to the do it not to another: And so as saint
austen says there: All the law is contained i^ this one precepte of kind.
That thou wylt not be do to the: do it thou not to non other / And so nedys he
that offendethe in one: offendethe in all / And therefore david and saint austen
also clepe gods law a sawtree and an harp of ten cordys / And therefore
david byddethe us preyse god in the harp: and in the sawtre of ten cordys:
that is to say in good kepinge of the ten co^maundementys / Confitemini domino
in cithara in psalterio december cordaru^ psallite illi And if it be so: that one
cord in the sawtree or in the harp be broke: or out of tune of a cord with
other cordys: all the song that is pleyde therein shall be vnlikynge to all that
here it and not plesau^t As tellethe the master of kind Lio. xviiio. That
thowe the harp be well stringed with stringis made of ashepe: and there be one
stringge that is made of a wolf set in the harp: it shall make al other at
discord: So that they should not a cord while it is there And it shall frete
atwo all the other cordys / Right so thou a man or a woman keep well all the
co^maundementys as to ma^nys sight: if he break one: he is gylty of all in
gods syhgt: as saint James says and his life while he is such is not
plesau^t to god / And the song of his harp: that is his living and his
co^uersacioun is at discord with god and all the court of heaven and / as the
wolf is alwey contrarius and enmie to the sheep: so is he at discord and
enmye to goddys sheep that be al tho ye be i^ wei of saluacyoun: And as long
as thou kepeste well the ten hestys i^ lowness: so long the stringes of thyn
harp be in good acorde as the stryngges that be made of a sheep / But if thou
follow the manners of the wolf. and break out of gods co^maundementys by gyle:
by raueyne. by malice and false couetyse: by false co^triui^ge Tha^ne thou
make i^ thyn harp astringe of the wolf: which shall shend the harp of thy
liui^g and destroy it: but thou do it awey by sorrow of heart: shrift of
mouth and amendys making.


The xiii. chapter.
Dives. I would se more openli hou he that si^neth in one synneth al ten
co^mau^deme^tis


Pauper. If thou trespase in manslaughter: thou trespasyste ayens all ten
heestys / For thou vnworshipest thy god: in ye that thou brekest his
commandment: and so defoulest his image Also thou take in vein his name:
that is criste and criste^ For thou doyst not as a christian man should do / Also
thou halowyst not from sin as god bad the by the third commandment / Also
thou despisest and not worshipest fader and mother that be god and holy church:
and thy bodily fader and mother / For thy wicked tatchys be shame and shenship
to thy fader and mother / Also thou doeste lecherye in that ye thou love thy
wicked will and thy malice more than god / And for to have thy wicked will
performed: thou forsakest god and taktst thy soul to the fend / For what
thing man loves mor than god: with that thing he does gostly lechery and
fornicacion and auoutre Also thou beryst false witness and lie many lesingys
to mai^tein thy sin: or else to hyde it: Also thou stelest thy soul and his
soul whom thou sleeste fro god: that bought hi^ so dear also wha^ thou slest:
thou doste aye^sthe nynth and the tenthe commandment / For every manslaughter
is do for couetyse of vengeance: or for couetyse of erthely good. or for
couetyse of flesshely lust: as of me^nys wives: or of there children or of there
seruantys: or for couetise of worship: so that if thou slay: thou forfetist
ayens al ten com:+maundeme^tis / And so it may be shewid of each of al ten. that
he yt breketh one: breketh al: and he yt is gylty i^ one dedly sin: is gilty
i^ al vii. and i^ al ye x co^man^deme^tis And in token of this saint john saw
a woman sityng on aredde best full of names of blasphemy which best had seven
hedis and x. hornys. Apoco. xviio. By this woman is understand pride. and
vanyte of this world / By the red best that she sat on is under stond the
fend and dedly syne that is full of blasphemy ayens god: This best had seven
hedys and ten hornys: That is to sai seven dedly sins and breking of the ten
co^maundementys: in token that what man or woman fallethe i^ oni dedly sine
ope^li: he fall thi^ al seven preueli i^ goddis sight And when he breketh
one commandment: He brekethe all And therefore says saint James yt he that
offendethe in one offendethe i^ al and is gylty of al iac.ii.co.


The xiiii. chapter.
Dives What longethe to ye precepte of kind ye saint austen speaks of: to the
love of god or to the preceptys of the first table / For we may do to god
neither good ne evil


Pauper. ssoth it is yt we may not do to god neither good ne evil / And yet as
faint austen says in the same book. De dece^ cordis This precepte of kind
byddeth us to love our god and serve him well and trwly: and keep all his
heestys For why al we be goddys serua^tys / And if thou haddist a servant says
saint austen: thou would that thy servant served the well and trwly I pray
the tha^ne says he serve thou well and trwly thy god: that is thy lord and
his lord: Thou woldeste that thy servant were trwe to ye and not false be thou
not falls to god Thou would no man should defoule thy wife: defoule thou not
thy soul that is goddys spouse. ne non other soul: Thou woldeste that no man
should destroi thy house: ne defoule it: defoule thou not than gods temple:
that is every clean christian soul / Defoule it not by lecherye ne by no dedly
sin For saint poule says: that who so defouleth gods temple: god shall
destroy him: Thou would thy servant kept well thy co^mau^dementys: and did not
aye^s thy bidding / Keep than thou gods co^maundentys: and do not ayens his
byddyngys: Thou would that no man despise thy image painted on aboorde:
despise thou not gods image by any dedly sin / For sith thou may not please
god in sin and shrewednesse: therefore thou offe^dest thy god in thy sin and
thy corrupcion: and do wrong to hi^ thisylfe / Thou do wrong to his
grace: to his gift: thou mainot do wrong to thy brother but thou do wrong to
god: yt is thy lord and his also / And therefore says saint john i^ his
pistle that who so says yt he love the god: and he hate his brother: he is a
liar.i. io.iiiio. / For in that he does wrong principaly to god: and to his
brother also / And therefore god says. Quicu^que effuderit huma gum sanguinem:
effundetur sa^nuinis eius. gen^. ix. He that shed death out mannys blood
wrongfully: his blood shall be shed: For whi says he: man is made to the
lykenes of god And so man slaughtyr is open wrong do to god i^ y^ that his
servant is so slaiin: and his image dispysed: and distroyde: Therefore god said
to the first mansleer that was caim which sloughe his brother abel falsely for
envy of his own godenesse: what have thou do caim The voyse of the blood of
abel thy brother criethe to me fro earth and axeth ve^geau^ce of the / And
therefore thou shall be cursed upon earth: which has opened his mouth and
has take the blood of thy brother abel of thyn hond Thou shall traueil in tylth
of ye lord: and it shall give the no fruit: Thou shall be wanderinge and flemed
upon earth. gen^. iiiio. And the same vengeance como^li follows murdre: For
murdre may not be hid: but night and dai it axethe vengeance / The murdre
shall my shappe in his doing and be unstable and wandering and odious in his
living / This sin of manslaughtir is so grievous in gods sight Tthat he
commanded in the old saw that if any man biliynge in awayte or by preuy
aspiynge: or by purpose killed any man: and after fled to gods auter for so
coure he should be take away thens and be slain for that death.exo. xxio. co.
And therefore saint john says i^ the book of goddys preuites yt he that sleeth
shall be slain: Apoc: xiiio: For as criste says in the gospel. that same
mesure ye men mete to other: shall be moten aye^ to them / And therefore in time
of his passion he seide to peter Put up thy sword For each man that uses
sword to shed mannis blood wytheoute lawful power granted of god: shall
peryssh by the sword: that is to sai biswerd of bodily vengeance: Or by the
swerd of gods mouth: which is full sharp on every side punysshinge both
body and soul: Apoc. io: co. For commonly he that uses the sword: or any
wepen to slay any man or woman he sleethe first himsilfe by the sword of his
own malice But trespasourys that will not be amended in other manner. may by
just dome be slain by the^ that here the sword of temporal punysshyng as
saint poule says. Adromanos xiiio.


The xv. chapter.
Dives. It seems to much folk that god forbedeth by his precpte al manner
sleynge both of man and of best / For he said generaly. Non occides Thou
shall not sle.


Pauper. By this word occides i^ latin he specifiethe and shewethe yt he
forbyddethe sleynge of man: and not of best. For occisio in latyne is in
englisso^ manslaughter quasi hominum cesio And therefore the pro pre englisshe
is this. Non occides Thou shall not slay no man


Dives. Wha^ne god said the sixth heeste: that non mechaberis. yt is to say
thou shall do no lecherye he forbyddeth al manner of lecherye. And when he
said the seven heestys: Non furtum facies yt is thou shall not stele: he
forbid death al manner theft both of man and of best and of al other thi^gges /
And by the same skill as methynkethe when be badde us not sle: he forbadde us
al manner sleynge:


Pauper. It is not the same skill ne like that skyl. For as I said first by
properte of the same word Occides: He forbid death only manslaughter. God
granted man power to slay bestes and live thereby. gen^: ix.c. but he granted
him never to do lechery with any creature: ne take any thing by wey of
stelche: or of false couetise


Dives. Contrare we find that baalam rode on his ass to curse goddis people
ayens goddys will. An aungel stood in a right straight weye ayens him The ass
saw the aungel and fled aside for dread of ye angels swerd and bare baalam
a yens the wall: and brosyde his foot Balaam saw not the au^gel / And
therefore he was wroth with the ass and smote him fulharde tha^ne the ass
through the might of god vndernam balaa^: his master and said to hi^: what
have I do ayens the: why betest thou me? Thanne balaam said: For thou haste
well deserved it: would god I had aswerd to slay the: Thanne the ass said a
pen: Have I not alweye be thy best on which thou haste be wont alweye to
ride. Seye when I did ever the such disese into this day / And a non god
opened the iyen of balaam: and tha^ he saw ye au^gel sto^di^g aye^s hi^ with his
swerd drawn And the aungel said to balaam / why haste thou so beat thyn ass
/ For butte thyn ass had goon out of the wey and ^ouen me place I should a
have slain the: and ye ass should lived. Numeri.xxiio. Sith tha^ it is so that
balaam was blamed for he bette his ass not withsto^ding that he hurth him:
much mo / to he should have be blamed if he had slain him And fo it semethe
that it is not leful to slay any best


Pauper. It is grauntid to man to sle bestys wha^ne it is profitable to him for
mete or clothi^ge: or to avoid noyaunce of ye bestys: which be noyouse to man
And therefore god said to noe / and to his children / Also fysshes i^ the sea
be take to your power: and to your hondes: and al thing yt styrethe and
lives upon earth: best and bridde shall be to you in mete I have take them al
to you as grene erbys: out taken that ye shall not ete flesh with the
blood: Gen^. ix c: And in another place he says thus: If the like to ete
flesh: sle and ete after the grace and the gift that god has youen the: so
that thou ete it with out blood. Deut^.xiio. And so grau^tid god to man for
to slay bestes fesshe and foul to his profit: but not to sle the^ for
crueltye: ne for liking in vanyte and shrewidnesse / And therefore when he
forbadde man to ete flesh with the blood: he forbad him to slay bestes by wey
of crueltye: or for liking i^ the shrewednes / And therefore he said Ete ye no
flesh with the blood: that is to say: with crueltye / For I shall seek the
blood of your soulys of the hand of al bestys: that is to say I shall take
vengeance for all the bestys that ye slain only for crueltye of soul and
liking i^ shrewidnes. Gen^. ix.c. For god that made al has cure of al. And he
shall take vengeance of all that mysuse his creature / And therefore solomon
says that he shall arm creaturys i^ vengeance of his enemeyes Armabit
creaturam in vlcionem i^imicoru^. sap^. vo.co. And therefore men should have
rueth on bestys of bryddys and not harm them without cause in taki^g reward
yt they be gods creaturys / And therefore they that for cruelte and vanyte
heded bestes and turme^t bestys or foul more tha^ it is spedeful to mannys
living: they sin in case full grievously.


The xvi. chapter.
Dives. As thou saydest by fore by this commandment is forbode al wrongful
ma^slaughter / Tell me in what case it is leful to sle any man


Pauper. Su^tyme manslaughter is do by hate and enmyte: as wha^ne a man is
slain maliciously of his enmye Su^tyme it is do for wicked couetyse to have a
mannys good: Su^tyme it is do by order of obedience and process of law: as
wha^ a man is slain by aqeust and by sentence of a judge ordynarye Su^tyme
ma^slaughter is do for need and for help of the comonlye and for the salvation
of them that be unguilty / As wha^ne the knight fightethe in his right / and for
ye right sleethe his adversary. To sle any man into ye first manners that is to
say / for hate wrath and enmyte: or for false couetyse: is alwey unlawful / But
for to slay a man the third manner and the for the / that is to say by process
of law with a lawful judge / or by law of arms by the hondys of knghtys or
of men of arms rewled by law of god it is leful: wha^ me^ be gilty / and
therefore saint auste^ says lio.io de libro arbiterio If it be so that the
knight sle his adversary in rightful bateyle: or ye judge and his officerys sle
him yt is worthy to dye / me thenkethe they sin not / But lene friend three
things be nedeful / so that manslaughter should be leful and rightful / First
that the cause be rightful order and process of law and yt justice have
lawful power to slay / and that he yt shall be slain be conuicte of his trespase
/ Also the intencion of the judge / and of the pursuers and of the officerys be
rightful: that they slay him in saluacioun of the right / And for saluauaco^n
and ensaumple of other / not for liki^g of vengeance ne of crueltye: not
having lyki^g i^ his pain: so yt the cause be rightful and the order and
process: and the entencion be rightful: Iusta causa. iustus ordo. iustus

Dives. Co^trate. yet the gospel says / Quod deus co^iunxit ho^ no^ seperet.
mt. ix. There should no man deperte thing that god has knyt to gydre. But
god has knytte the soul and the body to gidre therefore tha^ne it is not leful
to any man for to depart ye soul from the body: neither to slay man ne woman


Pauper. Wha^ne the man that is gilty is slain rightfully by the law: man
sleethe him not / but as gods mynysters and gods offcers / For the law of
god and god hi^silfe sle him i^ that that god commands such to be slain /
God is pri^cipal judge of his death / and man is but gods officer to do his

Dives. Why for badde he them the sword


Pauper. For god would that men of holy church should be me^ of pees of mercy
and of petye / And therefore he said to them / Discite a me quia mitis sum and
hui^lis cord. Learn ye of me: for I am low and meke of heart. mt. xio.co: He
badde them not lern to pley with the sword / ne with the staff: ne learn to
fight and shote to sle there enemies: but he badde them learn to be low and
meke of hertte and to live in patience as lambys amo^gys wolves And he bad them
love there enemies: and do good to them that hate them. mt. vo. c. He badde them
show patience / pees and petye / not only in word will and deed: but he bad
them absteyne them from all tokenes of vnpacience of vnpees: and of crueltye
And for that sheddynge of blood and manslaughter is often token of vnpacience
and vnpees of wrath and of cruelte in them that slen and disposythe them to
crueltye / Therefore criste forbadde the swerd to all the mynystres of the auter.


Dives. Tell me some other skyl


Pauper. Another skyl is this For the sacrament of the auter that the p^stes
make by the virtue of cristes word is a sacrament of charity and of onehed /
For it representh the onehede that is between crist and holy church: And also
it represents the onehed of the soul with the body / For as the soul
quyckeneth the body / so christ by the sacrament of the auter qickeneth holy
church and ma^nis soul Also it representyth the onehede of the godhede with our
ma^hed i^ crist and therefore holy church says thus. Nam sict ai^a racionalis
et caro vnns est homo: it a deus et homo vnus est xp^c Right as rosonable soul
and the flesh is one man: so god and the man is one criste / and one criste
is both god and man And therefore he that destroyethe the onehede of the soul
with the body and departs the^ a^we^n by ma^slaughter he shows not in
himsilfe ne in his deed: the sacrament of onehede of crist with holy church and
of the godhede with the manhede in criste. Butte be does ayens that sacrament
by speracion and division. that he makes i^ manslaughter: and shedding of
blood / And therefore he is irreguler: and unable to make the sacrament of ye
auter / And for the same skylif ama^ have wedded two wives and so deperted his
flesh in diverse wymen / he is irreguler. and unable to the auter / And
therefore not only prestys: but dekones and subdekenes in that they be astent to
the priest in making of the sacrament must be witout such departinge that is
contrary to the sacrament of endless charity and of onehede between god and
holy church and between al good criste^ people yt is i^ charity for all they be
one and com to gidre i^ this sacrament / For this skyl it is not leful to men
of holy church to shed ma^nys blood: ne to sle: ne to mayme The new testament
is a law of love And therefore criste would yt ye mynysters of the auter i^ the
new testament that should mynystre the sacrament of his endless love and of his
endless mercy to mankind / that they show love mercy: and petye: and no token
of crueltye The old testament was a law of dread and duresse: and nighe all the sacrifices that the p^stes made was don with sheddi^g of blod not only in
figure of cristys passion: but also i^ token y^ he that sinned was worthy too
be slain as the best that was slain That was offeridde for his sin / And
therefore the sword was granted too priests And the mynesterys of the old
law to punysshe rebels: when it nedethe And much of there office was to
shed blod And so by there office they were disposed to crueltye: In so much
that they were notte aserede too slay gods son there lord there souereyne:
and there god / And for that preestys of the old law be crueltye slow criste
god and lord of all Therefore sheddi^g of blood and ma^slaughter is forbode to
prestys i^ the new law / and makes the^ unable to the auter: that shed
mennys blood or help thereto.

The xx. chapter.
Dives. Me merueleth much why sheddinge of blood and the sword is so
straytly forbode to men of holy church. For as we read i^ the gospel Crist
badde his desiples selle there clothys and bye them swerdys: wha^ he said. Qui
non habet ve^dat tunicam suam: et emat gladiu^. luc. xxiio He that has no
sword sylle his cote and bye him aswerde


Pauper. Crist said tho wordis not to al his apostlis but to judas ye
traitoure not biddi^g him bye him a swerd: but so shewinge and saiynge by fore
the wicked will and the wicked purpose yt judas was i^ to beg aswred to come
for to betray criste: and to take him: that wha^ne the iewys came with swerdis
and staves to take him as the gospel says he should have his swarde redye to
defend himsilfe. if any of cristys discyples would smite him. And therefore
criste said not tho wordys in the plurel nou^bre: as to many: but in the
singular: as to one judas alone / For he only was in purpose to betray him: and
to beg him a sword for dread of knockys / And by tho wordis criste bad him
not beg aswerd but by tho wordys he vndernam him of his malice: in such manner
that only judas should understood it: and non other of the apostlys For criste
would not puplissh either discure hi^ to the apostlis but only vndernam him in
such speech: that only judas should wite that christ knew his wicked purpose
and would not discure hi^ And so he showed goodness aye^s his malice to stere him
to repentance.


Dives. Why answerde thanne the apostles and said. Domine ecce duo gladii hic
Lord lo two swerdys here ready And our lord said: Satis est: It suffisethe:
it is inoughe.


Pauper. For as I said: The apostles understood not why ne to whom criste
said tho wordis And therefore they wend as much folk wenethe yet that criste
had bode them have boughte swerdys to feyght / And therefore they answerde in
that manner: and bygu^ne to speak of swerdis and of fightinge / And thanne crist
was displesyd with there spech and bad the^ be stylle of such spech Satis est.
It is inoughe: it suffiseth yt ye have spoken i^ this manner speech Now no more
of this matter And therefore as luke says in the same place: they cesed of there
spech anon and went with crist i^to the mount of oliuete / On the same manner
god said to moses wha^ he prayde him that he might enter the land of byheste.
Sufficit tibi. It is inoughe to the yt thou haste said. speak no more to me of
this matter. Deuto. iiio.co. Also god said to the aungel that slow the people:
Sufficit co^tine manum tuam. It is enough withold thy hand / And criste said
to his dyscyplys in time of his passion when he fond him slepynge. Sufficit.
It is inoughe that ye have slept now: awake ye / And as he made an end of her
slepinge By this word sufficit: it suffisethe: so he made an end of there
vnkunnyng speech when they begu^ne to speak of swerdys by this word. Satis
e^ It is inoughe: that is to say: ye have spoke inoughe in this mar^ no more
hereof. For they wyste not what crist meant no more tha^ they wyste what criste
meant wha^ he said to judas. Quod facis fac cecius. That thou doiste ^o it a
non. In such wordys criste vndernam judas of his evil purpose yt he should
amend hi^ / And yet it is a custum with much folk yt wha^ne theye here there
children or seruantys speak vnwysly to put them to silence and do them be
stylle with the same word: and say: sone it is inoughe thou have said inoughe.


Dives. And many clerkys say: that when the apostlys said lo here two
swerdys: and criste said again Satis est It inoughe. In tho wordys crist
granted men of holy church two swerdys: both goostly sword and bodily sword


Pauper. Theye err as the apostlys did For they understood not whine to whom
criste said tho wordys / For criste granted neuyr too clerkys the bodily
sword to shed blood: but he forbad it to them in the same time when he
vndernam peter smiting with the sword and bad him put up his sword into the
shethe / For whi says he: who that smytethe with sword: He shall perysshe
with the sword / And so all the process of the gospel if men understand it
well: shwethe yt christ has forbode men of holy church the bodeli swerd / and
therefore as says saint ambrose there armuer and there fyghtinge should be bitter
teerys and holy prayers:


Dives. yet contra te Criste says in the gospel / Non veni pacem mittere sed
gladium / I came not says he to send pees in earth: but the swarde.mt.x.co.


Pauper. by the sword i^ that place is understood the swarde of goddys word:
as says the gloss: By such sward man is departed from sin and from wicked
cumpanye: as the gospel shewethe well there / And by this sword sin is slain
in mannys soul.


Dives. Sithe god forbad men of holy church the sword and sheddyng of blod
and ma^slaughter: why slow saint peter ananyam and saphariam: his wife for her
false couetouse and for her lesinges. auctuu^. vo.


Pauper. As the law says xxiii. q^. viii. petrus. He slow the^ not with
material sword: but only by power that god yaue hi^ to do myraclys / with his
prayers he raised a woman from death to life: whose name was thabita
auctuum.ix.c. And with wordys of his blaming he took her life from ananye and
safira / He prayde not for her death: but only under name them for there si^ne
and a non they fell down deed by the virtue of the sword of goddys word that
peter spoke / and the holy gooste by peter / For as saint poule says. the
swerd of gods word full often departs the soul from the body And therefore
the word and the cursynge and vndernymynge of holy me^ and of men of holy
church: is much for to dread / Or else by sufferaunce of god: anon as sei^t
petyr vndernam them: for they repented them not: the fend sathanas took power
over them: And slow them bodily: as he slow them first goostly by the
si^ne of false couetyse.


The xxi. chapter.
Dives. Is it leful i^ oni ca^ to sle oni man or woman unguilty?


Pauper. In no case as the law says openly.xx. q^. v. si non


Dives. I suppose that ye queste dampnethe a man that ye justice knowethe
unguilty: shall not the justice give the sentence: and dampne him: sithe the
queste says that he is gylty.


Pauper. God forbede. For tha^ne fallethe the justice i^ manslaughter: For he
may by no law sle him that he knowethe unguilty xxiii. q^. v. si non.


Dives. What shall he do thanne?


Pauper. If he have no judge above him: he shall save hi^ by his plain power /
And if he have a judge above him / he shall se^d the man to him and tell him all the case yt he may of his plain power deliver him and save him from the death.
or else seek sum other weye for to save him / But he shall not give the
sentence of his death. Pylat traueyled full besyly to save criste from death: for
that he wyste him unguilty much more a christian judge owes to travail to save
the innocentys life whom crist bought with his blood / and flee false sentence /
Pylat might and ought by law have saved criste / But for to plese the people /
and for dred yt they should have accused him to the emperor he followed there
will and put criste to the death / and therefore afterward he was dampened / For
the false queste pilate would not have dampened him in that that he wyste him
unguilty: but only for dread and to plese the people: he dampnede him / And
sithe hethen law sleethe no man unguilty: much more christian law shall sle no
man unguilty / But the judge shall do al his business to flee shedding of blood
without gylt Therefore he is made judge to descuse the truth to save the
unguilty: and to punyssh the gylty and to let malice. folly and falshed of the
questys and of the false wytnessys / Therefore god seyth thus to every judge:
thou shall not take the voice of lesi^ges: ne thou shlat nof joy ne thyn hond
to sey false wytnes for the wicked man that is to say / thou shall make no
covenant to say false witness ne assent thereto Thou shat not follow the
peples will: to do any evil thing or any falsnesse in dome / Thou shall not
assent to the sentence of many to go aweye from the truth. Exo. xxiii.c.
Therefore the law bids that the justice be not to light ne to ready to leave:
ne to ready to take vengeance. Di. lxxxvi. si quid Et xi. q^. vi.iii. qua^uis
Et xvi. q^. viii si quid. The end of every dome shall be iusticia. That is
riyhtwisnesse in englisshe / And rightwisnesse is a virtue: and a steadfast will
alwey to yield every man and woman his right. Extra de v. significacione co.
forum. in glosa. And therefore when the justice does wrong in his sentence
yeuynge. that is no rightful dome for it ends not in rightwysnes But more
wrong may he not do to man or woman. thanne rob him of his life and slay him
with out gylt. Therefore thanne what judge sleeth man or woman unguilty wytingly
he is no judge: but he is a tyrant: and does ayens al laws which be ordained
to do right to every man to punissh the gilty and to save the unguilty And
therefore seyth the law that he is no judge if rightwysnesse be not in him. Non
est iudex si non est in eo iusticia xxiii. q^. ii. iustu^.


The xxii. chapter.
Dives. It is lefulle to any man or woman in any case to slay themsylfe.


Pauper. In no case. and that for many skyllys First for by wey of kind every
man louethe himsilf and is besy to save himsilfe and to withsto^d al thing
that would distroy him And therefore it is sin ayens al kind man or woman to
sle him silfe / Also it is ayens charity ffor each man is bound to love him /
silfe and his even christian as hi^silf Also he does wrong to ye comontye of
mankind / For as the philosofre says. vto: ethicorum Every man is aparte of
the comonte as every menbre is aparte of the body. Also for mannys life is an
high gift of god youen to man to serve god / And only god may take it awey
when he will. And therefore he that sleeth hymsilfe: he synneth ayens his god:
in that that he sleeth his servant ayens his will / For though god give a man
auctorite to sle another man for his misdede: yet god yeueth no man auctoritye
to sle hymsilfe / And therefore says the law.xxiii. q^. v. non licet. That no
man ne woman should sle hi^silfe: neither to fle myscheeffeof of this world. ne
to fle other me^nys sin: ne for sorrow of his own sin that he has don: ne
for to go the sooner to heaven / For if he sle himsylfe as says there the law:
he gothe to endless mischeeffe. And he fallethe in over grievous sin / And i^
that he sleethe hymsilfe falls in wanehope. and does dispyte to the mercy of
god as judas did For after his death he may not amend him of that grievous
si^ne of ma^slaughter And by that manslaughter he leseth his life in this
world and his life in heaven bliss: and gothe to the death in hell with out
end / And therefore there should no woman sle hirsilfe to save her chastity that
she be not defouled For if she be defouled by violence ayens her will: she
synneth not For as saint lucie seyde to the tyrant paschasius ye body is not
defouled but by assent of the soul / But the sin is i^ him that so defouleth
her / And less sin it is to fall in lechery / than man or woman to sle
himsilfe: for there is no help after / Nether should no man ne woman slay
himsilfe ne mayme himsilfe for dr^d that he should consent to sin: but trust
in god that may keep him from consenting: and let occacio^s of sin And
though man or woman be constreyned to sin for dread of death: better it is and
a feyrer that a another sle him: than he sle himsilfe for that is dampened in
eueri law


Dives. Contra te. Sampson and diverse other slough themsilfe as we read in holy
writ


Pauper. As seyth saint austen de ciuitate dei. They slough the^ silfe by the
preuy counseyle of ye holy gooste: that would by there death do miracles / As
when sa^pson took the two pylerys of the paynyms temple which bare up all the
temple and shook them to gidre with his arms tylle they brosten and the
temple fell down and slough many thousandys of the hethen people that was
gadrede to wondre on sampson in dispyt of god of heaven whose servant sampson
was.


The xxiii. chapter.
Dives. Whether is it more sin to slay the rightfulman or awycked man?


Pauper. It is more sin to sle the rightfulman / for in that the sleer noyeth
most hi^ whom he oughtmore to love Also for he does wrong to him that have
not deserved it and more ayens rightwisnesse Also for he pryueth and robs
the comontye of manhood of agreate jewel / For every good man and good woman is
awelle to ye comontye of mankind / Also for he does more dispyte to god: for to
al good criste seyth. Qui vos spernit. me spernit who despisith you despisithe
me.


Dives. Contra If a good man be slain: he shall sone go to heaven / Butte the
wicked manne if he be slain unwarily: he shall goo too hell / And less sin it
is: to send be slei^g a man to heaven: than to hell


Pauper. Saint poul seyth.i. ad little iiio. that every man and woman shall thake
his own mede: after that his traueyle is Therefore the good man so slain shall
go to heaven for his good dedys: notte for the malice of the sleer / And the
wicked man so slain: shall goo to hell for his own wicked dedys not for the
wicked dedys of the sleer / And the sleer shall go to hell both for the sleynge
of the good and of the wicked / But he shall be depper in hell for sleyng of
the good than of the wicked: For he shewethe more malice. and more aggreuethe
god and all the court of heaven in sleynge of the good than of the wicked And he
shall answer for all the good dedys that the good man should have do: if he had
lived longer And he shall be punysshed: for the sleinge of the wicked man: for
that he sleeth him ayens gods law and lets him that he may have no time to
amend him


Dives. Is it leful to any man to sle his wife: if he take her i^ auoutre


Pauper. To sle her by law cyuyle there lawis ordeyne man and woman that don
auoutrye to be slain: It is leful so that he do it only for love of
rightwysnesse and of clennesse: not for hate ne for to be avenged on her.

And let him well charge his conscience: if he be ought gylty i^ the same:
either i^ will or in deed and take heed to his own freelte and thenke that the
law is as well ordained to punuyssh him if he do amys as to punyssh the woman But
any man to sle his wife by his own auctorite or do her be slain without
lawful judge: it is not leful by all gods law. And though any londys saw
give men leave to slay there wives in any case: holy church shall punysshe
them and enjoin them full hard penance as for manslaught.


Dives. Whether is more sin a man to sle his wife or to sle his fader or
mother.


Pauper. Both be grievous sins: and much ayens kind / For the man and his
wife be one flesh and one blood / And he owes as says saint poule love his
wife as his own body / And therefore he to sle her ayens kind / Butt yet it is
more sin: and more aye^s kind to sle fader and mother: for of them man has
his begynni^g his flesh and blood / And also if he sle any of the^ he
forfetteth openly ayens the co^maundementys of god the fourth and the fifte
For in that he vnworshyppethe over much his fader and his mother: and fallethe
i^ cruel manslaughter and therefore it is more sin to slay fader and mother:
than to sle his wife: as seyth the law in sm^. co^fessorum.lio.iiiio. tio. ix.
q^. x.


The xxiiii. chapter.
Dives. Sithe god byddethe that no man should slay unrightfully: why suffers
g^d so much werre be in earth: and so many bateyles.


Pauper. For much folk is worthy to die and will not stand to the law of pees
/ Therefore god has ordained and commanded the law of sword and of cheualrye
to bring the^ to pees with the sword that will not obey to the pees by law of
charity and reason.


Dives. Tha^ it seems that me^ of arms maysle men lefully that will not obey
to the pees and too gods will


Pauper: That is soth For Abraam. moses. iosue. david. iosie machabeis and
many other were men of arms and slowghe much folk / And yet god repreued
them not but he badde them sle and halpe them in there sleyng and in there
fyghtyng.


Dives. I may well assent that bateyle is leful: if it be rightful. For god is
cleped. Dominus exercituum and dominus sabbath. That is to sey lord god of
ostys


Pauper. Three things be nedful: that bateyle be rightful. Iusta causa: iustus
animus: et auctoritas legitum principis a rightful cause. arightful intencion
and authority of a lawful prince / First it is nedful that ye cause be
rightful that they fight only for the right: and to maynteyne right and for
salvation of the comontye: and of them that be vngiltye and would have pees /
For as seyth synt austen. the end of bateyle should be pees.xxiii. q^. i.
nolite. Also there intencon most be rightful that they fight not for pride to
get them aname. ne for no false couetyse to get worldly good: ne for no
malice for to be vengede: ne for no crueltye and liking to shed blood: For if
there intencioun be wicked: though there cause be true: they sin in
manslaughter / And for there wicked intenci / on god suffers men to be
ouerco^me in a rightful cause / Also it most be do by auctorite of a lawful
prince: that is prince made by common custom: or by common law: or by common
assentt of the comontye: or by common lawful election: For though aperson gadre
to him rebellys ayens his liege lords will: al though the rebellis make him
there head and her prince: they may not by his auctorite do rightful bateyle But
al though auctorite of a prince lawful be nedful to rightful battle that is
solemply don by mannis law: yet i^ a rightful cause at need man may by law of
kind with out auctorite of any prince fight and defend hymsilfe: and his godis
ayens wicked folk For it is the law of kind every man to save himsilfe and
put awey fors with fors. and might with might Licitu^ e^ vim virepellere. So yt
his purpos be not to slay ne to rebel ayens his souereyn ne ayens the law: but
only in truth to save him and his fro wicked doers Netheles clerks should not
fight for no worldly goodis / but they may in case with fighting and smytyng
defend there own person ayens clerk and lewed man And so may the lewed man
defend himslife with smitynge ayens the clerk that seeks to smite hi^ if he
may not else sekerly save hi^silfe / And if he may sekerly save himsilfe: either
by slight: either by shettyng of door or of gate or any other weye: he owthe to
save himsilfe and not smite a clerk: but wisely save them both / But alwey be
he ware: that his flight be not cause of his death And sith that the lewed man
owes to fle the clerk if he may in seker manner to save the^ both Much more
the clerk that should show patience and fle sheddynge of blood: by his order
owes to fle alewed man / if he may to save himsylfe sekerly and to save them
both. If the sugettys be in doubt whether the cause that they fight for be
true / they be excused by the p^cepte of there prince for virtue of obedyence:
so that the subgettys have no cause to misdeme of her prince by his common
living but that they suppose that he i^ al his living be rewled by reason and
gods law But if they be seker that the cause is false / they be not excused
ne owe not to fight / Or else if the prince be man out of good governance as
frentyke / or braynles. or else that he be in his living openly rebellyng ayens
god: thanne the people owes not to obey to his biddyng wha^ne he byddeth them
fight: butt if they know sekerly that his cause betrwe / But tha^ne they most
obey the prince of heaven that bids them sle no man ne woman unguilty /
Sowdeours and other knyghtys and men of arms and other friends of the prince
not subget to him by obedience / if they fight for him in a cause that is i^
doubt they be not excused from dedly sin and ma^slaughter. In sm^.

you the fifte heeste that byddeth you and us al / not sle / And therefore leave

ye be ware yt ye assent to no mannys death neither before ne after: but ye were
syker that they were gyltye and worthy to dye / For the law seythe / that
both they that don the mysdede / and they that assentte thereto / but worthy
even pain. A ge^tes and co^sencie^tes pari pena punia^tur. Iustifye ye no
mannys death / butt ye know well the cause of his death / For I am syker yt god
dampneth much manslaughter that ye and other iustifye. and the dome of god shall
fall that he seyde to saint peter / He yt smytethe with the sword / shall
perysshe with the sword / And he that robs shall be robbed. Veq p^daris nonne

and iustifye ye not yt god dampnethe Here endethe the fifte precepte: and
bygynneth the syxte precepte.


Dives. Thy counsel si good God send us pees: and keep us fro the sword.
Now I pray the declare me the sixth commandment.


Pauper. The sixth commandment is this. No^ mechaberis That is to sey i^
englisshe Thou shall do no lechery: ne meddle with no thing flesshly but only
with thy lawful wife. As seyth the gloss / And so by this p^cept he forbyddeth
al spyces of lechery


Dives. Hou many spices be there of lecherye.


Pauper. Nine And these be they. Fornicacion and lechery with common wymen.
auoutry defoulynge of maiden hode. defouli^g of chastity auoued to god
defoulyng of them that be nigh of kyn / of afenitye. or of gossyprede. and
sodomye that is mysvse of ma^nys body or woman's in lecherye ayens kind and
polucion of mannys body or woman's: by there own styrynge and by themsylfe
which is a full orrible sin / And also synful medlynge to gedre between
husbond and wife / Fornicacio. meretriciu^. adulterium Stupru^. sacrilegiu^.
i^cestus. p^m^ sodomiticu^ volu^taria i^ se pollucio and per se prouocat. et
libidinosus: coitus co^iugalis.


Dives. In hou many weyis may ye husbo^d sin medlynge with his wife?


Pauper. In eight weyis First if he meddle with her only to fulfill his lustys
and his lecherye taki^g no head to god ne to ye onestie of matrimonye / Also if
he pass me sure in his doing / Also if he meddle with her in times which holy
church cou^seyleth men to co^tine^ce / as in holy times and in time of lent in
time of fasting and of other prayer: which times he may meddle with her so
bodily ayens reverence of the time / and of god yt he shall sin dedly / For
peter and poul tech that wedded solke should in holy time / and in time of preyr
absteyne them fro such lustys that there prayer may ye more graco^usly be herd
of god and there heart the more youen to godd / For such lust as for the time
drawethe ma^nys heart and womannys much fro god: and makes them full flesshly
and ye les goostly / Therefore as we read Gen^. viio. in the time of the flode
in noes time for the herd tribulacion and dred that they were in all that year:
noe and his three. sons kept them chaste and lay by themsilfe and there wives
by them sylfe. so that by holy preyer and contye^nce they might the sooner be
delivered of that perel and myschefe that they were in / Also if he meddled with
his wife i^ holy place without need / For i^ time of werre though he meddle
with his wife in church: if he dare not ly of out ye church for dred of
enemies he is excused: and the church is not polute / or else it were polute.
And also if he meddle with his wife wha^ne she is great with child nygh the time
of berthe. For tha^ne lightly he might sle the child. Also if they meddle to
gydre with evil condition / Also if he meddle with his wife weti^gly i^ her
common sekenes at his ow: ne profre. But if husbond and wife meddle to gedre
flesshly without these defautis only to bring forth a vein too the heart.
And heth children to gods service else to fle fornicacion and lechery on other
halfe-or to yield the det of there body each to other tha^ne they sin not / But
thanne as says saint poule there wedlok is worshipful / and there bed wytheoute
spot of blame.

Honorabile connubiu^ i^ oi^bus and thorus i^maculatus. Ad hebre. xiii. co.
Upon which word says the great clerk haymo and the gloss also. yt it is a
worshipful wedlok wha^ne man weddeth his wife lawfully to bring forth children
to gods service: and absteyneth him fro his wife in dwe times. And thanne is
there bed without spot of blame: when he meddle with his wif lawfully and for
a good end keep mesure and manner: thanne rise they up out of bed with out
spott of blame.


The sedunde chapte.
MAtrymony wae ordained of god for ii. causes First pryncypaly into office /
to bring forth children to gods service. Also into remedy to fle fornicacion
and lecherye / For the first cause it was ordained i^ paradise before adams
sin. For the ii. cause it was ordained out of peradise after adams sin /
Three good things be pryncipaly in matrimonye / The first is feyth that each
of them keep truly his body to other: and meddle flesshly with non other / The
secunde is brynginge forth and norysshi^ge of children to the worship of god
and to gods service. For else it were better that they were unborn. The
third is the sacrament which may not be undo: but only by death / And therefore
the order of wedlok is fulworshipful / for it represents the great sacrament
of unity and of endless love between ye godhed and ye ma^hede i^ criste verry
god and verry man bitwene criste and holy church. and between crist and
criste^ soul / And the feythful love that owethe to be between husbo^d and
wife bytokeneth the love and the feythe ye owes to be bitwene crist and
criste^ soul: and between crist and holy church / For the husbond should love
his wife with true love / And therefore wha^ne he weddeth her: he sets a
ring on her finger / which ring is token of true love that owethe to be
between them. For they most love them to gedre hertely / And therefore it is
set in the forth finger / For as clerks sey fro that finger go yeueth her
but one ring i^ token that they should love them syngulerly to gedre. For as
ayens comyni^ge of there body / the husbond should love his wife and non other /
and the wife her husbond and non other / The ri^g is round about and has non
end in token that there love should be endless: and no thing depart them but
death alone / Also the ring is made of gold or of silver in token that as gold
and silver pas al other metals in value and cle^nesse: so should there love
pass al other loves. And the husbond love his wife passing al other wymen: And
the wife love her husbond passing al other men And as gold and silver pass al
other metals in clennes / so should there love al be set i^ cle^nes and not
common to gedre / but for bryngyng forth of children or to flee fornicacion or
to yield the debt of there bodies This love bitokeneth the love that we owe to
god that is our goostly husbonde too whoom we be all weddedde in our baptem /
For we should love him hertely with all our heart syngulerly with al our
soul lastingly with al our mind myghtely with al our myghtys / And
therefore he says. Deutro. vio. Thou shalt love thy lord god with althy heart
with al thy soul with al thy mind with all thy might: The husbo^d betokens crist
ye wife betokens holy church and criste^ soul which is gods spouse and /
owes to be suget to christ: as wife to husbond / Three orname^tys long
pryncipaly to a wife. Arynge on her finger a broch on her breast: and agarlond
on her head / The ri^ge betokenethe true love as I have said / The broch
bytokeneth clennesse in heart and chastitye that she owes to have / The
garlonde bytokeneth gladness. and the dignitye of the sacrament of wedlok /
For the husbond bytokeneth crist: and the wife holy church / which is cleped
queen: and gods spouse / And therefore sei^t poule says thus. Viri diligite
vxores vestras. ye men love ye your wives as. criste loved holy church / and
put himsilfe to the death for holy church / So should men do if it neded for
there wives as says gloss / Men says he owe to love there wives: as there own
bodies He that loves his wife: he loves himsilfe: Sithe thanne this sacrament
of wedlok is so great and so worshypful in crist and holy church / ther-fore
every man love his wife as himsilfe / And the wife love her husbond and dread
him / wymen says he most be suget to there husbondys as to there lord: For man
is head of woman: as criste is head of holy church / And as al holy church is
suget to crist: so most wyme^ be sugettis to there husbo^ddys. These be the
wordys of sei^t poule. Ad ephesians. quinto.

The third. chapter.
Sith that the order of wedlok is so great and so worshipful in criste and
holy church / as saint poul says without doubt they yt break it or misuse it
in lust and lykyng of the flesh and follow only there lust as bestes and
refreyne not themsilfe by reason and by gods law / they sin full grievously /
Therefore we find in holy writ. tobie.vio.co. That there was a woman that
hight sara and she was wedded to vii. husbondys: and adeuel ye hight asmodeus
slough them al each after other the first night or yt they meddled wlth her /
For they wedded her more for bre^ni^ge lust of ye flessh / than for any true
cause of matrymonye / After the aungel raphael came to young Tobie and seid to
hi^ yt he should wedde sara Tha^ young tobie seyde to the au^gel I have hard he
seyde yt ye deuel has power ou^ al men yt wed her / and slethe them Tha^ the
au^gel seyde to hi^ / I shall tell ye over which men the fend has power over
them that so take wedloke that they put god from them: and fro there mind
and give tente to flesshely lustys / as horse and mule that have no
understanding Over them the deuel has power Butte thou shall not take her in
such manner: but three nyghtys ye shall keep you chaste / and give you to holy
prayere: and thanne thou shall take thy wife with the dred of god pri^cypaly
to bring forth children to the worship of god / Sithe tha^ne the devil has
such power over them that so misuse there wives and the order of wedlok / Much
more power has he over them that break ye order of wedlok and take other tha^
there wives / Therefore god bad in the old law. Deuto. xxii. that if any man
medil with another ma^nis wife / they shall be slain both ye man and the woman
And the wise man seyth / that he that does auoutrye for myschefe of heart / he
shall lose his soul: and he gadereth shame and shenship to himsylfe. and his
shame shall neu^ be do awey Prou^. vio. And there he says yt al though theft
be grievous sin / yet i^ regard of auoutrye it is but a small sin / And so
says ye great clerk bid / and the gloss also. Many myscheues fall to them
that live i^ auotrie much sikenesse: much myshappe loss of good: wanysshyng of
cateyl / and little foyson therein: sodeyne pouert evil name and much shame
great hurt / and often maymi^ge and myscheuous death / as death in presoun and
hanging / and often soden death / and instruction of eyrys and of there erytage
/ And therefore the wise man seyth Filii adulterorum. etc. The chlidren of them
that live in auoutrye: shall sone be at end / and the issue and the sede that
comethe of the wicked bed shall be distroyed and though they live long they shall
not be set by and there last age shall be without worship. Naciones inique
dire sunt consu^macionis They that be msborne most commonly they have hard
end. Sap^. iiio: co. And as he seythe in the next chapter following / Children
borne in auoutre shall give nos deperotys: ne set no stable gronude butt they
shall alweye be in tempeste of tribulacion / There braunchys shall break / and
there rotys be plucked up The fruit of them shall be vnprophytable / and they
shall be full bitter i^ eu^y mete and able to right naught. Sapiencie.iiio.co.
In token and co^firmacion of this we find in the law: yt the holy (...)
boniface the third which was amerter wrote to the king of england in this
manner As it is told openly by the cuntres. and vpbreydyd to us that be i^
france and ytalie: and hethen men repreue us thereof: that englissh people
despise the laws of wedlok and give them to auoutrye and lechery as did the
folk of sodo^. Butte wit it well: if it be so as men sey of them / the people
that shall be borne of such lechery and spouse brech shall be vngentil pepel and
reprefe to al there kynred They shall be wode in lechery / and alwey the people
shall come to wors and wors / and at the last be unable to bateile. unstable
in feyth and without worship and not loved of god ne of man: as it fallethe to
many other nasions: ffor they would not know gods law Distinco.lvi. si gens
anglorum.

Dives. It semethe yt the prophicie of that (...) is now fulfilled / For what
auoutre has reigned in this land many yerys: it is no cou^ceyl and namely
amo^gns these lordis which have now brought this lord in bitter bales / Su^me
of them be slain: and su^me of them yet live i^ much woo Gods law is
foryete and forbade that men should not ku^ne it ne have it in there mother tu^ge
The people is unworthy and in despyte to al crystendome. for there falshede and
there false byleuynge: and so wood in lechery that the brother is not ashamede
to hold openly his own sustre. They be harlottis in living unstable in
feythe: unable to bateyle: ouerco^me nyghe oueral hated of god and of man
without grace and speed nigh in all there doi^g


Pauper. Exaumple to this we find in the secunde book of kyngys.xiio.co. where
we find yt wha^ne david had don auoutre with barsabee the wife of the noble
knight Vrie: and after that treccherousli slain that knight god sentte the
prophet nathan to david: and repreued him of his sin and seyde: that swerd
and debate should never pass fro his household and fro his ki^redde I shall
says god reyse myscheffe: and disease ayens ye of thyn own menye: and take
thy wives and give them all to thy next. and he shall openlyly by thy wif Thou
doiste it preuely. I shall punysshe the openly. And so it befelffor absolon
his own son droffe him out of his own kyngedome and say by his wife: in
the sight of all the people And was there never after. stabilyte in his kingdom
/ And yet the auoutrye of david was more punysshed: For the child that was
bygoten i^ auoutry dyed sone after for the sin of the fader and mother / And
afterward aaman dauidis son lay by thamar his own suster / And therefore
absolo^ her brother sloughe aama^ his brother in treccherie And all these
myscheues fell for david is sin with bersabee / we find also in holy writ.
Iudicu^ xx. co. that for defoulyng of one ma^nys wife were slain sixty
thousand and five thousand / It is a common proverb in lateyn. Debile

ground is feeble and false: the work that is set thereon shall sone fail /
But the ground and the bygynnyng of every people is lawful wedlok and lawful
generation in matremony And if that fail the people shall be unstable and
unthrifty / and that god shewethe well in the beginning of the world For when
me^ wedded vnlawfulli and brake the boondys: and the laws of wedlok which god
ordened at the beginning. tha^ne god sent the great flod and destroyed al
mankind: save noe and his wife and his iii. sons and there wives


The fourth chapter.
D Pauper. When yafe god laws of matrimony and what laws yaue he:


PAuper. When god had made adam he put a great sleep in adam: and in his
sleep he took out one of his ribbys: and filled up ye place with flessh / And of
that ribbe he made eve and brought her to adam. Tha^ adam awoke and as god
inspyred him: he took ye laws of wedlok and said thus / This bone is now of
my boonys: and this flesh of my flesh / For this thing man shall forsake
fader and mother: and take him to his wife / And they shall be two lone flessh.
Gen^. iio. In which wordys: when he said that man for his wife should
forsake fadir and mother: and take him to his wife: he showed ye sacrament of
true love and unity that owthe to be bitwene husbond and wife / And by the
same wordys he showed what feyth owth to be bitwene them / For he shall take
him to his wife and medel with her and with non other. and she with him and
with non other / And in that he said that they should be two in one flesh:
he shewid that they should meddle to gedre pryncypaly too bring forth children
to gods worship / For i^ there child husbond and wife ben one flessh and one
blood / Also i^ that he seyde that the husbonde should cleue to his wife: he
forbids fornicacion and auoutre / And that he seyde in ye synguler noumbre
to his wife and not too his wives: he forbids bigamie that ama^ should not
have two wives to gedre ne one woman two husbo^dis to gidre / And in that he
said that they should be two in one flesh. he forbad sodomye / bnd also by
the same wordys he shows yt each of them has power over others body and
non of them may conteyne: but by assent of them both.


Dives. Why made god woman more of the ribbe of ada^ than of another boon.


Pauper: For the ribbe is next the heart in toke^ that god made her to be
ma^nys fellow i^ love and his helper. And as the ribbe is next the heart of
alboues: so should the wife be next in lone of al wymen: and of al men / God
made not woman of the foot to be mannys thral ne he made her not of the head:
to be his master: but of his side and of his ribbe to be his feolowe i^ love
and helper at need / But wha^ eve sinned: thanne was woman made suget to man:
that the wife should be reuled by her husbo^d and dread him and serve him as
fellow in love and helper at need and as next solace i^ sorrow: not as thral
and bond in vilein seruage For the husbonde owth to have his wife i^ reverence
and worship in yt they be both one flessh and one blod


Dives. Why made not god woman by hirsilfe of the earth as he did adam.


Pauper. For to increase there love to gedre: And also to give woman matter of
lowness / First for encressyng of love. ffor in that woman is part of ma^nys
body: man most love her as his own flessh and blod / And also she must love
man as her beginning: and as her flessh and her blood / Also she owes to take
great mtaer of lowness: and the^ke yt man is her perfection: and her begynnyge
and have man in reverence as her perfection: as her pryncipal: as her begynnyg
and her first in order of kind / God made al mankind of one For he would that
al mankind should be i^ one charity as they came al of one.


The fifte chaptor.
Dives. Whether is auoutre gretter sin in the man or in the woman.


Pauper. Commonly it is more sin i^ the man For the higher degree ye harder is
ye fall and sinnemore grievous Also man is more mighty by wey of ki^de to
withsto^d and has more skyl and reason whereby he may withsto^d and be ware of
the fyndes gyle. And in that he is made master and gouernoure of woman to
govern her in virtue: and keep her fro vices / If he fall in vices and in
auoutre more than woman he is much to blame and worthy to be repreued
shamefully / Therefore saint austen. in lio. de december cordis: vndernymeth
husbo^dis that falin auoutre and seyth to each of them in this manner / God
seythe to ye thou shall do no lechery yt is to sey: thou shall meddle with no
woman: butte with thy wife / Thou ayist this of thy wife that she meddle with
non but with the And therefore thou oughtist to be byfor thy wife in virtue thou
fallest dou^e under ye filth of lechery Thou wylt that thy wife be ouerco^mer
of lechery and have the maystry of the fend / and thou wylt be overcome as
acowerde and ly dou^e in lecherye / And not withstonddynge that thou art head
of thy wife yet thy wife go before ye to god and thou that art head of thy wif
goeste bacward to hell / Man seyth he is heed of woman / And therefore in what
household the woman lives better than ye man in that household hangethe the
head dounwarde For sith man is head of woman: he owethe to live better than
woman: and go byfor his wife in all good dedys: yt she may sue her husbond and
follow her head the head of each household: is the husbond: and the wife is the
body By course of kind theder yt the hedde ledethe: thither should the body
follow / why would thanne the head yt is the husbond go to lecherye: and he will
not yt his body his wife follow / why would the man go thither wheder he will not
yt his wife follow: and a lytyl after in the same book saint austen says thus
/ Day by day playntes be made of mannys lecherye. al though there wives dare not
plain the^ of there husbondys Lechery of me^ is so bold and so customable / yt
it is take now for a law i^ so much yt me^ tell her wives yt lecheri and
auoutry is leful to me^ but not to wyme^: thus seith saint auste^ /


Dives. And su^tyme it is wist and hard ye wives be take lyi^g with her serua^tis
and brouht to court before ye judge: with much shame but yt any husbo^d is so
brouht to court bifor ye judge for he lay with his wyme^: it is seldo^ sen


PAuper. and yet as seyth saint auste^ i^ ye same book: it is as great si^ne i^
the husbo^d as i^ ye wife and su^del more But forsooth says he it is not the
truth of god but ye shrewednesse of man yt makes man les gilty tha^ woman i^
the same si^ne Me^ be not so often take i^ auoutry ne punysshhedd for auoutrye as
wymen be not for they be les gylty: but for yt thy be more gylty and more
mighty and more slygh to maynten there si^ne / and nygh each of them confortethe
other in his sin / Men be witnessys iugis and doers to punysshe auoutrie in
woman / And for they be ouerdone gylty in auoutre. Therefore they traueyle nygh
al with one assent to mainteyne there lecherye / In woman is seldom se a voutre:
And therefore it is full sclaunderous wha^ne it fallethe and hard punysshed
Butte in men it is so common yt there is vnnethys any sclaunder thereof wymen
dare not speak ayens the lechery of men: and me^ will not speak to repreue the
lecherye of man / for they be so much gylty / Sin that seldom falletheis
most sclaunderous. and yete in case less grievous. And sin that often
falls / and is most in use / is leeste sclaunderous and yet it is most
grievous / For the more customable and the more blood that men be i^ sin and
the less dreye and shame that men have to sin: the more grievous is there
sin / Therefore saint austen i^ the same place spekethe more of this matter
ayens the lecherye of men and sey the thus / Parauenture thy wife herethe in
church by prechynge that it is not leful to the to take any other but thy
wife / She comethe home and grutcheth aye^s thy lecherye and seythe to the: yt
thou doeste thing that is notte leful / For why we be both criste^ The
chastity that thou axiste of of me. yield thou me / I owe too the feythe: and
thou owiste feith to me: and both we owe feyth to criste / Though thou disseyue
me thou disseyueste not god: whose servants we be both Thou disseyueste not
him that bought us both for he knows al But weneste thou seyth saint austen
that the man wylbe heled and amend with her words /

Nay nay seythe he / but anon he shall be wroth and he shall be wode both with
his wife / and with the prechoure and curse the time that his wife came to the
church to here the truth. These be the wordis of saint austen in the same
book And yet after i^ the same book he seyth thus / Paraue^ture thou letchoure
wolt excuse the and sey / I take noon other mannys wife / But I take mine own
servant / wylt thou seythe he: yt thy wife sey to the / I take noon other
husbond I take butte my servant / God forbede that thy wife should sey so to
the / Better it is that she have sorrow of thy sin: than follow the or take:
wicked ensaumple of the / Thy wife is chaste and an holy woman and a true
christian woman: She has sorrow of thy lecherye: not for the flessh but for
charity / And thy wife would that thou doeste not amys: not for that she does
not amys / but for it is not spedeful to ye For if she kept her chaste and did
not lecherye only for yt thou shuldeste do no lecherye / if thou do
lecherye: she should do lecherye But for that the good woman keeps chastitye:
not only for ye feyth yt she owthe to the / butt also for the seythe that she
owethe to criste / For though the man do amys / yet the woman yeuethe her
chaste to god. Therefore says saint auste^ i^ ye same place Crist speaks in
the hertys of good wymen within in there soul: there there husbond hereth it not
/ for he is not worthy to here it / and conforteth his daughter with such
manner wordys / Thou art evil deseased with wrongys of thy husbonde: what has
he do to the I pray ye have patience be sorry of his mysdede: but follow him not
to do amys:. but he must follow the in goodness / For i^ that that he does
amys let him not be thy head to lead the: butte let thy god be thy head /
For if thou follow him as a head i^ his shrewednesse / both head and body shall
fall down into hell And therefore might not the body that is the wife follow
the wicked head but might she hold her to the heed of holy church that is
criste / To him the wife owes her chaste to him pryncipaly she most do
worship: for he is pryncipal husbo^de Be her husbond present be he absentte /
the good womoan shall alwey keep her chaste / For criste her husbond to whom
pryncypaly she owethe her chaste. is never absente / Change your life ye men
letchours: says saint austen there / And fro thens for ward be ye chaste /
Ne seye ye notte that ye may not keep you chaste For it is shame to sey yt man
may not do: that a woman does: ne be so chaste as a woman is / The woman by
right has as freel a flesh as the man / And woman was first deseyued of the
adder. your chaste wives show to you that ye may be chaste if ye will. Theyse
be the wordys of saint austen.


The sixte. chapter.
Dives. Wymen may better be chaste than men for theye have much keeping upon
them / The law byddethe them too chastytye / There husbondys be besye too
keep them and hard laws be ordained to punysshe them: if they do amys


Pauper. To this answerethe saint austen in the same book: and says thus /
Much keeping makethe woman chaaste: and manhood should make man chaaste. To
wooman is ordained much keeping. for she is more freel woman is ashamed for her
husbond to do amys / Butte thou art not ashamedde for criste to do amys Thou
art more fre than the woman / For thou art strenger: and lightlier thou
mighteste ouerco^me the flessh and the fend if thou wylt / Therefore god has
bytaken the to the. Butte one woman is much keeping of her husbo^d dredful
laws good norture great shame fastness. and god pri^cipal / and thou man
haste only god above the / Thy wife fleethe lecherye for dread and shame of the
for dread of the law: ffor good norture and principaly for god / Butte for all
these thou kepeste not the chaaste / ne thou leueste not thy lechery neither
for dred of god ne for gods law ne for shame of the world: ne for shame of
thy wife: to who^ thou art bound to be true. ne thou wylt leeue it for ne
good nortur but live as an harlotte and use harlottys manners / Thou artte not
ashamed of thy sin says saint austen / For so many men fall therein. The
shrewsdnesse of man is now so great that men be more ashamedde of chastytye
than of lecherye / Manquellers thieves: periureris: falsewytnessis rauenourys
and false men be abominable and hated amongys the people / But who so will lie
by his woman and be a bold lechoure / he that is loved he is preised / And all the wounds of his soul turn into game / And if any man be so herdy to sey
that he is chaaste and true to his wife and if it be know that he be such he is
ashamed to come amongis men that be not like him in manner / For they should
iape and scorn him and seye that he is no man For mannys shrewidnes is now so
great: that there is no man hold a man: but he be ouerco^me with lechery /
And he that ouercomethe lecherye and kepethe hi^ chaaste he is hold no man.
Theyse be the words of sayntt austen in a book de december cordis


Dives. Me meruelethe much that saint austen: and you also accuse man so much
of lecherye: and put more defaut in man than in woman*


Pauper. Crist did the same / we read in the gospel. Io.viiio. that on a time
when criste satte in the temple of Jerusalem techynge the people his laws /
Thanne the scribis: and the men of law: and the phareseys brought a woman
newly taken in auoutrye: and set her by fore criste / and seyde to him al in
gyle. Master this wooman right now was take i^ auoutrye / The law of moses
byddethe us stone al such / Butte what sayeste thou thereto All this they seyde
in gyle For had he bode the^ stoned her: he had seyde ayens his own
prechynge / For his prechinge and techynge was full of mercy and pety / And if
he had seyde that she should not have be stoned thanne had be said ayens
moses law and tha^ne would they have stooned him / And therefore he seyde
neither the one ne the other. But he stouped down: and wrote with his finger
in the earth / And when he had wreten a while he set hi^ upright again and
said to them / which of you be without sin: he cast on her first the
stone / And after he stouped down and wroote in earth / And when the
accusers of the wooman herd theyse words of criste and se his writing / they
were ashamed: and went out each after other / and the eldeste went out first
/ and non of them left there / For as seye these clerks: each of them saw
in that writing all the evil sins that he hade done of lecherye of
spousebreche or of ady other sin / And each of them wend that al other
about had seen his sin / And so for dread and for shame they went out for
they saw well that they were more gyltye in lecherye than the woman and more
worthy to be stoned / But criste of his goodness wrought so / that each of
them saw there his own sin: and non other mannys: so yeuynge us ensaumple
to hyde other me^nys sin: and not defame our even christian: while there sin
is preuye / And when they were goon out for dread and shaame Thanne said
crist to the woman where be they that accused the. No man has dampened the
Lord says she that is soth no man has dampened me: Thanne criste said to her
/ Ne I shall not da^pne the / Go and be in will no more to sin


Dives. By the law she was worthy to be deed / why would thaune criste that
yaue ye the law save her


Pauper. although she were worthy to dye yet her accuserys and the people that
brought her theder were not worthy to dampne her / ne to pursue her to death /
for they were more gyltye than the woman / And therefore seythe the gloose in
that place / Though the law bid the^ be slain that be gyltye: y itt the law
will not that they should be slain by them that be gyltye in the same sin /
Butte he that is vngyltye in the same sin shall punysshe him that is giltye /
And terfore seyth the gloss: that they y^ so accused the woman: by right of
law / or they most have let her go or ellis be stoned with her for they
were more giltye in that sin than the wooman / And so by the law christ
delivered her rightfully: and saved her merciably / Therefore seythe the law of
holy church: that tho that be gil: tie in any great sin should not be take for
accusers ne witnessis in dome: no manqueller no thieves: ne wicked iogulors
robbers of churchis: rauenours: ne open lechours. ne they that be in auoutrye.
ne they that poysone folk. ne periurerys. ne false witnessys ne they that axe
counseyl of witches / Al these and such other be unable for to accuse in dome:
or to bear witness in dome: butt if it be for to accuse the^ that be there
felowys: and helpers i^ there sin m^. q^. v. co^stituimus. Et vi. q^. li. qi

dampne the errors of a another that has naught in himsylfe that is dampnable.
super Bti^ i^maculati. Et iii. q^. vii. iudicet. And therefore the law puts
many a case in which ye husbo^d may not accuse his wife of lecherye. First if
he be gyltye in the same.xxxii. q^. nichil i^iqus Also if he give her occasion

The seventh chapter.
Dives. Is a man bound to forsake his wife: when she falls in fornicacion


Pauper. Either ye fornicaco^n is p^uy or it is open / If it be preuy: and may
not be preued / he shall notte forsake her openly / ne he is notte bound to
forsake her preuely / as anentys the bed / If her fornicacion be open: either
there is hope of amendment: or there is noon hope of amendment / If she will
amend her / and there be good hope of amendment / he may lefully keep her
stylle / If there be non hope of ame^deme^t: he owes not to keep her still /
For if he do: it seems that he consenth to her sin. Sm^. con. lio.iiiio. ti.
xxii. q^. vi. quero.


Dives. May a man by his own auctoritye forsake his wife / if she fall in
fornicacioun


Pauper As anentys her bed: he may forsake her by his own auctoritye but not
anentis dweling to gydre without auctoritye of holy church And if he forsake
her company as anentis dwelling without auctorite of holy church: he shall be
compelled to dwell with her / butt he may anon preue her fornicacion / If a
man meddle with his wife after that yt he knows her fornicacion: he is
irreguler / though he be compelled thereto by holy church. Sm^. con. lio.iiiio.
tio. xxii. q^. viii. vtru^ vir. If the husbond be deperted from his wife by
auctoritye of holy church: He may if he will enter into religion without
her leeue / Butte whether he enter or nay: he is bound to contynence al her
lyffe / and he may non other wife have as long as she lives for only death
deperteth the bond of wedlok


Dives. Contra If a man wedde a woman he may enter i^to religion or he meddle
with her: and she may take another husbond and yet neither of them is deed.


Pauper. There is bodily death and gostly death: that is enter into religion /
For thanne man or woman dies ayens the world / If he meddle with her bodily:
only bodily death may depert the^ as ayens the bond of wedlok. But or that he
meddle with her bodily: goostly death that is enter i^to religion may depart
them For till when they meddle to gydre bodily: the boude of there wedlok is
but goostly / And therefore goostly death brekethe that boonde / And for as
much leeue friend as the husbonde is as well bound to keep feythe to his wiue
/ as the wife to the husbonde. therefore if the husbond trespass and fall in
fornicacion: she haehe as great accion ayens him as he should have ayens his
wife if she did amys. Quia quo ad fidem matrimonii iudica^tur ad paria.


The eight chapter.
Dives. I may well assent that auoutrye be asul grievous sin both in man and
in woman / But that simple fornicacion between syngle man and syngle woman
should be deedly sin / I may not assentt thereto And common opinion it is: that
it is no dedly sin.


Pauper. Every sin yt excludethe man or woman out of heaven is dedly sin /
but simple fornicacion excludes man and woman out of heaven but they amend
them here / therefore thanne simple fornicacion is dedly sin


Dives. Where fyndeste thou that simple fornicacion excludes man and woman
out of heaven


Pauper. In the pystle of saint poul where he seyth: that no fornicaries ne
they that do auoutrye. nesodomitis. ne thieves. ne mawmetrerys ne glotons. ne
wicked spekers. ne they that live by rauyn / shall have the kingdom of
heaven.i. ad little. vi. And in the chapter next before. he byddeth that men
should not meddle with such fornicaries and with such wicked lyuers not ete
with them ne dri^ke with them: for they be acursid of god and of all the company
of heaven / And i^ another pystle saint poule says thus. Wit ye it well and
understand ye it that no fornicarie: ne vncleene man of his body: ne falls
covetous man shall have eritage in the kyngedome of criste and of god / And
therefore seythe he / Late ye no fornicaco^n ne uncleanness ne avarice be named
in you: ne filth ne folly spech ne harlottre: but al manner oneste as it bicometh
sayntis. Ad ephe. vo. And in another place he says that god shall deem
fornicaries and them that do auoutrye. Ad hebre.xiiio. That is to seye as seyth
the gloss / God shall dampne them without end / although they wene not so but
since that god yeueth no tale of flesshly sin / And therefore saint John says
in the book of gods preuitees to fornicaries: and manquellers liers and
periureris and such other cursed folk: there part shall be i^ ye pit wellyng and
brennynge with fire and brymstone. Which is the secunde death of hell Apo^
xxio.co. And the wise man bids that thou shall not give thy soul too
fornicaries in any thing that thou lose not the and thy soul and thyn eritage
in heaven / And every woman fornica. tie: shall be trodden under foot of the
fendis as drit i^ye wey Eccle. ix c.


Dives. Contra All the p^ceptys of the secunde table be youen of god to let
wrongys that me^ should else do to there even criste^ But wha^ne a se^gle man
medleth with a sengle woman: he does no man ne woman any wrong For either of
them is in his own power


Pauper. Though each of them be in his own power / yet each of them does other
great wrong For each of them slethe other by dedly sin: and each of them sleeth
himsylfe: and each of them does wrong to god: in that they do ayens his forbode:
and slay the souls that he bought so dear: And both they do wrong to there
even criste^: in that they give the^ wicked ensaumple and matter of sclaundre


Dives. yet Contra te God seyth to every man and woman Crescite et
multiplicamini. Wexe ye and be ye multiplied. Therefore thanne if a syngle man
meddle with a syngle wooman to bring forth children: it seems to me no sin.


Pauper. God said notte tho words to every man and woman / butte only to them
that were wedded to gidre by gods law: that as they were wedded to gydre to
bring forth children: so god badde them bring forth children: God said not
tho wordys to sengle folk but to adam and eve his wife And un to Noe and his
wife / and to his sons: and there wives / And therefore Tobie said: to his
son / Attendite tibi fili mi ab omni fornicaco^ne. and cetera My son keep
the fro al ma-ner fornicacioun: ne meddle with non wooman: but only with thy
wife. Tobie. quarto. capitulo. And saint poule says Mortificate membra vestra
que sunt super terram. Sle ye your synful membrys that be open etthe / Slay ye
fornicacion. uncleanness. lecherye / These be the membrys that he byddethe us
sle. not the pertyes of our body / as the gloss says And the gloss says
also / That every liynge with a woman out of lawful wedlok is cleped
fornicacion. and forbode as dedly sin / And therefore god badd in the old
law: that if the priests doughtir were take in fornicacion: she should be
brent. Leuytici xxio.co And if any other ma^nys doughtir: fell into fornicacion
in her faders house or she were wedded / she should be stoned to death. Deu.
xxii.c Therefore god would yt his mother marie should be wedded or he were
conseyued of her. For if she had be found with child out of wedlok: the
iewys should have stoned her without mercy / And if it were leful to syngle
man and syngle wooman to meddle to gydre and gendre: god had made matrymony in
vain and there would no man knytte him vndepartably to any wooman if he might
without sin meddle with what wooman he would Therefore crist in the gospel
da^pnethe simple fornicacion and al manner lecherye: and says that who so
lokethe on any woman: in will to meddle with her out of matrymonye: he does
lecherye ayens gods commaundementt and synneth dedly / Mat. vo.co. And
therefore as I seyde first generation: and bringing forth of children is
granted only to them that be wedded too gydre lawfully.


The nynth chapter.
Dives. Be al wedded folk bound by this precept of god Crescite et
multiplicamini: to do there diligence to byget children:


Pauper. Before manki^d was multiplied: wedded folk were bound to do there
deligence to bring forth children / Butte now that mankind is multiplied /
the precept byndeth them not so much to generation / But they be fre to
contine^ce and keep them chaste: if they be both of one assent thereto / For many
skyllys god ordained that man and woman should not meddle to gydre but they
were wedded to gydre. For by auoutrye and fornicacion falls full often that ye
brother lies by his sustre and the fader by his daughter / And many an
vnlawfulle wedlok is made by cause of anoutrie / And he yt does auoutrye he is
a thief and rob the man or woman of his body yt is better tha^ any worldly
catel For the wives body is the husbondis body: and his body is her body / For
neither of them has power of his own body: to give it to any other by
flesshly lust And he that does fornicacion he robs crist of his right both
bodily and goostlye / And therefore saint poule says. that the lechoure takes
the membre of criste and makes it ye membre of ye stru^pet with whom he
medleth.i. ad little. vio Also by auoutrye be made false eyris: and true eirys
truly bigote put out of there eriatcte Also by auoutrye gods law yt he made
so solempnely in the beginning of the word first of al laws: is broken /
And therefore he that breketh it: is an open traitoure / To this accords ye
words of the wise man: where he seyth that the woman which forsakes her
husbonde / and take / another: and makes eritage of another matrimony does
many sins First she is misbileuynge to goddis law / and brekethe gods law.
Also she trespaseth ayens her husbond / Also she does fornicacion in auoutry /
and makes children to her of another man But her sons shall give no rotis and
there branches shall give no fruit She shall leeue there mind in cursynge and her
shame shall never be do a wey. Eccle. xx.iii.c. And therefore seith ye gloss yt
auoutry is as damnable in the man as i^ the woman / And therefore in the same
chapter he repreueth auoutrie and fornicaco^n i^ man full highly


The tenth chapter.
Dives. Reason and holy wryt dryueth me to grant: yt both auoutrye and simple
fornicaco^n be full grievous sin but more grievous is auoutrye: And feign I would
keep me fro both sins But wymen be ye fendis snare. and so tempte me to
lecherye. that it is full hard too me to keep me / Adam sompsonem Petrum David
and Salomonem Femina decepit: qs modo tutus erit. Woman deseyued adam. sampson
petir. david and salomo^ / who may tha^ne be syker fro womans gyle:


Pauper Many a man has be deseyued by wicked wymen: more by his own folythan
be disseyte of wymen But many more wymen have be deseyued by malice of me^:
than ever were me^ deseyued by malice of wymen / And therefore the wooman
lechoure is cleped ye snare of ye fe^d ye hu^tith after mannys soul. For the
wise man seyth. Inueni amariorem morte mulierem etc. I have found woman more
bitter than death / Such is the snare of the hu^ter: her heart is a net and her
handys be hard boondys / He that pleseth god shall escape her: butte the synful
man shall be take of her Eccle. viio.c. But men be cleped not only the snare of
the fe^d but also they be cleped his net spread abroad on the hill of thabor for
to take many at oones Osee vo. Mannys malice is cleped a net spread a broad on
an high hyl for it is open and bodily don: notte in a few: but in many / And
therefore wha^ne holy wryt spekethe: of the malice of men: he speaks in the
plurel noumbre as to many / But when he repreuethe the malece of woman he
speaks in the synguler noumbre: as to few: in token that there be more
shrewes of men than of wymen: and commonly more malice i^ me^ than in wymen: al
though su^me woman be full malicious. Fightyng robberye. manslaughter open
lechery. glotenye. gyle falsnesse periuri tratoury. false contriuynge. and
such other orryble sins: reign more in man tha^ in woman / This false
excusacion that excuse so there sin by the malice of wymen: byganne first in
adam and lost adam and al mankind: For synfullye he excused his sin by woman
wha^ god vndernam him of his sin and put woman in defaute / Also he put god
in defaute that made woman and answered full proudly: as men do these days and
said to god / The woman yt thou yaue to me to be my fellow yaue me of the tree
and I ete thereof / As who seyth / Haddeste thou not youen her to be my fellow I
should not have sinned / And so notwithsto^ddynge that he was more i^ defaut
than the woman: yet he would not knoulege any defaute. butte he put woman and
god principaly that made woman in defaute.


Dives Hou was adam more in defaute than woman.


Pauper. For to him principaly god yaue the precepte that he should not ete of
that tree: and eve knew it not but by adam / woman was tempted by the fend
wonderfully in the adder which wentt that time right up: And had a face
like a wooman. As saint bid and the master of stories. And she was dysseyued
with his fair by heestes and his falsse sly speech For he hight her that they
should notte dye: but be as gods kunnynge good and evil: Adam had no
temptacioun from outward but asimple word of his wife that proffered him ye
apple / For we find not that she said to hi^ any deseiuable word And therefore
sith man was forbode of gods mouth: and she not but by man. and man had
less temptacion than wooman. and thereto in no thing would accuse himsilfe: ne
yield him gylty but put defaute al in wooman and in god therefore he sinned more
than woman: For woman yield / her ^tyltye. but she a^sed no mercy She made no
such excusaco^n but in great perty yielded her gyltye. in that she said: the
adder has deseyued me / For in that she knowlegyd that she was deseyued she
knowlegide that she had do amys and unwisely and otherwys tha^ she ought have
do / And for that woman lowede her and knowlegide her vnwisdom and her folly:
therefore god put in woman that time an hope of our salvation when he said to
ye adder I shall put enmitye bitwene the and woman: end bitwene thy sede and her
sede: and she shall break thyn heed that was the fe^de which was heed and leder
of the adder that time / The sede of the fend be wicked works and wicked
folk: to whom god seyde in the gospel / Vo^ ex perte diabolo estis. Io. viii.
ye be of the fader the fend / The seed of the woman goostly be her good
dedys / with which the fend and ye fendys lymes have great envy And commonly
wymen more orribilitie of sin than do men And by our lady blessed mote she
be: the fendys power is destroyde / Also the sede of woman is criste borne of
the maid marie without part of man / And so there was never man properly sede
of woman but crist alone / and always is enmitye between criste and the fend
and his seed / For as saint poule says criste and belial. light and
derkenesse may not acorde / For this skill saint poule says. that adam was not
deseyued in the first priuaricaco^n: but woman was deseyued.i. ad thi^.ii And
therefore as seyth the gloss wha^ne god vndernam adam he said not that the
wooman had deseyued me: as the woman said the adoer has deseyued me. butt he
said the woman yaue me of the tree. and I have eten / And also as the gloss
says there / ada^ was so wis yt he might not bileue ye fe^dys tales ne be
deseyued i^ yt manner / as ye woman was And for ye woman was not so wise as adam
was therefore she bileued ye fe^dis tales and so was deseyued / And ye wyser that
adam was: the more was his sin wha^ne he fell But al though adam was not
deseyued fro outward by another: he was deseyued fro inward by hi^silfe by
preuy pride as says saint austen. de ci^. lio.xiiii. co.xiii. Where he says
that adam and eve bygu^ne first to be wicked i^warde: by which preuy
wycked^nesse they fell in open vnobedience / For as he says there Pride is
beginning of every sin. Inicium omi^s peccati superbia Eccle. xo. And as
solomon says Contricionem p^cedit superbia: and ante ruinam exaltatur sp^c.
prou. xvio: Before brekynge and brisure goth pride. and before open falling
the sprite of a man and a woman is enhaunsyd by pride And therefore says saint
austen in the same chapter that both adam and eve were wicked: and deseyued by
pride: and well let of them silfe before they ete of ye tree / For preuy
falling inward went before / open falling outewarde by inobedience: and so
adam was deseyued and fell by pride or eve yaue him the apple and eve was
deseyued by pride or ye serpent deseyued her. For as seythe saint austen vbi.
sm^. they coueted more excellence and hiyher degree than god ordained them to /
They both sinned grievously: but adam more grievously as I said first And therefore
saint poul says / not al men dyed through the sin of eve but through the
sin of adam Ne god said not to adam: Cursed be the earth in eues sin ne he
seyde: Cursed be the earth in your sin / But to adam alone he said. Cursed
be the earth in thy work and in thy sin / And therefore says saint ambrose.
super lucam. That eve sinned more by freelte / and vnstablete and
chau^geabletie than by shrewednesse. Mobilitate magis animi quam p^uitate
peccauit: Crist bycam not woman: but man to save mankind / That as mankind
was lost by man: so ma^kynd should be saved by man / And therefore in manhede he
would die for mankind: for manhed had lost mankind. And also he bycam man and
not woman to save the order of kind. And for yt womans sin was less grievous
than ada^s sin: and less dered mankind. and woman was les infect i^ the
first priuaricaco^n tha^ was man: therefore god took his ma^hed only of woman
without part of man / And so i^ yt he bycam man: he did great worship to man.
But i^ yt he took his ma^hede only of woman without part of man he did great
worship to woman For only of woomans kyn: he made medycyne to the syne of adam:
and to hele mamkynde of the hard sikenes of adams sin


The eleueth chapter*
Dives. Thy wordys be wonderful / Butte I can not ayensaye the for dread of
our lady mother and maid that gate grace to mankind and is our help in
every need / But yet I seye as I seyde first woman disseyued sampson yt was so
strong


Pauper. Woman disseyued him not til he had disseyued himself. by lechery and
misgouernaunce of himsilfe / First he wedded an hethen woman aye^s gods law.
and ayens the will of his fader and mother: for lust and mysloue that he hade
to her / After that he lay by a common woman: that was hethen / And after that
he took another hethen woman to his concubyne that hight dalida wiche full
disseyued him and brought him to his death / He was false to god / and wymen
were false to hi^ wymen sey that he was by sotted upon them. and therefore they
treted him as a sot / He disseyued hi^silfe and did full vnwysly: wha^ne he
suffered a woman to bind him amongys his enemies and told an hethen woman his
counseyle and in what thing his enemies might most dear him / And all
though god turned his folly dedys to the worship of god and of gods law: yet
sampson was not excused thereby for he did much amys and much folly / Also
david was deseyued by his mys lust: and his lecherye. not by the woman bersabee
as thou seydest in thy veers / For thus we read in holy wryt in the secunde
^oke of kings.xi cao. That on a time when king david roos from his sleep
after mydday and romed in his soler of his paleyse: he saw a fair woman wassh
her in her soler. he knew not the wooman ^ne the woman thought not on him ne
knew not of his wicked will as the book shows there A non he sentt after this
wooman and when she came to him: he lay by her: and bygate her with child /
and non as he knew that she was with child. to hide his si^ne he sent after her
husbond vrie. yt should come home and meddle with his wife yt ye child should be
named to hi^ and not to david / And for ye godeknyght would not come home at
his wife ne use lust of his body whylys gods ooste lay i^ the feelde in
seege of a cetye that hight rabath: david sent him again with letters of his
death to ioab the prince of the ooste / and traytourly did hi^ sle / Here
mighteste thou se that david was oucome with lechery and deseyued by the fend
/ or the woman came to him / For as criste says in the gospel / For who so
lokethe on a woman in will to do amys with her: anon he has do lechery and
forsetteth ayens this commandment Non mechaberis David looked on that wooman
in will to do lechery: when the woman thought non evil / He sent after her as
after his lege woman and she wyste not why And when she came to him as to her
king he lay by her synfully. for it was full hard to her to let him / Also
peter forsook christ in time of his passion and ran awey fro christ. or any
wooman spoke to him ye time and so he deseyued himsilfe: and the woman deseyued
him notte. She did her office / For she was vsshere and keeper at the door / as
says the gloss and saint gregori and she seyde to him that he was one of
cristys disciplis as she seide soth For she was bound that she should let non
of cristys disciplis enter / And ano^ at the first word he forsook criste and
said that he knew him not / And not only woman did saint peter forsake criste
in this manner / but me^ said to him the same wordis and for dread he forsook
crist sone after and suore that he knew him not And therefore if it be repreue to
woman ye woman made saint peter forsake criste: as much repreefe it is to men
and much more / For all though he forsook criste at ye woman's word yet he
swore not therefore ne forswore him til men seyde to him the same wordys. M^
xxvi.co and m.xiiiioco. Also salomo^ disseyued himsilfe or any woman disseyued
him. For he took to hi^ many hethen women of false bileue to have his lust /
He sought them: they sought not him / He wyste well that it was ayens gods
law a king to have so many wives and concubines as he had For god bad ye
kings of his people should not have many wives. ne multiplye them many
horsys in greuaunce of the people ne multiply to him great weyghtys of gold
and silver in disease of the people: as holy wryt shewethe well. Deutronomio
xviio. capitulo. Also it was forbode to him and to al other so to cumpanye
wythen wymen And ayens all this did Solomon in high offense of god. Solomon
sought the cu^pany of hethen wymen / The wimen were stable in there false
byleeue. He was unstable in his right bileue and followed her false byleeue: and
forsook gods law in great pertye / and worshipped false gods Lecherye
ouercam him long or many of the wymen knew him And so be men right these
days. overcome with lecherye with out womannis cumpanye and without doing
of wymen For as criste says in the gospel who so looks on a woman in will to
do amys with her / though she thenketh not on him: he does lechery / And if
he handle her or smell her or speak to her or go to her: or seek by wilys. or by
sleyghtys to have his lust of her / though the woman consent not to him and
though he be let of his wicked will: yet he is gyltye in lecherye / and does
ayens this camau^dement of god Non mechaberis Men lechours gone and ride fro
town to town to get wymen: after there lust / They seek the wymen: and not
the wymen them They cast many wyles to get woman's assent i^ sin Men
commonly beworchers and bygi^ers of lecherye and tha^ne whether ye woman assent
or not assente: yet the man is gyltye / And for often time it fallethe that
when men wend be seker of the woomans assent thanne the wooman will not
assent for dread of god and if she assented before and hight the man to follow
his lust and after repents her and withdrawethe her from his wicked cumpanye
tha^ne shall the lechours man diffame al wimen and sey that they be false and
deseyuable / For such lechours speak most vylenye of wymen: for they may not
have there foul lust of them at will and for they may notte defoule them with
there bodies: they defoule them with there tu^ges: and speak of them full evil and
defame them falsely: and procure to them the harm that they may. Exaumple we
have in the book of Danyel. xiiio.co. of the good woman susanne and of two
falls old prestis that were iugys and gouernourys of the people for ye year /
which by one assent waited to have this woman aloone in her gardeyne / wha^ne
she should go to wasshe her: as the manner was thanne / And for she would not
assent to there wickedness but cried after help: anon they cried ayens her / And
when men come: They said that they fond her liynge with a young man.

And so falsely dampnedde her to death: for they might not do there foul
lust with her / But at the prayer of susa^ne god sent daniel his prophet and
took the^ and conuecte them in there falsehede and sloughe them and saved
susanne / we find also in ye secunde book of kings.xiii.o capi. That aamon
the son of david feyned him seek and prayde his fader david yt thamer his
suster might come and keep him And wha^ne she was come he spoke to her for to
lygh by her: butte she would not asse^t / And tha^ne he opp^ssed her: and so
defouled his own suster / And anon he hated her more than ever he loved her.
before / because that she would not assent to him / And spitfully put her out
of his chaumbre and did shete the door after her / For this deed aamon was
slain sone after of his brother absolon.


The xii. chapter.
Dives. And yet many a woman will assent to lust of flesh full lightly if it
be profryd.


Pauper. That is sothe / But wymen be not so ready to assente as me^ be to
profre it And he that profereth it and bigi^neth: he asse^teth first and is
more in defaute


Dives. Thou excuseste much wymen: and acuseste men


Pauper. I accuse no good man: butt lecherous men: ne I excuse no wicked woman
but good wyme^ that be falsely defamed of lechery not only in there persons /
but in there kind generaly / For the proud malice of man defameth unskillfully
the kind of woman And as adam did put his sin on womon and would not excuse
his own malice to get mercy.


Dives. Solomon speaks much evil of wymen.


PAuper. And solomon speaks much good of wymen / For he said Mulier timens
dm^: ipsa laudabitur. The woman that dredith god she shall be preysed. Solomon
repreueth wicked wymen: and praysethe good wymen / and he repreuethe wicked men
and preisethe good men


Dives. Salomo^ seythe. Dm^s malacia nequicia mulieris. Breuis est om^is
malicia super maliciam mulieris Eccle. siastici xxvo. The wickedness of woman
is al malice / / And every malice is short above ye malice of woman.


Pauper. Soth it is when women give them to shrewidnes: they be full
maliciouse. And when they give the^ to goodness: they be full good. and
therefore the wise man i^ the next chapter. folowi^g prayseth wime^ full much and
says. that blessed is that man that has a good woman to his wife / His yeris
shall be doubled. he shall end his yeris in pees / A good woman is a good part:
in a good part of them that dread god / And she shall be youen to a man for
his good dedys / The grace of the besy wooman shall like her husbond / and make
his bones fat / Her disciplyne and her norture. is the gift of god And the
holy woman and chaaste is grace upon grace And as the son shynynge lightneth
the world in ye heyght of ye day so ye beauty of a good wooman is in confort
and array of her husbonde / And as golden peleris set on sylu basys so be siker
feet on the solys of the stable wooman. And endless grounds on a seker stone:
be gods co^mau^deme^tis in the heart of an holy woman. Fundamenta eterna
super petra^ solidam: mandata dei in cord mulieris sancte. Eccle: xxvi.co.


Dives. Solomon says Vinu^ et mulieres apostatare faciu^t sapientes Eccle.
xixo. wine and wymen make wise men to dote. and forsake goddis law and do amys


Pauper. And yet there is no defaute in the wine: ne often time in the woman / But
defaute is in him that unwisely use the wyn and unwisely uses the woman and
other gods creaturys / Thoghe thou drink wine till thou artte drunken and
falleste in lecherye by thy glotenye: the wine is not to blame: but thou yt
can not or wylt not mesure thysylfe: And though thou look on a woman and art
caught i^ her bewtye: and assenteste to do amys: the woman i^ case is not to
blame: ne her bewtye not to lack that god has youen her But thou art to
blame that no better kepeste thyn hertt from wicked thoughtys / Butte there
thou shuldeste preyse god: thou thenkeste evil: and misusseste gods fair
creature in offense of god there thou shuldeste preyse him: And if thou felest
ye tempted by the sight of woman: keep thy sight better / And if her dalyaunce
stire the to lechery: fle her company / For ayens lecherye fleght is best
fight / Thou art fre to goo awey fro her: no thing bi^deth ye to do lechery but
thy lechours heart.


The xiii. chapter.
Dives. Woman's array styreth much folk to lecherye.


Pauper. Although i^ case ye array and the atyre is not to blame no more than is
her bewte: yet by common course of kind both man and woman seek to be onestly
arrayed after there estat and after there degree: and after the custo^ of the
cuntre that they dwell in not to tempt folk to lechery: ne for pride ne for
non other sin but for onestie of mankind and to the worship of god: to whose
likeness man and woman is made / And he is our brother: and this is the
custom of good folk But if they do it for pride / or to tempte folk to
lecherye or for any other sin or yt they took on the^ atyre yt is not
according to them if it be to cost full or to strange in shap. or to wide or
to side not rewled by reason: they sin full grievously in the syghte of god /
And namely tho men that cloth them so short: that man and wooman may se the
form of the shap of there preuy membrys which be shameful to show and the
sight is great cause of temptaco^n and of wicked thoughtis Saint poule byddeth
that wymen should atyre them in onest array with shamefastness: and
sobrenesse. not in broydynge of there here: not in gold and sylu ne in perrie
ne in ouerdon clothe.i: ad thy iio. And the same seythe saint peter in his
first pistle iiio.co. where he byddeth that me^ should have there wives in
worship and keep them onestly.


Dives. Wymen these days array them full much ayens the techi^ge of Peter and
Poule / and therefore I dread me: that they sin full grievously


Pauper. Peter and Poule forbid not utterly such array / But they forbydde
wyme^ such array to use in pride: or to provoke folk to lechery and to use
such array passing there estate / or for an evil end / For we find that saint
cecilie and many other holy wyme^ went arrayed in clothys of gold and in rich
perrie and wered the hair under ye solemn atyre / And Peter and Poule said
tho wordys pryncipaly for time of prayer. as for lent: ymbre days gangedayes.
fridays: vigilies / and in time of general precessdn made for need In such time
namely man and woman should leeue al tokens and signs of pride in array / For
as the gloss says: there proud clothing gettethe no good of god: and makes
folk to deem amys: namely if it pass mesure and good manner / The pricipal
entenco^n of saint poule there he says tho wordys: is to enfourme men and
wymen in prayer For whom they should pray why and hou. and where they shall p^y
as says the gloss / And he enformethe them to prey in lowness: without pomp
of clothyng and of great array / For I am syker: that the foul stynkyng pomp
and pride of array that is now used in this land in all three pertyes of the
church. that is to sey in the feudorys and in clergy: and in comoners. Will
not be vnuenged. But if it be sone amended: by verry renpentaunce and
forsakynge of this sin / For fro the higheste unto the loweste in: every
staate and in every degree and nigh hond in every person: is now array passing
to mannys body and woman's ayens all reason and the law of god


Dives. Sith it is so that man is more pryncipal in order of kind tha^ is
woman. and more stable and mighty and of higher discrecion by course of kind
than is woman and should as thou haste well seyde be more virtuous and stable in
goodness than woman: hou may it be that wymen keep the^ often more chaste. and be
more stable in goodness than man / For we se that when men take the^ to be
ankeris and reclusys. With inn few yerys commonly either they fall in reusys.
or eresyes or they break out for womans love. or for irkyede of there life / or
by some gile of ye fend But of wime^ ancris so inclusid is seldom her de any of
these defautys but holely they begi^ne and holely they end


Pauper. Man by wey of kind is more stable than is woman and of more
discrecion but by grace wymen be often more stable in goodness than be men and
have better discrecion i^ goodness than many a man.


Dives. Why so


PAuper For men trust to much in themsilfe and trust not in god as they aught
to do: wymen knowinge there freelte trust not in themsilfe. but only in god and
commend them more too god than do men often time / And the wise man seith
Iniciu^ sapiencie timor domini. prou. ix.co: ps. no. The dread of the lord is
beginning of wisdom / For who so dredethe god with love dread as the good
child the fader: that love dread shall teache him what is plesaunt to god: and
what may displese him / And it shall make him besy to do his plesaunce. and to
lef his offense / And commonly wha^ne men bicome ancrys they do it more for ye
world than for god. They do it for ipocrisie: to have a name of holiness and of
wisdom. or for couetise to get good or be out of obedience: and at there own
will. to ete and to dri^ke: wake and sleep when the^ lykethe. and to do as
them lykethe / For there shall no man repreue them thereof: ne wit whether
they do well or evil: or whether they pray or not pray And commonly men ancrys
have more dalyaunce with the world both with men and wymen: tha^ ever had
they or they were ancrys / And though they were lewed foolys before: tha^ne men
hold them wise. and axe of them doubtys of concie^ce and of thi^gges that be
too come. of which things they kun no skyl And yet what they seye. the people
takethe it for gospel. and so they deseyue many a man and many a wooman. And
sithe they ground them all in pride in ypocrisie and in couetyse: and trust
in themsylfe more than in god therefore he sufferethe the fend have power over
them. and desease them and bring them to wicked end / But wymem take often
that state for no such end: butt only for god / And they seeing there own
freelte commend them to god / And therefore god keeps them so: that the
fend may not desese them in such manner: ne disseyue them / we redel holy
wrytt. Gen^. xiio. and.xx.co. That when abrahm^ came into strange londys he
badde his wife saray that she should not be aknow that she was his wife: but
seye that she was his sustre / For she was so fair a wooman that he wyste well
that men should coueyte her for her bewetye / And if they wend that she were
his wife: they should slay him: To have her at will / For auoutrye was harder
punysshed than manslaughter / And therefore to save his life abrahm^ said: and
badde her seye that she was his sustre / For as seyth doctor de lyra abraham
wyste well that she was a good wooman: and had such an au^gel to keep her that
no man should have power to defoule her / and so it byfel / For anon she was
take and led to the king of egypt and kept there ye in kings court long
time: And abraham fared well by cause of her / But god sent such sykenasse to
the king and to his wives and to his concubynes. and to all his household that
they had no might ne liking too defoule her / Thanne the king axed his
priests: and masters of the law / why ye desese fell unto him: and to his
household / And they by reuelacion of god. said. that it was for the pilgrymes
wife / And tha^ne the king let him goo with worship / we read also that
abraham had two sons. ysmael. of agar his servant. and ysaac of sara his
wife / Abraham loved well ysmael / for he was the elder son On a time sara saw
ysmael: pleye with her son ysaac: not goodly: she was mispayde: and said to
abraham: that he should put ysmael and his mother agar out of household: For
ysmael said she should have no part of eritage with my son isaac Abraham
bare full heavy of these words: for he loved much ysmael / Thanne god said to
Abraham Thake it not so hard ne so sharply that sara said to the of thy
child: and of thy servant agar / Butte in all thing that sara says too
the: here byr voice. and do thereafter. And thanne abraham putt them out
household: Full much ayens heart / And so not withsto^ding that abraham was
so nyghe god that he was cleped gods friend / yet as for thanne his wife
knew more of goddis will than did he / Also we read of Isaac and rebecca his
wife that they had two sons borne at onns which were Esau and Jacob ysaac
loved better Esau tha^ Jacob / But Rebecca loved betr^ Jacob ^han esau: and so
did god And by techyng of the holy ghost she begyled ysaac and esau also: and
did ysaac give his pryncypal blessing to Jacob: there he would have youen it
to Esau: and al was goddys deed and so confermed by god / that when ysaac
wyste of gyle: yet he durst not withdraw his blessing For he saw well that it
was gods will and gods doing And therefore he said to esau weeping for he
was so begyled / Benedixi ei:et erit benedictus I have blessed hi^ and he
shall be blessed.


The xiiii. chapter.
Dives. I assent well that by grace a wooman may be as stable in chastitye: in
goodness as a man And without grace neither man ne woman may keep him chaste /
For the flesh both of man and woman is full freel and full ready to fall / And
therefore I pray the tech me some remedy ayens the temptaco^n of of lecherye.


Pauper. One remedy is reasonable abstynece from mete and drink. and for to
flee deynte metys and deynte drynkes. and to flee gloteny as most bygynnynge
and mean to lecherye. And therefore glotenie is forbode by this commandment as
mean and wey to lecherye / Another remedy is hard liynge watch: and
travail. that the body have not to much ese. but be well ocupyed / For the
wise man says that idylshyp has taught much malice / Multam enim maliciam
do cuit ociositas: Therefore says he. Right as to the ass longethe fedynge /
yerde and birdeyn so to the servant yt is to seye to the flesh that should be
sugett and servant to the soul. longs dread and chastisyng and work of good
ocupacioun Eccle. xxxiii^. And god says ye pride and plentye of bread: and
welfare and plentye of rychessys and idelshy^e. Were cause of the wickedness
of Sodemitys: and of there lecherye. and for they loved not pore folk. Ezechi.
xvi.c^. And therefore almesdede is a / great remedy ayens lecherye to get
grace of chastytie. so that it be youen to the pore nedye: that is in
myscheffe. and to such that have not bykynd to get there lyuelo de by traueyle
of there body and if they beg they do it with out avarice: with meekness.
and clennesse of living: to such bid death criste do alms seiynge. Date
elimosina^: et ecce omi^a munda sunt vobis. Luce: give ye alms. and lo al
things be clean to you: if ye will amend you / and another remedy is a man to
have mind of his death: and thenke hou he shall wend hense. With bitter pain.
and tha^ne al his lust shall turn into woe and so rewe and thenke. that by man
or wooman never so fair: so well farynge. so hole: so lusty: so liking to the
iye. so mighty so witty. so great of lynage. so rych so great of name. or of
lordshyp. Either by man either woman. he ever so plesau^te: shall die: and turn
to earth and aisshis and worms mete And if he smell now never so sweet: he shall
sti^k than full sour. Therefore the wise man seythe. In omnibus operibus tuis
memorare nouissima tua and i^eter number non peccabis Eccle. vii^ c. In all these
works thenk on thy last things: and thou shall not do no sin without end:
we read that in england was a king that had aconc^byne. Whose name was rose /
And for her great bewte he cleped her rose amou^de Rosa mundi / that is to
say / rose of the world / For him thought that she passed al wymen i^ bewtye
/ It bifel that she died and was buried while the king was absent / And when
he came again for great love: that he had to her he would se the body in the
grave And when the grave was ope^ned there sat an orrible tode upon her
breast between her teetys: and afoule adder bigirt her body about in the middle
/ And she sta^ke so that the king ne non other might stand to se that orryble
sight / Thanne the king did shette again the grave / and did write these two
veersis upon ye grave Hic iacet in tu^ba rosa mu^di non rosa munda. Non redolet
sed olet quod redolere solet That is thus to sey i^ englissh / Here lyethe in
grave rose of the world but not clean rose / She smells not sweet but
stynketh full foul that sumtyme smelled full sweet And another remedy ayens
lecherye is that a man and woman keep well there fine wits that a man keep well
his ho^dys and his body from mys touching. his ^erys fro misherynge. that he
he: re no tales of lecherye / ne foul spech / For saint poule says.
Corru^piunt bonos mores colloquia praua.i. ad little. xvo. Wicked spech
destroys chastytye and good thewys / Also he most keep well his sight. taking
exau^ple of Job which made acouenannt with his iyen. that he should not thenke
on amayde^ to have mys lyki^g i^ the thought And ye prophet Ieremye said yt
his iye had robbed his soul in the woman of his cetye trenorum. iiio. For
theyse skyllys the prophet said: that death is entered by our windouys that is
to say / by our five wyttys which be wyndouys* and wikettys to the soul.
Ieremye ixo co. And another remedy is a man to keep well his heart from idel
thoughtys / and from wyckedd things. For as criste says in the gospel. out
of the he^^ cowycked thoughtys: ma^slaught. auoutrye fornichcion. the^^ ^^^s
witness. blasphemye. Mxvo. And therefore seyth the wysman. Omni custodia serua

The xv. chapter.
ANother remedy ayens ye temptacion of lecherye is devotion and mind of
crystys passion / Far as says saint gregori / there is non so hard
temptacion. but that man should over come esily enough. if he thought enteerly
on cristys passion / we find in gestys that on a time a great kings son
loved well a pore wooman / For though she were pore / yet she was fair and
plesaunt in berynge / The kings son took her to his paramoure and wedded
her / wherefore his fader and nigh all his kyn was myspayde. For them thought yt
he was much disperachid by her. Wherefore he seeing that his kynred bare so heavy
of his marriage: he went into fer lands and yaue. him to arms / and what he
might win with his sword he sent it home to his wife: saving his worship
and his living / In every journey he had the better of his enemies and so his
name bigan to spring fer and wide. At the last he ca^ i^ so hard feight al
though he had the maystery yet he was so wounded. that nedys he must dye /
Thanne he sent home his sharte full of woundys: and of holys: and al forbledde
to his wife with alettre under his seal saiynge in this wise / Cerne
cicatrices: vetris vestigia pugne. Quesiui proprio sa^guine qicquid habes.
Byhold my woundys and have them in thy thought / For all the goodis that be
thine with my blood I have them bought And when this woman saw this sharte.
and read the lettre she fell down i^ swowne And wha^ she was releued she heng
up this sherte i^ a preuy place of her chamber. and when ever any man came to
her to speak of wedding or of flesshly lust: she went i^to her chaumbre and
looked on his sharte. and came out again styffe and steadfast in her husbondis
love that was ded: and denied the^ there axynge. seiyng in this manner / while I
have his blood i^ my mind / That was to me so good and kind / Shall I never
husbonde take / But him that dyed for my sake. And thus she kept her in
clennesse and chastitye all her life for love of her husbonde. that dyed for
her love By this pore woman that was so fair is understand mannys soul and
woman's which is made too the lykenes of god / But it was made full pore through
the sin of adam / By the kings son is understand criste gods son
which loved so much mannys soul that as says saint Poule he auentisshed
himsilfe and dispariched himsilfe into the likeness of aseruant: and married to
him our kind and mannis soul and lived here two and thritty winter and more
in much woe to wi^ne the love of mannys soul and faught ayens the feude. the
flesh and the word that be alwey besy to lose mannys soul. And alwey he
had the maystry: by might of the godhed / But on good friday he came in so fell
a fight with that tyrant ye fend of hell ye though he had the maistry: yet he
was so forwounded. yt by wey of ma^hod which he took of the maid nedely he
must dye / And tha^ he sent home a lettre of love to his spouse ma^nys soul
seiyng as the knight said. Cerne citatrices etc. Behold my woundys and have
them i^ thy thought. For all ye godis yt be thine with my blood I have them bought
/ For why all the joy and blis that we should have in heaven and all the grace
and goodness that we have here in earth. al have we by virtue of cristis
passion. For but he would have died for onre sake else should we have layne in
hell pain without end / By this shirte full of woundys and so blodye I
understood his blesful body For as ma^nis body is clad i^ his shert so the
godhed was clothed in the blesful body of criste / which bodi was al blody and
so full of wou^dys: yt as shyth the prophet Isaie. i.c. Fro the sole of the
foot to ye top of the head there was no hole place in his body / Therefore ^^ue
friend I pray you hang ye this shertte in a preuye place of your chaumbre:
that is to say Set ye crystys passion enterly in your heart: and whonne the
fend: the world. or the flesh. or any wicked man or woman. bygynneth to
temp^e you to sin: anon wend ye to your heart and look ye on this shert /
Thenke hou that blesful body was born of the maid marye wytheoute sin and
sorrow and never did amys / Thenke hou it was forrent and fortorne / byspeted
for our sin and our sake: and not for his own gylt / and if ye do so and
thenke enteerly on cristis passioon / ye shall lightly ouerco^ every temptacion.
and have the better patience in tribulacion. Whefor an holy man says thus
Reminiscens sacrati sanguinis. quem effudit amator hominis / effundendo
lacrimas: Non est locus ingratitudinis. vbi torre^s tante dulcedinis atti^git
ai^as etc. When I thenke on cristis blood / that he shed upon the rode I let
terys smert. What man may be unkind That cristis blood has in mind. enteerly
i^ his heart Sweet Jesus christ what is thy gylt That thou thus for me art
spylt. flower of vnlothfulnes. I am a thief and thou dieste I am gyltye and
thou obeyste all my wickedness why yaueste thou so much for thyn what wi^nest
thou with thine hard pain: rich in bliss above: Love thyn heart so deep
has sought That pain of death letteh ne naught to wi^ne mannys love Another
remedy ayens lechery is redynge and daliaunce of holy writ and of holy mennys
lives / And therefore sei^t Ierom says ad rusticum monachum Ama scienciam
scripturarum and carnis vicia non amabis Love kunnynge of holy writ and of
gods law: And thou shall notte love vices of the flessh. And therefore god
says / No^ videbit me homo et vinet. Exo. xxxiiio. There shall no man se me by
devotion and live flesshely / For noothynge sleeth so much the lust of the
flesh as devotion / and the^ke of god / and study in gods law / And a
another remedy is to thenke on hell pain / For as seyth saint Thomas de
veritate theology In hell shall be ouerdon hete of fire and gnasti^g of teeth for
cold and for pain derkenes and smoke and bitter weeping. Without end /
Rorynge and belewynge of foul fendes. Wepi^g and weylynge sobbing and
sighynge of synful soulys / and endless repreue of there sins endless dread.
endless thirst stenche / light thundre and worm of conscience boondys. presoun.
dread. shame wantyng of the blisful sight of gods face / and woo without any
hope of any welthe: There men shall seek death and not find it / and wisshe that
they hade never be borne / And as saint Bernard in his meditacions seythe /
there shall be hard weeping and groging of teeth roryng of feendys: and hidous
thunder There there sight shall be foul. Wormys todys adders: and orryble faces
of the fe^des and misshape things. there wicked worms shall gnawe the heart
rotys. there shall be sorrow and sighynge: and orrible dread There synful
wretchys shall bre^ne in the fire without end / In there body they shall be
turme^ted by fire and in there soul by worm of conscience: There shall be death
without death For alweye they shall be in diyng and i^ utter pain and may not
die / butt alwey live in diynge / There smelling shall be filled with orrible
stenche. for there shall be no hope But when they be i^ these pains ten
hundred year: yet there pain is new al to begin And therefore if love of god:
ne mede i^ heaven styreth us not to fle lecherye and al other sins / let us
fle lechery and all other sins for dread of endless pain.

The xvi. chapter.
And another remedy aye^s lechery is to thenke of ye hard vengeaunces ye god
has take for lechery First take heed what ve^geau^ce god has take for
simple fornicacion we find in holy wryt Gen^. xxxiiiio. that dyua ye daughter
of Jacob went fro home to se ye wymen of that cuntre: and to se there atyre Tha^
sychem the son of emor: prince y^ cu^tre went and defouled this dyua by might
And not withsto^dyng his besines for to have weded her yet he was slain for
his lechery and his fader. and all the men of that cetye. and that cetie
destroyed / we read also i^ holy writ Numeri xxvo. For that the children of
israel did lechery with the wimen of moab. god was offended And bad mooses
take the princes of his people and hang them up on iebetys / for they were
asesentynge to the sin. and bad-euery man sle his neyghbore that was gyltye
in that sin / For by lecherye they fell into idolatre And so for yt lecherye
were slain ye time four and twenty thousand Thanne phynees the son of
eleazar saw one of the children of israel lie by one of ye wymen: and to venge
his sin he took his sword and roof them both togy. dre into the earth:
through there preuy membrys / And god was so much pleased with his deed that
he granted to him: and to his children after him the dignytye of preesthode
without end For but he had do that deed god should else have destroyede the
people / Also for auoutrye and unlawful wedlok all mankind was destroyde in
time of noeis flode safe eight soulys. Gen^. vi. And for defoulynge of one
mannys wife were slain sixty thousand and five thousand and all acuntrye: and
a great cetye destroyed at the bidding of god. Iudicu^. xixo. and xxo. Also
david for auoutrye was dreuen out of of his kingdom. and he and al his
household and al his kynred were afterward full hard punished for his
lechery.iio.. xi. and xiio co. And by the old law both man and woman should be
slain: if they were take in auoutrye / we read that Judas the son of jacob
had three sons by one wooman her. onam and selam / But her that was the eldest
son was a shrewe and mysused his own wife / wherefore god was wroth with him
and slough him with soden death / for he used his wife i^ lust and would not
bygete children of her / but did so yt she should not cons^yue. Gn^. xxxviiio.
Also for lecherye: seven husbondis of sara that was after the wife of young
tobie were slain of ye fend for there foul lust. Tobie vio Also for lechery
of the^ yt be of kynred and of affenitye: god has take hard wrath. as wha^
Aamo^ lay by his sustre thamer. he was slain of his brother absolon: and Loath
ye brother of Abraham by dru^kenship: lay by his own two daughters and bigat of
the^ ii. children moab and amon which children and the people that came of them
were alweye enemies to gods folk and a cursed of god Also Jacob cursed his
son Ruben for he lay with one of his wives Also for the foul sin of
sodomye: five fair citees Sodom and Gomorre and other three cytees. Were
destroyde i^ time of abraham For god rayned upon them fire and brymstone from
above And the earth shoke so and tremblyde that they sonke dou^e i^to hell
house. land man. and child. and best and all that they had There was no thing
saved butt Loath and his two daughters. His wife might have be saved. but for
that she looked again to ye cetie ayens ye angels byddyng / wha^ne she hard the
rewful cry of them that perisshed therefore she turnid i^to a salt stone For ye
au^gel bad the^ streitly that they should not look again And all that cu^tre which
was before likened to paradise for farienesse and plentye of the cuntrye:
turned into afoule stynki^ge podel: that lasts into this day: and is cleped
the dedde see / For there may no thing live therein for filth and stench in
ve^geaunce of that stynkynge lechery. Gen^. xiio.

Dives. Me merueleth much yt god took so general wreth to slay man and woman
and child / For I am syker. there were many children full young and unguilty in
ye sin / Also we find notte that wymen were thanne gyltye in ye sin / The
book says that all the people of men fro the child male to ye old came to do
that sin but of wyme^ speaks he not that any came thereto


Pauper Though women use notte that sin. yet they were gylty in that that
they forsook not there husbondys yt were gyltye / For sodemye is most
sufficient cause of dyuorce between husbond and wife wha^ne it is openly used /
And sithe they would not forsake there husbondys: in ye orryble sin: in manner
they assented to there sin: and so ryghtfully they perisshed i^ sin with
them. Of the children vngiltye the master of stories says. that god slough
them for there best. For if they had lived forth into mighty age they should
have followed the lecherye of there faders and so it was better to them to die
or they were gyltye: than to have lived longer and died gyltye and go to hell
without end


The xvii. chapter.
Dives. Fell there any vengeu^ce for lecherye of men of holy church?


Pauper. We find i^ the secunde book of kings vi.co. that there was a deke^ i^
the old law: whose name was Oza And when he touched ye hutche either ark of god to hold it up whannd it should else have fall: his right arm serid and
dried suddenly: and anon he died For as seyth the master of stories. ye night
he had delyd with his wife Sith thanne the deke^ of ye old law was so herd
punyshed for he touched gods hutch ye else should have fall for he meddled that
night with his wife much more prestys and dekens of the new law be worthy
much woo: if they p^sume to touch gods body or to mynestre at gods auter.
When they have comonedde with other men's wives- or with there concubynes.
And therefore the law byddeth streitly that there should no man ne woman here
mass of ye priest which that he knows sikerly that he holds aco^cubyne or
is an open lechoure and notorye Distinc. xxxii. nullus etc. p^t hec. And in the
same law it is forbode in pain of cursinge that any priest lechoure: should
say any mass. or any deken lechoure read any gospel. or any subdeken read any
pystle in the office of holy church / And in another place the law biddethe yt
such notorye lechourys should have no office in holy church ne benifice. and
if they had but if they would amend them ^they should be pryued both of office
and of benefice Disti^c. xxviii. decreuimus / And if any man of holy church
haunted much the place and the cumpanye of suspecte wymen. but he would cese He
should be deposed Desti^c. lxxxi. clericus / And there should no strange wymen
dwell with men of holy church: but there modris beldames auntes and godmoders
and brothers daughter. or susteris daughter. Ibm^ co. cu^ omnibus And if there
might any evil suspeco^n be of there dwelli^g to gydre or for youth. or for they
be suspecte in other byhalue. tha^ they should not dwell with the^ in
household. but in some other place. Ex. de cohi^taco^ne clicorum and
mli^eru^.io.co.


Dives. Though a priest be a threw. the sacrame^tys that he mynystreth be not
ye worse / For the goodness of the priest amendethe not the sacrament. Ne his
wickedness appeyrethe them not as the law shewethe well in the same place
Vbi supra proxi mo capitulo. vestra. Why forbid death thanne the law men to
here massys of synful preestys lechourys* and therefore ye law says ye falli^g
fro the higher chastity yt is voued to god is more and wors tha^ auoutrye / For
sithe god is offended when the wife kepethe notte feythe to her bodily
husbond: or the husbonde keeps not feythe to his wife: much more is god
offended if feythe of chastitye is not kept to him which was proffered to him
freely: not axed nedely. And the more freely it was made without compellyng.
the more sin is the brekynge. xxvii. q^. i. Nupciaru^ in fine.c. etco.
impudicas. etc. scie^. Also the law says that the sin that is don
i^mediatly ayens god is more sin than ye sin that is do pryncipaly ayens
man / And therefore seyth he: facrilege is more sin than any fornicaco^n or
auoutrie. xvii. q^. iiii. sunt q.


Dives. Contrate. The law says that auoutrie is most of al si^nes.xxxii.
q^. vii. quid in omnibus


Pauper. The gloss answers thereto and seyth. that it is amaner of spech to do
wlate auoutre and showing that auoutrye is full grievous / But he says there
that manslaughter and incest: and sacrilege by brekyng of the vow of chastitye
is more grievous. And also it may be take for gostly auoutrye: that is wha^ne
acristen soul forsakes the feythe of holy church that he reseyued in his
baptem: and forsakes crist to whom he wedded him. and turns to the fend and
to false believe / And every dedly sin is goostly auoutrye


Dives. I am answered seye sorthe what thou wylt


Pauper. Also lechery is more synue i^ men of holy church tha^ in wedded
folk: because of thy person / For men of holy church may better withstonde
the flesshly temptacion / than wedded me^ For they owe to pass the people in
kunnynge and virtue / And therefore god seyth in the gospel: that the seruante
knowing the will of his lord and not doing his will shall be hard punysshed.
Also for his unkindness. For why the gretter his benefyce is and the more that
his dignytye is ye more is he bound to god and the more is his sin if he be
vnki^d And therefore holy wrytt says. Potentes potent tormenta pacientur /
They that be mighty in this world by wealth and worship that god sends them:
shall suffce mightily turmentys / If they be unkind Also for the si^ne
repugneth more to his person both for his digi^te and for ye vow of chastity yt
he made i^ taking of holy order.


Pauper. Not for defaute of ye sacrament. For the secrament is not the worsse
for the malice of the preeste / But therefore this law forbids men to here
there masses and there office: that they might be so ashamed of there sin and
the sooner amend them


Dives. When is a man of holy church cleped i^ the law an open notorye
lechoure.


Pauper. When the deed shows so thesilfe that it may not be denied ne excused
or when he is aknow it before a judge or conuycte thereof before his judge Extra
e.co. vestra. and coquesitum. Wha^ne it is thus notorye and open: there should
no man ne wooman here there massys nether office wetyngly / Such clerks
lechours. be he preeste. be he busshop. be he deken or subdeke^ he should lose
his degree and not abide in the chaunsel among other clerks i^ time of office
and he should have no perte of ye gods of holy church. Disti^c: lxxxi. si qs
cu^ aliis capitulis sequentibus And therefore saint Gregori biddethe in the name
of god: by the auctorite of saint Peter that no preeste lechoure. ne deken ne
subdekene lechoure should enter holy church till that they would amend them /
And no man ne woman says he: be so herdy to here there office For why he says
there blessing turns into cursynge and there prayer into sin For god says
to them. I shall curse your blessyngys / And al tho says he that will not obey
to this holy precepte. they fall i^ sin of ydolatrye. Distinc c.lxxxii. si q
sunt Therefore god seythe to wicked men of holy church: butt ye will here me and
set your hertys to worship my name: else I shall send to you myscheef and
curse your blessyngys. Mlachie ii.c:


The xviii. chapter.
Dives. Whether is lecherye more sin in wedded folk: or i^ me^ of holy church


Pauper. In lecherye be many degrees. as I seyde before / For auoutrye is more
sin than is simple fornicacion / But in ceste yt is lecherye with them that
be nigh of kyn: is more than auoutrye: And sacrilege that is lecherye in them
that have auoued chastity as in men of holy church and in men of religion
also: is more than auoutrye. Hec sm^. consolio. iiio. tio.xxxiiiio. q. CCi.
quero. Where he says that sacrilege and bregynge of the vow of chastytye: is
more than auoutrye / And also his sin is more grievous for it is more
sclaunderous. and noyous to the people. for his wicked ensaumple. And therefore
saint gregory says. that they shall answer for as many soulys as perisshe by
there wicked ensaumple For when the head and the leder falls: the body
lightly shall fall / And more discomfort it is to an oste if they se there
chefteyn flee and turn the back. thanne though they see twenty other si^ple
men turn the back and flee and more conforte to the enemies And so it is of
me^ of holy church that should be leders of criste^ people For they turn the
back to god and fle out of gods ooste as often as they fall in dedly sin
/ Also it is more grievous i^ me^ of holy church / For they may better flee
lecherye than men of the world / For it needs not the^ not much dele with
wymen: ne with the world. ne it longethe not to them. But it longs to
them to fle the cumpanye of wimen and every occaso^n of sin Vide in sm^.
conf. lio.iiio. ti. xxxiiii. q^. CCii. For these skyllys clerks sey that ye
studious the^ / king of lecherye defoulethe as much a clerk as does ye deed

The xix. chapter:
Dives. Why be men irreguler for bigamye:


Pauper For many causys. First for dignyte and onestie of holy order: and of
the sacramentys of holy church / Also to show token and exaumple of
contynence and of chastitye Destinc: xxxii. posuisti. For he that shall prech
contine^ce and chastitye: most show continence and chastitye in himsilfe Also
for there is not full sacrament of matrimonye And he that shall minystre the
sacramentys of holy church. most have no defaute in any sacrament / wherefore
thou shall vnderstondde as that I seyde first. the sacrament of matrymonye
bytookenethe the unite and the knot bitwene crist and holy church. as bitwene
one husbonde and one wife maiden without spotte. as says saint poule. and
that is bytokened by the conjunction and the knytti^ge togidre bodily of
husbonde and wife in matrymonye. Also that bodily knyttynge to gedre i^
matrymonye bitoenketh the unity and ye knot bitwene the godhed and the manhed
in the chamber of the maid marie which knot and unity and matrimonye byganne
in time of patriarkis and prophetys. and it was made siker and stable in the
time of grace in the birthe of crist and in his passion / But it shall be full
ended and made perfect in heaven bliss And therefore says saint Austen in
questioi^bus orosii. that as god made woman of the rib of adam slepynge and of
his side. so out of the side of crist slepyng upon the cross. ran blood and
water. Which be the sacramentis of our redemption. by which sacrame^tys holy
church is fourmed: and wedded to criste as eve to adam Also matrimony
bytokeneth ye unity and the knotte between ^riste and christian soul. and that
pryncipaly for the goostly knot that is bitwene the husbond and wife i^ assent
of there willys. For as much thanne as he that is in bygamie is not only one
husbo^d to one clean wife. as crist is one husbonde too one holy church
maiden. Or the wife is not only wife bodily to one husbonde. but the husbonde
has deperted his flessh in two wives. or ye wife departed her flessh in two
men therefore there is defaute in ye sacrament of matrimonye / For it signifies
not perfitly the unity bitwene crist and holy church / And in many manner man
fallethe in bigamye and so in irregularitye First if he have two wives lawfully
one after a another and knowethe them flesshly / Also if he have two to gydre
or mo. as one by the law openly and by dome of holy church / and another by
law of conscience / and know them flesshly / Also if he have two on yt manner
one after another and knowethe them flesshly / Also if he have wedded a wedowe
corrupt Also if he wed any woman corrupt of another man. Where he knows her
corrupt or knowethe it not / Also if he knew flesshly his own wife after that
she is known of a another / whether he knows it or knows it notte Also if
any man of holy church or profes in religion wedde a woman and meddle with her:
be she maid or corrupt. he is irreguler. Versus. Si ducas i^ducam. vel quam
corruperit alter. Vna^ post aliam binasque simul tua coniux. Cognita si fuerit
bigamie lege teneris. Et si pollicitam violasti virginitatem. In all these casys
man is irreguler.


Dives. Though the man be not maid when he weddeth a maid: is he not
irreguler. for his own corrupco^n why is he tha^ irreguler for corrupco^n of ye
woman / For it seems that his own corrupcion should rather make him
irreguler: Than the corrupco^n of the woman.


Pauper. In the conjunction of criste to holy church is unity and onehed in
both parties And therefore if either man or woman in matrimony has departed
his flessh before: there is a defaute in that matrimonye. as anentis that
sacrament / For there matrymonye bytokeneth not perfytly the matrimonye between
criste and holy church / But more onehed and clennesse is nedful in the woman
than in the man / For in the man it is nedful that he have wedded no woman
before flesshly butte one / But it needs not that he be amayde: but i^ the
woman it is nedful that she be not corrupt before of any other man.


Dives. By what skille:


Pauper. For the corrupcion before matrimonye causes not irregularitye in him
that is corrupt: but it cause / the irregularitie in the other that is knyt to
him / For that deed of corrupcion fallethe not tha^ne on him that did the deed
/ but on him that is knitte to him in matrymonye / And therefore right as the
man is not irreguler for he is corrupt himsilf when he weddeth: but for he
weddethe a woman corrupt right so if woman were able to holy order: she should
be irreguler / not for that she is corrupt: but for that she knyttethe her to
man corrupt: but she hade be corrupt before in other matrimonye / Another
skylle may be this / For the knott and unity made between criste and holy
church: and bitwene the godhed and the manhed: it is one and onys made for
ever / Therefore it is bitokened by the bodily knytti^ge to gedre of the first
matrimonye But when man passes to the secund wife and weddethe also bodily:
or if she be corrupt: Thanne goth he from unity to pluralite / Therefore the
secu^d matrimonye may not figure perfytly the conjunction of criste to holy
church: ne of the godhed to the manhed: which conjunction is one: and but onys
don for eu. and not chaungeable / For there the thing tokened is but one: ye
thing tokenynge that thing most be one / And the thing tokened and ye thing
tokeni^g ye thing most be like / Also more cle^nesse is nedful to the woman to
save the sacrament of matrymonye: tha^ i^ the man: for ye woman bitokenethe
holy church wedded to criste: which as saint poul says most be clean maid
with out spot / Also the woman bitokene the mandhed of criste that he took of
the maid marie without part of man / Also the woman bitokeneth criste^ soul
which most be without corrupco^n of sin if it shall be cristys spouse / For
these skyllys: to save the sacrament of matrimonye: ye woman most be maiden /


Dives. I suppose a man had defouled a maiden: and after that he wedded her is
he irreguler for he weddethe yt woman so corrupt /


Pauper. Su^me clerks say ye and su^me nay / But most common openyon is that
he is not irreguler: for he departed not his flesh i^to another wife. so that
the maiden be not defouled of another


Dives. Saint poule says / Oportet p^sbiteru^ esse vnius vxoris virum. p^. ad
thy. iii.c It bihoueth a pressed to be husbonde of one wife / And so it seems
that every priest most have a wife. or else he may be no priest: and so
there should no priest dwell maiden


Pauper. The words of sapnt Poule be thus understand: that there may no man be
priest that has had two wives bodily For thanne is he bigamus.


Dives. What if a man wene to wedde a maid and he find her corrupt.


Pauper. He is irreguler / And if he wed a maid and she meddle after with any
other man. and her husbo^d meddle with her after that she is known of another.
though the husbond wite it not: yet he is irreguler / And if a man accuse his
wif of auoutrie and he meddle with her after: that by his own axing or by his
wives axynge: he is irreguler: be she gilty. be she not gilty / And by common
openio^ though he be compelled by holy church to yield to her her debt of his
body. if he yield it: he is irreguler If a man wedde a maiden: and she dye a
maiden: and after that he wedde another maiden and know her flesshly: or if he
know ye first and not the secunde: in this case he is not irreguler For he
deperteth not his flessh into two wives ne his wife into two men And if he
wedde a wedow maid: he is not irreguler / If a man has made a contract with a
woman: and after weddethe a another and knowethe her flesshely if he know not
the first flesshly: he is not irreguler / But if he be compelled by holy
church to go again to the first anon as he yeldeth her the det of his body he
is irreguler / If a man have two wives before his baptem: or one before: and a
another after bodily: he is irreguler: He yt is bigamus shall have no joy of any
preuilege that longs to ye clergy: and be subget to other seculer iuges / as
other lewed men. And upon pain of cursynge. he shall bear no tonsure: ne use
clothyng that longs to clergy. In sm. conf. lio iiio.tio de bigame


The xx. chapter:
When wymen be deliu^d of there children they may enter holy church to thank
there god what time they will or may the law lets them not / And by the same
skill me^ of holy church may si^ge before the^ in there oratorie and oneste
place: if they have leave. Extra libro iiio.tio. de purgacione post pertum And
thefore they that clepe them hethen wymen for the time yt they lie in be

Dives. May a man give his wife leave to meddle with another man: or the wife give
the husbond leave to meddle with another woman


Pauper. Nay For neither may give other leave to do dedely sin ayens the
precepte of god. Non mechabe: ris. Ne the Pope himsilf may give them leave.


Dives. Contra. We read. Gen^. xvio. That Sara the wife of Abraham yaue abraham
leave too meddle with Agar her servant to get on her a child and so he did:
for he bigate on her ysmael


Pauper. To this clerks sey that Abraham was excused. For it was the manner
among the good people of god that time that if the wife were bareyne: by there
both assent the husbond might take hi^ a secu^darie wife: not for lust / but
only to multyplye gods people / And so Abraham by assent of his wife and by
the preuy leave of god: not for lust but for to have a child to gods worship
took Agar to his wife And so she was his secu^darie wife: and sara the chief
wife / And so also had Jacob four wives lefully not for lust / But for to
multiplye gods people / and for token of things that were to come / And yt
was do by auctoritye of dispensacion of god: which is above al laws / But
though god dispensed with abraham and Sara to do in that manner: or with Jacob
to have many wives to gedre: for figure and skillis that god knew: yet men may
not take now this time example there of to do the same / For the skillis
aforsayde be fulfilled And the law says: Priuilegium pauco rum non facit*
legem commune^. xxv. q^. i.co. vstio^ prope sinem. The preuylege of a few
makethe no common law / And therefore Isaac the son of Abraham had never but
one wife that was Rebecca of which he bygate but two children: at one time as
says saint Austen / And he meddled never with other woman for desire of children.
ne for lust of his flessh / And so by his co^tinence he shewethe yt his faders
doing was but a special preuilege granted of god to him: and therefore in that
he took non ensample thereof / For that Abraham did: he did it by special
despensacion of god: and i^ figure of things to come / For by his servant
Agar: and his son ysmael: is understand the old testament and the jews and
all that lyuen after the flessh and in dedly sin / By Sara and her son
Isaac is understand ye new testament. and folk of the new law that is
christian people. that lyuen gostly out of dedly sin And that abraham at the
biddi^g of god drove out either put out of household his servant and his
child when Sara had borne her son ysaac. bytokeneth yt in time of grace
when the new testament that is the new law and christian people byganne:
tha^ the old law should be put aweye. and the jews put from ye household of
heaven: but they would be converted / And also that all that lyuen after the
flsshe and in dedly sin: shall be put out of gods household: but they
amend them.


The xxi. chapter.
Dives. I have often hard said that fendes in mannys likeness have leyne by
wymen and made them with child / And that is wonderful to me For the find is
but asprite and has neither flesh ne boon: ne any thing of mankind whereby
he should gendre with woman


Pauper. The fend by sufferaunce of god may sad the air and make him a body
of the eire: in what likeness god suffers him in so much that as says saint
Poule: he transfygurethe himsilfe into an aungel of light Much more than he may
transfigure him into likeness of man or woman by sufferaunce of god. for
mannys sin and womans. And the fe^des yt tempt folk to lechery be most bcsy
to appear in mannys likeness and womans to do lechery with folk and so bri^ge
the^ to lecherye / And in speech of folk: they be cleped eluys / But in latyne
wha^ they appeir in mannis lykenes: they be cleped Incubi. And wha^ne they
appier in likeness of wyme^: they be cleped succubi / And for they have no
matter. ne sede of themsilfe to ge^dre: therefore they gendre and take the
superfluyte of the matter and seed of man that passes from man slepynge and
other times. and with that matter they meddle with wymen / Also they gader matyr
and seed of wooman. And with that meddle with man in woman's lykenes / And of
such medlynge as god suffers common su^tyme good children: su^tyme wicked:
sumtyme well shapen. sumtyme evil shapen / Butte nedys one most be man or
woman For fend with fend may not gendre Such fendys be most besye to shende
wymen And therefore it is perelous to wymen that desyren much mannys cumpanye.
to be ouermoche solitary without onest cumpanye / And such foul spritis do
there lechery in this manner: not only with man and woman: but also with
unreasonable bestes: and appear to them in likeness of bestes: as a bole to
kyne: and as aram to sheep / And so by fendes doing come many of theyse
mysshape things that be borne both of wymen and of bestes: as a calf with an
adders tail: a child with an adders head. a child born of a sheep with wolle
in the neck / Al these have fall in our days.


The xxii. chapter.
Dives. It may be well as thou sayste. But I pray the tell me what is gostly
foruycacion: gostly auoutrye and micherye:


Pauper. All three be take for one: and pryncypaly it is cleped ydolatrye /
when man or woman withdraws hyo love and his trust fro god and settethe it
more in creature than in god and the worship that longethe to godhed does it to
creature thanking creature of the benefices that only god may do / And so the
worship that longs only to god they give it too creature: stock or stone man
or woman: or to ymagys made with mannys hondys that neither may se here: ne
help at need: when man or woman is cristened: his soul is wedded is criste
by right believe and true love and charity that he hoteth there to gog to keep
his hestys and to forsake the fend / But after wha^ he forsakes god and
gods hestes and turns him to the fend by his own fyndi^ges of mis lusts
and leueth ye love of crist for ye love of any creature tha^ he does gostly
lechery with the fend And therefore says David: that they have do fornicacion
in there own fyndyngys / And on this manner al flesshly thoughtis and of misluste
and vnrightful doing and unlawful couetyse in that it with draws the love of
man or of woman fro god: it is cleped goostly fornicacion and auoutrye / And
thus every dedly sin is cleped gostly auoutrye and gostly fornicacion: but
pryncipaly ydolatre and forsakyng of the feyth Also false prechyng / and falls
exposicion of holy wryt: is cleped spirituel fornicaco^n As they that preche
pryncipaly to please the people and to get a name or to get temporal good / Of
such says saint Poule: that they put gods word in auoutrye: Adultera^tes
verbum dei.ii. ad. little ^iiiio. For there they should use it to the worship of
god / and to the profyt of mannys soul: they use it to there own worship and
to there own wordly profyt and to plesaunce of the fend and harm of mannys
soul / Also falls couetyse is cleped gostly fornicacion. Therefore saint James
says to false couetyse men: Adulterii nescitis quia amicicia huius mu^di
inimica est deo. Iacobi iiiio. ye auoutererys and lechouris wit ye not that
friendship of this world is enemy to god / Therefore i^ the book of gods
preuetyes couetyse and pomp of this world and covetous and proud people is
cleped the cetye of Babiloyne that is to say the cetie of she^ship And it is
likened to a common woman with which kings princes lords. marchauntys and all
couetouse folk have do gostly lecherye: and it is cleped mother of fornicacions
and of abominaco^ns For as saint Poule says: couetyse is rote of all
wickednessys And therefore god byddethe there that his people should go out of ye
cetye of babiloyne that is to seye forsake synful cumpanye: and forsake lust
of the flessh and pomp and couetyse of this world yt makes men to forsake god
and do gostly lecherye with the fend wend ye out says god fro this wicked
babiloyne: and forsake this wckiid common woman of lust and of false couetyse:
that deseyueth all this world / For in one day shall come al her destrucco^n /
And that shall be endless death: weeping and hungre without end: and there shall be
brennynge fire and smoder without end and tha^ al yt have do gostly lechery and
lived i^ delicys and falls couetise / shall weep and say veve: alas alas. apo
c.xvii. and xviii.


The xxiii. chapter.
Dives. Al though thy speech be skillful: yet in one thing clerks hold ayens
the in that that thou seist that the sin of Adam was mare than the sin of
Eve. And they argue thus ayens the / God rightful judge punysshed eve harder for
her si^ne: than he did ada^ for his si^ne but yt should not god have do: but for
her si^ne was mor grievous tha^ the sin of adam / therefore than the sin of
eve was more grievous than the sin of adam.


Pauper. This argument is grounded in two false maxyms First that every
punisshyng and vengeance assigned of god for mannys sin and woman's is
assigned after yt the sin is mor or less / And this maxim and ground is false / wherefore thou shall understand that god punisshe some sins in this
world: and some in the other world: su^me both here and there In the other
world he punyssheth every sin after yt it is more grievous / or less grievous
/ But in this world he does not alwey so / But often i^ this world he punyssheth
the les sin harder: than he does the more sin / Therefore in the old law
auoutre was punysshed as hard or harder than manslaughter: and yet ma^slaughter
is more gruous sin than auoutrie And god took more temporal ve^geaunce in
this world for lechery. than ever he did for ydolatrie. And yet ydolatrie is
gretter sin than lechery: for it is i^mediat ayens god and ayens the first
precept of the first table / And manslaughter is harder punysshed in this word
tha^ perjury / And yet perjury is gretter sin: as I said in the secu^de
commandment / And sins in simple pore folk be harder punisshed in this
world / than sins of the great me^ / If a pore man stele an horse: he shall be
hanged But if a lord by raueyn and extorsions rob a man of all that he has:
he shall not be hanged ne lityl or naught punisshed in this world / David did
auoutre and manslaughter for which sins he was worthi to be slain by common
law of god / and yet god would not have him slain but if apore man had do tho
sins he should have be slain / A simple man went and gadered styckes i^ the
sabot: and god bad moses stone him to death. Solomon Ieroboa^ achaz did great
ydolatrie and drough mech of ye people to idolatre and yet were they no slain:
therefore the smaler sins god punissheth i^ this world that ye souls
punyssheth i^ this world yt ye soulis of the sinners may be saved if they cun
take it i^ patience And commonly he punisshith harder pore folk in this world /
than he do rich folk: as by common law / For the sin of great men: as in ye
same spyce of sin is more grievous: than is the sin of ye poor man / And
therefore god reseruethe the grievous sins and ye sins of great folk to
punisshe them in the other world: or in hell or in purgatory / There may no
temporal pain be full punysshynge for dedly sin save contricion alone / And
therefore god punissheth no alwey folk in this world after the quantite of there
sin: but as he seth it most nedful and spedful to the people and to his
worshype / For only god knows the greuoushed of dedly sin / For often that
that seems most grievous in ma^nys sight: is less grievous in gods sight:
and ayenward. Therefore god mesureth not alwey pain: after the quantitye of the
sin. But often he punysshethe in this world them that be less gyltye as
much as them that be more gyltye / As in time of the flode of Noe: and in the
perisshyng of sodom and gomorre: and many other times he punisshed wymen
children and bestis that were not giltye in the sins: for which that
vengaunce fell / And often he sends sikenes and dysese to good men / in
punysshynge of there sins in this world. and suffers shrewes to have there
will: and lytyl or naught punyssheth the^ i^ this world / And as the lion is
chastised by betyng of the whelp so often time god punissheth and chastises full
hard in this world them that be less gyltye: to warn them that be more giltye
that they should amend them / Therefore crist said to the jews: wene ye yt tho
men which pylat slough for there rebellion were gretter si^ners than other folk
of the cuntre / Nay forsooth / But I say to you forsooth: but ye amend you: ye
shall perissh all / And wine ye says crist that the eightene me^ upon which
fell the tour of syloa in Ierlm^ and slough them wene ye that they passed in
sin all the men of Jerusalem / Nay forsooth But I say to you: but ye amend
you: ye shall perisshe all to gydre. Luce. xiiio. And so the punysshyng of tho
men so slain was a warning to them that were more synfulle that they should a
mande them / And so thou mighteste well see that thy skylle is naught worthy:
god punysshed eve harder i^ this world than he did adam: therefore her sin was
more than the sin of Adam.


The xxiiii. chapter:
ALso the secunde maxyme and ground i^ which thou say yt god punysshed eve
harder than ada^: may skylfullye be denied. For in punysshi^g of adam god yaue
his curse and said. Cursed be the earth in thy work and in thy sin / He said
not cursed be the earth in thy work of eve ne he said not cursed be the earth
in your work: as for common sin of them both: but he said only to adam /
Cursed be theerth in thy wrke / In punysshynge also of the serpent he yaue his
curs: and said / Thou shall be cursed among al thing living upon earth /
Also god cursed caym when he punysshed him for sleynge of his brother Abel /
But when god punysshed woman / he yaue not his curse / And we read not yt
ever god yaue his curse to any woman openly i^ special / Ne god repreued not
eve so much: as he did adam / And so the great rep^efe and blami^g and the curs
that god yaue in punysshyng of adam more than he did in punisshing of eve
sheweyng well yt the sin of ada^ was more grievous than was ye sin of eve /
and that there was more obstynacye in adam than was eve / For cursyng is not
youen of god ne of holy church but for obstinacy / As I said first adam
answerde full obstynatly / God blamed adam pryncypaly for brekynge of his
commandment and said to him that brekyng of his commandment was cause of
his nakedness and of his sodeyn myschefe: and not wythstondynge the techynge /
and the styrynge of god: he would not be aknowe of his senne: but put his sin
on god: and excused him by eve: and so put sin to sin in excusacion of his
sin. When god punisshed adam he cursed the earth for his sin / which
curse turned to woo and traueyle of him and of all mankind which we may not
fle / And therefore he said to adam. thou shall ete of the earth in travail and
sorrow all the days of thy life / I shall bring the forth breris and thorns
and thou shall ete erbis of the earth / Also in punysshi^ge of adam god yaue
the sentence of death upon hi^ and al ma^ki^de for his sin: and therefore god
siad to adam thou shall ete thy bred i^ swi^k and swet of thy face til thou
torn again into the earth For earth thou art:and into earth again thou shall
wend / Sith thanne god for sin of adam yaue so grievously his curse: and
blamed so hard adam of his sin: and for his sin dampened him and all
mankind: and punisshed al erthely creaturis for his si^ne and dampened him and
al mankind to pertuel traueyle when he said. thou shall ete thy mete with
traueyle and sorrow all the days of thy life / And also for the sin of adam
he yaue sentence of death: to him and to al mankind that is most of al peynes:
it folowethe that god punysshed harder adam for his sin: than he did eve for
her sin / For why in punisshyng of eve god repreued her not so much as he did
adam And he yaue thanne no curse ne peyn perpetuel safe subjection: I shall
said god multiply thy myscheues and thy conseyuyngys: and in sorrow thou shall
bear thy children: and thou shall be under power of man: hnd he shall be thy
lord God seyde not to woman: I shall multiply thy thy myscheues all days of
thy life / For she may keep her chaste if she will and fle mischefe and pain
of children birth / And that god made woman subget to man for the sin of
eve: is was no new thing to woman For as says saint austen super gen^. lio
xio.co xiiii. woman was subget to man before by order of kind: but that
subiecto^n was only by love and charytye but for her sin she was made subget:
not only by love: but also by need and bondage of onest seruyle work to obey
to man and be under his governance / Before her sin she was subgett to man
only by love / But after her sin she was mad subget to man not only by love
but by dread and by need For she most dread man and she has need of his help
/ For that was the pride of adam and of eve: that they desired to have no
sovereign ne governor but god alone as clerkis sey And therefore the fend in
gyle by hight the^ yt they desired saying to eve if ye ete of ye tree yt god
has forbode you: ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil: that is to
say: ye shall need no sovereign ne gounoure to tech you ne to govern you but
god / And for yt they desired it lightly they leuyd it / For as says the may
of stories: Thing that is desired: lightly it is believed And therefore god
rightful judge punisshed them both in subjection of dread and of need: and of
hard seruage He made woman sub get to man / and aftwarde he made man subget
and thralle to man: for the sin of adam as says saint Austen Super. gen^. v.
sup^. mor tha^ eu^ he made woman subget to man. for the sin of eve: as says
saint Austen. super. gen^. v.s. For though woman be in thraldom to temporal
lordis as be men. that is not for the sin of eve: but pri^cipaly for ye sin
of adam / The subiecto^n that woman is put i^ for the sin of eve: is the
subjection that the wif owethe to her husbond / And all the soueraygntie and
lordshyp yt any man has here in this world either over man or woman: it is
meddled with much woo and great sorrow and care / For every sovereign in this
world most care for his subgettys: if he be wise. And in higher degree that he
be of lordshyp and of dignitye: in the higher degree is he of perel of dread of
sorrow and care in punisshing of adms sin: And so both lordship in this
world: and subieccion be punisshed of adams sin / And if subgettis can have
patience with there degree. they be in more sikernes both of body and of soul /
and in more gladness of heart tha^ be the souereignes / And so punysshed god adam
as much in manner: in that he made hi^ lord and governor of woman as he
punysshed eve: wha^ne he made her subget to adam / For in ye god bond man to
have cure of wooman I her mischief to save her and to keep her: that was by
common so feynte: so feeble and freel: and so mischeuous by cause of her sin.

The xxv. chapter.
Dives. yet clerkys ergue ayens the and sey that woman sinned more grievously
tha^ adam: for she put hirsilfe i^ sin and her husbond adam / Butte adam put
only himsilfe in sin.


Pauper. This skill is naught For as I said first ada^ was she^t with preuy
pride and wealth of himsilfe and fell into sin or eve proffered him the apple
/ Also says saint Auste^ de ci^. di^. lo.xiiiio co.xio. Adam wyste well that
it was a grievous sin / But eve was so deseyued that she wend that it had be
no sin / And therefore the sin that she did by ignorance and deseyte of the
fend excuses not: ne lessethe not the sin of Adam that he did willing and
wyttyngly. Ada^ was her sovereign and should have governed them both: and not
obeyed to ye voice of his wif aye^s the voice of god that forbad hi^ the tree
Example if a simple man be vnkunnyng and by deseyt of sum shrew do a folly
wening not to do amys: and he come to his prelate or his busshop and counseyle
him to do the same: and his prelate or his busshop do the same wetynge well that
he does amys: and that it is a grievous si^ne: every man will deem that ye
busshop and his prelate synneth more grievously than the simple man that wend
not to do amysse And thus nigh al circumstauncys that agreggen any sin
agregged the sin of adam more than the sin of eve / For he was sovereign
and perfect more in kind wyser and myghtier to withstonde the fendes fodynge /
And with less temptacion fell in sin and brake gods co^mau^demente wytyngly
/ But eve by deseyte of the adder sinned by ignorance. as says saint auste^.
v. su^ proxi^o. and sidorus de su^. bono lio.iio. Eve yield her coulpable. adam
did not so. Eve wend not have sinned. adam wetyngly si^ned in hope of
foryeuenesse: As says saint austen: and the mays^ of sentence lio.iio.d.xxii.
And so adam sinned in hope and p^su^pcion ayens the holy gooste: and this is a
fulle grievous sin as crist shows i^ ye gospel Mt.xiio Quicu^que dixerit
verbu^ co^tra spiritum scm^ non remittetur ei. etc. Where the gloss says that
they that sin by ignorance may lightly have foryeuenesse. but he yt does it
wetyngly ayens the majesty of god ayens his conscience: he is worthy no
foryeuenesse Also adam was more obstynat than eve was.


Dives. Show me that


Pauper. For god blamed him first of al: and declared to him his sin: and
god abode of punysshyng till he had vndernome eve: and after eve ye fend i^
the adder: and first he punisshed ye adder and tha^ eve yt ada^ should have
beware and axed mercy And so god blamed him first and punisshed him last: so
yeuyng hi^ respite of repentance: But for all this adam repented him non ne
would axe mercy ne lowne hi^ First god punisshed him fro fe^ in the adder in
that he cursed the adder that was his suget and made the adder enmye to his
wife and to her sede: that is to seye to there children that she should get of
adam / and so god made the adder yt was before suget and meke to him rebel and
enemy to his love yt was his wife and to al yt should come of the^ two / yet
ada^ stood abstinat. Tha^ god punisshed eve his wife his love his help: and so
punisshed him in Eve / For if he loved her so much as clerks sey. it should
have be to him full great pain to se his wife his love so punisshed / For as
clerks seye. the great love that he had to eve: made him to break the
commandment of god / And yet these days it is full great pain to kind
folk true in love to se there love: and there frendis in sorrow and desese. Also
god punysshed adam and eve. in that he punisshed her with mischeues of
sykenesse. freeltie and feblenesse / For in so much god took from him his help
that was woman made to be mannis help / But the more feeble that god made her
for sin: the less she might help man / Also god punisshed them both anon
as Adam ete of the tree: and made the^ so naked and so vnoneste yt they were
ashamed of themsilfe which pain fell not too adam ne to eve till adam had ete
of the apple / And not withstondyng all this: yet adam stood obstynat and axed
no mercyne knowleged no sin And thanne god rightful judge punysshed him full
herd / both in this world and in the other world and punisshed al mankind
for his sin as says saint Poule and saint Auste^ and other doctouris / God
punysshed adam and mankind full hard for his sin: when he took much of his
lordship awey from him: and made nighe al creaturis rebelle to him: and brought
him so low in order of kind that though by wey of kind man before adams sin
passed woman in virtue and perfeccion of kind Now after ada^s sin woman
often time passes many men in virtue and discrecion: and in other gyftis both
of kind and of grace / And before the sin of adam: man was so souereyne to
woman: that woman should not have be his souereyne / But now for adamis sin
of time man is suget to woman as to his lady by bondage and thraldom: by hard
feruage by need: and dread: and owethe more seruage and subjection to woman for
adamys sin: than does woman to man for ye sin of eve / For god made woman
for the sin of eve only subgett to her husbond in service of onest work as
felawe notte as chorle in velenye work of wordly bondage. Also man for the
sin of adam is ordained too many more perelys both on land and on water and
too werre / and too woe. and business of this world and to much traueyle: and
many perelys more than wooman is ordained to


Dives. Wondre I have that any clerk should hold ayens the in this matter of
adam is sin.


Pauper. Clerks speak often by opinion in this matere and other matters also.
and not alwey afferme that they sey to the uttermost but put it in the doom of
other clerks. if they kun say better. And so do I at this time / if any
clerk can say more skilfully. Here ends the sixte p^cepte and bygi^neth the
seventh precepte.


The first chapter.
Dives. I thank the for thou haste well declared to me the syxt precepte. Now I
p^y the enfourme thou me i^ the seven / the heest


Pauper. The seventh precepte is this. Non furtum facies That is to seye Thou
shall do no theft. neither in will: ne i^dede as says the gloss And so by this
precept is forbode al manner mys taking and al manner falls witholdynge and
withdrawyng of other mennys good aye^s there will. and all the menys that led to
theft be also forbode by this precepte as false weightys. falls mesurys. falls
oaths / gylous speech. gyle in craft. and gyle i^ chafarye false werkmanship
and feint labor in laborerys that taken great hire and do little therefore.
Also raueyns extorcions. false witholdynge of det and of mennys hires. and
false witholdyng of mannys right and woman's. and lettynge of there right. Al
these be forbode by this precept And so by this precepte is forbode al manner
theft both bodily and gostly


Dives. What is bodily theft


Pauper. As says Reymu^de. lio.iio.tio. de furtis Bodily theft is a gilous
and unlawful tretyng and using of another mannys good mouable ayens the will of
the lord that owes the thing to get the thing in the silfe to his advantage.
or to have the use of the thing for a time or for to hyde it for atyme and
deny ye possession: though he thenke to make restitucion / And thus sum is
open theft / and su^ is preuy theft Open theft is when the thief is taken
with his pelfere or conuicte by true witness of theft and such theft is
punysshede by lo^des law and by holy churches law / Sum is do so preuely that
the thief may not be take therewith ne convict / And such may not be
punisshede openly by no law but only preuely by law of conscience in the dome
of his co^fessoure which is bound to counsel and to save his name and his
fame / And as the law says: every unlawful vsyng and taking of other mannys
good meuable or not meuable. is theft. xiiii. q^.v. penale and xxxii. q^.

forbyddeth raueyne /


The secund chapter.
ALso leave friend ye shall understand that as holy writ witnesses. there is
theft and robberye of mannys name and woman's and yt is cleped bacbitinge and
defamynge through which man and woman leseth his good name / And therefore the
wise man says / Ne appelleris susurro in vita tua. Eccl. vo. Be thou not
cleped a musterer: ne preuy bacbyter in thy life. be thou not take false in thy
tunge yt thou be not shent for to that thief yt stelethe a mannys good name /
is ordained much shame and much pain and full wicked dampnacion is to the
double tunged man and woman and to musterys and preuybacbiters is hate and
enmite and despyte. Eccle. vo.co. For this manner of theft is full great and
grievous. For as Solomon says Melius est nomen bonum qm^ diuicie multe. et
super auru^ and argentum gracia bona / A good name is better than many
richeses. and good grace of good love passes gold and silver prou^. xxii.co.
For the best iuel and most richesshes that man or woman may have upon earth. is
to have a good name and love and. grace amongys his neyghborys and in the
cuntre / And therefore bacby^s lesyngmongeris and wicked spekers that rob man
or woman of there good name and bring the^ in wicked name and fame: they be ye
worst thieves upon the earth and they may not be assoyled of this theft: but
they do there deuore upon there power: to restore man or woman there good name and
fame: that they have wyckedly robbed them of / And therefore says the law that
they that with bacbytyng destroy the good name and the good life: and the
good thewys of other folk be worse thieves than be they: that rob men of there
godys: and of there catel. vi. q^. i. de^iores / And in the nex chapter. the
law says: that bacbitynge is a full great wickedness For who so bacbytethe
his brother he is a mansleer and there shall no such thief ne mansleer have part
i^ ye kingdom of heue / And therefore the law says in another place that it
profyteeth not as anentys mede in heaven a man to fast or prey or do other good
dedis of relegion but his thoughtys be withdraw fro wickedness and his tunge
fro bacbiti^g De condici. v. nichil enim prodest and not only he is guilty i^
bacbiti^ge that speaks evil of his eue^ criste^ / but also tho that gladly
here such wicked spech and shrewed tales of there even christian. vi. q^. i. ex
merito.xxi. q^.iii. no^ solu^ / And therefore the wise man says / put awey fro
the the wicked mouth and put awey fer fro the lyppys bacbytynge. prou^. iiii.
Hegge thynrerys with thorns. and here not the wicked tunge. and make dorys to
thy mouth: and lockys to thyn eerys. Eccle. xxviii. The^ke yt he will speak of
the as evil bihynd the: as he does of another bihynde him / The^ke what woo and
myschefe comethe of bacbytynge and wicked tunges: and show him no good chere:
but show him by thy countinance and thy chere yt his spech plesethe the not /
And anon he shall cese / and be ashamed of his malice / For the wise man says
Right as the north wind destroieth and scatereth the rain and the cloudys
so the heavy face of the herer destroys the t^ng bacbityng prou^. xxvo. The
children of israel bacbited gods doing / and lacked the land of byheste /
wha^ne they should have entered / and god was offended with them / and bad them
wend again bacward into desert and there he held the^ forty year till they were
deed every chone: yt came out of egipte: save two me^ Iosue and Caleph For they
two spoke good of the land of byhest and held with god / And so the children
of the people that ca^ out of egypt entered the land of bihest and not the
faders: save Iosue and Laleph / And that for there bacbitynge. Numeri. xiiii.
Also marie the sustre of Moses bacbyted her brother moses and spakeuil of hi^
and anon she was afoul lepre and might notte be heled til moises prayed to god
for her. num^ i.vii.c.

The third chapter.
ALso there is theft of wordys / Of which theft god speaks by the prophet
Jeremy xxiiio.co. Where god vndernimethe false prophetis and falls p^chourys:
which stale awey his wordis fro the people and told not the truth as god bad
them: butte only said such things yt shall please the people and so deseyued
the people with lesynges and with false miracles. as men do these dayis feynyng
miracles of ymagis as men do these days to maynteyn ydolatrie for lucre of
offering and false miracles of wicked lyuers and sey that god does miracles
for them: and so blind the people in falsnesse / And so they give the worship of
miracles doing to ymagis that man has made: and to wicked lyuers gods
enemies. Which miraclis only god may do and so rob god of his worship And in
that they withdraw gods word. and the trewethe the gods law that longs
to me^ of holy church to tech. and to the people to cun and to know / And so
they deseyue the people in that they be thieves of gods word and shall be
punisshed full hard of god for such theft of gods word / For god says to
every p^late curate and prechourer Speculatore^ dedi te domui israel and cetera
I have made the a day wait to the household of israel and to my people. and thou
shall here my word of my mouth. and show it and tell it in my name to them /
If I sey to the wicked man yt he shall dye for his wickedness / And thou
tellest him not butt hydeste my word. and spekeste not to hi^ that he may turn
him from his wickedness and leave it: that wicked man shall dye i^ his wickedness
and I shall seek the blod and the death of him of thin hond. that is to say thou
shall answer for his death. Ezech. iiio.co. Also they be thieves of gods
words that p^che gods words to there own wordly auantage: not to ye worship
of god. ne to profyt of mannys soul / Also they be thieves of gods wordis
that eleggen gods words and holy writ falsely to maynteyn errors and eresies
or sin or shrewdness.

The fourth chapter.
ALso there is atheft of wordly good. Of such theft Job says Agru^ no^ suu^
demetu^t They repe other mennys feldys and make vintage of there mennys wynes.
and take mennys clothi^ge fro them: and late them naked i^ the cold winter.
and rob moderles children and pore widowis by might and spoil and rob the
pore people / The thief says / he rises up in the morwe and sleth the nedy
and the pore. and by night he steleth as a mycher. Sz deus i^ultu^ abire no^
patit. job xxiiii.c.

Dives. Hou many spices be of theft


Pauper. Full many. For sum time a thing is stolen p^uely without wetyng of
the lord or of the keeper and ayens there will and it is cleped mycherie Su^tyme
it is do openly by might and violence wetyng the lord and the keeper ayens there
will. and that is propirly rapina raueyn / Su^tyme it is do wetyng the lord or
the keeper and aparte ayens the will. but not all ayens there will / under certain
condition of wynni^ge not leful in the taker. and tha^ne it is cleped vsura.
gouel or usure in englyssh / Also al manner vnrightful occupiyng of any thing
lordship or any other aver i^ this world: is cleped theft / And therefore saint
auste^ says thus The thing that man or woman has by the law: that is his by
ye law and non other mannys / And man has by ye law that he has rightfully
and he has that rightfully that he has well / And therefore says he / every
thing that is mis had is other mennys / and every man has his good amys that
uses his good amys In epla^ ad macedoniu^ / Also witholdyng of alms from the
pore nedy folk: is theft in goods sight / For the covetous rich men withdraw
fro the pore folk that longs to the^ and misspende the pore mennys good
whereby they should be sustained / And therefore the wis man says. Sone defraude
thou not the alms of the pore man / ne turn not awey thin iyen fro the pore.
ne despise not the hu^gry soul. ne tene ne anger thou not the pore in his
mischeffe / Torment thou not the heart of the nedy: ne delay thou not the yift
from him that is in angwyssh / Cast not awey the preyer of him that is desesed:
ne turn thou not thy face awey fro the helplese for wrath ne give thou not him
that axeth the good non occasion to curse the byhynd the / For if the poor man
curse the i^ bytternes of soul: his prayer shall be hard / For he that made him
shall here him And therefore make the plesaunt in speech to the congregation of
pore folk / and bow thyn ^ere to the pore without heaviness: and yield thy
debt and answer pesable things and meekness: not to arunt them ne rebuke
them ne chyde them but only thou have the more open cause. Eccle. iiiio.
Therefore saint Poule says: yt god louethe a glad yeuer.


Dives. By the law of kind and by gods law. al thing is common / And
therefore says the law xii. q^. i. dilectissimis Right as the air ne the light
of ye son may not be departed by lordeshyppys ne aproprid more to one person
than to another: ne to one college more than to another: no more should other
things that be youen commonly to help of ma^ki^d. be departed by lordshippis:
ne apropred more to one tha^ to another. but al things should be common / And
therefore we read Actuum iiiio. that in the beginning of holy church all
things were common to the multitude of criste^ people / And ayens law of kind
is no despensacion. Desti^c. xiii. S. io. Why bad god tha^ne yt men should not
stele. sith al thing is comen to good me^


Pauper. By gods law: al thing is common to good men / For as says saint
austen Omla su^t iustorum / All things be the rightful mennys But as the law
says. xii. q^. i: dilectissimis Dyuision and properte of lordship is made
among man kind by wickedness of falls couetyse. both of rich and of pore.
For the rich draw to themsylfe. that longs to other For why all that the rich
man has passing his oneste living after the degree of his despensaco^n. it is
other me^nys and no his / And he shall give full hard rekeni^g thereof at the day
of dome wha^ne god shall sey to him / Read racionem villicacionis tue / yield
acou^te of thy balye / For rich men and lords in this world be gods balyfes
and gods reues to ordeyn for the pore tolk and to susten them And therefore
says saint Poule Habentes alime^ta and quibus tegamur: hiis conte^ti simus. If
we have nedful lyfelode and hili^ge: be we paid therwithe. and couette we
no more Also pore folk be not paid with sufficient living but couete more than
them nedethe And for couetyse: more tha^ for need take things again the lords
will. in hynderi^g of him and of other that be more nedy. and should be help
thereby / And therefore god forbad al manner theft that me^ should take no thing
for anymis couetise aye^s the lords will.


The fifth chapter.
Dives. Sith all thing is common by gods law: and by law of kind: hou may
any man be lord of any thing. more tha^ another man


Pauper. There is lordship of kind. and there is lordship of this world
grounded only i^ couetyse. and there is lordeshyp of despensaco^n and of
governance and so Ioseth the son of jacob was cleped lord of egypt. Gen^.
xlv.c. The first lordship is common to every good man and woman. For kind made
all men euene in lordshyp / And in token thereof both lord and servant fre and
bond rich and pore: come i^to this world naked and power: and wend hens naked
and pore / Naught they bring with them. but wepi^g sobbyng and forow / And here
no thing with them: but there dedys good or wicked / The lordshyp of this world
is sufferable and worshipful / For as saint Poule says / Omi^s potestas a deo
est / Every power and lordship i^ this world comes of god / And therefore he
bids that every man and woman should be subget and meke to the lordship above
the^ For though the couetise and wickedness that lords and rich men ground
them in be of themsylf. yet the lordship and power is of gods yift: as says
saint Austen. and therefore it most be worshypped. The lordshyp that is only of
dispensacion committed by a souereygne is medful worshypful and comendable /
Also there is three manner of properties and propirhed / One is that kind yeuethe.
as man to lie. And every man has his own heart. his own soul and his own
will. for to do well or evil and this property is nedful / Another propirtie
there is. that comes only of couetyse. by which couetise folk say. this is
mine and this is thine / And so they propren to themsilfe by couetise: that is
common by kind / And this propirtye so grounded in couetise is da^pnable and
synful / The third is dispensacion / For one man has much thing in his
dispensacion and governance: that another man has naught to do of / And this
dispensacion comethe su^tyme of gods gift. as when he sent one man more
riches i^ this world than another Sumtyme it comes by ordinance and yifte of
lords and of souereigins here in earth: As whane lords and prelatis committee
to there subgetys governance of there godys of there places and benefices. And
this dispensacion if it be well do it is full medful:


Dives. But as saint Poul says / it is a question / who is found true among
such dispensouris / For nigh al seek there own profit. but not the worship of
Jesus crist


Pauper Many be full false / And yet sithe dispensacion of worldly goodys is so
committed to them / in that they have lordship of there propre dispensacion
ordained of god: and be cleped propre lords of there propre dispensaco^n / not
for there false couetise / ne for no properhede that they challenge by false
couetyse / For i^ that be they no lords but tyrauntys and rauynourys. And so
though they have propre lordship of dispe^saco^n of worldly godis more than the
pore people: they have yet no more lordship by wey of kind than the pore man /
ne non other lordship tha^ the poor man. but only of dispe^sacion / And so
though the rich folk have more lordship of propre despensacion tha^ne the
pore yet the lordship of kind i^ nedful things stondeth still common to rich
and pore / But for sin it is not so fre. as it was before the sin of adam
For god will not that the pore folk take any thing without leave of the propre
dispe^satour that is clepid lord thereof and therefore god said. Non furtu^
facies. Thou shall do no theft / yt is to say. thou shall naught tak with out thy
lords leave /


Dives. this is wonderful to me that the poor man is as grett a lord by wey of
kind as the rich and yet may he naught take without his leave


Pauper. It is more wondre yt the good poor man is lord of all thing nedful
to him by weye of kind. and the synful rich man is lord of rightnought by wey
of kind. for he is gods traitor And yet god will that the pore take
rightnought of the good yt the rich man has in his dispensacion without leave:


Dives. that is to me more wonderful tell me hou this may be:


Pauper. Thou might se at ^ye yt the king heir apara^t and other heyris of
great lordshippes: not withstondyng that they be heyrys and lords of all: yet
shall they not enter the office of there officers / ne take any thing aye^s: ne
bear aye^s with out leave And if they do: they shall be hard vndernome: and in case
beat of there master and of there tutoure / For fredam in youth is cause of
pride and of many other vices / Right so god seeing that mankind which is lord
of al erthely godys and ordained to regne in heaven bliss: If he had his fredam
in use of erthely things he should fall in pride and many vices as adam did
while he was fre / Therefore he has put ma^ki^d and namely the pore people
under the governance of the rich folk / and of there lords which be there
tutourys and dispensatourys of godys of this world to salvation of the pore
people / And therefore saint Poule says: Quanto tempore here is peruulus est
nichil defert a seruo cu^ sit dominus omnium. sed sub tutoribus et auctoribus
est vsque ad p^finitum tempus a patre. ad gal. iiii^. As long as the heir is
yo^g young and little. there is no difference bitwene him and a servant sith
there is a lord of all / but he is under tutour and gouernoure unto a certain
time ordained of the fader And therefore since the rich folk ben tutours and
dispe^satours of these worldly gods ordained of god to salvation of ye pore
people / god wole yt noma^ take of the gods yt been co^mittyd to them withoute^
their will and their leave. And if any man take thereof against their will and
against gods ordenau^ce / he does theft against this p^cepte. No^ furtu^
facies. Thou shall do no theft.


The vi. chapter.
Dives. Is it lefulle in any cas to stele. and take any thing against the
lords will


Pauper Stelth sowneth como^ly theft and robbery / and su^tyme it sowneth prive
taking without wittyng of the lord. And so it may be done in iiii. cases
withoute^ sin For need. for alms. for right / for hap of fyndinge. First
for need and mischief / for if any man or woman for myscheif of hungre / or of
thrist / or of cold. or of any other mischief. Which mischief he may not flee.
to save his lif but he take things against the lords will. If he take any
thing so in perel of death / or in great mischif / need excuses him fro sin
/ and fro theft. if he do it only for need and not for couetise. And he owes
to enfourme his conscience and think yt if the lord of the thing knew his
myscheife. he should not be mispaied. and tha^ne does he no theft / for in the
last need al thing is coe^n Also for ye lord is bound to help him at ye
need. and also for need hay no law Example we have in the gospel where we find
yt the disciples of Criste for hu^gre took erys in the field and gnyddyd them
/ and ete the corn for hungre The phariseis were asclaundryd thereof and said
to Crist yt his disciples did thing yt was not leful. And tha^ne criste excused
them for need of hungre and said that they were unguilty and i^nocentes in
that. And he put them example of david. that ete for need of the holy loves
in gods tabernacle / which loves only prestes should ete by the law. Mt.
xii.c. For it is a generalle rule in the law / that need has no law.


Dives. Is ye man yt so takith for need bound to restitucion


Pauper. Nay. And yet for more sikernesse. and to putt him in dread of stelth
/ his confessor shall give him su^dele penance for ya^ doing. Also by weye of
alms the wife may take of her lords good in which she has dispe^sacion /
as in mete drynk and clothes and give alms mesurable to the nedy / and
think yt her husbonde should be pleasyd with her yifte. if he saw ye mischief
of the pore. and if he su^tym^ forbede his wife / to do alms / she shall not
full cease from alms discretly done For husbondes make often such inibicions
to their wives to tempere there yeuyng not fully to let hem

And if she see yt her husbonde be sclaundryd and wroth with her yeuyng.
though his wrath be vns^rilful. she must te^pre the more her yeuyng But wha^ne
she may well su^what give for them both with good conscience. Nathelesse if she
se him greatly agreuyd for ^eryeuynge / and he forbede utterly her to give
alms / thanne it is good that she obey to his biddynge and be sorry yt she
may not give / and be always in will to give if she durst. and so win her mede
by will alone / as she did before by will and deed.


Dives. If ye wif have good in propre by her self Bona perafernalia. may she
natt give thereof withoute^ her husbo^des will.


Pauper. She may give. and she is bound to give / and he owes not to let her


Dives. I suppose. yt the husbonde forbede his wife utterly to do alms of
his good and she se a man or a woman in vi^ mischief / may she not tha^ ^eue
them alms and help them


Pauper. in ye need she is bound to give and she shall give / and think yt if
her husbonde saw yat need he should not be mispayed. we read in the first
book of kings. xxvi.c. yt there was a great nygarde and an angry shrewe. Whose
name was nabal. He had a good woman wise and fair to his wife whose name was
abigail. That time david fled the persecucion of king saul. and lived in
deserte with vi. hundryd men with him as outlawes. And for mischief he sent x.
men to this rich nabal. praynge him of su^me alms in mete and drynk But
this nabal despised david and his messangers. and clepyd them thieves and
outlawes and flemyd men / and would no good give hem / not withsto^ding that
they had sauyd his good / and his bestes / all the time that they were in
deserte. When david herd these tidi^ges he was wroth and came with iiii.
hundryd me^. to sle nabal / and all that lo^ged to him. It hapnyd that a
servant of nabal told his wife abigail. how David had sent messangers to
Nabal: and how he had despised them.

Anon Abigail without wytting of Nabal charged Assis with bread and wine with
soden flessh of five sheep. figs and with reisens and other vitayles great
plentye and sent to / David by her serua^tis: and she followed after: and
happened to mete David in his coming / Thanne David repreued her husbonde
Nabol of his unkindness: and seyde he should sle him / and all that longed to
him. Thanne the good woman Abigail fell down to ground and worshipped David.
and prayde him of audience / Tha^ne she axed mercy to her husbonde Nabol and
excused hirsilf. that she wist not of his masse^gers wha^ne they were there and
prayde David yt he should not so venge himsilfe and taught him much goodness. and
proficeid to him much wealth and prayde that he would accept her presaunt. and
so he did / Tha^ne David said to her / Blessed be our lord god that sent the
this day to me / and blessed be thy speech. and blessed be thou that this day
have let me fro sheddyng of blood to venge mysilfe / And thanne David turned
again into desert. and she came home again and fond her husbond nabal at soper
sole^^ly But that night she spak naught too him of that matter. for he was full
drunken / But in the morrow when he was sobre: she told him what she had do
to save his life / And anon his heart died for sorrow / and he wex heavy as a
stone / and with in ten days he died wicked death. and than David wedded his
wife Abigal Also if man or woman stele awey mannys swerd when he is wood to
let him of manslaughter of himsilfe: or of other: he does no theft ne sin.
Also by cause of rightwisnesse man may take aweye other mennys goodys ayens
there will. as in rightful bateyle: so that they that feyght rightfully ayens
the vnrightful take there goodys not for couetise: but for rightfulnesse to
show yt they have ocupied tho goodys wrongfully / But if they take there goodys
for evil couetyse: they do raueyne. though the deed be rightful in the sylfe.


The seventh precept.
Dives. If a thing be lost and he that fyndethe it keep it stylle: is it
theft.


Pauper. He yt finds it: is bound to restitucion: if he may wete to whoom it
longethe. And therefore he shall do men to wit of the finding by open spech in
town street and in church / that he that owes it may challenge it And if no
man challenge it: he yt fo^de it may by auctorite of awis confessoure keep it
stylle if he be pore and nedy and pray for him that aught it or else give it
to other nedy that they may pray for him yt aught it: and so make restitucion
Therefore saint Austen says in omelia. if thou have found any thing / and not
made restitucion: that thing thou have stolen / For he says / god takes more
head to ye heart than to the ho^de And therefore theft is doonin asmale thing:
as in a great For god charge not the thing that is stolen: but the wicked will
of the steler as says saint auste^ and saint gregori / And therefore if children
i^ there yongthe stele pynnes or apples or any other small things anon as it is
perseyued / they should be hard chastised in ye begynni^g For the philosofre
says Principiis obsta withstond the beginning of vices and of micherye. For
wha^ne children in young bygynne to have liking in mycherie / though the thing
be small i^ valu: there sin is not the less ne the sin of them that suffer
the^: Therefore it is gods dome yt when they be not chastysed i^ there yongth
for such mycherie afterward they stele gretter things: and be hanged. to shame
and shenshyp of al there kyn / And therefore as boicius de disctplina scolariu^
tells wha^ne a mannys son of Rome should be hanged: he p^yed his fader to
kys him And he bote of his faders nose. seiyng to hi^ Thenke well fader on this
toke^: and chastise better thy children. For had thou chastysed me well in
myy outh I should not have be hanged / Therefore the wise man says / Qui parcit
virge odit filiu^ suu^ etc. He that spariehe the yerd: hates his son. And he
loves his son that chastises hi^ and techeth him besely. prou^.xiii. We
read that on a time a power man was tempted to ete goos flessh but he durst not
stele for dread of hangi^ge. On a day he met with the fend and he bad hi^ stele
a gose and ete enough at onis And he did so / And sone after he stale an ox and

him wheder a wey Tha^ne the these said to the fend: woo worth the wicked wight:
for thou have brought me to this end / Tha^ne said the fend blame me not /
for thou might se by ye byl that it was no goo^


The eight chapter.
DIues^ I suppose a man have borrowed a thing. and he that lent it him takethe
it aweye fro him p^uely ayens his will. and ayens the covenant of the lenyng do
that man theft. so taking again his own good:


Pauper. He does theft For it is not for ye time fully his own good. as
says Raymu^d lio.iio. ti. de furtis / And if lord or lady: or any other man
bytake his servant or his officer any thing to keep. and he take it awey fro
him without his weti^g: for falls couetyse or for malice to endau^gere the
servant. he does theft / For though the thing be his own: yet it is not freely
his own: as long as the servant by his assent has kepi^g and despe^sacion
thereof.


Dives. I suppose a man weneth to take his own good when he takes anoter
ma^nys good ayens his will / or if he take his own good vnlefully. Wenyng yt
it were leful so to take it does be any theft in this case:


Pauper. Nay For all though in case he do vnlefully: yet i^ this case be does
no theft ne dedly sin: And yet he is bound to restitucion / Theft i^cludeth
alwey gyle and falsnes without which is no theft: And if a man take of another
mannys good without his wittyng if he have a just cause to wene yt he should not
be mispayde though he wist it tha^ does he no theft ne sine / and if he take
another ma^nis good weni^g that it be not his will though it be his will yt he
take it: yet he does theft and dedly sin in gods sight: But he is not
bound to restituco^n wha^ne he knows yt it is the lordis will: ne the lord
may not axe restituco^n sith it was his well / If aman or woman by mis eggi^g
take awey another mannys servant he does theft / If a man selle or bye man or
woman that is fre. or yeuethe him or takes him of gift ayens his will / he
does thift: as says Raymu^d. Vbi sup^. If a man or woman be take presoner i^
time of rightful bateyl he is not fre And therefore his master may give him or
sell hi^ by law of arms: Butte ware him of law of conscience: and of charity:


Dives. If a man have hired or borrowed an horse or any other thing into a
certain place and for a certain time: and he pas that place or his time aye^s
his will that owethe that thing does he theft:


Pauper. If he do so of purpos and for couetyse or sum evil cause / he does
theft But if there fall a sodeyne case wha^ne he comethe to that place

that he hired it to and he knew not of that case wha^ne he hired that thing /
and hi^ most nedis perform that case: or else fall in grt harm: tha^ne he
may take that horse or other thing ferther and longer without: theft so that he
may truly pay for that yt he passes in the first covenant


Dives. And what if a man lene awey another mannys good without assent of him:
which good he lent him to his use.


Pauper. he does thefr: But he have just cause to wene that the lord of ye
thing shall not be mispayd / For in ye lening he uses another mannis good
ayens his will for lucre and wynnyng of frendshyp / And if a man lene another
any thing upon a wed. And he use ye wed without leave of him that owes it: he
does theft / but it be for saluaco^n of ye thing For if he use it for spari^g
of his own good for lucre or for falls couetise ayens his will that owes it. he
does theft as says the same clerk If athi^g stolen perissh. though the
thief have no profit thereby: yet is he bound to restituco^n. and he most
yield as good or better tha^ it was wha^ he took it And he is bound to make
restituco^n both of ye thing and of the profyt that came thereof to hi^ And for
ye profyt that should have come thereof to the lord in the time that ocupied it
ayens his will And if he have amended the thing that he stale / he may not axe
again ne withold his expe^sis / And he shall make restitucion after yt the thing
was worth when he stale it or better If the thief profre the lord in
couenable time and place the stolen thing: and the lord will not receive it:
if the thing after that by mishap perisshe: the lord has non accion ayens
the thief for the letti^ge of restituco^n ne for the profit that might have
come thereof after that he proffered it to him: but for the time before If a man
have stolen a thing he is bound not only to restitucion of the thing: but also
of the value of the use.


Dives. If a man or woman bye in open markette a thing stolen: wening that it
were not stolen: when he knows the soth. may he axe the pryse of that thing
of him yt owethe it: or withdraw it: til he have pated hi^ as much as he paid
therefore


Pauper. Reymu^d and other clerks sey nay. And therefore be ware another time /
both for loss of his and also for susspeccion of theft. for lightly for
beggi^ge of stolen thing he might be take as a thief / Nethelesse he my
rightfully axe his payment of him that sold it to him when he has restored
it to the lord of that thing / and if he spent any thing in ame^deme^t of
that thing while it was in his keeping: he may with good faith axe that of him
that owth the thing without restoryng of the prophet that he had of that thing:
before he wist that it was stolen But wha^ne he knowethe that it is stolen. and
other mennys keeps it stylle for couetise or any other unlawful cause: he is
bound to restituco^n fro ye time as long as he keeps it of the profyt to the
lord: If the thing perissh while he keep it not knowing that it was stolen by
good feyth: he is bound to restitucion / And if he sold it awey or yaue it or
he knew of the stelthe be is not bound to restituco^n of the thing. but of the
profyt. if he be ame^dyd thereby and this is good law of conscience / If a man
stele fro a rich negard or an usurer. any thing to do alms: he does theft /
Quia no^ sunt facie^da mala vt vei^a^t bona.xxxii. q^. iiii. sict non sunt /
For as saint Austen. says. all though he give in alms all that he has take
in stelth he is not excused of theft. for he puts sin to sin / First he
steleth / and in yt yeueth it awey he makethe himsylfe unable: to make
resttuico^n / And though a man purchase much good falsely and do alms of ye
misgote good he is not excused of rauayne.

Dives. May not criste^ me^ stele young children of jews and of hethen people.
and baptize them ayens the will of there fader and mother /


Pauper Nay / And that for three skilles / First to fle perel of the feyth / For
wha^ne they come to age they might lightly be perverted fro the feythe. by mys
eggyng of the fader and mother. Also by rightful law of kind the child is
under cure of the fader and his mother and of his fre^des till he come to yeris
of discrecion But when they be in age of discrecion / they may be cristened
ayens the will of there fader and mother: but not ayens there own will / Also it
was never the manner of holy church to cristene young children of hethen people:
ayens the will of there fader and mother / And if it might have be don lefully
saint Siluestre and saint Ambrose and other holy men of holy church should have
get that leave of christian princes that were lords that time: both of christian
and hethen people But they axed never that leave: ne did it by there own
auctorite: as sey the saint Thomas In quadam

Dives. If a woman stele any thing or she be wedded. may she make restituco^n
after that she is wedded without any leave of her husbond:


Pauper. If she have stole thing: she is bound to make restitucyon thereof /
though her husbond again say it: For her husbond has no right in that thing
And if the thing stolen be wasted: she is bound to make restitucion if she
may of her own traueyle and of her own wynni^ge But of her husbondys godys:
ne of there godys in common she may not well make restitucion with out his leave:
but if he were consenting to the theft / and if the husbond stele any thing:
if the wife consent thereto or have part thereof in eti^ge and drynkyng or any
other use: be it with her will be it ayens her will. she may preuely make
restituco^n of there common godys / For in that she does no gyle ne theft to her
husbonde. but she does that ^e aught to do But if he forbid her vttrly to make
restitucion: and she be not co^senting to the theft it is siker tha^ to her to
obey and make no restitucion ayens his will / and though she did / it were no
dedly sin. And if she stele any thing: and her husbond be co^sentyng thereto:
or wetingly takes part of ye theft she may make restitucion p^uely of there
common godys: if she may not do it of her own labor. Hec sm^. confess. li.iio.

Dives. If a man have late his house or place to ferme for acerte^ time may he
in any case put the fermore out within that time.


Pauper. In many case he may put him out: First if the place be nedful to his
own dwelli^ge. for his other place that he dwelled i^: when he let that to
hyre is perisshed by fire or by mishap: or take fro him: and he has no^ other
to dwell in / But if he had non other wha^ne he let him to hyre: he may not
put him out for that need / For he might auysed hi^ wha^ he let it so to hyre
/ Also if the house have need of amendeme^t. Which byganne after that he let
it him to hire / But in these two casis he most alesse the hire that the
fermoure should pay for the time yt has dwelled therein Also if the fermoure
myssvse the house and the place / as if he keep swyne in house of onestye: or
waste the place / And in theyse casys he may do hi^ pay full paime^t for ye time
that he has ocupied it: and make amendys for such harms And if he fail
greatly of his pay /

folly and his fault he bring the lo^d out of tilthe / Also if the lord of the
house or place / fall in great harm and enmyte by defaute of ye fermoure
Also if the fermoure keep open thieves or open lechours or other malefasouris in
his houses: or his reseyuourys: of such wicked folk: thanne may the lord

The tenth chapter.
Dives. If a man by gyle do another man sell a thing yt he thought not to sell or
do him sell it for less than he thought have sold it: Does that man any sin
/ As these men that tell folk that there is much corn and much salt coming
newly from biyonde the sea. and so make men to sell great chepe there corn and
salt yt they have: that they may they msylfe afterward sylle there corn and
there salt the derer And as chapmen that come home by times before other: tell
that there fellows be take of enemies and that lityl more chaffer shall come And
so by lesynges they sell there good more dear than they should else selle


Pauper. They sin grievously. and in manner they do theft / Netheles the
contract that men make with them in byi^g and selling most stand: but if
it be ouerdon outrage and open falshede / Butt he most do penance for his
lesynges and hy^ gyle


Dives. Is it leful to sell athynge for more than it is worth


Pauper. If the seller selle any thing for more than it is worth to begyle the
byer. he does great sin and theft / But if he do no gile i^ his sellyng than
he may sell it after that they accord / For although it be not so much worth
to another man as he sells it for: yet i^ case it is so much worth to hi^ yt
begeth it. and he that sells it may not forgo it for less price without
great damage / And i^ this case one thing may be sold for mor tha^ it is
worth i^ ye silf by common estymaco^n but if ye seller may forgo it without damage
so yt he have the valeu by common estimacion he is bound too selle it for the
common use. and no more take therefore / And if the seller be much harmed by the
sellyng: and the byer much amended by the byynge: he owethe by good conscience
if he may do sum reward to the seller. although londys law compel him not
thereto / And the same owith the seller to the byer. if the seller be much
ame^dyd by that sellyng / and the bier much apeyred


Dives. It is hard to know what is the right value. of a thing


Pauper The right value and the just price of thing is after yt the common
market gothe that time And so a thing is asmoche worth as it may be sold to.
by common market. Ta^ti valet quanti vendi potest. Hec sm^ con. li.ii. ti. viii.
q^. i. et q^. ix. If a man or woman selle a thing for good and he know a
defaut therein by which defaute the bier is disceiued / he does gile and theft
Also and if the bier begile so the seller. And therefore god seyde to the false
iewys. Argentu^ tuu^ versu^ e^ in scoriam / et vinu^ tuu^ mixtu^ est aqua Thy
silver is turned into dross of silver and into falls metal ^ and thy wine is
medlyde with water. ysa. io And therfo^ they that begile folk with false money
wyttyngly / do great syn. and perilous theft Also if he selle wyttyngly by falls
measure / and by false weightes And therefore god says thou shall not have
diverse weightes more and less / to bye by the more / and selle by the less.
Ne thou shall not have a more busshel and a less busshell. ne none other falls
diverse mesut But thou shall have just weit and true and even busshel and
true. that thou may live long in the land that god shall give the God hatith
that man that does such gyle / and he hatith al manner of vnrightfulnesse.
Deutro. xxv. Also if man or woman sell seek thing for an hole thing wittyngly
to begile the bier / he does theft / and is bound to restitucion. And though
he know not ye defaute / when he sellith it / when he knowith yat defaut he is
bounden to make su^me reco^pe^sacion. as says the same clerk in the same book
and place. q^. xi. Also if the seller sell a better thing than he wenyth to
selle in great damage of him self / as if he selle gold for lato^. or if he
sell a good thing for a small price / wenyng that it were litel worth if he be
much harmyd thereby / the bier is bound to restitucion or recompe^sacion.


Dives. Is the seller holden to tell the bier the defautes of a thing that he
sellith


Pauper. If the defautes be preuy and perilous / he is holden to tell them to
the bier and selle that thing better chepe. For if he sell an haltyng horse for a
swyft horse / and a ruynous house for a strong house / it is perilouse. and
harm. to the bier / and he is bound to restitucion But if the defaute be open
/ and though it may not serve ye seller it may serve the byer / thanne it
nedith not the feller to tell the defautes but he is bound to selle it for the
less prise.


Dives. May a man selle a thing a derrer tha^ne he bought it. to


Pauper. Else might no man live by his marchau^dise ne by his craft He must
take up his costs and sustain him and his by measure and worship god and holy
church / and help the pore nedy after his estate And for this end it is
leful and nedeful to the chapma^ and to the werkman to selle thing derrer
tha^ne he bought it. to And therefore sei^t Poule says. that no man is holden
to travail on his own costs for the comynute / neither in knighthode ne in
chapmanhode ne in werkmanship. And they yt with false oaths / and lesynges /
and slye speech begile folk in byeng and selling / sin greuouslye. and be
holden to restitucion / if they begile so folk wyttyngnly.


Dives. If ii. persons betake the thridde person a thing to keep by covenant
that he shall not deliver it but to them both to gider. is he bound to keep
covenant


Pauper. yhe forsothe.


Dives. And what if he deliver it to oone of them in absence of the other / and
withouten his wyttyng


Pauper. He does amys / and yitt neither of hem has lauful accion against him
for to compelle him to yield it. For he that resceyued it again has none accion
to him / for he took it him again. And the other. has none accion against him /
for he is not bound to him withouten the other that made the covenant with him
/ and has resceyued it again. Thus says Hostie^sis in su^. li.iii. Rubrica de
deposito. S. cui detur. v. si vero.


The xi. chapter.
Dives. May not a man do alms of evil gote^ good


Pauper. Solomon says. Immo lantis ex iniquo: oblacio est maculata. The
offrynge of him yt offceth of evil gote^ good / is spottyd and foul in gods
sight And he that offreth sacrifice of ye pore man's good / is like him. that
sleeth the son in the sight of his fader. And god that is highest approves
not the yiftes of the wicked me^ / ne takith head to their offrynge. Eccle.
xxiiii. And therefore Solomon says Honora deum de tua substa^cia. Worship thy
lord god with thine own good / not of other men's good Proverb. iii. And
Tobie said. Ex substancia tua fac elemosina^. Of thyn own good do alms.
Tobie iiii.c.


Dives. Contra. God bids in the gospel that men should make them friends in
the bliss of heuyne of richesses of wickedness / Facite vobis amicos de
ma^mona iniqtatis. Therefore it semyth yat it is leful to do alms of evil gotten
gods


Pauper. In three manners a thing may be evil gotten / For su^tyme it is so mys
gotten yt it must be yolden again to him yt owes it / as in theft / raueyne /
and usury if he may be found. And so of mys gotten good men should do none
alms / but yield it aye^ Also a thing is mys gotten when both yeuyng and
taking of the thing is against gods law / and both the yeuer and the taker
lose their right / as in symonye. And therefore neither they may do plesau^t
alms of that good so mys gotten. Also a thing is mys gotten / when the deed
and the craft that it is gotten by is so unlawful that the taker may keep it
stylle lefully / but the yeuer may not axe it again / as thing gotten by
licherye and by synful iapery of irregulers of mynstralles witches / and such
other. Which manner wynnyng is clepid foul wi^nyng. that is Turpe lucru^ in
latyne. And of such evil gotten good they may do none alms. But they should
make no open offrynge at the auter ne sacrifice of so mys gotten good. And
therefore god says. Non offeres mercede^ prostibuli in domo dn^i dei tui quia
abhominatio e^ apud deum Thou shall not offer ye mede of the woman a comen
lechoure in the house. of thy lord god / for it is abhominacion to god.
Deutro. xxiii. And officers of kings princes lords and ladies of busshoppes
and prelates / yt take yiftes of men by common custom or by profre / that they
should mayntene them and give them favor in their causes / they may do alms
of gods so gote^ / al though it be full often evil gotten.xiiii. q^. v. non sane.
For to such Christ bad that they should make them friends in heuene / of
richesses of wickedness / that is to say of richesses so mys gotten For he that
takes it has no right thereto.


Dives. Why praised Crist in ye gospel the false baily that so for yaue men
their dett / in fraud of his lord / to have thank of hem and help at need.
For he foryaue one the halfdele his dett / A another the fifte part of his
debt.


Pauper. Crist prised not the false ^al^^e. Butt Christ says that his lord
praised him not for his fraud but for his slighte that he did in help of him
self ne Criste tellith not that parable in the gospel / that men should take
example of his fraud. to help them self by fraud of robbere of other mennys
good / but to teache me^ to make them friends by deeds of mercy and of alms
/ and foryeue other men their dettes as they wole that god foryeue them there
dettes and make them fre^des / in heuene with richesses of this world


Dives. Why clepyd Crist richesses of this world richesses of wickedness


Pauper. For they been to much folk occasion of much wickedness. and much
disease of hate / wrath / envy / of debate of plee and of great discension And
it is full hard to get the^ or to keep them withoute^ sin. and great disease
And therefore seint Poule says that they yat coueyte to be rich in this
world. fall in the feendes snare. And the wiseman says if thou be rich in this
world / thou shall not be unguilty ne cleen from sin. Alsoo leave friend ye
shall understand. that wickedness in holy writ is taken not only for sin /
but also for pain and disease and myscheuys of this world And so gods of
this world been clepyd richesses of wickedness / that is to say of pain. and
disease. and of mischief For they bring men in to pain travail and much
disease / for men have much trauail in getting / much dread in keeping / and
much sorrow in the lesyng.


Dives diuicias non congregat absque labor. Non tenet absz metu / nec deserit
absz dolor They hot sikernesse and bring folk into great perel / great dread
and in great enemyte They hot a man to have his lust and lykyng and bring him
in endless hungre For as solomon says the couetouse man has neuir enough
Auarus non impletur pecunia. but always couetith more and mo^ Also they bi^ete a
man ease and rest and bring him in much trauail. for nigh all the traueyle of
this world is to get good. Another skylle there is why they been clepyd
richesses of wickedness For the law says.x. q^. i. dilectissimi^ by wey of
kind all men ben even in lordeshippe and richesses. but by wickedness of
false couetise in the people men ben vneue^ i^ riches For su^me have much.
some litel / su^me ben rich su^me ben pore / and god has youen more richesse
to one man in dispensacion and governance / thanne to many other. And yt is to
refreyne the wickedness o false couetise. in the people And for wyckednes is
cause that oone man is richer thanne a another / therefore they be clepyd
richesses of wickedness. For ne had be the wyckednes of Adames sin / and
of falls couetise of man's heart / else all men should have been euynly
rich. But now they ben vneuyn in richesse for sin and shrewidnesse / and
therefore gods of this world ben clepyd richesses of vneuenes and of
wickedness. iniquitatis id est non equitatis. And therefore all the richesses
yt one man has passinge another. it is richesses of vneuenesse. For in yat he
is vneuyn with his eue^ christian. therefore they ben clepyde richesses of
vneuynesse. Therefore god bids the rich men yt been but his baillies and his
Reues in this world make friends of the pore folk / both by yeui^g and
foryeuynge / as that baillie did / and be not to hard to their subgettes but
merciable and for give hem their dettes which they owe to god and to them For
god is so great a lord and so rich yt there may no man do him fraud. of his
good ne hyndre ne lose his lordshippe.


The xii. chapter.
Dives. In the fifth precept thou seidest that rich me^. that wole not help the
pore folk ben mansleers Here thou see yt they be theuys / and so it semyth
that they do against both precepts.


Pauper. In that the poor man may die for the rich man with holdith his good
from him / in yt the rich man is a mansleer / and does against this precepte
Non occides. thou shall not slay And in that he witholdith his good. from the
poor man in his need he is a thief and does against this p^cepte Non furtum
facies Thou shall do no theft. For all that ye richeman has passing his
nedful living. after the state of his dispensacion / it is the pore man's And
therefore says seint ambrose. that it is no less sin. to the rich man for
to deny the poor man help at need when he may help him of his abu^dau^ce.
thanne it is to rob a man of his good. The bread says he yt thou witholdest
in superfluytee. is the pore folks that have hu^gre And the waste clothing
yat thou shittest up in superfluytie. is the pore wydowes. And the money that
thou hydest in the earth in waste is the ransom of the priseoners and of
mischeuous folk / for to deliver them out of prisone and out of bonds / and
help them out of woo. And therefore says he / wit thou itt well. that of
asmany gods thou art theif and rauenoure as thou might give to help of
the pore folk if thou give them not. No man should say any thing his own
that is comyne to all.


Dives. I assent well to thy words that rich men should give alms of their
haboundaunce saving the state of their dispensacion / and yt is fulle hard to
do For much thing is nedeful to the rich man more tha^ne to the pore. because
of his state. of dispensacion. For moo things ben need fulle to a king tha^ne
to an earl. and moo to an Earl thanne to a simple knighte. and so it is of
other staates. To kings princes and lords it is nedful to have treasoure to
wage men of arms in defense of the Realm / and to wage their officers in
governance of the Realm and of there lordship. And therefore an Emperor said.
Qui omnibus pre est: omnibus indiget. He that is Lord by dispensacion of all
thing in this world / has need of all thing. And so the more lorship in
this world / the more need.


Pauper. Therefore of such things so nedful to man after the state of his
dispensacion. he is not bound to give the pore. but in great need. But of
other superfluyte that is not nedefulle to him in that degree / he is bound to
give For always the common profytte owith to be chargyd more. thanne the profytte
of one person


Dives. It semyth by thy words that men of holy church which spend the gods
of holy church in wicked use / as in pomp. pride / glutony / lechery / and in
other vanities be thieves / for they witholde pore me^nys good / and spend it
mysuse against the will of god and of pore folk


Pauper. That is sothe / for seint Jerome says that all that clerks have of
holy church gods / it is the pore mennys / and for help of the pore folk
principaly holy church is e^dowyd. To them that have the benefices and ye
gods of holy church / it longith principaly to give alms and to p^aue cure
of the pore people. Therefore seint Bernard / in epistola ad eugeniu^ / says
thus. the nakyd cry and the hungre pleyne them and say. ye bisshopes what does
gold in your bridles / it may not putt away cold ne hu^gre fro ye bridle It is
our that ye so spend i^ po^pe and vanytie. ye take it from us cruelly / and
spend it veynely. And in a another pistle that he wrote to a chanon he said
thus. If thou serve well gods auter it is grauntyd to the to live by ye auter
/ not to bye their bridelles. silueryd or ouirgilt For what thou kepist for thy
self of the auter passinge thyn honest nedeful living / it is raueyne / it is
theft it is sacrilege. Therefore these men of holy church that boocle there
shone with boocles of silver and use great silver harneys in their girdylles
and knyues / and men of religion / monks and chanones / and such other. that
use great ouches of silver and gold. on their copes to fastne their hodes
against the wind / and ride. on high horse with sadles harneised with gold and
silver more po^pouslye thanne lords / be strong theuys and do great sacrilege
so spe^dyng the gods of holy church in vanite and pride / in lust of the
flesh / by which good the pore folk should live. A lady of a thousand
mark by year ca^pynne her hode against the wynd with a small pynne of laton
xii for a penny. But a monk that is bounden to poverty by his profession wole
have an ouche / or a broche of gold and silver in value of a noble or much
more.


Dives Be not such men of holy church so mispendyng the pore mennys gods
bound to restitution.


Pauper. If they have whereof to make restitucion / they ben holden to
restitucion / as says Dockynge super. Deutro. v.c. Quia non dimittitur
peccatum donec restituatur ablatum. And therefore seint Austyne. In epistola ad
Macedonium. says thus. If a another man's good be not yolde^ again wha^ne it
may be yolden / he that stale it does no verrey penance but he feyneth
penance For if he do verrey penance he must do restitucion to his power.


Dives. And what say thou of tho clerks that spe^de holy church goods. on
their kynnesmen and wymen. and oyer rich folk for to be mayntened and for to
have a name and for to be worshipped in this world.


Pauper If they give their kynnesmyn and their friends to releue them of their
need / it is well done. and the order of charity axith it. But if they give the
gods of holy church to make them rich and great in this world. of ye pore
mennys good / it is raueyne theft and sacrilege. Alsoo to give rich folk
measurablye to mayntene them rightfully in holy church / it is well done Butt
to give them holy church gods to be worshipid and to have a name of pomp it
is evil done and it is sacrilege and theft so to spend the gods of holy
chirch that been the pore mennys gods.


Dives. What sayste thou of them that spend the gods of holy church. in
their own nedefulle use / and do not their duite ne serve natt therefore.


Pauper. The same Cclerke Dockynge in the same place faith / that they ben
thieves For the gods of holy church / and the benefices ben youen to them.
that they should trauayl and serve holy church in techynge prechynge and
sacraments yeui^ge and in besy governance. And but they do so. they be natt
worthy to have bn^fices of holy church ne to live by holy church gods. And
therefore Seint Poule. says. Qui non laborat. no^ ma^ducet.^ He that trauayleth
natt should not ete. And if yt they take holy church gods / and traueyl not
therefore as they ben bounde^ they ben theuys. For if a labourer took money to
travail in ye field. and he trauayled not therefore / but he yaue it again he
should be holden a thief. And therefore seint Poule said. Qui episcopatum
desiderat / bonum opus desiderat. He yt desires a busshoprike / he desires a
good work. Prima and Thimo. teercio For as says the gloss / in that that he
desires a busshoprike / he desirey a work not a dignity. He desires
travail / not ease and rest. not to wexe into pride / butt for to come from
pride to more lowness / to be servant and minister of all his subgettes of
which he has cure / or else they be not worthy to live by the goods of holy
church For the benefices of holy church be not youen he^ for to go pley them
/ butt for to travail about their cure.


Dives. They have their vikers and their parisshe preestis under them.


Pauper. The vyker and the parisshe priest shall answer for that they they
resceiue and ye pesone for that / yt he resceyuethe. And he that more
resceyueth more is bound. And the benefices of holy church be not youen to
clerks that they should betake to other men the cure / Butt for they should
have principal cure them self. For else the lewyd man. and woman might have
the benefices of holy church / as says the same Clerk. And he says that
persons which absent them fro their churches only for ese or for couetise. or
for lust of their flesh. and so spend the goods of holy church / they
been thieves Nathelesse as he says they may absente them from there churches for
a time by leave of their sovereigns that may give them leave for su^me good
cause / as for learning or for help of their churches. Also they that resceyue
the benefices of holy church and be unable in that time wha^ne they resceyue
them to serve holy church / or to have cure of that benefice / they ben
theuys. But when they fall in age and in feebleness after that they have truly
traueiled / or after that ye bn^fice is youen them they may lefully live by
their benefices but if they have sufficient patrimony to be sustained with.
Also they that ap propre to them gods of holy church be theuys and do
sacrilege as says the same Clerk dockyng / in the same place For clerks in
their beginning say. Dominus pars hereditatis me Our lord god is part of

should take heed to his name what it signifies / and travail to be such as
his name signifies. Quia cleros greci dr sors latin. For clerk in greek and
in latyne. is lot and part in englisshe For every Clerk should be the lotte and
the part of our lord god / and in that they been ordained to gods service
passing the comen people Therefore they been clepyde Clerks. Clerici. that is
to say / chosen by lotte. For they been kings / and gouernoures of hoolye
church. And in tooken thereof they bear the crown on their head by shauynge
away of their here. For the shauynge away of their here. signifies and
betokens doing away of te^peral gods and wilful pouert. by which they been
kings in heuene. Ibidem. capitulo. duo. And therefore says the law there.
Capitulo Res ecclesie. That things of holy church ben not had as propre
but as come^ / and owe to be spent in the use that they be youen to. For all
that thou Clerk haste. more thanne suffiseth the to thy nedeful living / but
thou give it and spend it in good use thou witholdest violently as a thief.
Distinctione. xlvii. Sicut. And if clerks have patrimony. sufficiently of
their own to live by / if they waste the gods of holy church that been
ordeynede for pore folk. they do theft and sacrilege. xvi. q^. i. in fi.


The xiii. chapter.
Dives. What is propirly sacrilege.


Pauper. Sacrilegium est sacre rei violatio / vele / iusdem vsurpatio Vnde
sacrilegium quasi sacrilediu^ id est sacrum ledens. Sacrilege is defouling of
holy thing / or mysusyng and mys taking of holy thing.


Dives. In how many manners is sacrilege done.


Pauper. Su^tyme sacrilegie is done for the person that is despised and
mysboden As when clerk or religiouse is beten or smyten in despit Sumtyme
sacrilege is done because of the place as when church or churcheyerde is
pollute by blood shedyng or any holy place is reuyd of his fredom. Also
sacrilege is done because of thing yat is stolen or mysused / and that in three
manners / Or for that holy thing is taken out of holy place / or thing not
holy out of holy place / or holy thing out of no holy place. xvii. q^.
quarta. qisqis.


Dives tha^ it semyth yt they yat witholde there tithes fro god and holy church
/ do theft


Pauper So says the law. xvi. q^. vii decimas. For the tithes of holy church been the auowes of christian people / ransom of sins. and patrimony
help and heritage of the pore people / and tributes of the nedy souls. xvi.
q^. i. quia iuxta. et.c. decime. Where the law says that tithes be deit to
god. And all that witholden them falsely they do sacrilege / and rob the
pore folk of their gods And he that witholdithe his tithes / wrongefully
shall answer at yedome for asmany souls as perisshe for hungre and
mischeife. in that parisshe.

Where he duellith. And he ye wole not pay his tithes shall mysspede and his
good. shall vanysshe / and he shall have sekensse. and sodeyne pouert.
Ibidem.c. Reuertimini. And if he pay his tithis truly he shall have health of
boby / and the more plenty of good and grace of god / and foryeuenesse of
sin / and the kingdom^ of heuyn. As says the law / ibidm^ co. decime. Et
Raymundus in su^ma sua li.i. titulo de decimis. And therefore the law says
there that god axith not the tithes for yifte ne for need but for worship yat
we should knowledge him our lord and yeuer of al good He axith of us the tenthe
part for our profit not for his profit It is a sin to pay late / but much
more syn is neuir to pay ibm^ x.c.


Dives. Of what things is a man bound to tithe


Pauper. Of corn in heruyst / of wine in we^dage / of fruit. of bestial / of
gardeyn / of yerde / of medowe / of venery / of hyues / of fisshing. of
wyndmyl. and of watermylle / xvi q^. vii. Quicu^que et co sequenti. Extra.
li.iii. ti. xxxo pastoralis. And as Raymonde says Tithes owe to be youen of all the fruits of ye earth Of apples of tres / of erbes of pastures / of bestes /
of wolle. of mylk / of hey / of fisshinge / of fermes / of mylles / of bathes /
of fullynge places / of mines of silver and of other metal / of q^reris of
stone / of marchaundise of craste and of other goods and also of time lio io.
tio xii. And as says hostiensis libro iii. ^ode^ titulo Of every thing
rightfully gotten a man should tithe and of his service and of his knight
ship.


Dives. Much thing is well geten and with little aua^tage of them that get
it. and often with great loss / and therefore me thinks it is unskillful that a
man should tithe his chaffare and his craft or his service or his travail
there his wynni^g is little or naught.


Pauper. There been ii. manner tithes. Su^me come of therth / as corn wyn
bestiale that is brought forth by the land And such tithes ben clepyd
prediales in latyne Sum tithes come only of the parsone / as by marchaundise.
and werkma^shippe / and such tithes ben clepyd parsonales in latyne.

And in such tithes that been parsonales / and comen of marchaundise. Or of
craft / or of such. other travail / a man shall account his expenses / and
look whether he is encreasyd / or natt. And tithe his winning and his free
increases. in payng of tithes prediales yat come of the land / he shall not
acounte expe^ses but freely pay the tithe neither worste ne best but. but as
they cu^me to hand withouten chois Extra li.iii. e. ti. pastoralis. et c. cu^
homines. Nathe less if a man for devotion give the best to god / it is
prisable and well done


Dives. Should me^ tithe al thing ye newyth


Pauper. Things yt ben taxed in the law men should tithe / not al thing that
newithe / for much thing newith that is natt profitable. And though it be
profitable. yitt it is not worshipful as hounds. and cattes.


Dives. I suppose a man cu^me by fre yift of by succession and by heritage to
great lordship and much richesses / or take freely great yiftes / is he bounden
to give the tenth part of that eritage or of tho yiftes to holy church.


Pauper. Nay. for so al poscessions and lordshippes should fall to holy church. Extra e. pastoralis glosa. And if a rich man yaue a pore man x pe^s
to bye him with a clothe. or to pay his dettes / or else to his living. he should
pay the tithe to the p^st and that were against reason For if al free yiftes
should be tithed. holy church should be to rich. and the people to pore For
so he might axe the tenthe part nyghe of every testamament


The xiiii chapter.
Dives. To what church shall man pay his tithes.


Pauper. Tithes personales as of marchaundise and of craft man shall pay to his
parisshe church. there he duellith and takith his sacraments / and herith his
service But tithes prediales should be paid to the church / to which manner and
the land longith to. but custom be in the contrary. as says su^ma conf.
Tithes p^diales should be youen / anon in the beginning / but tithes
personelles may abide til the end of the year for the more auantage. of the
church


Dives. How should the tithes be spent


Pauper The tithes and the gods of holy church should be departed in four
parts / after that the parties haf need and be worthy One to the busshop if
him need Another to the ministres of the church. The tridde to pore folk The
iiii. to amendme^t and making of the church if it need.xii. q^. iiii. quatnor.
where the gloss concludith and says yat clerks should be compellyd to
reperacion of the church and not the lewd people x. q^. i. decernimus. But as
says Guy do in rosario in ye men must take heed to custom of ye cuntre and
what the part is that longith to the church


Dives. I suppose yt the curate of the chirch waste the gods of holy church.
in sin and i^ lechery / and be an open thief or an open lechour or mansleer /
so that his misleuyng. is sclaunderous and notorie. should men pay their tithes
to such wicked lyuers


Pauper. Hostiensis says that if the pressed or curate or curate of the church
mispende holy church gods. or be a notorie lechoure / the lewd man is natt
bound to give him his tithes But he shall give them to his sovereign next
above him which is bound to spend them in profytte of the church / or of the
pore parisshyns


Dives. The law is against him Extra li.iii^ ti. de decimis c. tua nos. where
the law says that for wickedness of the minystres of holy church. men should
not withdraw their tithes from them


Pauper. Hostiensis answers thereto and says yat as long as their sin is
pryue. men should not withdraw their tithes And so meneth that law. But
when their sin is open. and notorie thanne men should. not pay to them but
to there sovereign Thus says Hostiensis in su^. sua. li.iii. Kubrica de
decimis.S. et quare in fine And he allegith many laws for him and many laws
ben for him that he aledgith not For the great Clerk Gracianus in the decrees
yt is chief book of law canon says yt the clerk notarie lechour should
have no part in the goods of holy church. distinct. lxxxi. Si quis amodo cu^
aliis capli^s sequentibus And there says the gloss that to whom it is forboden
to do office in holy church / to him is forboden and interdiit his benefice
But as the law says there. To al such notorie lechoures. prestes dekenes
subdekenes ben forboden the offices of holy church yat they should do no
offices in holy church / and the people is forboden to here their office.
Therefore than their benefice. is forbode^ the^ til they amend hem ibm^ Siqui
sunt prisbiteri Upon which law says Gwydo in rosario. That if prestes be
found such open lechoures and malefactoures / their subgettes may of their
own auctorite put them from their office / And natt abide sentence ne doom of
their souereyn / al though the bishop were favorable to suffer such. wicked
livers For why says he such been suspe^ded by the pope and by the law.


Dives. This sentence is wonderfulle and not plesaunte to men of holy church
and yet as me thenkith it is skilful For if any man ought me dett and paid it
to mine enemy / to strengith him in his malice aye^s me wyttyng well that he
should rob me thereof and not pay it me. he did much against me and robbed me
cruelly of my good. And so as me thynkith do they yt pay tithes and duties
that long to god and holy church and to pore folk / and pay them. to such
wicked lyuers and open enemies to god / for they been lost for euir Or if he
kept them stille / or paid them to his sovereign. as Hostiensis says / than
were they sauf and holy church and the pore people might be helped thereby


Pauper. It is leful so to keep them and not against the law / yt they aledge
ayens hostie^sis and against other clerks and against the common law / for ye
law acordeth with all other clerks if it be well understand. For these been
the words of the law. Pretextu nequicie clericorum nequiunt eas. s. decimas
nisi quibus de ma^dato diuino debe^tur suo arbitrio errogare Extra libro iii.
de decimisc. tua nobis. That is to say in englisshe Lewd me^ may not under
color of wyckednes of clerks give by their own do me the tithes butt to
them that they been debt to / by the commandment of god. For it is not
leful to give awey a another man's good withouten the will of the lord of the
good as says ye law there. These words be not against Hostiense / for
Hostiense. spekith of clerks open lichours and open wicked lyuers.

This law spekith of clerks whose sin is preuy and of hem that been defamed
falsely by malice of the people / and he bids there that they should be
yeuone them again Also this law says that it should natt be youen but to them
that it longith to by the commandment of god But by the the commandment of
god they long not to such wicked lyuers. Therefore they should not be youen to
them. Also though they lewd man witholde his tithes and his duties fro such
wicked men in holy church and pay them to his sovereign. or else kepith them
stylle for profytte of holy church. in that he yeueth them not away butt
kepith the^ sauf to profit of holy church And that law men allege. ayens
hostien^. s. tua nobis / speaks against the lewd me. that give awey tithes of
holy church. and dispende them as them likethe. and give them away to whom ye
they wole / and this is not lefulle withoute^ autorite of busshopes. If the
busshop or any house of religion resceiue so many tithes in a parisshe by old
custom / that the curat of the church may not live honestly by his bn^fice /
than a certain portion of the tithes. may be youen to that curate. for to live
by. not withstondyng ye old custom Extra li.iii. de prebendis / c. extirpande
/ where the law says / yt he that has cure of a prisshe should serve it him
self and not by a another / but need of other cure compelle him thereto


The xv chapter.
Dives. Shall holy church axe tithes personales of iewys that duelle among
criste^ people


Pauper. Nay. For they be not of holy church / and they take natt sacraments
of holy church ne service of the curate. If a man gilously selle a portion of
corn or it be tithed / both the byer and the seller ben bound to tithe it The
seller for his gyle. and for he has the value of the tithe. And he yt bieth
it is bounden for that corn passith to him. With charge of they tithe. And so
holy church may axe ye tithe of whether of them that he wole But if he get
it of the one of them / he may not axe it of the other But if the byer thought
to gyle in his biynge if he paid the tithe after ye he bought it / the seller
is bound to make him restitucion. And if the byer and the seller wist well yat
it was not tithed / them must both do penance as for theft. And if the byer
pay the tithe / the seller is bound to restitucion but the byer bought it to
such a pris yt he may yet well save his own If the corn be stole or it be
tithed and the lord of the corn were to slow in the tithing and tithed natt
after the custom^ of the place but delayed it / holy church may axe of him the
tithe of the corn^ so stolen But if it be taken away with in the time of due
tithynge he is not bound to restitucion of the tithes. Hec Raymundus lio io de
decimis.


Dives Is a man bound by the precepte of god to pay al his tithes both
prediales and personales.


Pauper. As Innocente the pope the thridde. Extra e. in aliquibus. and Reymonde
also say All the tithes must be paid that been taxed by gods law. Leuitici
vltimo. And al other tithes both p^diales and personales after custom of the
cuntre long approved For consuetude or custom in law positif that is man's
law. is expositour and termynour of the law. Consuetudo approbata est optima
legum interpres. extra. li.io ti. iiii. cu^ dilectus Et consuetudo est
alteralex. But there may no consuetude or custom be kept against gods law /
ne against law of ki^de


Dives. Why badde god that me^ should pay more the x. part tha^ a another part.


Pauper For x is nombre so parfyte that it conteyneth al nombre For all nombres
after x. ben made of ten and no^bres within x. And nine is nombre vnparfite /
and all nombres within x ben imperfect in regard. of.x / And therefore god bad
that men should give him. the tenthe part / and keep to them self nine parts /
in token that al our parfection cu^meth of god and to hi^ it must be arretted
by prisynge and thankyng / and al our imperfeccion cu^meth of our self And
therefore we witholde nine parts to our self / and give to god the.x. part /
so knowlechyng that all our perfeccion and godenesse cu^meth of him / and al
our imperfeccion cu^meth of our self And in token that he is our lord and
lord of al / and al yat we have cu^mey from him / as al our no^bres ben
contained in x / and come of x.


The xvi chapter
Dives. Is symonye any spice of theft


Pauper. It is theft and sacrilege in that yt a man tretith and occupies
vnrightful thing that is not his Of such thieves spekith Crist in the gospel.
Qui non intrat per oftiu^ in ouile / sed ascendit aliu^de / hic fur est et
latro. Io. x.c. He yat entrith natt in the fold of holy church by the door
that is Crist. and takith not his benefice freely by weye of alms for cristes
sake but by symonye / he is a theif. and a mycher And all that so cu^me. into
the benefices of holy church by symonie / they ben mychers / and thieves


Dives. What is symony


Pauper. Symonye. is a studious couetise and will to bye or sell. thing
spirituel / or thing annexed or knytt to spirituel thing. For as the
philosophre says not only he that stelith priuelye / is a mycher But also he
that wole stele privily / is a mycher and a theif But here thou shall
understand that su^me things be forbode^. for they be symonyent as bieng and
sellyng of the sacraments of holy church / in which will alone withouten
deed makith a man guilty in symony Su^me things ben symonient only for they
ben forboden by holy church. As if a clerk resign his church in covenant
that it shall be youen to his neuewe or to su^me of his kyn such will withouten
deed makes not a man symonie^t ne guilty in symonye as anentes holy church /
but if it be done only for profytt of the person and not for profytt of holy
church. he is guilty before god And if he resign it freely in covenant and in
will that it shall be youen to him that is more able to profit to man's soul
tha^ne he is him self / in that resignyng he does no symonye.


Dives. Whereof came the name of symonye


Pauper. Of simon magus a great wytche For he proferyd to seint Petir a great
su^me of money to have grace of the holy ghost to make men hole of seknesses /
and to do wondres and to make the holy ghost to light in men and wymen / as
seint petyr did But seint Petir forsook his money and said to him. Thy money
be stylle with the in perdicion and perisshing of dampnacion / for thou wenyst
to get ye yift of god with itactuu^ iiii And therefore all that bye any thing
spirituel or any thing knytt to spirituel thing / ben clepyd propirly
symonie^tes And they that selle it ben clepyd giezites Giezi te in latyne For
Giezi the servant of Helisee the prophet took mede of the great lord Naman
for that god had made him hoole. of his lepre / by the prophet Helisee that
was his master And so he selde falsely the yifte of god. in asmoche as was in
him / against the will of god and of the prophet helisee. And therefore he was a
lepre and al his kynne after him. iiiio Regu^ v. Nathelesse commonly both bier
and seller of spirituel thing ben clepyd symonie^tes For simon magus did that
was in him to bye the grace of the holy ghost / and was in purpos and will to
selle it forth to other for money and for yiftes


Dives. In how many manners is symonie done.


Pauper In three manners as thing spirituel is bought and sold by three manner
yiftes For su^tyme it is bought by yifte of hand / su^tyme by yift of service
/ sumtyme by yift of tu^ge / yift of the ho^de is clepyd money and other
richesses / yift of service. is clepyd their service youen not i^ due manner /
ne rightfully to have a thing spirituel / yift of tunge is favor flateryng
and prayer yt men make them self or by other. so to have spirituel things Also
in resceyuyng of holy order is do symonye / sumtyme only on his side that
makith orders As wha^ su^me friend of him that shall be ordered yeueth the bishop
su^me yift withoute^ the wityng of him yat shall be ordered Sumtyme it is do only
on his side that shall be ordered / as if he give any yiftes to any of the
bisshopes officers to speak for him that he may be ordered and of which yift
the busshoppe knowyth not Sumtyme it is do of both the parties / as when the
one yeueth and the other takith. Sumtyme it is done and yitt in neither pertie
/ as if a friend of him that shall be ordered give or hot any thing to the
bisshopes officers to help him in that cause / and nether he ne the bishop
knowith of tho yiftes. And in these manners may also be done symonye. in yeuynge
of benefices of holy church. If any man give any yift for me or pray for me
that I may be ordryd or resceyue benefice if I ayensey and assent natt thereto
his yifte / ne his biheest / ne his prayer / lettithe not fro mine ordres ne
fro my benefice / but if I assent thereto before or after payng the money that
he behighte. I fall in symonye. And though it be neuir so preuy I must resign
/ And if mine enemy give or bihete yiftes for my promocion i^ will so to let me
by symone / and it be not mine assente / his deed lettith me not Extra libro
iiii. de symonia c. sicut tuis litteris. If any friend give any yift me
vnwyttyng for my promocion / and after that I wyste thereof or I were clepyd of
the busshop to my promocion. and I wist it well yt I should not be clepid but
for ye yift I should not resceyue that promocion. Hec su^. conf. li.i. ti. i.


The xvii chapter
Dives. May no thing be youe^ lefully for thing spu^el.


Pauper. yhis. For both yift of hand of tongue and of service. may be youe^ for
spirituel thing yift of hand may be youe^ for spu^el thing in v. cases as
says Reymunde. First if it be youen freely for devotion and for reverence of
the sacrament and of spu^el thing withoute^ any covenant. or any axing of the
taker. But for to give any thing by wey of covenant or biyng / or sellyng / or
of chaungyng it is not leful And if it be dout whether the yift be youen by
covenant or by evil entencion / me^ must take heed. to the state of the yeuer
/ and of the taker whether the rich give the pore / or the pore to the rich.
or rich to rich Also to the qua^tite of the thifte / whether it be of great
price or of little price. Also to the time of the yeuyng / whether i^ time of
need or in other time And so by these circumstaunces deem in wht manner it was
youen The secou^de cas is / when me^ give freely to any man of holy church.
any thing for spu^al dedis as for certain seiyng and singing to which he is
not bound. The iii. case is when it is youe^ to clerks for spu^el deeds to
the which they be^ bound of office For there is no man bound to travail for
naught / ne the curate serve the church for naught / ne the p^chor to
traueyle for naught And therefore seint poule says that they yt serve the auter
shall live by thauter. And so god has ordained yt they yt p^che the gospel.
shall live by the gospel. Prima ad little ix. Nathelesse the more freely that a
man p^chith the more is his mede And though he axe not ye people is bound to
give him freely / As says seint austyn super illud Produce^s fenu^ iume^tis.
The iiii. ca^e is to have life withoute^ e^de. and fory euenes of sin Therefore
Daniel said to the king Nabugodonosor Pcta^ tua elimo sinis redime Dan^ iiii.
Bye again thy sins with alms / not yat we may bie heuene / ne foryeuenesse
of sin / but by alms doing we may deserve to have for yeuenesse of syn /
and heuene bliss and so biynge is taken for deseruynge. The fifth cause is
wha^ne a man for to have peace byeth away the wrong that ht suffryth in spu^el
right wha^ne he is syker. yt his cause is rightful. Extra de symonia c. Dilecto

The xviii. chapter.
Dives. What pain is ordained against symonye.


Pauper If a clerk be a symonient in taking of his order / he is suspendyd of
his order both anentis him self and ane^tes other so yt he may not do execucion
of his order And whether his symonie be pryue or apert he is suspe^dyde. And if
he be co^uicte before his judge / shall be deposed. and unabled to eu^y worship
and lose ye money yt he paid therefore And he yt ordryd him wyttyngly by
symonie / or yaue him bn^fice by simonie or he tht resceyueth any bn^fice by
symonye / or is mean thereto though their syn be privy / yitt they be
suspendyde. as anentes them self. And if it be open / they ben suspe^dyd both
ane^tes them self and ane^tis other And he yt takes his benefice with symonye /
he must resign and make restitucion of all the profyt yt he has take there of /
and for the profyt yt might have be taken thereof for his time. For it is a
general rule in the law that who so occupies any thing wiyoute^ rightful
title / he is bounde^ to restitucion of all the harms and of al profyt yt came
thereof / or mit have come thereof for ye time / saving hi^ expensis yt he spent
i^ profyt and salvation of yt thing And both clerk and lewyd man yt does
symonye / he is acursed in ye deed. And if it may be preuyd / ye lewd man
shulbe accursed openly i^ holy church. Prima q^. i. reperiu^tur.


Dives. If the officer of the busshop axe of custom any yiftes i^ making of
ordres / in sacrynge of busshopes / in blessing of abbottes / if they yt
should be ordryd or blissed or sacryd / give them such yiftes. for custom
that they allege / is it symonye.


Pauper. If he give it principaly for such custom and for their axing it is
symony But if he give it freely / not for there axing ne for custom ne by
covenant / it is no symonye But most siker it is that he give none thanne ne
for thanne / for it is like symony. And seint Poul bids yt me^ should
absteyne the^ from every wicked liknesse Also they that give or take any thing
by wey of custom or of covenant for blessyng of weddynges for sepultures / for
diriges / for cream or oil / or for any sacrament in which is youen grace
he doithe symony. If any curate or perisshe priest for yiftes / for prayer. for
love / for friendship / hide a open syn of his parisshyn obstinate in syn or
recounseile him that wole not amend him / or for hate and enemy / te wole not
recounseyl him that wole amend him / or for hate or love or yift or prayer
puts any man or woman / from the sacraments of holy church / he does
symony. If a priest be bounden of office to say a mess / or dirige. and such
other prayers and he axe money therefore / he does symonye. But if he be not
bound thereto of office / and he has not his nedeful living he may take money
for his travail and let his travail to hyre by days and years as annuelers
done / as says Reymunde. Et extra ne p^lati. vices suas and co vltimo. But if
he have sufficient living and he be not bound to say that mess or dirige /
thanne he shall say it freely. or else not say it For else it seems that he
does it principally. for couetise. If a pressed have said a mass if he say a
another mass. that day for money or for to have thank of the world / he does
symone. De con. di. i. sufficit.


The xix. chapter
Dives. If religiouse or seculer clerks in auauncement of their kynnesmen make
covenant to giddre and say / Assent thou to auaunsynge of my neuewe and I shall
asse^t the aua^syng of thy neuewe Or else one says that aslonge as I live
shall there no grace of any auau^seme^t. pass while I may let it / but I have
this grace for him yat I p^y for. do these any symonye.


Pauper It is symonye. For the law says. Absit omi^s peracto^ cesset omi^s
conuentio.i. q^. ii. qm^ pio. In spirituel things every covenant should be
away / every conuencion cease. If the curate wole not burye the deed body / ne
suffce it to be buried / but i^ covenant that he shall have his bed or his
best clothe / or su^me other thing he does symone. all though it be custom to
pay. yt he axith. And therefore he should freely bury the deed and bless the^
that been nedy / and so absteyne him fro every spice of symonye. and afteward
compelle them to pay and keep good customs / if that they might well do it for
pouert. Extra e. ad apostolicam If a priest wole not baptize but he have money
therefore he does symonie. And rather the lewyd man or woman should baptize the
child / thanne give money therefore And if he were of age yt should be baptized.
and there were no man ne woman butt the preeste. though he were in peril of
death he should rather die without baptyme of water / thanne he should be
baptized by symonie. For in that case the baptym of the holy ghost suffiseth to
him Every man and woman may baptize for need. If any patron give a benefice in
covenant that he that resceyueyth it shall help him te^porally and his also /
it is symonye Extra e. nemo. And if he give it to su^me of his kynne so to
magnifye him self / and to be the more mighty worldly by aua^syng of his
kynrede / it is symone And if a patron selle a patronage by the self / or
selle the manner yt is annexed thereto / the more dear for the patronage / he
does symonye As says Petrus tarentinus super quartum sent. distinct xxv. And
therefore he says that choppyng of churches withoute^ auctorite of the bishop
/ is symony. And he says there also that right of patronage may natt be sold.
but it passith forth with biynge of the land that it longith to. If prechours
or pardonystris or other folk that goo for alms. pray the parisshe priest
or the curate to procure them su^me good in their parisshe in covenant yt the
priest or the curat shall have a certain part thereof / it is symony as anentis
the priest / for both do sysymony / and also they do sacrilege and theft / in
that yt they defraude men of their good / and put it not in the alms that
they give it to and both the priest and the pardonistre be bound to
restitucion.


The xx. chapter.
IF a man or woman / give money to be resceiued i^to house of religion / and so
in religion in covenant yt he or she shall give a certain money to ye house it
is symonie though it be comen custom so to give Nathelesse if he be resceyued
freely as the law wole / he does no symonie. Extra e. sicut pro certo et c. in

and ouircharged with ye person so cladde / they may afterward pray the fre^des
of that person / of su^me alms in releuynge of the house and of that charge.
If a man or a woman give money to prestes rich or pore / for trental / for
a^nuel / for yerday / or for to say mess of the holy ghost or other masses or
to give money to clerks / for saying of psalters or of diriges. or to pore men
in couenaunte of certain prayers / with intencion so to bye their prayers he
does symonye. scdm^ glosam Willi^ / et vt habetur in su^. con. li.i. ti. i. q^
xlii. And yet as he says there / it is lefulle to take and to give money and
other temporel things / for such spirituel thing / and for p^yer by wey of
devotion and of fre yift / so to excite devotion and love of persons the more
to pray for them. And in this manner men may give to colleges certain money to
keep their yereday / not by wey of covenant of biyng / and of selling / but
so to stir them freely to grant them their axing by wey of more charity and
more beuocion. For such spirituel thing may not be sold And therefore men
should give their good freely to men of holy church by weye of amesse / and
they should take it freely by wey of alms And the yeuer with his yifte of
charity may axe certain prayers. of them that he yeueth to / and if they
grauntyd him they ben bounden to keep their grant Therefore says seint Austyne
that the apostelys took freely their living of them that they preached freely to.
And as great sin it is the pressed to sell his prayer / as the prechour to selle
his prechynge. Criste badde i^ the gospel that me^ should make them friends of
the richesses of this world yat they might resceyue them into endless
tabernacles that is to say yat they might so pray for hem yt they might be
resceyued into bliss And thus must all men of holy church. take their
living if they wol be clean out of symony. For they may not sell there office
that they do in holy church / ne their prayer / but by fre yiftes take their
sufficient lyuelode Extra ne p^lati. vices suas. co qm^ enormis.

Dives Con^tra. It is ordained by constitucion synodalle what money a parissh
priest and what an annueler should take


Pauper. That is natt for his office but it is done to let the false couetise.
of men of holy church / to put in certain hou much is sufficient: to their
living that they should no more axe. ne men no more give them. But if it be
not sufficient / they may take more by leave of their prelates And that taxinge
is natt ordeigned by the yeuer of the money / but by the prelates of holy
church both anentis symonye and against false conetyce of their clerks.


The xxi. chapter
Dives. It seems by thy words / that they ye sing the golden trentalle. go
fulnigh symonye For they make wounderful couenaunte. of their syngyng.


Pauper Leave friend thou shall understand that covenant making makes often
symonye that should else make no symonye / As if the yeuer axe what it is
worth to sing many messys and the priest answers twenty shillynges. or ten
shillynges / or a noble. Or if the yeuer seye. sir what wylt thou take to sing
it. and the priest answer and sey no less than twenty shillynges. or ten
shyllynges. and thus bargeyne and broke. about the singing of the mess. that
may not be fold ne boughte / as men do in biynge and selling / of an horse /
thanne they fall both in cursed symony. Also if the yeuer say to the priest
in his bargaynynge / that he shall sing for certain souls and for no moo and
he bihotith him so / thanne ben they both accursed for that foul symonye And
also for it is against charity / for the preeste is bounden to sing for all
christian And for the mo he prays in special by weye of charity / the more he
plesith god. and the more ben tho souls helped / for which he takith his
sellarie. And in that he byndeth him to say speci / all messes in certain
time / He must in cas leave the mess of the day that he is bounden to. if he
be a curate and so does symonye. as says Raymounde / and other clerks. Also
he does in that against the ordenau^ce of holy church. Extra libro tercio de
celebratione missarum. c. secu^do where it is boden that there should noman leave
mass of the day for other specialle messes / As of the Trinity / our lady.
or other not for it is evil to here or to say such specialle messes. but for
it is evil to leave messes of the day for such special messes. as says the
gloss. Neuirthelesse if a man wole here such special messes in reverence of
the Trinite or of our lady / it is well done / so that he leave not mess of the
day for such messes.


Dives. Thanne me thynkethe that curates. that been bounden to say mess of the
day / to the parissh / or i^ cas mess of Requiem / may not well sing such
golden trentalles.


Pauper. That is sothe / ne no priest that has sufficient living by other
salarie. And therefore it is forbode^ the synodales of england / yt any person
or wyker should make covenant with his parisshe priest / that he should besides
his salarie. take annuel or trentalle or any such other / that they clepe
vantages. Inhibemus districtius. But they shall give to their parisshe priest
sufficient salarie. Whereby they may live withoute^ such false couetise. And in
the constitucion of Lambeth the secounde chapter / it is bode^ that no priest
shall bind him to such special messes / by the which they might be lettyd.
that they might natt serve the church / of laufulle service. of the day / as
they be bound.


Dives. Sithen than it is so that mess of the day is as good as such special
messes / and that it is as good or better to here and to say mess of the day
as such special messes / me thinks that by such manner si^gynge of golden
trentales / souls been much disceyued.


Pauper. That is sothe For tho thritty messes that they axe / as they say must
be in doing al a year nerehande / there they might have thritty messes as
helply / to the soul out of pain / withyn thritty days. For in such
syngyng is done much symony. much ypocrisie and much folly. For su^me
prestes faitoures tell the people that but the messes be said in three days
principally of tho feestes / that is to say in the festis and in two days
next following / else the souls be not helped by tho messes And so if the
priest fell seek tho three days so that he might not sing / although he had
sung all the other messes / that trental might not be done that year by their
oppinion. And so in cas he should happen to be in syngyng of one trental x.
year / or twenty year / there as he might every year sing his annuel. Also if
our ladies day in lent fall on good friday he may not thanne sing tho iii.
messes. Also su^me prestys bihighte to fast bread. and water / and to were the
here every day when they shall sing. any of tho masses for tho souls And so
them must fast bread and water / and were the heir on Cristmasse day Ester day
/ and nigh all the high ^^estis of the year /

Also they say that they must have a specialle Orison / that is not of the
missalle / ne approved of holy church / butt often repreuyd. or else as they
say the mes / ses ben litel or naught to profyt of the souls. And thus by
faitrie and ypocrisie many fool prestys bihight more and bind them to more
for x. shillinges. thanne a good priest would do. for x. mark.


Dives. And they say that Saint Gregorye. ordained that manner of singyng to
have his modre out of purgatory. And therefore they clepe it. saint Gregory's
trental


Pauper. They lie on saint Grigory For his modre was a full holy woman as we
find in his life. And we find not that seint gregory did any preeste sing in
that manner. for any soul But we find libro iiii. dialogorum That when seint
gregory knew by reuelacion yt one of his monks was in hard peyn of
purgatory for he had been a proprietarie unto the time of his diynge / seint
Gregory badde one of his monks which he leet a good man sing for him thritty
messes day by day And in the thritty day the deed monk. apperyd to the same
monk and thankyd him / for unto this tym said he I have be in hard peyn but
now I am deliueryd. And saint Gregory tellith alsoo libro quarto dialogorum.
that a soul apperyd to a priest and p^yed him that he would have mind of him
in his mess And he song for him seuene days by and by. and so the soul was
delivered For better it is to deliver a soul out of pain within vii. days.
or xxx. thanne so to let him langore in pain al ye year when he might be
helped within thritty days And so would every man. and woman that is in bodily
disease and in prison. And he were no good friend that let his friend live in
prison al a year / when he might have him out within vii. days or within
xxx. days.


The xxii. chapter.
Dives. And so it may be yt the feend fond up the golden trental so to langore
souls in their pain / there they should the sooner be delivered.


Pauper Therefore seint Gregory.iiio. et quarto dialogorum. shewith by many an
example that it is best to sing for the souls day by day if the preeste be
well disposed to sing so. And he shewith there yt lettyng of any day singing.
is great disese to the souls / for they desire full much to be deliueryd. out
of their pain But the people by faitre of covetous clerks is so blent. that
they have leuyr. to give xx. shelinges to langore the souls in pain al a year
/ tha^ to give xx. shillinges or x. to have them out within a monethe. or much
less tym But leave friend better it were to give xx shilli^ges to help them in
haaste with the worship of god and of holy church. than for to give xx
shillinges late to help them and that with offense of god. and p^iudice of
holy church And better it is to have four score messes / sunge to gidre day by
day for twenty shillinges tha^ne to have thritty messes song in the long year
for xx shillinges For why ye may for twenty shillinges do singe a quarter of an
annuel and do the souls have part not only of thritty messes / but of asmany
messes as be pens i^ xx shili^gis For though ye give a thousand pound for a
mess. the priest may not appropre that mess to any soul / butt only pray
for him after yt he is bounden / and he must put his prayer in the will of god
/ and in his plesaunce / for in cas the soul yt he prays fore is dampened And
parauenture a pore man. that no priest thinks on in special / yat died in
more charity than he that the priest prays fore in special. shall rather be
helped by the mess of the priest thanne he for whom he prays in special.
More ouir leave friend understood that prayer is a great gracious yift of god.
For as say the clerks holy prayer is a stiyng up of man's heart and womannes
to god. Oration est ascensus mentis i^ deum. And that may no man have withouten
special yift of god For Criste says in the gospel / yt there cu^meth no man to
him / but ye fader of heuene draw him by inward gostely mocion that is
inward devotion / And withouten this inward devotion p^yer of mouth is right
noghtworth And therefore it is good sumtyme to give alms to a good preeste
which has need of alms to meue him to pray for you yat ye may have the
grace of god and sweetness in him by the prayer of the p^ste and your alms.
Natheles ye shall not give him alms to co^streyne him to certain prayer.
after your devise so to let him of his deuoco^n. Ne ye shall not give him
alms with inte^cion to let him to pray for whom that he wole after that his
devotion is and after ye god yeueth hi^ grace. For always the pressed must be more
fre to pray tha^ne ye may be to give. ne ye may not with your yift co^streyne
him ne let him to pray for whom that he wole pray. For all though the priest
be artyde by the law of his taking there may though no law art him of his
prayer but that he shall always be fre to pray for whom that he wole / and as
his devotion is for all christian / and for the conversion of al hethen folk. And
therefore leave friend ye shall give freely to the priest what you lyketh so to
excite his devotion to pray for you and the more to have you in love and mind
in his prayers / not to lose his charity to pray for other. For the mo that he
prays fore by wey of charity the more profit it is to you and to your
friends souls. that he syngith fore.


The xxiii. chapter.
Dives. thy speech semethe to me full reasonable But I pray the if religiouse /
or seculer clerks selle any ground of scu^arie in church or churchyerde to
buriynge of deed bodies / is it symonye


Pauper. Neither the office of buriyng ne the ground of sanctuary may be
sold to buriyng without symony Tercia q^. ii. etc. postqm^ / et in su^ma
co^f. li. i. ti. xvi. q^. prima. Much more thanne it is symonie to sell the
ground of sanctuary in church or in church yerde to chapmen to set on their
bothes and their stalles for to make gods house an house of merchandise / and
a den of theuys against the lore of crist.

And if the colleges or curates. selle the rynginge of their belles at
buriynges or at diriges / so yt they wole not suffer their belles. be ronge
but they have a certain money therefore / it is symonye / and to selle the
office of ryngynge is symony. Nathelesse the ryngers may take for their
travail And he that has thoffice of ryngyng freely yeuen to him may let that
office to hire withouten symony In su^ma. conf. li.io tio.i.


Dives. It semyth by thy speech that clerks charged su^tyme much the vice of
symony


Pauper It must be chargyde. for it is a sin yt god punyssheth full hard For
as Ierom Austyn and Gregory say / symone of the priests of the old law was
one of the pri^cipal causes. Why god distroyed the cite and the temple of
jerusalem / and the kingdom of jews


Dives Is it symone if colleges of religious or of seculers abbot or priour
selle out of their house lyuerunse


Pauper. Many clerks sey that it is no symony / but it is a full vnsiker
marchaundise And I dare say that it it sacrilege and theft full nighe symonye.
For why the gods of holy church so well endowed ben youen to help of the
pore and to keep hospitalite not to selle them again to rich me^ to mayntene
them i^ unlust and in bodily ease But that the clerks that serve the church
shall live thereby / and to spend the remenant in hospitalite / and in alms
to the pore people. And so the gods of that collegges been not here but as
dispensoures. For they been the poor me^nys to whom and for whom tho were
yeuen And by such lyueru^ses / the colleges be brought to poverty / and the
pore and the seek that should be helped thereby / been fraudyd / and robbyd of
their right And persons been made rich / and the comynutee. ouir pore and
charity is exiled out of the congregation For when the money is paid the
religious that sold the lyuersu^nes desire the death of the bier And como^ly.
such lyuersu^nes ben sold in hope that the byer shall sone dye / or in hope yt
in his ending he shall give to them al his good or much thereof passing his
covenant And so sellyng of such lyuersu^nes is far from charity. and deep
groundid in false couetise and it is yift and sacrilege in that yt they so
minystre the gods of the pore folk and selle them aweye / by which gods the
pore folk should be helped / and so both the byer. and the seller do sacrilege.
For these skylles and many moo sellyng and biyng of such lyuersu^nes ben
utterly forboden. by the laws of holy church. in co^stitutionibus octo bon^.
co. volentes.


The xxiii. chapter.
Dives. Is usury and gonel. any spice of theft


Pauper. In cas it is full great theft.


Dives. What is propirly vsurye.


Pauper. Usure is a wynnyng axed by covenant of lenyng. and for lenyng / as
says Raymunde lio / iii.^. ti. And it is done most commonly in things of
nombree. of weight and of mesure / as in money yt is told / or metal or other
thing that is weyed / or in corn oil wine / yt is mesured.


Dives How many spices been they of usury.


Pauper Raymounde says that there ben ii. spices of usure / one is spu^el and
rightful of which Crist spekith in the gospel Luce xix. Quare non dedisti
pecunia^ mea^ ad mensam. etc. Why yaue thou natt my money to the board / yt is
to say my grace and my yiftes to profyt of other men by open co^municacion. And
so spirituel usure is clepyd multiplicacion of the yiftes of god / and of the
graces that god has youe^ to man or woman not to hyde the^ but to comyne them
forth to profytt of other And so with the grace and the yift that god has
youen to man for a litel travail. to win an hundryd fold mede in heuene.
Another usury is bodily usure and vnrightful. that cu^meth of false couetise
by covenant of lenynge. For if wynnyng come freely to the lener for his lenynge
withouten covenant / so that his intencion were not corrupt in his lenynge /
but yt he lent principaly for charity / and not principaly for worldly wynnyng
/ it is none usure al though he hope to have and so have aua^tage by his lenyng
But if he le^t pri^cipaly in hope of worldly wi^nyng whether he lent it with
covenant or without covenant of winning for his false covetous intencion he
does usure / and is an usurer Therefore Crist saiy in the gospel. Date mutuu^
nihil inde sperantes. Luce vi. give ye your lone hopyng no wynnyng thereof /
that is to say / as says the gloss Do ye it pri^cipaly for god. and not for
man / but hope ye pri^cipaly to have your mede of god yt biddith you lene And
thanne whether the borower pay or not pay god shall yield you your mede.


Dives. May the lener axe no thing of the borower for his lenynge.


Pauper. No money ne thing that may be measured by money / neither mete ne
drink. ne cloth / ne yift of hand of tu^ge ne of service. But other thing yt
may not be mesured by money. he may axe / as love and charity. good will and
good frenshippe for his lenyng


Dives. Why is usury holden so great asynne.


Pauper. For the usurer sellith to gidre the thing that he lenyth and the use
of the thing And therefore usure cu^myth of the selling of the use. The usurer
sellith the thing that he lenyth in that yat he takithe more ouir for the use.
of the thing. Wherefore thou shall understand that many things there be that
may not be used withouten waste and distructio^. of the thing / as mete and
drink and such other / and in such the use may not be departed from ye thing.
But needs he that grauntith the thing / grauntith the use of the thing / and
they may natt be sold a sundre. And in such things / if the seller take for
the use he sellith that thing twyes. and sellith thing that naught is. For
the use of that thing is fulle waste thereof. and for such selling of the use
it is clepyd usury. For the usurer sellith the thing in it self and the use
ouir. Su^me things there be i^ which the use is not full distruccion of the
thing / as use of an house is the duelling or occupacion thereof / and i^ such
the lordship of the thing may be grau^tid withoute^ the use and the use
withoute^ the lordship. And so a man may take his house yt he letith to hire
aye^ to hi^ and ouir take for the use of the house But as the philosop^. says
vo iii. politicorum. the use of money is chau^ging of one for a another to help
and ese of the comynute which chaungyng is destruction of the money and
wasting in manner. In that he that chaungithe it. for other thing so spent it
away. And therefore it is unlawful. for to take any thing for the use yt out to
be comen to al / as it is ordained to help and ease of al And therefore it
suffiseth yt the lener take again the euyne value / and if he take more ouir for
the use he doy usure / and he is bound to restitucion


Dives Contra. God yaf leave to the jews to take usure of other nations.


Pauper. That was to fle the more evil / for else they would have taken usury
of their brethern for couetise / and ye god forbade them and grauntyd to them
to take usure of other nations about them and among them both to spare their
own nation and also to get so again in pertie yt longid to them by the grant
of god For all ye lord theraboute enhabite with the hithen people longyd to the
jews by the grant of god / and wrongfully the hethen people withelde much
land fro them.

IF a man let his horse / his ox or cow to hire / in covenant that if the

own good. that eles should perisshe / or principaly for help of his neighbor
he does none usury By gods law al usury is dampened. By emperoures law
and by by man's law sumtyme it is suffryd natt for yat it is good ne leful
but for to fle the more evil. for often men should perissh. but they might
borowe upon usury For else the covetous rich men. Wole not lene to the
nedeful / and so the law of man rightfully suffrith it for a good end But the
couetouse man does it unrightfully and for a wicked end And therefore holy
church dampneth them that lene upon usury but not in them that borowe for need
/ or for a good ca^e upon usury whe^ne he may natt else borowe But if they
borowe for a wicked cause / as for pley at the dyce / or to spend it in
glotony lechery or pride / or in other wicked use / they sin grievously And
though it be leful to borowe for a good end upon usury / yet it is not leful
to lene upon usury / ne to counseyl any to borowe upon usury. As it is
lefulle to a christian man to take an hethen man yt swerith by his fale god And
yet it is not leful to the christian man for to axe of him that oath / ne to
stir him thereto. For why oath and swerynge is a divine. Worship that longith
only to verrey god Also notaries yt make instruments upon couenau^tes of
usury ben forsworn. For when they be made notaries. they make an oath that
they shall neuir make instruments upon covenant of usury And so if they make
any such instrument. they been forsworn / and they may neuir after bear
witness in any cause ne make instrument in any cause For they ben made thereby
of wicked name. and unable to every office worshipfulle / in the law and to
every dignite And if any p^late under wrytt to such covenant or set his
seal thereto. Wyttyngly / is giltye of vsurye. though he have no wi^nyng
thereby. Hec in su^ma conf.

Dives. What pain is ordained in the law for usurers


Pauper. All usurers by the law ben bounden to restitucion And if they been
open usurers / they ben accursed by the law in three things For they should not
be houseled. ne holy church shall not take there offryng ne resceyue them to
criste^ buriyng but they amend the^ before their death. And what priest else
takes her offcyng and burieth them / he shall make restitucion of yt he
takithe to the busshop in help of the pore folk And he is worthy to be
suspendid of his office and of his mess Extra e. ti. quia in omnibus. If the
usurer may not make restitucion / he must axe foryeuenesse of hem that he is
dettour to if he wole be saved And not only ye usurer / but also his heir is
bounden to restitucion / and he may be compelled by the law to restitucion.
Extra e. ti. tu nos And if other men be bounden to him for usury he may no
restitucion axe til he have made restitucion to other that he is bound to for
usury Extra e. ti. quia frusta.


Dives. Whereby should men know an open usurer


Pauper If he keep open stacion or open shop to lene or to change for
usury. Or if he knowledge it before a judge in dome / or be co^uicte by witness
/ or if he bear the name of an usurer with dedys openly don according to that
name.

If a clerk be an usurer / or an heir to an usurer but he wole make
restitucion he shall be suspendyd And but he wole amend hi^ he shall be deposed.
And if he be so i^corrigible that his busshop may not amend / him he shall be
chastised by seculer ho^de. Extra libro secundo titulo de iudiciis. capitulo
cu^ non ab homine. The clerk shall make restitucion of his own good if he have
whereof and not of gods of holy church but if he have ought spent of such
usury to profyt of holy church If a prelate resceyue offrynge of the usurer
su^me clerks say that he shall take it again to the usurer in repreef of his
sin. Su^me say that he shall take it to the busshop which shall take it again
to the usurer. And if that usurer. may not be founden the busshop shall give
it to the pore folk. If the borower swer^ that he shall pay the usurer and not
axe it again. he must pay it to save his oath. and he shall not axe it again.

But he may make denunciacion to prelates of holy church. of that usury. yat
the usurer may be compellyd by laws of holy church to amend him / and so
to make restitucion And if he swear that he shall neuir bewrey him to holy
church. of that vsurye / he is not bounden to that oath. For it is against the
salvation of his euyne christian. and against the precepte of god.

If the usurer bye an horse or land withouten money of his usurer / and give
it to a another / he that resceyueth that yifte is bounden to make restitucion.
if he wist that it was so bought and youen. Extra. e. cum tu. Servants and
laborers / that serve usurers in honest things. may lefully take their hire

withouten biddyng of his master / though he borowe it for the nedys of his
master / or any man borowe money upon usury for the nedis of a another
withouten his bidding. he that so boroweth. is bounden to restitucion / if the
usurer would lene withoute^ usure freely. He ye cou^selith hi^ not to lene but
upon usure is bound to restitucion / for he lettith the proufytte of his
nighboure. If a Jew lene to a christian man upon usury / he synneth And he may
be compelled by prelates and by lords to make restitucion. Extra e. post

No lord / no college / no man should suffer usurers duelle i^ their

they know of their vsurye. they should put them out / and neuir resceyue
such usurers more after. And if busshoppe / or archebusshop do the contrary
they been suspendyde. And they that been of less degree. been accursed if they
do the contrary / and colleges and comyntes fall into interdit And if they
stand stylle in their malice / one month all their lands ben interdited And
lewd people that suffer such usurers to duelle in their lordship. or in their
houses. should be compellyd by censure. of holy church to putt them out scdm^

thanne it is worth in covenant to have it aye^ what time that he wole pay the
price that it is worth / it is usury For the byer gettith again all that he
paid and asmoche thereto As if a man selle a thing for ten shelinges that is
well worth xx. shelynges / he shall have it again. for so the byer wynneth by
usure ten shelinges ouir that he paid first.


The xxviii chapter
But such slightes and many other that been not written here / the false
usurers cursed of god begyle and rob the pore people against the precept of
god there he says thus. If thou lene. to my pore people / thou shall not
therefore mysbede him ne trauayl him the more therefore / ne ouirp^sse him with
usury. Exodi xxii. If thy brother says he be nedye. pore or feeble. take none
usure of him / take no more. thanne thou yaue Dread thy god that thy pore
brother may live with the / Thou shall not lene thy money to usury / ne axe of
him ouir habundau^ce. Take no more than thou lentyst Shus says god Leuitici
xxv. Non fenerabis fatri tuo etc. Thou shall lene to thy brother by usury
neither money ne corn ne any other thing But lene it to him withouten usury.
that thy lord god may bless the in every werk that thou have don Deutro.
xxiii For who so leneth to his even christian withoute^ usury he shall speed
the better. And they that lene with usure. shall speed the worse. And in what
land usury is used openly that land shall mysfare Therefore david says / that
wickedness has besegyd that cite and ye comynte by day and by night above the
walls and travail and unright and much wrong is in ye cite. and gyle. and
usure fails not from the stretis of ye cite. Die ac nocte circumdabit ea^
super muros eius i^iquitas. etc. For such usury and gyle and false oaths in
biyng and selling / the prophet zachary says yt he saw a book fleyng in the
air yt was xx cubits long and x. in bread. And he axed the aungel of god
what it might be / and the aungel said to him it is the curse of god yt gothe
to the houses of theuys / and to men nys houses that forsuere them. by the
name of god. zachary v^. And therefore solomon says that who so gadreth
tresoures with a liyng tunge / he is vein and evil herted / and he shall
stumble. to the snares of death. Raueyners and robbries of wicked men shall draw
them down to hell. for they would do no rightful dome Prouer. xxi. To such
god yeueth his curse. Woo he says be to you that join house to house. and
couple field to field / and say of right that is wrong / and of wrong yt is
right / and put light into derknesse / and derknesse i^to light / bitter into
sweet / and sweet into bittre. ysa v.c. For these false men of law and sligh
couetouse folk be a mannys cause euir so good but they have money to stand
with him they shall say that is a wicked cause. And be it euir so clear in
right / they shall seye. it is full derke / they can se none help therein And be
it neuir so derke yt noma^ can se right therein / for money they shall say that
it is clear enough And be it euir so siker. or esy to pursue and sweet i^ ye
silf they shall say it is a bitter cause and unsavory to dele with / but they have
money / and be it euir so perilous and bitter for money they shall say yt it is
siker enough. He that robs his even christian of any good he does against three
laws. First against the law of kind yt says thus That thou hatist to be
don to the. do thou it not to a noiher. Also he does against law written. No^
furtu^ facies ^ yt biddith Thou shall do no theft Also he does against the law
of grace For charity yt is principal heest of the law of grace bids yt men
should give to other of their good and not take from them wrongfully. We find
in holy wrytt Iosue vi. et vii. cap^. yt for achor stal gold silver and cloth
against the beast of god. he and his wife / his children / and al his bestes were
stooned to the death first / and afterward burnt. With all the other god that he
had and xxxvi men slain with enemies for the theft of Achor / that so stalle
against gods biheeste. And god said that til when his yefte was punysshed /
the people should neuir have speed in batail ne in otyer journey.

Dives. It is thanne little wou^dre that our folk speed evil these days i^
wer^^ upon their enemies. for they go more to rob and to pile thanne to fight
for any right


Pauper For that sin and many other / they speed full evil / For they be so
blent with sin that the light of grace by which they should be wissed in there
dedys is hid a wey fro them. and so they wandre forth among there enemies. as
blind bestes. and for they seen no myscheif til they fall therein / For as the
wise man seithe / Obcecauit cos malicia eorum. sap^. iio There malice has made
them blind Tells a great clerk. Solmus de mirabilibus mu^di that in the
land of serdynye is a well of ye which well if a true man drink. his sight
shall amend / But if a thief drink thereof. though his sight be before ever so
clear. he shall wey blind / By this well I understand plenty of worldly
goodis and of richesses that god sends among ma^kinde which / goodys and
richessis comen of the earth / and newen year by year / as water in the well.
and all true folk that drynken of this well / that is to seye that comen
trewly to there good and richessis of this world and spenden them well to the
worship of god. and profit of there even christian: they have more light of grace
to se what is to do / and what may please god / And they that falsely come to
gods of this world by yift. by gyle. and usure and by falls oaths they wexen
blind. for they leese the light of grace and be blent with there malice / Therefore
seint Ambrose super lucam seyth. that in the richessis is no blame. but the
blame and the defaute is in them yt can not well use there richessis / And as
richessis says he is letti^g of virtue to shrewis. so it is help of virtue to
good folk that can and been in will to use well her richesshis /


Dives. I dread me that nigh all our nation has so drunken of this well of
sardynye. that they been gostly blind For if I take heed what theft of symonye
regneth in the clergy. What theft of usure regneth principaly among
merchants and rich folk / what theft of raueyne and extorsion regnethe
among the lords. and grate men. What mycherie and robbere among the pore
commons that be alwey inclined to sle and to rob. me thynkethe that much of
our nation is gyltie in theft and ouerdon much blent with falls couetise /


Pauper. Therefore god seyth thus / Aminimo vsque ad maximum omnes sequu^tur
auaricia^ / A propha^ vsque ad sacerdotem cu^cti faciunt me^dacium. et ideo
corruent. Fro ye leest to the most al they folowen avarice and false couetise
From the prophet to the priest al they make lesynges and do gile and
falsehede. And therefore they shall fall. And I shall give their wymen to
strangers and their lo^des and their feeldes. to other heirs Iere. viii. And
by the prophet ysaie god under namyth the governors of the people both in
temperaltie and in spirituality. and says thus. Principes tui infideles socii
furum etc. Thy princes been false. and felowys of thieves. All they louen
yiftis and follow meedys and yeldynge again / For they demed not after the
right. but after that me^ might pay. ysa. io. Si videbas furem currebas cum eo
et cu^ adulteris porcionem et cetera. If thou seye a thief thou ran with him to
help him. as false iuges i^ temporalte don these days / And with lechouris
and auoutreris. thou puttedist thy part as iugis in spiritualte don these dayea.


Here ends the seventh precepte or commandment. And begins the eight
precept or commandment.
Dives. It is fulle much to dread that gile. and falshede shall undo this land
as thou say but god of his mercy / he do bote I thank the with all mine heart
/ for thou haste well enfourmyd me in kepinge of the seventh commandment. Now
I pray the for charity that thou wylt enfourme me in the eight commandment.


Pauper. The eight commandment is this. Non loqueris contra proximu^ tuu^
falsu^ testimonium. That is to say. Thou shall speak no false witness against
thy neighbor. In words as says seint Austyne. and saint Thomas de veritate
theology libro quinto. God forbedeth all manner lesyngea and hydyng of treuthe
when it should be said. For as the law says. Qui tacet consentire videtur.
He that is still and wole not say the treuthe when he should say it semyth / yt
he consentith to falsenesse And so by his stylnesse he witnessith with
falsenesse against treuth / and against his neighbor and synneth dedly with his
tung for that he wole not use it to witness the truth when he should And
therefore says seint austyne. that both he yt hides the treuthe and he that
lies against the treuth been guilty against this precepte.

For why he that is stylle wole not porfyt to his eue^ christian / and he that
lies desires to harm his even christian. In Epistola ad casulanum. For man and
woman in bounden by this precepte natt to harm his neighbor with his tunge
And therefore John Crisostome says that not only he is a traytoure to the
treuthe / that lies against the treuthe / But also he that says not freely the
treuth. yt he owith to say / or not freely defendith the truth which he owes
to mayntene and defend And so although that by stylnesse enforce them not to
know the treuthe. that they know and wole natt be a know in due time / they
be liars and false witnesses Nathe less leave friend ye shall understood that
there is three manner of stylnes One is anentis god. a another anentis our even
christian The iii. anentis our self. The first is wicked when we cease from
due prisyng of god / and thanki^g for his benefices. The secounde is wicked
when we cese from due manner of techynge and vndernymyng of our even christian.
The third is wicked in two manners / First if a man or woman for dread or shame
/ or for pride will not seye thing that he should sey to pleyne him of his
mischief and to seek help of soul by shrift or good counseile. or of body by
other help and by good counseile but gnawynge and fretyng him silfe inward and
will not pleyne him outward to them that would conforte him and speaks so much
inward without confort till he falls in wane hope. and shendeth himsilfe by
anger / and inward sorrow / Therefore says saint Gregory lio.viii. moraliu^
That much folk when they have wrong sufferen much the more disese inward /
for they will not speak it outward / For why says he If they said peasebly
there disese outward with there tunge sorrow and desease should pass out of there
heart. and out of there conscience. Si illatas inquit molestias lingua
tranquille diceret: a consciencia dolor emaneret Sumtyme men be stille in
desceit of other. that they may the more bodily accuse other.


The secunde chapter
Dives. Hou many manner been there of lesynges.


Pauper.. Seint austen lio de me^daco^ puts vii man^ of lesi^ges which ben
co^prehendyd in three. Quia omne mendaciu^ vele^ perniciosu^. vel officiosu^.
vel iocosum For every lesynge or it is such yt it does harm. and than it is
cleped in latyne perniciosu^. that is to sey wicked in englisshe / Or it is
such that it does good and none harm. and that is cleped i^ latin o^ficiosu^
that is profitable in englissh. Or it is such that it does neither good ne
harm. and that is cleped in latyne. Iocosu^ that is bourdeful i^ englyssh: as
when men make lesynges only to make folk merry / The first manner that is
cleped perniciosu^ and wicked is alwey dedly sin / But the two other manner of
lesynges been venial sin to the common people / But to men of holy church and
to religeouse and to all that should be folk of perfection. they ben dedly
sin if they been done by auysement / or by custom as says seint Austyn. The
first manner of lesinges is done in v. manners. First if any man sey preche or
teache any thing against the feith of holy church. The ii. is. when the lesyng
harmethe su^me and profits to none / as lesynges of bacbiting and falls
witness of syn yt common law punyssheth The thridde is yt so profitith to one
yt it harmeth to a another / as false witness in cause of dett or of heritage
or of such other. The iiii. is when the lesynge is maade withoute^ profit /
and withouten cause. save only for likyng to lie and to disceyue / and for
custom of lesinges. The fifth is when the lesynge is made only for to plese as
flateringe All these manner of lesynges ben forboden by this co^maundment to
all manner folk. as dedly sin The lesynge of flatering may be done in three
manner / or prisynge a man in thing. that he has more than he is worthy to be
prised / or prisyng him i^ thing that he has not / or prisi^g him and
flateryng him i^ his syn. and shrewydnesse and in his folly And this manner of
flatering if it be done wyttyngly / it is dedely sin The secou^de manner of
lesyng that is clepyd Officiosu^ and proufitable / it is done in iii. manners.
First for salvation. of catel that should else be lost wyckedly by thieves if
they wiste where it were Also for salvation of man or of woman innocent. that
is sought of his enemies. Also to save man or woman fro sin As if a syngle
woman say that she is a wife / so to keep her clean from them that would
defoule her. Such manner of lesynges ye avail and profytt and also lesynges
bourdful been venial sins to the common people. but to men of perfection /
they ben dedly sin / namely lesynges bourdful when they been in use
custumable. For it fallith not to men of holy church. and of religion to be
iapers ne liars. But it fallith to them principally to fle ydel words For
Criste says in the gospel / that me^ shall give answer at the dome for every
ydel word that they say. But such lesynges bourdful in men of perfeccion
turn lightly to lesynges pernicious and wicked. For they do harm to them
that here them / in that yt they. be ascla^dryd of their vanyte and of their
lesynges For them thinks and sothe it is / that men of holy church and of
perfection should not be iapers ne disours ne liers ne vein but sad in chere
in word and deed Therefore the master of sentences. li.iii. distinct xxxviii.
says openly that such manner lesynges. been venial sins to them that be of
imperfect state / and dedly sins to them yt be of perfect stat And seint
Austyn libro contra mendaciu^ says ye treuth should not be corrupt for any
temperal profyt. And no man ne woman shall be led to enlesse health with help of
lesynges / for every lesyng and falshede. is against crist. that is souereyne
treuthe And seint Gregory libro xviii. moraliu^. says thus. Os quod mentitur
occidit ai^am. The mouth that lies sleeth the soul And the prophet says
Lord thou shall lose al yt speak lesi^ges And therefore says he me^ of
perfeccion must with al business fle leesynges / in somoche yt for salvation of
any mannys lif they should not lie to help a nothers body i^ harmi^g of their
own soul. And therefore god says No^ menciemi^ and no^ decipiet vnusqsque
proximum suu^ Leuitici xix / Lie ye not and no man disceyue his neighbor.


The iii. chapter.
Dives Contra. We read in holy wryt Exodi. io. that pharo assigned to the wymen
of israel two mydwyues Sephora and phua. and badde them slay all the children
males and keep the wyme^ But they for the dread of god and for pite dydnat so
but saved both male and female and with a lesyng excused them to the king and
said that wymmen of israel cowde better help themsilf than wymen of egipte
and had children or they come to them / And as holy writ says there / therefore
god yaue them house and land.


Pauper Not for the lesyng but for they dredde god / and for the dread of god
they sauyd the children. Therefore god yaue them house and land / and not for
the lesynge and so says holy wryt Nathelesse su^me clerks sey yt for her
lesynge god chaungid the endless mede yt they had else be worthy. into temporel
mede of house and land.


Dives. yet Contra te. We find in the gospel that after yat criste was risen
from death to life. ne went with ii. of his disciples. cleophas and another in
the liknes of a pilgryme and spoke with them of his death and of his passion /
butt they knew him not And at even when they came to the castle. of emaus /
ne feyned him to goo ferther And yet at their prayer he went in with them But
feyning as seint austyn says is a manner of lesyng / therefore not every manner
of lesyng is sin


Pauper. It semyd to their sight that crist had feyned / not by falls feyni^g
inward i^ deed as he showed outward / for he was fer fro there feith And
therefore he showed him outward as a stranger and a pilgrim passing for they
knew hi^ not ne believed not i^ him steadfastly Also by that doing he showed
that he should pass forth bodily out of this world / and wend above all
heuenes


Dives. We find gen^. xxviio that Jacob in in disceit of his fader yt was
blind and in fraud of his brother Esau said to Isaac his fader to have his
blissi^g I am esau. thy first son / and that was false And yitt god approuyd
his deed Therefore thanne it seems that every lesinge is sin /


Pauper That Jacob did was figure and prophicie of thing that should fall /
And for that prophicie is don i^ deed / therefore it was no lesing For though he
were not his first son in berthe. yet he was his first son i^ dignity by
ordenaunce of god / that ordained that the people cu^myng of Jacob. should be
sovereign. to the people cu^myng of esau. And that the great biheest of
cristes birth made to Abraham and Isaac should be fulfilled i^ jacob and not in
Esau. as their fader wend that it should have be. And so though Esau. Were the
first son / and principalle to Isaac / by the dome of Isaac yitte was Jacob
his first son / and his principalle son by the dome of god. And though he
were not Esau. bodily in person yitt he was Esau in dignite.


Dives. Contra His fader Isaac seyde that he came gylefully. and took his
blessing.


Pauper. Isaac said as he wend but not as it was For he knew not tha^ne the
will of god in yat doing For it was no gyle ne falsenesse in Jacob. For it
was not the deed ne the speech of Jacob / but it was the deed / and the speech
of the holy ghost yt wrought in him and spoke in him. And therefore Criste said
to his disciples. It ben not ye that speak but the holy ghost of your fader in
heuene spekith in you. And so he spoke in Jacob. and rebecca. his mother that
counseiled him so to get his faders blissynge.


The iiii. chapter.
Dives Seint Austyn says that lesynge and liynge is not only in feyned speech
but also in feyned deeds.


Pauper Saint austyn says not that all feyned deeds ben lesynges and syn. but
he says that al feyned speech in falshede is lesyng and sin. For man has
more fre might to govern his speech thanne for to govern his dedys / for
always a man may speak as he wole / butt he may not always do as he wole And the
philosophre says. po pery armynias / yt speech is token of thoughts in the
heart For it is ordained yt man by his speech should show thing to be or not to
be / as he felith and thinks in his heart And therefore Crist said in the
gospel. Sit sermo vester est e^ / non no^. Be your speech yhe yhe. nay. nay /
That as it is in the heart so it be in the mouth. yt yhe of the mouth be yhe
of the heart.

And nay of the mouth be nay of the heart / so yt the mouth and the heart must
always accord. For as says seint austyn In libro co^tra mendacium. The mouth
berith witness to the heart And therefore if man or woman say otherwise thanne
it is / in his heart / he berith falls witness against his heart and against him
self. and does against the p^cept of god / yt bids him say no falls witness
against his nighbour ne against his next / yt is his own heart and his soul
Another skyll is this for deed is not ordained. principally to be witness to
the thought of man's heart / but it is ordained to the profit of the doer and
to the proufytte of his neighbor and to the worship of god. And therefore.
When feynyng in deed is profitable to the doer. and to his even christian and
to ye worship of god / it is leful and in case fulle medeful. And therefore
david when he was among his enemies in perel of of death / medefully feyned
him to be wood. so to save his life to the worship of god and the profyt of his
nation and of his friends and of his enemies. that should else have fallen in
manslaughter. Primo regu^ xxi. But spech is ordained of god principally for to
be true. Witness of thought in heart. And therefore who so says other wise.
thanne it is in his heart and in his conscience he synneth / for he misuseth his
speech against the order of kind ordained of god.


Dives Sith feynyng of deed is not always sin / as feynyng of spech tell me
when it is sin. and wha^ne not.


Pauper Feynyng in deed is done su^tyme by slight. for a good end As we read
in the fourth book of kings.iiii. Reg. xo. that Iev. the king of israel. did
clepe to giddre all the prestes of the false mawmet baal. into a certain day /
as though he would have made a great solempnytie. and worship to baal / and did
cloth all the false priests in one certain clothe that he yaue them / yt by
the clothing me^ should know them from other And when they were al gadryd to
giddre in their temple to worship baal / the king Iev badde. men of arms go
and sle them all / and so they did. Also Iosue leder of gods people feyned
flight. to disceyue gods enemies / Iosue. viii.c. Such feynyng so that it be
do withouten lesyng of the mouth is leful and in cas medeful / Also there is
feynyng for good teching And so Crist feyned him to go ferther to stir his
disciples to hospitalite. Also there is feynynge of significacion / and so
Jacob. as by man's dome feyned him to be esau But in gods doom it was no
feynyng of falshede / but figure showed by holy ghost that spoke in him and
wrought i^ him Aso there is feynyng of falsenesse and of doublenes for to
disceiue. and such is in ypocrites. and false folk And al such feynynge / is
lesyng and forboden of god. by this precepte.


The v. chapter.
Dives. Is it any sin to bileue thing that is false.


Pauper. There is falshede of the sayer / and falshede of the thing that is
said Falshede of the sayer sumtyme is pernycious and wicked / and to bileue
lightly. such falshede / itt is dedely sin and dampnable. Sumtyme false head
of the sayer is profitable as touchi^g worldly thing. and not noyous as to the
world. and su^tyme it is neither profitable ne noyus to the world as lesi^ges
made only. for board yt harmeth no man worldly ne profits And to bileue tho
ii. manner of falshedes it is venial sin Also there is reprouable falshede of
thing that is said And either that thing longith to the nedefulnesse of our
salvation as be articles of the faith and to bileue such falshede / it is
dedly sin / or it longith not to the nedefulnes of our salvation and to
bileue suhce falsehede lightly it is venial sin / or else no syn as says
Dockyng super Deutronomiu^ Nathelesse there should no wysema^ be to hasty to
bileue things of charge that sound either great prosperity or great
aduersite: For the wiseman says Qui cito credit leuis est cord. He that sone
bileuyth is light of heart and unstable Ecclesiastici xix. And therefore says he
bileue not every word that men tell the. ibidem The fool simple man says he
by leueth every word but the wise man takith head to his paas / and gothe ne
bileueth not chaungeably after mennys speech ne after lesi^ges but after the
law of god that is not chau^geable Prouer. xiiii. and eccle. xxxiii.


Dives. Sithen it is so yt a man may syn beryng false witness of him self
whether synneth he more prising him self falsely or lacki^g him self falsely


Pauper. Both ben folly. and in cas great syn For caton says. No^ te collaudes
nec te culpaueris ip^e. Prise thou not thy selue. ne lack thou not thy self /
And solomon says Laudet te alienus. et non os tuu^. Extraueus et no^ labia
tua. Let a another man prise the and not thine own mouth / a strangers and
not thy lips. prouer. xxvii And therefore by common opinion of clerks / it is
more syn a man to prise him self falsely by auantement than it is to lack hi^
self falsely For aua^tme^t comes of pride yt is worst of al sins But lackyng
of him self may come of lowness medefully For every man of hi^ self is more to
lack than to prise. And therefore says the prophet Omnis homo men dax Every
man and woman of himself is false and a liar. And solomon says yt no man wot
whether he is worthy love or hate of god And so do man wot what he is worth
i^ gods sight And asmoch as he is worth in gods sight so much he is worth
and no more Therefore says aristotle iiii. ethecorum xiiiic yt the auau^ter of
him self is wors than the lacker of him self Iactator vituperabilior est quam
vituperator Et idem dicit Ricardus de media villa super sentencias li.iii. di.
xxviii. questione quarta.


Dives. Which ben clepyd by the law false witnesses


Pauper. They that been brought to bear witness and ben sworn to say the
soth / and do against their oath. sayng falls or hidyng the treuthe and thing that
should be said / or transpose things that should be said Or a man say thing
for certain yat he is not siket of though it be treuth that he says And also
he is false witness that swerith a treuth with sligh spech for disceyt Such
manner folk saint Austyn likneth to Judas And much folk says he these days
despise the deed of Judas / and yitt they do the same that he did or else
worse For why says he Although that for mede bear false witness / they selle
Criste that is sovereign treuthe for mede Et est super illud Mt. Quid vultis
mihi dare et ego eu^ vobis tradam. But such falls witnesses be wors thanne was
Judas For he sold crist for thritty pens. But many false witness selle Crist
for much less / and sumtym for noght only to show malice or to be ve^gyd
Judas made restitucion of the money that he took to bitray crist and would not
reioise it / but false witnesses these days make no restitucion / but live by
such false synful lucre. Judas bileuyd not that Crist should rise fro death to
life. and deem the quycke and the deed But we believe yat he rose from death to
life and shall come to deem al mankind verry god and verry man And therefore
christian men false witnesses. been more to blame thanne was Judas.


The vi. chapter.
Dives. May al manner me^ bear witness in doom.


Pauper. Nay. for bond servants should bear no witness i^ causes of their
lords / neither aye^ste them ne with them / but in asmoche as the cause
touchith other of his seuauntes iiii. q^. iii. Scriminali. v. Ite^ serui. Ne
wymmen should bear no witness of preef in causes of felony / but in
matrimony and in causes of purgacion of wymens evil name. they may bear
witness of preef. And wymen may accuse in causes of felony Also no young folk
with in xiiii. year / ne foles ne beggars ne full pore folk / ne hethen men. ne
christian men openly loosed of falshede / or onys teynt false and forsworn. ne
open wicked lyuers and of evil name / none of these is able to bear witness /
in dome before a judge. vus Condico^ sexus etas discreto^ fama Et fortuna fides
in testibus ista reqre.

By false witnesses the jews slew seint Steuyn / and by falls witnesses they
slew Criste / and by false witness the true man na both / and by false
wytnes they would have slain the holy wooman Susanne. but god sauyde her and
brought the false witnesses to the same death. yt she should have had / if
her witness had been true / and that was the law that time / and yet it is
in many lands. And if they disherite any man or woman / or do him lose any
thing by false witness / they ben bounden to restitucion Also bacbiters
forfete against this precept / which by malice bacbyten them that been good /
and by lesinges diffame them Also flaters ye falsely prise them that be wicked
so to favor them in their sin. And so both the bacbiter bacbyting the good
man / and the flaterer prisynge the wicked man have gods curse / that he
yeuethe to all such / thus saying. Ve qui dicu^t bonu^ malu^ / et malu^
bonu^. Woe be to al them that say the good wicked / and wicked good ysa. v.co.
And namely they that been nigh to lords and to great men and been their
gouernoures or there cou^seilours or co^fessours and to please them / and to
flater them be it neuir so false / and take none head to god ne to treuth. but
only to plese / and say nay or yhe / not after the treuthe is / butt after the
lord wole have it / and so harden him and blind him in his folly. Such
flaterers be like to a be that is clepyd camelio^. Which best changith his
color after the things that be besides him / now white / now black. now
read / now grene / now blewe now yalowe / Right so such flaterers change
their speech / after that they hope best to please there lords. and other men
For now they speak good of a man / while the lord is his friend And if he
fall enemy to him / anon they speak him harm and velonye so to plese the
lord and other alsoo that been that man's enemies. In presence of his fre^des
they speak a man good / though they wole him no good and in presence of his
enemies they speak him evil And as the fane of the steple. turns after the
wind. so turn flaterers and bacbiters their speech / as cu^pany spekith that
they ben in The mosel and the face. of the camelion is like a swyne. and an
ape. For every flaterer is a bacbiter And as a swyne hay moore liking to lie
in a foul slough thanne in a fair grene / and with wrotynge of his snoute
defouleth the place there he goothe. so has the bacbiter. more liking to speak
of other mennys defautes and of their vnhonesties and sin tha^ne to speak of
their godenesse and honesty / and wysly speech. Wroting upon their defautes to
appear and defoule their good name And in that he is a flaterer he is like the
ape / that what he seith other men do he wole do the same. For flaterers reule
their tu^ge not after the treuthe. but after the plesaunce and spech of other
men But this be Camelion though it be fair while it is alive yet as soon as
it is deed it is full foul as says the master of ki^d Right so such
flaterers and fair spekers that speak well and do full evil although they seem
fair and worshipful / in this world. i^ the other world after their death they
shall be full foul and fendes fellows / in hell pain / but they amend them And
all that speak well and do not thereafter forfete against this p^cept For they
deny by their deeds the treuth that they say with their mouth Of such. seint
poul says yt with their mouth they knowledge them self to know god. but with
there deeds they deny it. Confitentur se nosse deum / factis aute^ negant.
Tite. po And therefore god warns folk of such false witnesses that speken
the treuthe with their mouth and deny it i^ deed. and says thus Omnia
quecunque dicerint nobis facite: scdm^ vero opera eoru^ nolite facere. Mt
xxiii. All thing that they bydde you do / do ye it. But do ye not after their
wicked works.


The vii chapter
ALso these me^ of law that for mede mayntene falshede against the treuthe. or
for mede hyde the treuth that they should. mayntene / or for mede withdraw
them to suffer or let falshede have his forth. they forfet against this
precepte which forbedith al manner falshede. I read on a time there were ii.
men of law. duellyng in one town The one at even came home from the assise.
and the other axed him what he had won that day And he said xx mark. and
that he had right much travail therefore. yhe said the other / and I have
won asmoche and more / to be at home. and not to trauayl. Such men of law
and batteres of law that have no conscience / may well say yt is written in the
book of ysaie the prophet Concipimus et locuti sumus de cord verba me^dacii.
etc. We have conceived. by study and by good informacion knowing of the treuthe
/ and of our own heart / and of our co^triuyng we have spoken words of
lesynge and of falshede And therefore rightful dome is turned bacwarde. and
rightfulnesse stood from far and might not nigh treuthe fell down in the
street. and equite might natt enter / the treuth is al foryeten And he that
went away fro wicked thing / and would have lived in pees and treuth he was
open pray to false men Qui recessit a malo prede patuit ysa. lix. But would god
that they would amend them. and say that is written the same chapter. Lord
god our sins been multiplied before the / and our sins answer to us for
our great sins been with us and accuse us. We know our witnesses. for we
have synnyde and lied falsely against our lord god. We turnyd us away and would
not go after our god / to follow him in treuth / but spoke ayenste him
falshede. and passing of gods law for to endau^ger the simple folk. Also
prechoures of gods word that preche moore for wynnyng of worldly good than
for winning of mannys soul. and seek more their own worship. thanne gods
worship in their preching and preche not the treuthe / ne wole say men their
sothes in rep^uynge of their sins. they been falls witnesses and do against
this precepte. For if they hyde treuthe in favor of sinners and wole not
preche against their vices. Or if they preche falshede and error to show their
wit by curioust of spech / or preche high matters not profitable to the people
not helply to mannys soul. all such prechoures ben clepyd false witnesses.
Also they that preche so hard against the mercy of god / that they bring folk
in wanhope. And also they that preche so much of the mercy of god and so little
of his rightwysnesse that they make folk to bold in sin / such prechoures
ben falls witnesses of crist For all his mercy is medlyd with rightwysnesse and
al his rightwisnesse is medlyd with mercy. Therefore david says Universe vie
dn^i mi^a et veritas. All the ways and the domes of our lord god been mercy
and treuthe. Deus iustus et misericors. God is rightful and he is merciable. to
all that wole amend them. All prechours of gods word should be witnesses
of Criste. that is sovereign treuthe. And therefore Crist said to his
disciples. Eritis michi testes in jerusalem etc. ye shall be witnesses to me in
Iherusalem. and in all iurye / and in samarye. and in every land to the last
end of the earth. Actuum primo co. And therefore prechoures should auyse them
well that they prechid no falshede / ne say no thing for certain that is in
doubt to them and that they hide not the treuth that should be said / and that
there life and their techyng accord with the techyng and the life of Christ For if
they teache otherwise tha^ne Criste taught / and live natt as christ lived they
ben false witnesses to crist Christ taught chastity. and co^me^dyd pouert and
lowness And therefore if the prechoure of gods word be a lechoure and a
carnal man proud of heart and couetouse. he is not true wytnes of Criste And if
he repreue in his dedys poue^t and chastity. and say that criste was not pore
for mannys sake / he lies upon Criste and he is to him ouirdone false
witness. For Crist said that foxes had their dennys / and the briddes her
nestes / but the maidens. son had not where he might rest his head / Mt
viii.c. And seint Poule said that Crist bicame man nedy for us i^ this world
to make us rich with his myscheif Propter nos egenus factus est: cum esset
dives: vt illius inopia diuites essetis. ii. little. viii.

The viii chapter.
ALso all ministres of holy church / and namely men of religion. should be
witnesses of Christ to edificacion of the people and of their neighbors / that been al men and wymen And therefore men of holy church ben betoknyd by galaad
that is to say* an hope of witness For all their living in heart in word in
werk. and in clothinge should bear witness to crist.

Dives. How should men of holy church bear wytnes in clothing to Crist


Pauper. For in clothing they should show sadness honesty and lowness / as
nigh folowers of Criste / and witnesses that taught sadness against vanity /
honesty against glotonye and lechery / lowness against pride / and pouert
against couetise And therefore the outclothing of me^ of holy church / and
namely of me^ of religion should not be to strayte. ne to short. to show. the
shap of their body. for pride and vanite and to tempte wymen / ne to preciouse
against pouerte / ne ouirdo ne feeble against their degree. and honesty of holy
church / ne to side ne wide against measure.


Dives. Of this matter thou spoke before. I coueyte no more to here thereof. For
as thou sothely saidest men of holy church and namely me^ of religion pass i^
great arraye and pomp / temporal lords


Pauper. Also as often as the p^st syngith his (...) he representith the person
of Crist yt dyed for us all upon the tree. And by his clothyng and by his
mess syngyng he berith witness of Cristis passion. and shewyth that all that
he does i^ seeing of his mess / he does it in mind of cristes passion and if he
have no mind of cristes passion after that his clotyng shewyth that he should
be / he is a falls witness in disceyte of his neighbor Therefore seint
Gregorye says that no man does more harm in holy church / thanne he that
has a name and order of holiness and lives wyckedly. Nemo amplius nocet in
ecclia. quam qui perverse agens nome^ et ordine^ sanctitatis habet.


Dives. What betokneth the clothing of of the pressed at mess.


Pauper. The amyt on his head / at the beginning betokneth the clothe yt
cristes face was hyled with in time of his passion / when the iewys hyled his
face and bobbyde him / and badde him arede whoo smote him The long aube
betokneth the white cloth that Errowde cladde with crist in scorn as he had been a fool. The fano^ the stole and the girdel / betoken the boondes. Which
Criste was bonden with / as a thief / in time of his passion. The fanon
betokneth bonds of his hondes. The stoleye rope yt he was led with to his death.
The girdel the bonds yat he was bound with to the pyler and to the cross.
The chesible betokneth the clothe of purpure in which the knights clothed him
in scorn. and knelyd to him and said in scorn Hayle thou king of iewys The
busshop passing other prestys has a mytre and a cross. The mytre on his head
betokneth the crown of thorns. yt crist bare on his head for man's sake. And
therefore the mytre has two sharp horns. in tooken of the sharp thorns.
The two tunges yt hang down on ye mytre betoke^ the stremys of blood yt
ran down fro cristes head by pryckyng of the crown of thorns. The crose
that the busshop berith in his hand betokneth ye read spear that the knights
turme^tours put in the hand of crist in scorn for a ceptre And the
archebusshoppes cross betoknethe the cross that crist died upon for us all
The busshoppes gloves. at mess in his ho^des. betoken ye nails in cristes
hondes / and the sandalies on his feet at mess betoken the nails in christian
feet If it be so than yt me^ of holy church having thies tokenys of cristes
passion in their mess saying have no devotion in cristes passion ne mind of
his passion they bear false wytnes For it is not with them inward as the tokene^
shown outward Also the amyt betokens the basinet of health yt is hope of the
life that is to come / and forsakyng of erthly things. The long albe betokneth
chastity of body and soul The gyrdel fanon and stole / betoken the
commandments and the counseyles of crist in the gospel by ye which me^ of
religion and of holy church ben bounden passynglother to serve god The
chesible betokneth the holy clothe of Criste withoute^ seem all wo^ne in one
which betokneth parfyt charity The mytre on the busshopes head with the horns
betokneth cunnyng of two testamentes old and new which cu^nyng he owith to
have and to teache with two. tunges / with tu^ge of deed. and with tu^ge of
speech and show them both in deed by good example yeuynge. and in speech well
techyng / and yt betokenyth the ii. tu^ges hangyng behind on the mytre. And
the same betoken the ii. tunges hanging behind on the aube on the prestes
shulder. For every priest should cu^ne gods law and prech it with tunge of
deed and good example. and with tunge of speech These ii. tunges hang higher
on the busshop than on the simple pressed in token yt the busshop is more highly
bound to the tu^ges of good ensample and good teching than the simple priest.


Dives. It is a common saw that tho ii. tunges on the priests shuldre betoken
yt this land has been twes renegat and peruertyd.


Pauper. That is false. For sith this land took first the feith / the people
was neuir renegat But the people of this land was slain nigh al up for ye
faith til there was no criste^ man to duelle therein / but only hethen people yt
had slain christian people. and by the sword kept this land yt they wa^ne of
criste^ people Therefore Bid de officio diuino says yt it betokneth ii tu^ges
yt me^ of holy church owe to have as I have said And therefore they ben cleepyd
tu^ges Also the p^stes crown betokneth the crown of thorns on cristes head
and the dignity of the presthode. And his shauyng as says the law /
betokens pouert i^ soul / and forsaki^g of worldly gods.


The ix.c.
Dives. What betokneth the busshoppes cross. in manner of living.


Pauper. As says a great clerk Bid. li.i. de diuino officio. The busshop
croce is clepyd a shepherdes staff. to to stir the busshop to lowness. and
to think on the cure and on the besinesse and the charge that he takes upon
him when he is made busshop He berith no ceptre of worldly dignyte to stire
hi^ to pride / ne berith no sword that is token of cruelte / but he beryth a
shepherdes staf / not to sle / ne to smite / but for to save his sheep. yt ben
his subgettes spiritualy / which staff above is crokyd in manner of an hoke /
to draw again yt would not come / or else go awey For the busshop should
principaly travail to draw synful men and wymen with fairness by good
words. and by good ensample to the mercy of god / and natt to be fers ne fell
to the synfulle. And therefore as Bede says above on the hoke of the cross is
written thus about. Cum iratus sueris mi^e recordaberis. When thou shall be
wroth thou shalt think on mercy. In the round knott byneth the hoke is
written homo. that is to say a man / to do the busshop think that he is but a
man as another is / and natt be proud of his dignite. Byneth beside the pyke
of iron is written parce. that is to say spare. For he must spare his subgettes
and show grace to the^ as he wole have grace of god And in token thereof the
pyke of the cross should not be sharp but blunt For the doom of the
busshoppe should not be to sharp / but always medlyd with mercy The staff of
the cross is right and not wrong. in token. that the busshop should deem
ryghtfully and govern his subgettes in right and equite. and do no man wrong
Vnde versus. Contrahe per primu^ / medio rege. parce per ymu^ By these tokenes
outward busshopes and prestes witness them self to be such inward as the
toknes show But if they be not such. they be false witnesses to criste and to
cristes lore in damage of their even christian / for by ypocrisy they disceiue
the people Forsothe it is a lesing any man knowledge him self a busshop priest /
or clerk / or man of religion. and worche contrary things to his order. and
ayens the tokenes that he bears of holiness / It is a lesynge any man or
woman to say him christian. and do not ne live noe thereafter. as a christian man
or woman. but perauenture wors than jew. saresyne or panyme / Therefore says
saint John in his pistle / yt who so says that he knowethe god and keeps
not his co^mau^dementis. he is a lier / there is no feith in him.i. Iohannis
socu^do And he yt says yt he loves god and hate his brother. he is a lier.
Io. iiiio. And so every wicked liver. is a lier And therefore saint Ambrose
says in this manner / Brethren flee ye lesynges / For all that louen
lesynges. ben the children of the find / For as criste says in the gospel.
all such have the fend to there fader / which has ever be a lier and fader of
lesynges: and never stood in treuth but with a lesing lees all mankind as
criste himsilfe says i^ ye gospel.io.viii. And yet into this day vnnethis he
bryngethe any man woman to sin but with lesynges And so with lesinges he
sleth mannys soul and womans and ever has be a cruel mansleer and a false
lier: as criste says i^ ye same gospel


Dives. Tell me I pray the / hou wyttnessis should have them i^ dome for to be
treue witnessis /


Pauper The witnessisi^ dome and the judge also should be indifferent to both
perties and say the treuth for both perties. And the judge may not by the law
take mede to deem treuly / ne the witness may not by the law take mede to
bear true witness. Much more than ye witness owes to take no mede to bear
false witnese. ne the judge to give vnrightful dome.xiiii. q^. v No^sane
Nethelese the witness may lefully take his costis of him yt bring the him to
witness / And if a man see that his neighbore should fall in his truth and lose
his right for defaut of witness / if he know ye treuth and may bear witness
in the cause. but he bear witness and say ye treuth for saluaco^n of his
neighbore. else he synneth grievously though he be not brought to bear
witness. And in that case men of holy church may and owen to bear witness: so
that it be not i^ cause of blood ne of grievous syn And if a man take meede for
his witness. he is bound to restituco^n


The tenth chapter.
Dives to whom shall he make restitucion:


Pauper. If he took mede to bear falls witness. though he bear treue witness.
or no witness / he shall make restituco^n. not to him that yaue it. For he is
not worthy to have it again. sith he yaue it for falsehed and for sin. But he
shall make restitucion to hi^ aye^s who^ he took it to do him wrong / And in the
same manner shall make restitucion if he took mede notte to bear witness. but
for to be stylle. and not say the treuth And if ye witness take mede to say the
treuthe / he shall make restitucion to him that yaue it to him in help of his
right / For it was leful to him so to give. but it was not lefulle to the
witness so to take / And if it be in doubt for what end the yifte was youen:
thanne he shall make restitucion and give it ye pore folk by the doom of holy
church / Hec Reymundus li. ii. ti. de testibus.


Dives. hou many witnessis be nedful in doom.


Pauper. After that the cause is: so most be the nou^bre of witnessis / And
after the person or the persons been ayens whom the witnessis been brought /
For ayens busshopis and preestis and ayens men of holy church and aye^s
persons of temporalle dignitye most be brought more witnessis and of more
worship. than aye^s simple folk:


Dives Why so


Pauper. For there should no man be in dignitye neither speiritual ne temporal:
but treue folk. to whose treuth me^ should give more crede^ce. tha^ to spech of
si^ple folk which known not well what is treuth. ne what is false. What is
profitable to the comonte. ne what is noyous. and often full litil dredyng god /
Also persons in dignity in that they be soueragines and iuges and gouernouris
of the people. for there rightful domes: and su^tyme for vnrightful geten the^
much hate of the people. and often without gilte and for there good deed. and so
they have many adversaries / For it is not i^ ye power of the gouernoure to
please al But nedis either he most offend god. or else men that dreden not
god / And therefore the judge shall not lightly leeue a few witnessis ayens such
persons / Also if persons of dignite might lightly be dampened by the simple
folk. the people should be to bold ayens there sovereigns and litil set by
them And so dignitye both spiritual and temporal should be in despite and come
to nougt / And therefore su^tyme it is better to suffer a shrewed prelate or a
curat and a shrewed man to regne: thanne lightly at the request of the people
to despose hi^ / but his syn be well open and well sclaunderouse and noyous


Dives. Is there any caas in which it is leful to stand to one witness


Pauper. in that is no preuidice to a another / it is lefulle to stand to one
witness As if it be in doubt whether a child be cristenyd / or a church
halowyd. or an auter / or vestment halowyd. Also by assente of both perties
me^ may sto^de to the witness of one Also men may stand to the witness of
the priest seeing that his parisshyn is ame^dyd if the sin be not open. Vt
dicit hostiensis. in su^ma li. ii. Rubrica de testibus. S. quotus est numerus
Also the witness shall say for certeynte yt he knowyth for certain / and sey
in doubt thing that is to him in doubt.


Dives. Often a man wenyth to be syker of thing and he is disceyued


Pauper. If he do his deuer to know the treuth / thou he be disceyued so sayng
ayenste treuth / he synneth not dedly For it is not his will to bear falls
witness.


The xi. chapter.
Dives. Is a man bound. to keep counseyl of thing that he knowith by prive
telling


Pauper. That a man knowyth. only by shrift he is bound to keep pryue and no
witness bear thereof For he knowith it only as gods pryue minyster. But if he
knew it not only by shrifte. but by other weye thanne by his telling that is
shreuyn to him thereof / if it be such that it be great harm of the comynte /
or of any person / thanne he is bound to tell it out for salvation of his
even christian / saving asmoche as. he may the person that told it him. so
that he be ware of more harm by his tellinge If it be such that it be not to
harm of the comente ne to great harm of any person if he have bound him to
counseyl he shall not be it a know for no biddynge of his sovereign For it is
a law of kind to keep counsel that man knowith by counseyl / if the keeping
of counseil be not against charity For against charity may no man be bounden
neither by biheest ne by oath. And for to discoure counseyle that is told thim
for counseyl when he may lefully keep it counseyle it is a falshede. And
therefore the wise man says / that who so discureth the priueties of his friend
he lesith faith Ecclesiastici. vicesimo septimo. For that is the manner of
false friends that wha^ne they turn to eneminyte. than to tell the priuetyes
of there friends to shende them / as says the wise man / Ecclesiastici vio.
witnesses must accord i^ the thing and in the person the place and in the
degree / and in the time. If one witness stand against many witnesses / his
witness is nout but he be written with them in any instrument. If the witnesses
contrary among themself / the judge shall deem aftere the more party /
butt the less party pass the other party in worship. and dignitye / and in
good name Or else if their witness be more semely to the treuthe / and yt
they preue better their words thanne the other pertie / but that must sto^d in
discrecion of the judge. They that shall atteynt other witnesses must be mo in
no^bre and of more worship and of better name than the other were. If witnesses
ben even in both perties in nombre / and in dignity / the judge shall deliver

says The false witness shall not be unpunished. and he yat spekith lesynges

there ben three manner of witnesses.

The xiii. chapter.
There is a witness abooue us that knows all and may not be disceiued / that
is god that sees al / and he shall at the day of dome be to us both judge and
witness. Ego sum iudex et testis. I am judge and witness. says our lord
god. Ieremye xxix And Job said. In heuene is my witness / and he yt knowiy al
my counseil. is above in high And there is a witness within us that is our
conscience. For as seint poule says. our joy is witness of our conscience
And there is a witness withouten us / and yt is our nighbour and all creatures
that shall bear witness against us at the dome before the high judge. but we
amend us by time and deem well our self For moses said. Testem i^uoco celum
and terra^. I clepe heuene and earth to witness / that if ye make to you any
lyknesse / or image to worship it and break gods law / ye shall sone
perisshe. Deutro. quarto. And i^ an other place he says thus. I clepe heuyn
and earth to witness that I have set before you life and death / good and evil
blessyng and curse. And therefore chese the lif that ye may live and and love
your lord god and obey to his voice / and cleue to him by feith and love. for
he is your life: and lengith of your days. And if your heart be turned away
from him and ye wole nathere his laws / but worship false gods. I say to
you before that ye shall sone perisshe. Deutro. xxxo. And therefore lene friend
if we wol be syker at the last dome / and come sikerly before our sovereign
judge that knowith al / us must deem well our self in this world. For seint
poule says That if we demyd well our self / and discussed well our life / we
should natt be dampnyd. Prima ad Little xio

Dives. How should we deem our self.


Pauper As the gloss says there. Thou shall be thine own domesman Thy seete
shall be thine heart / and set thy selue gilty before thy self domesman. Thy
thought and thy conscience. shall be thy two witnesses / for to accuse the. Thy
turmentoures should be dread and sorrow / that in manner should show thy blood
by weeping of salt terys when by witness of thine own conscience and of thy
thought / thou haste demyd thy self giltye / and not worthy to come to gods
board ne to heuene bliss. And there says the glofe that seknesse feblenesse /
and sodeyne death fall commonly / aftre Ester among the people / for men in
Estre resceyue unworthily gods flesh and his blood. Ideo multi in firmi et
i^becilles et dormiu^t mul ti. s. per mortem. prima ad little. xi. Butt for
every man is favorable to him self. and to his own cause. therefore thou
shalt have with the two. assessoures by whose counseile thou shall deem thy
self / and tho shall be treuthe. and reasone. Take with the treuthe that thou
make no false excusacion of thy sin. Ne lie thou not for to excuse thy self
ne for to accuse thy self falsely. ne to grievously. but as thine other
assessoure reasone wole accord. And if tho ii. witnesses that is to say / thy
thought and thy conscience suffice not to bear witness ne to full enfourme the
of thy synful life. Take to the. the thridde witness that is thy feyth. And so
let thy doom stand in witness of two or three. And feith says thus. Fides
sine operibus mortua est. Feyth withouten good works is deed. For all though
you believe as a criste^ man. butt thou live as a christian man / else thou art
deed in soul and worthy to die withoute^ end Feith that fails in word. and
thought is deed and helpith natt to bliss. And anon conscience. and mind shall
accord to him / and say thus. He that uses amysse his free will that he die it
is skyl withouten remedy saving gods mercy And take heed yt thy clergy may
not save the For holy wrytt and clergy say. Anima peccatoris morietur. The
soul of the sinner shall dye Also thy clergy may not save the. if thou be in
dedly sin. For thou art bigamus. and twyes weddyd First to crist i^ thy
baptym. and after to the feende by assent to syn And so thou art wydowe. fro
crist weddid to another widow that is ye feend forsaken of god for his pride.
to whom he was weddyd at the beginning of the world. Ne trust thou not in thy
dome. on a good cuntre. For if the quest common of the x. commandments which
thou have broken / and of the ii. precepts of charity against which thou have
offendyd / and of the xii. articles of the faith against which thou have erryd /
and of the vii. deeds of mercy. Which thou have natt fulfilled / and of thy v.
wits which thou have misspendyd / and the four cardynal virtues against
which thou have trespassed / this solemn queest of xl true witnesses shall
dampne the as a man queller of thine own soul. And as a thief traytoure thou
have robbed thyn own lord of his good For robbery is clepyd all manner
mystreatynge of a another man's good. against his will. And thou haste robbyd
Christ of that preciouse soul. that he bought with his dear blood / and mysused
and myspent his creatures. against his will. For as says seint Gregory in his
Omelie. all thing that we tak of god to use of good living / we turn it
into use of wicked living. Quicquid ad vsum recipimus vite: in vsum
conuertimus culpe. For the health of body that god sent us. We spend it in
sin and in wickedness. fair wedyr in vein occupacion of pride and of
couetyse. peace / in vein sikernesse / ple^tee of vitailes / in glutony and
lechery And so this solemn quest of forty would dampne the for guilty.
Therefore there is none other remedy but truly deem thy self and yield ye gilty
and tak the to the m^^y of god and punysshe thy self by dread and sorrow of
heart and putt the in the dome of gods judge / that is thy confessoure / and
make amends after his dome and by his assent For god against whom thou have so
highly offe^did wole sto^de to his rightful dome / and accept such satisfaccion
as he assigns the by the law of god to do / if thou do it with good will.


The xiiii. chapter.
THus deem thou thy self / and thanne shall thou be syker at the dredeful
dome wha^ criste our brother verry god / and very man / shall come down to deem
the quycke and the deed And as says seint poule / he shall come down with the
voice of a tru^pe that is to say. With the voice of aungelles and of
archaungelles which shall cry and say Surgite mortui venite ad iudicium. Rise
ye up that been deed / and come ye to the dome And anon in the twynklyng of an
iye we shall al awake of the long sleep and rise up and come to the dome pope
and prince / king and caiser. lord and lady free and bond rich and pore.
great and small. al they shall awake and rise up body and soul. again knytte
to giddre That voice shall be so hydous so dredeful and stern that heuene and
earth shall begin to quake. The stones shall ryue / and all the deed arise from
death to life each man and woman to answer for him self / no man per attorney.
Now our judge Crist is a lomb merciful and meke / than he shall be as a lion
dredful and stern. And the lion with his cry abassheth al other beestes and
makethe them to stand stylle save his own whelps / which with his cry he
reyseth fro death to life / so the voice of Crist at the day of dome shall arere
us al from death. to life which voice shall be full dredful to them that live
beestly / and take none head to god ne to his law Them it shall arrest and make
them stand stylle. as prisoners. on the earth and abide their judge. For they
shall so be chargyd wi^ sin / that they shall not wend up against Crist. as the
good shall wend up and mete with Christ For to them that been goddis children
that voice shall be full sweet. and full likyng to here and make them so light that
they shall we^d up and mete with criste in the air. as says seint poule To his
children Crist shall say Venite. etc: Come ye my faders blessed children and
take ye the kingedome of heaven that was ordained to you before the beginning of
ye world. But to these bestial folk. and wicked lyuers to the proud to the
couetouse. to the enuiouse / and to lechouris. glotou^s. and to ve^geable
folk. his voice shall be full dredful and full bitter when he shall say to them
Discedite a me maledicti etc. Wend ye hens fro me ye cursed wretches into the
fire of hell withouten end. there to dwell with the fend and his aungelis
And so he shall send the^ to sorry place and to sorry cu^pany without any remedy
/ was there never thunderblast so dredful as his voice thanne shall be to them
that shall be dampened / And was there never song so merry. ne me. lodie so
likyng as his voice shall be tha^ne to all that shall be saved. And therefore deem
well thy silfe here: that thou be not dampened there Stond here to the saw of
ye great queste of treue witnesses. Which I have nempned to the and
demethisylfe thereafter / And be treue domesman of thisylfe or else thou shall
have the same q^st. ayens the at the dredful dome. And thereto all aungelis and
archaungelis and all the seyntes in heaven and all creaturis shall tha^ bear
witness ayens the and axe vegeaunce on the / Thanne as says John crisostom
super illud. Plangent se omnes tribus tree et c. The aungelis shall bring forth
the cross. the spear. the nails. the scourges. and the garlo^d of thorns
with which criste suffered his passion. Thanne shall crist sit on high to deem
ye qcke and the deed / he shall depart the good from the wicked and set the
good on the right side. the wicked on the liftesyde / He shall turn hi^ to the
wicked on the liftsyde and show them the cross. the spear the nails. the
scourges and the garlond of thorns and his wou^des all fresshe which he
suffered for all mankind. and say to the wicked on this wise / Ecce miseri
et ingrati quanta provobis sustinui propter vos homo factus sum etc. Se ye
unkind cursed wretches what I suffered for your sake For wha^ I was god and
king of kings and lord of lords and never had wist of woo. for your sake I
bicam man for your sake I suffered to be beten and bound. be spateled and
despised be nailed to the cross crowned with thorns. stongen to the heart
with a spear. and was slain dispitous death as ye may see to bye you from
endless death. Where is the rau^som of my blood where be the souls yt I bought
so dear: where is the service that ye should have don to me: where is the love
that ye should have showed to me: I loved you above all creaturis / I loved you
more than I did mine own worship Forwhy. for your love I put misylfe to
sorrow and care. And ye loved more a little mucke and a lityl lust of the
flesh. than ye did me or my rightfulnesse: and lityl or naught would do for
my love / For wha^ne I was hungry ye would not feed me / when I had thurst.
ye yaue me no d^^h when I was naked / ye hilde me not / when I sought mine
harborowe: ye resceyued me not when I was seek and in preson: ye visited me
not / And therefore wend ye hens from me into the fire of hell without end
there to dwell with the fend and his aungelis / O. says saint Gregori thou
synful wretch what shall thou do. fle may thou not. ne hyde the may thou not.
and if thou apere as nedys thou most thou art but she^t / for yer^ thou shall
have al thing ayens the / Above ye thou shall have the dredfulle domesman ready
to dampne the On the right side thou shall have the wicked works to accuse the
On the lift side the foul fendes ready to draw the to hell / Byneth the thou
shall have ye endless depnes ready to swolow the in / withoute^ the thou shall
have all the world on fire ready to brenne the / within the thou shall have thyn
own conscience worst of al / gnawyng the and fretynge the withouten end Thanne
as says the wise man All creaturis shall feight ayens us / Sap^ vo. Thanne as
says the great clerk / Crisostomus. heaven earth water son moan night and
day and al ye world shall stond ayens us in witness of our sins And though
al thing were still our thoughtis and our conscience / and our works / shall
accuse us and stand witnessis ayens us / Therefore saint austen in his omelie
super illud Estote misericodes says thus Brethern take ye head to the mercy of
god: and to the hard dome of god: Now is time of mercy. after it shall be time
of dome Now god clepeth again that been turned a weye fro him: and foryeueth
the^ there sins that turn again to him: and he is full pacient and abidethe of
wrech that men should turn the^ to him and be saved. And anon as si^ners turn
them again to god he foryeuethe sins that been passed and bihetith joys to
comi^g Now god stireth and monestith the^ that been slaw to good dedi^ he
confortith them that been diseasyd / he techith them that be studiouse / and
helpith them yt fight against vices He forsakes no ma^ne woman that traueyleth
to do well if they clepe to him He yeueth to us that we should give again to
him to please him wha^ne we have offendyd him For we have not youe^ him ne
wherewith to queme him / butt that we take of him The time of mercy is full
great. I pray you brethren all let ye natt this time pass you. but take ye
it while ye may After this tym shall cu^me tym of dome when men shall do hard
penance withouten fruit / for itt shall not help them Tha^ne sinners that had
their wealth in this world shall sigh and say with great sorrow Quid nobis profuit
superbia etc. What has profited to us pride / what has now helped us our
pomp: our boost / our richesses: Al thies ben passed awey right as a
shadow. These been the words of seint austyn.

The xv chapter.
THa^ne they that shall be damned shall say a saw of sorrow yt neuir shall have
end. De fecit gaudiu^ cordis nti. versus e^ in luctu^ chorus nt. cecidit
corona capitis nostri / ve nobis quia peccauimus. The joy of our heart is done
and past away / to sorrow and care is turned our pleye. the garlonde of our
head is fall to ground / that euir we did syn welaway the stounde. Trenorum.
quarto. Therefore leave friend take we to us the time of mercy and amend we us
while we may for else we shall not wha^ne we would And the le^ger yt god
suffrith folk to reign in their sin / and the more patience yt he has with
them the harder he shall smyt them but they amend them. And therefore the doom
of god is lykned. to a bow For the bow is made of ii. things Of a wrong
tree. and a right string So the dome of god is made of ii. manner folk Of them
yt ben wrong through sin / and live wronfully / and do much wrong / and
of them yt be right and rightful in living The archer sheti^g in this bow is
crist And the more yt ye bow is draw abak / the harder it smyteth wha^ the
archer lousith. So the longer yt Crist abides / and so draws his dome abake
/ the harder he shall smite but folk amend them And as the archer in his
shetinge takes the wrong tree in his lift hand / and the right string in
his right ho^de and drawith them atwynne / so Crist at the doom. shall set the
wrong lyuers on his left ho^de. the rightful lyuers on his right hand / and
set the arowe in his bow / that shall be the dredful sentence of his dome /
and draw the rightful from the wrong / the good from the wicked / when he
shall say to the rightful. Come ye with me up into heuene bliss. Withouten end
/ and to the wrong lyuers he shall say. Wend ye he^s fro me down into hell
peyn. With outen end. Of this bow the prophet says Arcum suu^ tetendit and
parauit illu^. God has bent his bow / and made it redye / and he has arrayed
or made ready therein tacle of death. and has maade his arowes hot with
brennynge things For they that been burnt with sin shall brenne with the fire
of hell withouten end. Of this bow david also says Dedisti metue^tibus te
significatione^: vt fugiant a facie arcus. Lord thou have yeuen a tokenynge to
them that dread the / to fle away from the face of the bow.

The xvi. chapter.
Dives. What tokenes ben tho


Pauper. There is dome in special / and dome in general. yt shall be in the
last day of this world Dome in special. each man has anon as he dies And
therefore crist says. Nunc iudiciu^ est mundi. Now is dome of the world / for
anon as thou art deed / thou shall be demyd either to heuene or to hell / or
to purgatory. Of this dome spekith Solomon. Memor esto iudicii mei Have mind
of my dome / for such shall be thy dome / yisterday it fell to me / to morrow
it shall fall to the Before this dome goo many tokenes of warning to synful
wretches / as age / seknesse / feblenesse / dasewyng of sight / blindness /
deefnesse / rymplynge or ryuelyng of skin / fading of color / failyng of
mind / loss of catel / of fre^des by death and other


Dives. When shall that day of general dome fall


Pauper. as Criste says in the gospel there is none aungel / ne saint in heuene
that wot when it shall fall But suddenly and unwarily it shall fall / and come
as a theif / and as death does to many a man yt wole not be ware by tokenes
before. No more shall men thanne blent with sin be ware of the last dome ne of
the first. that shall be death no more thanne the men would beware by the prechinge
of Noe to fle the flode that drenchid al save viii. souls.


Dives. Sithen each man and woman is demyd anon as he is deed / whereof shall
serve the general doom.


Pauper. That al men hethen and christian may se the rightfulle dome of god / not
only in them self but in all other / that hethe^ me^ may se and know their
false bileue for which they been dampnyd And christian men se and know their
unkindness / and how rightfully they and all other be dampened that die in
dedly sin


The xvii chapter.
Man's dome is perverted by iiii. things as says the law xi. q^. iiii.
Quatuor. by dread by couetise of yiftes / by hate / by low But crist he is
almighty / he dredith no man He is lord of al he nedith no mede ne yiftes He
hatith no good man ne woman. and therefore he shall dampne no good man ne good
woman He loves al manner right / and therefore he shall do no wrong. He knowith
al / and therefore there shall no falls witness ne slight of me^ of law disceyue
him. Every man shall be there a true witness of his own dome / for his own
conscience shall save him or dampne hi^ And therefore leave freende be ye a true
witness of your self in this world to save your self here in time of grace /
and thanne shall ye be a true witness to your self. to save your self. in
time of the dome. False witnesses in this world haste their rightful doom of
dampnacioun in the other world. For they been false witnesses to them self /
and to the other also. As says saint John with the gilden mouth. super
Matheum opere imperfecto Omelia vi. There is no man able to be a true witness
to a another man but he be first a true witness. to him self in his own dome.

At the doom god shall axe of us reknynge and aunswerynge / of the benefices.
that we have taken of him / he shall axe them again / in nombre in weight and
measure. He shall axe of us how often we have resceiued of his yiftes. how
much we have resceyued and how we have spent them And the lettres and the
tails of our conscience. shall aunswer^ and say that we have resceyued goods
of kind / that is to say of body and of soul / Alsoo gods of fortune that been temporal gods and temporal richesses and gods of grace that been virtues
and cu^nynge. Thanne the sovereign judge shall axe of us answer of his
benefices in the plurel nombre saying. Esur^^^ etc. I had hungre and ye yaue
me no mete I had thriste and ye yaue me no drynk I was nakyd and ye clothed
me not. I sought my herborowe and ye resceyued me not. I was seek and i^
prisone / and ye visited me not ne comforted me not And sithen the dome shall be
so hard to them yat help not their even christian with their good at need /
much moore streit it shall be to them that rob their even christian / as to
theuys pilours extorcioners and ma^quellers lechoures and to al wicked doers
Thanne men shall give answer of every ydel word yt they speak / as crist
says in the gospel And as saint Bernarde says the rich man shall give
answer of every threde in his clothe / of every cru^me of bread i^ his bread
skep of every drop of drink of his barel and in his tu^ne and in his vessel
Also Criste shall axe rekni^g by hole mesure. For as Criste says in the
gospel. men shall ther^ reken and yield to the lest ferthi^g withouten
foryeuenesse And such measure as men mete here to other shall be moten again to
them mercy for mercy / hard for hard Also god shall thanne axe of us. reknyng
in weight of strayt doom for all our deeds shall there be weyed by the dome of
god and of onre own conscience / and after that they wey they shall be rewardyd
/ the good in bliss the wicked in pain Thanne the hand of god shall write in
the conscience. of every man and woman that shall be dampnyd these three words.
Mane techel phares. Which iii. words he wrote on the the wall of the kings
hall Balthazar. to his dampnacion Danielis vo.c. which vision apperyd to the
king in time of the great feast that he made in dispyte of god / and made men
drink in the vessels of gods temple / which vessels were hallowed to
god. For Mane is to say in englisshe. God has nombred thy kingdom and days
of thy reign and made an e^de thereof. Techel. is to say / thou art weyed in a
balaunce / and thou weyest to little. Phares. is to say thy kingdom is departed
from the For after the dome the synful man may no le^ger look after the
kingdom of heuene which was ordained to him if he would have deseruyd it But
thanne he shall be departed fro that kingdom yat he has lost by his folly. and
go to prison of hell withouten end which he has deseruyd For tha^ Criste
shall say to every man and woman Toll quod tuu^ est et vade. Take that is
thine. and that thou haste deserved and goo thy wey / to heuene if thou have do
well / or to hell if thou have do amys and not amendyd the. Thanne al wicked
christian men shall be demed and dampnyd / but hethen men shall be dampened and not
demyd For as Criste says in the gospel He that bileueth natt in Criste now /
he is demyd Su^me shall be demyd and sauyde / as good christian men common lyuers.
And su^me shall be saved and not demyd / as men of perfection / For they shall
deem other as crist saiy in the gospel Dos qui reliquistis omnia. etc. ye that
have forsaken al worldly gods for my sake / and followed me in poverty and in
perfection / ye shall sytt on xii. sety^ demyng the xii. kynredes of israel.
that is to say / all that shall be demyd.

The xviii. chapter.
Dives. It is dredeful thing to think on this dome.


Pauper. It shall be more dredeful to here it and to se it / and most for to
feel it. and namely to rich folk that have resceyued many gods of god and
not spendyd them ne dispensed them to his worship And saint gregory in his
omelye says / the more the yiftes of god come to a man / the more wexe
reknynges and answer of the yiftes. Therefore seint James spekithe to you
rich men in this manner Agite nunc diuites etc. Now ye rich men do ye so that
ye may save your self / weep ye and wayle ye for your myscheuys that shall
fall to you but ye amend you. your richesses ben roten / your clothes be
mothe eten / your gold and silver is rustyd and the ruste thereof shall be
witness against you at the dome. and ete your flesh. as fire. For ye kept
your good so hard from the pore folk / therefore ye have tresourid wrath and
wreche to you in the last days. Iacobi v.


Dives. Well is him. that is well deed


Pauper. And well is him that well lives For as seint Austyn says He that
lives well may not evil die Therefore as I said first Deem well to thy self /
and of thy self For as Solomon says The true witness delivers souls of woe
both i^ his own and in many other Prouerbi. xiiii. And as the prophet says
Seek ye up our lord god with alms deed. While he may be found. clepe ye
him while he is nigh. Now he is high now he clepith us to his mercy Now he
may be found benign and bonour to all. But after the dome and after our
death / he shall be fell and fires to us. but we amend us. Thanne shall we find
no mercy but that we deserve by our life And therefore leave friend do ye as
seint Poule says Dum te^pus habemus operemur bonum. ad omnes. While we have
time worche we good to al. And the wise man says what good thine hand may do
/ do it besily while thou might / For there shall be no worching reason ne
cu^nynge / ne wisdom. after thy death to win the mede Ecclesiasttes ix.
Therefore Crist says in the gospel that there shall cu^me a night when no man
shall worche to win hi^ mede The day is our life / the night is our death. for
be we deed we may no more worche to win mede. ne to amend us.


Here endith the viii. precepte. And begins the nynthe.
Dives. God send us grace to do as thou say. I thank the for this
informacion / for I hope it shall do profyt Now I pray the that thou wylt
enfourmme in the ix. commandment


Pauper. The nynthe precepte is this Non concupisces domu^ proximi tui. Exodi.
xx. Thou shalt not coueite thy nighboures good with wrong / house ne land In
the viii. precepts before god forbedith all wicked works. In these ii. last
he forbedith al wicked wylles and consent to sin For of wicked will cu^meth
yuel deed And therefore Criste says in the gospel / that out of the heart.
comes al manner sin. for with outen will and asse^t of the heart is no sin
done. De cord exiunt cogitaciones male / homicidia adulteria fornicationes /
furta falsa testimonia / blasphemy. Mt. xv. Therefore seint Poule. says that
couetise is rote of all evil. And therefore god forbedith al wicked couetise.
both of the world and of the flesh Couetise of the world is clepyd
couetise of the iye. i^ other me^nes good Couetise of the flesh is clepyde
will to lechery and to glutony. And right as a wicked wede is clean clensyd
out of a lord wha^ the rote is drawn away / and til when ne the rote is
drawn up / the land is not clean clensyd ne well wedyd / and bodily seknes is
not well cured ne helyd till the root of the seknes be thus distroyed Right so
mannys soul and woman's may not be clean cle^syd of sin. ne gods law may
natt be kept / til couetise of the heart which is rote of al manner sin and
of all gostly sickness be drawn out of the land of man's heart / and
distroyed. And therefore when god had youen viii. p^ceptes by which men
should flee al wicked works / he put thereto other ii. precepts against false
couetise / bydding that men should put wicked couetise out of heart For false
couetise is principal. letter of keeping of gods law and rote of al
wickedness Therefore in this commandment god forbedith principaly false
worldly couetise. and specially of things not mouable by the^ self wha^ he
byddeth that thou shall not coueyte thy nighboures good with wrong house ne
land. In the seuynth p^cept god forbedeth the deed of al wro^gful taking wha^
he bids the not stele In this heest he forbedeth al manner wro^geful desire
and mys couetise of any mannys good / of house / of land / of gold / of
silver / of cloth of corn and of all such other things that may not stire
themself.

This precept is principaly aye^s false purchasoures / that for false couetise
ben besy to begyle. and with falshed to rob men of house / and of land and
put them out of their heritage. To such false purchasoures god yeuethe his
curse and says thus. Ve qui cogitatis i^utile et operamini malum in cubilibus
vestris. etc. Woo be to you that think unprofitable thing / and worche wicked
thing in your beds i^ the morrow when ye may not sleep For tha^ne they
cast gyle and falshede against their euencristen. They have couetyd other
mennys feeldes says he / and by mit take them away from them / and rob them
of their houses / and falsely challenge the man and his house and his heritage For
often they challenge men for bond / and so enter into their house and land. and
have all their heritage with gods curse. Michee. ii. Also god yeueth them
his curse by the prophet ysaie there he says thus Ve qui coniungitis domum
domui. et agrum agro copulatis etc

Woe be to you that falsely join house to house / and couple field to field / to
the end of the place yt ye may say / all this is mine and no man has ought
within me.

Wene ye says god that ye alone shall duelle upon earth. This false couetise
says he sowneth in mine erys And therefore many a fair house and great shall be
forsaken / and no man ne woman duelle therein. ysa. v. And thus the wise man
says Non at tingas terminos paruulorum etc Touch not the bounds of the small
pore folk. to reave them of their right. and enter thou not in to the feelde of
faderles children. to put them out of their heritage For almighty god that
is there nigh friend shall make their cause full greuouse and full hard against the
Prouer. xxiii.


The ii. chapter.
WE find in holy writ the third book of kings xxi.c. That there was a king
of israel that hight Achab / and there was a man duellyng by him that hit naboth
that had a fair vyneyerd that lay nigh the kings paleis / and therefore the
king desired greatly to have it / and said to naboth. give me thy vyneyerde.
and I shall give the a better there. fore. or else asmoche money as it is worth
Tha^ne naboth said god forbede that I should change my faders heritage. I
wole neuir change it ne selle it. Tha^ne the king was wroth and for malancoly
leyde him on his bed. and would not ete ne drink. The queen Iesabel his wife
come to him and axed what him ayled The king said that he had spoken to naboth
to have his vyneyerde / and he would not grant it him Thanne Iesabel the
queen said Be of good confort and take me thy ring and I shall give to the.
the vyneyerde Tha^ne she wrote lettres i^ the kings name to the principalis of
the city under the kings signet. And badde them gadre their court to gidder
and make a solemn fasting so to blind the people with ypocrisie and bad them
ordeyne. two false witnesses / which should accuse naboth. and say yt he spak
evil of god and of the king and so dampne him as gilty and stone him to the
death and so they did For it was the law that who so spoke evil of god or of
the king or cursyd them he should be slain when Iesabel had tidinges yt
naboth was slain / she came to the king and badde him rise up and be merry and
take the vynyerd to him for naboth was deed And anon the king rose and went
into the vyneyerde and took it to hi^ Tha^ at the bydding of god Ely the
prophet met with him and said to him in gods name Thou have slain and thou
have that thou couetist. But I tell the it forsothe in the same place there the
hounds have lykked up the blood of Nabothe / hou^des shall lycke up thy blood /
and hounds shall ete thy wife Iesabel. and hounds and briddes shall ete thy
body / and god shall distroye thine householde. and sle al thy kynred / and
thine alyaunce / and sone after it fell so And thus of false couetise / came
perjury / false witness. murdre / and manslaughter and distruccione. of the
kingdom. we read also in the passion of seint Beatrice that there was a false
couetouse man whose name was Lucres. And he coueytid much the place of saint
Beatrice And for couetice to have ye place he accused her to an hethen judge.
that she was a christian woman And so by his accusacion she was slain. For she
would not forsake Cristene Cristes law. When she was thus deed / Lucres
entryd into her place to have it in possession And for joy of the place he
made therein. a great feast to his friends And when he was most merry and
iocu^de in the mids of the feast a young soukyng child that was there in his
moders arm said al alowde that al men might here it Audi lucreci. Here now
Lucres Thou have slain / and thou haste entryd falsely into this place and
haste it at thy will. But now thou art youen into the might and into
possession of thy most enemy And anon in time of the feast before al his
friends and his gestes / the feende entryd within him / and iii. ours to
gidre so for trauelyd him and so rent him before them al til he slew him and
for his false couetise bare his soul to hell Here thou might se what perel is
to purchase any thing amys by false couetise And therefore if thou have
purchased any thing falsely / or if thou occupye any thing mys purchased look
yt thou make restitucion for salvation of thy self / and of thine heirs For it
is a comen proverb De male q^sitis vix gaudet tercius here is Of evil gote^ good
ye third heir uneath has joy.

The iii. chapter.
Dives. If I had ought purchaced a mys my self. I hold me bounden to
restitucion / but of my former faders purchase have I naught to do whether it
were rightful or not rightfulle. Butt that they left to me I will keep it as
the good man Naboth did of whom thou spakfull ate


Pauper. Naboth would have kept stylle his fader heritage that longyd to him by
right / and by descent of heritage. But if thou keep any thing wyttingly that
thy former faders purchasid falsely. in that thou kepist not thy faders heritage
as naboth did. but thou kepist other mennys heritage to which neither thou ne
thy fader had right And therefore but thou make restituco^n thou shall rewe it
and al thine heirs. as Achab did and his heirs. Which lost not only that
they had mysgoten of naboth by murdre. and by gyfe / but ther^o they lost.
their lif / their worship and their heritage for euir. I read that there was a
great man which did much alms / and for his alms. god would have him
saved It by fell in an evening he romyd alone under his wode side by his place.
there came an aungel in a man's lyknes and bad him go with him Suddenly they were
to gidre i^ a deep valeye / and in the mids of the valey was a deep pytt full
of fire smoderinge medlyd with pitche and brymstone. full foul sti^kynge.
Thanne the aungel bad this man look into this pytt. He lokyd down / and there
he saw three galowes stonding in the fire On the ferthest henge a man by the
tunge. on the secounde henge a man by the hondes / but on the thridde henge no
man. Thanne the aungel axed him what he saw. and he told him all the soth.
Thanne said the aungel. He yt hangith by the tu^ge is thy faders fader / which
purchased the place that thou duellyst in / by gyle of his tunge / by false
oaths / by leesynges / by perjury / by false witnesses / and did many me^
forswere them / and therefore is he principaly punysshed in his tu^ge / and
haungith by his tunge in this orrible fire and shall do withouten end for he
would not make restitucion. He that hangith on the secounde galowes by the
hondis is thy fader which kept stylle by mighty hond that his fader
myspurchased / and would not make restitucion The thridde galowes in which
hangithe no man been ordained for the but if thou amend the and make
restitucion Anon the aungel passyd aweye from him. and he was delivered again
under his wood side.

The next day after he sent after the heirs of the plaace and made
restitucion. His wife and his children were fulle sorry. and said unto him.
Allas allas now been we all beggars. Thanne he aunswerid and said Lever I
have that we beg in this world / thanne to bring you al and me into that
endelesse pain tha I saw And better it is to us for to lose a place in earth
to which we have no right / thanne to lose our place in heuene bl^sse wtouten
end.


Dives I assent well to thy spech / say forth what thou wylt.


The iiii. chapter.
PAuper. Many hard vengeaunces have fallen for false couetise Giezi was smyten
with foul miselrie For couetise made him to sell the health of Naman / which
health came only by the grace of god. iiiio.. v. c. For couetise judas sold
Christ. gods son for thritty penys. and betrayed him / and after he went
and henge him self till his belly brast And there his belly braste / and there the
devil that was in him flewe out and bare his soul with him to hell.


Dives. Why went natt the feende out at his mouth.


Pauper. For his mouth had touchyd cristes mouth / when he kyssed crist in
gile and said. Hayle master.


Dives. Thy skyl is good say forth what thou will.


Pauper. Also for couetise an any and saphira his wif died sodeyn death and
dispitouse bethe for they lied to the holy* ghost. and forsook their money to
seint Petyr For couetise Nachor was stoned to the death / for he stale gold and
clothe against gods forbode Iosue vii. We find in the life of seint Barlaam
yat on a time an archer took a nightyngale and would have slain it God yaue
speech to the nightyngale. Which said to the archer / what shall it proufyt to
the to slay me. Thou may not fylle thy womb with me I am so little Save my
law and let me fle and I shall teache the three wysdomes which if thou keep
well they shall do ye much proufyt. Thanne the archer was a woundryd of her
speech and hight her sykerly that he let her fle. if she taught him the
wysdomes. Thanne she said besye the not to take thing yt thou might not take.
For thing that is looste and may not be recured ne gotten again make no sorrow.
Thing that is not semely to be sothe / leave it not The archer let the
nightyngale fle. When the nightyngale was up in the air. she said to the
archer a feeble cou^seyl have thou take For thou have lost a great treasoure For
I have a margery stone in my womb more thanne an ostriches ey. Tha^ne the
archer was sorry and prayed the nightyngale come again to him and hight her well
Tha^ said the nightyngale. Now I wot well thou art a fool / and al my lore
profits the not For thou make much sorrow. for thou have lost me. and yet
thou might not get me again Thou trauaylist to take me. and thou might not
take me / ne pass the weye yt I pass by And ouir that thou leuyst that I
had such a preciouse stone in my body asmoche. as an ostriches ey. and al my
body is not half so much.


Dives. What is this to purpose.


Pauper. By this nightyngale yt syngethe so swetly / I understand Criste.
gods son that song to mankind so^ges of endless love. And a nightyngale is
in latyne philomena. yt is to say in englisshe. a sweet lover / as says
Catholicon And a sweter lover tha^ne Christ was there neuir none He taught to
us many wysdomes / in which he taught us these iii. First. he badde that thou
should natt be besy to take thing yt thou might not take. When he bad the
not stele / ne coueyte thy neighbors good with wrong. For as the law says.
Hoc solum possumus. quod de iure possumus. Only we may do that we may do
laufully And therefore if thou traueil to get thing unlawfully yt thou might
not have by the law / be it house or land worship or dignytie / thanne thou
besiest the to get a thing that thou might not take. And therefore the
wiseman says Noli laborare vt diteris etc. Travail thou not to much to be
rich. But put measure and manner to thy wysdoome / and to thy slight / that
though thou myghtest get a thing by sleight or by soteltie / always take heed
to the right and to the law. Ne erigas oclo^s tuos ad opes quas habere no^
poteris. s. de iure etc. Lift not up thyn iye says Solomon to richesses that
thou might natt have rightfully. For they shall make them wings as of an egle
and fle into heuene / that is to sey they shall fle away from the / and accuse
the before god of thy false head / and of thy couetise Prouer xxiii. Also
couetouse folk do a yenst the secou^de lesson that this nightingale crist
ihu^s taught v^ to keep. For wha^ they lose thing by myshappe or by aduersite /
or by death of wif or children they make so much sorrow. yt they renye god / and
fall in full hard sekenes both of soul and of body. But david the king
keeping this wisdom did natt so but while his son ^ay seek. as long as he
was of hope to have his life: so long he wept and fasted. and prayde for his
life to god. But when the child was deed / ano^ he sesed of his weeping and
ete and drank and made merry: For he wist well that he might not get him
again.iio. xiio.co. Also couetise makes men to leeue thing that is not semely
to be soth / and to believe many strong lesynges For thing that is much
desired is sone leued. as says the master of stories / And for as much as
couetouse folk desiren to have much thing that they have no right to /
therefore they bileue many false tales. and assenten to falsehede / For the
couetise and the talse accorden sone to gedre / For if a false man come and
tell the couetise man a falls tale of winning. or tells him that he has
right to a thing: he leuethe him sone be it never so false. But therefore this
nightyngale blessid Jesus said Qui cito credit leuis est cord etc. He that
sone bileueth is light of heart and fulle chaungeable. fro virtue to vice. from
treuth to falsnesse from charity to couetise. Et minorabitur And he that sone
bileueth shall be lessed in worship and lityl set by For sone leui^g of lesi^ges
bri^geth people to much folly / This makes men to bigynne pleyes and briges
and one neighbore to hate a another. the husbonde to hate his wife. the wife her
husbonde. the fader his son. the son his fader. the mother her daughter. the
brother his suster. this has brought england in bitter balis Therefore the wise
man says / Non omni verbo credas / Bileue not every word Eccle. xiiiio. He yt
leueth sone lesynges. his word and his love and his feith wawen about as the
wind / Therefore the great clerk Seneca says in his epistle. that no wise man
bileueth any new tales lightly.


The v. chapter.
ALso we read in holy wrytt numeri xxii. That Balaa^ the false prophet would
have cursed gods people for couetise of the yiftis which Balaac king of moab
proffered him. natwitstondyng that god forbad it him and bad him not come there.
Wherefore as he rode to the king balac. his ass that he roode on vndername him
and hurt his foot aye^s awal For the ass saw an au^gel stondinge with a swerd
drawn aye^s him in the weye. and therefore the ass fled out of ye wey i^to ye
feld Balaa^ was wroth and smoote his ass full hard with a stafe: for he bare
him so out of the weye And the as ca^ in a strait wey between two wallys. and
there he saw also the aungel ayens him And for dread he fled a side and bare
Balaam ayens ye wall and hurt his foot ayens the wall Tha^ne balaam bette
eftsoon full evil Sone after the aungel stood ayens him in so strayte weye.
that the ass might not flee on any side. butt fell down and would no ferther
thanne efte he smote the ass / God openid the assis mouth and he said to
balaam. What have I do ayens the. Why byteste thou me now the third time / I
have alwey be thy be* and thou have alwey reden on me. and I served the
never thus till now / Tha^ne god opened the iyen of balaam. and he saw the
aungel stondynge ayens him with a naked sword which repreued him of his false
couetyse and of his wicked purpos. and for that he beat his ass without gilte
and said. yt butt the ass had goon out of the wey he should else have
slain him for his wey was ayens the plesaunce of god:

Dives. What bitokeneth this tale


Pauper. Balaam is to say in englisshe a deuourer of the people and sturbloure
of the folk Iterp^tatur deuorans pplm^ et turbans gentem And therefore balaam
bitokeneth false couetise of this world which deuoureth the pore people and
stourbelith every nation / For nigh all the debate in this world is for mine
and thyn: And therefore said a philosofre. Toll duo verba meum et tuum. et
totus mundus erit in pace / Put out of this world two wordys mine and thyn.
and all the world shall be in pees. Balaam first in his prophecy worshipped
gods people and prophicied to the^ much prosperity as he was compelled by
the might of god to say But at the last with his sherewed counceile that he
yaue to balaac to have his yiftis. he / disseyued gods people and brought
th^e^ to lechery and to ydolatrie. and so to offend god wherefore four and
twenty thousand of gods people were slain. and all the princes of the people
were hangid upon gebettes ayens the sonne^ at the biddynge of god Right so
couetyse of this world first puts men in hope of great prosperitye. and
hoteth them welthe and worship / See says couetise. such a clerk is there
that may spe^nde so much by year / and yet he was but a pore mannys son as
thou art / be of good heart / for such as he is thou might be. And so
couetise puttith example of knights / of merchants / of p^lates of lords
and of ladies If thou have richesse says couetise. thou may do much alms
and have many prestis to pray for ye out of purgatory But be ware for by
such bihestes the feende and worldly couetise been a boute to disceyue the and
to bring the in glotonye and lechery / and ydolatrie / as balaam brought
gods people to shenship He wole make the more to trust in thy good tha^ in thy
god For what thing that man or woman loves most and settith his heart most
therein / that is his god / as says seint Ierom. Therefore seint poule says /
that avarice is seruage of mawmetry For gold is god to the couetouse man / to
whom he does most worship / which false god is betoknyd by the image of
gold. yt was lx. cubits in hight and vi. in bread which the king
Nabugodonosor raised up in the feeld. of Durain. and co^pellyd al men to
worship it And who so would not worship it / he did put them in an oven full of
fire / in token. that who so worshipeth not i^ this world the false god of
gold and of false couetise / and yeueth no tale of this world and wole not
obey to false couetise to serve it with gile falshede and perjury but live in
treuth and in charity / yat man shall have much woo i^ this world And therefore
seint poule says yt they that wole live mekely and goodly in Criste shall
suffer much tribulacion i^ this world Therefore seint Gregory says. This
world is a furneys and a oven to try in gods children. by anguysshe and
tribulacion. Be ware of the bihestes of couetise For fair bihestes make sottes
blithe. He wole so entryk the in dett and in sin / that it shall be full hard
to the for to escape. and so to bring the to die in dedly sin And if thou
dye in dedly sin / all the gold under the cope of heuene though it were thine
/ ne all the prestes under son may not help the. Therefore sei^t poule Qui
volunt diuites fieri i^cidunt in temptationes et in laq^um diaboli. etc. They
that coueyte to be rich i^ this world fall into hard temptacions and into the
feendes snare. and into wicked desires and vnproufitable. and fulle noyous /
which drench men into the death of hell and bring them to perdicion For why
says he / Root of all evil is couetise Prima ad Thy. vi.


The vi. chapter.
Dives. I wene that all me^ might be helped with her. richesses after her death.


Pauper. It is not so But only they shall be helped with their good. after
their death / that deseruyd by there life to be helped with their richesses after
their death. as they that do alms after their staate / and spend well the
good. that god has sentte to them / and pay well their dettes / and do
such other good dedys / and keep them from dedely sin to their lives end or
namely thanne. Thus says saint Austyne In glosa prima ad thessalo. quarto
super illud. Nolumus vos ignorare de dormientibus And therefore be ware and take heed to three warnyngis and tokenes that god yaue to balaam to flee the sword
First his ass went out of his way. After that he hurt his foot and
diseasyd al his body At the last he fell down under him and would no ferther
bear him. By the ass I understand wealth of this world that stondith
principaly in richesses and in bodily health / which berith a man up in this
world as the ass bare balaam. Butt beware. for right as the ass is a full
dulle be / and when a man has most need and most have in his journey /
tha^ne he wol not go but at his own lust / and so disceyueth his master Right
so worldly welthe disceyueth them that trust therein / and fails the^ at
need. This ass of worldly wealth first gothe out of the wey that is wha^ne
god sendith a man aduersite / and his causes and his traueil goth not forth as
he would ne as he wend they should do. but when he wenyth to win. he leesith
/ and spedith natt as he wend to speed. And there he wenyth to find friends /
he fyndeth enemies. And in case if he wole pass the sea / the wind is against
him / and dryueth him out of his weye. And if he plete / su^me slit puts him
out of his purpose. and yt he wend to speed in a month he shall not speed it
in a year. and parauentur neuir bring his cause into the right wey there he
would have it. When this ass gothe out of the way. take heed to thy way
and to thy purpose / and if thy way and purpos be against the plesaunce of god /
as was the way of Balaam tha^ne wend again and cese of thyn evil purpose. And
if it be not aye^s the plesaunce of god / dispose the to patience and thank god
of al. and take heed what the angel said to Balaam. Butt the ass said he.
had gone out of the way I had slain the For but welthe of the world
went sumtyme out of the way by aduersite and by sickness / else it should
be cause to much folk. of death. both bodily and gostly

For if man had always his welthe and his will in this world he should give no
tale of god / ne of man. The secounde tooken was that he hurt his foot. and
so diseased his body / thatt is when god sendith man sickness and castith
him down i^ his bed / and makes him so feeble. that his feet may not bear
him. tha^ne take thou head to thy wey and to thy life. if it be ought contrary
to god / and if it be amend the. The thridde token was. that the ass fell down
under his feet in a streyt wey / and would no ferther bear him This streyt wey
and so narow a paas / is death where no man may flee Thanne wealth of this world
lykned to the ass. fallith down to ground and wole no le^ger here man up in
this world Thanne passith health and wealth and al lust of the flesh And
therefore when thou cu^myst to the point / take heed to thy wey and to thy
lif. And if it be contrary to god / amend the thanne for euir as thou will
fle gods sword Richesse and wealth of this world is lykned to a ioguloures
horse.

We find that on a time came a proud gettour into a stable and found a
mynstralles horse. stonding by his horse. And for it was better thanne his / he
took it and rode away thereon / and left his feeble horse there. The mynstral
perceived that / and ran by a nigh pathe. and met with hi^. in passing ouir
a water and cried. Flectamus ianua. The horse knew well his masters voice. as
he was wont to do in pley he did thanne / and knelyd down i^ the water.
Thanne the mynstral said. Leuate. And anon the horse rose up as he was
taught and kest the proud iettor in the water / and ran again to his master.
This mynstral is the world which pleyeth with folk of this world as a
mynstralle / as a iogulour and as a disour His horse is richesses of this world
/ which often at the voice of this world plays Flectamus genua. and brings
them low and to great pouert and forsakes them in their most need / and
follows the play of this world and not the will of coueitouse folk that would
have them / but full often they that traueyle most to be rich / been most
pore And namely evil gotten good sone pleyeth Flectamus genua. With them that
have mysgoten them by myspurchace / or by witholdyng of dett / or by falls
executorie or by mycherie or robberye Therefore it is a comen proverb. De male
quesitis vix gaudet tercius here is. Of evil gotten good uneath ioyeth the third
heir


The vii. chapter
Dives. Thy speech is not plesaunte to worldly couetouse men / and yet
experience shewith that thou saiste sothe.


Pauper. It farith by many folk as it does by many sheep. For many sheep be
not paid to go with their felawes in come^ pasture / but seek their mete
among busshes thorns and brymbles. to have the better bytte / till they ben
so wysked and snarled among brembles and thorns that they may not go away.
Thanne cu^meth the pie or the rauene and piketh out the one iye. and
afterward the other iye. Thanne cu^meth the wolf or an hou^de or su^me other
be and sleeth him Right so it is of covetous folk For they wole not live in
plain pasture. among their neighbors / ne be not paid with comen lyui^ge
that god has sent to them but outrage and seek to be in higher degree of
richesses and of worship thanne their neighbors ben. and seek their living
among brimbles and thorns / that is to say among false richesses / as
says Christ i^ the gospel. They borowe of one x.li. of a another.xx.li. and so
forth ^ and thynk neuir to pay and thus they get much good and live a merry
life with other mennys good Also they bicome executours and attourneys to su^me
rich man in his diyng. and hot him well to be true to him But when he is deed
they keep al to the^self and thus they snarle the^self so i^ dett and in false
richesses to be holde^ great in this world / that they may not pay there
dettes Tha^ cu^meth the feend and pyketh out there right iye and makes them
lose to^science. ane^tis god After he pyketh out their left iye. and makes
them lose shame anentis the world So yt neither for dred of god / ne for shame
ne for spech of the world / they cese not to borowe ne to get falsely other
mennys good / and so fall depper and depper in dett / till at the last the
feend sleeth them body / and soul And therefore look yt thou pay well thy
dettes. While thou may / for else thou shall not wha^ thou would For a sheep
yt gothe much among thorns leeuyth su^me of his flece in every busshe. there
he gothe. till he is naked Right so the thorns of falls richesses. and such
dettes shall take thy flece fro the / yt is to say / thy true catel if thou any
have / so yt thou shall have right naught to help with thy self ^ till wha^
thou shall go nakyd of good / and have less than naught Therefore says a great
clerk Tulius.li.ii. de officiis. that no thing saves more a comyntie than
faith. But feythe may not be says he but men wol pay their dettes. And in the
third book. de officiis. he says / yt it is a sin against kind to tak awey
falsely a another man's good / and to make him rich with a another mannys loss
For yt says he / distroyeth charity and the felauship of mankind For men
dare not comyne their good to gidre by lenyng / for dread of false couetise.


Dives. That is soth For I had leuyr have my good in other mennys hondes thanne
in mine / if I wyste that they would truly pay it again But I find so many falls
and so few true / yt I dare not lene but to fulle few Say forth what thou
wylt.


The viii. chapter.
PAuper. Two things principaly should abate couetise of mannys heart.
Unstableness of this world and dread of death. First unstableness of this
world / for this world. and the wealth of this world is lykned to four
things full unstable To a whele about turnyng / to a ship in the se sailyng /
to a flower that sone fadith and fallith to ground. and to a shadow that always
passith and duellith but a stounde First wealth of this world is lykned to a
whele about turnynge. for when the whele gothe about that / yt is byneth.
anon it is above. and that yt is above. anon it is byneth. And that yt is on
the one side anon it is on the other side Right so it is in the whele of fortune
of this world. For now a man is byneth in his youth and in his beginning In
myddel age he is above in his welthe and in his flowers / But anon the whele
turns down again to greter age to pouert / to seknesse and feebleness. till at
the last he fallith of ye whele / and dies / and lies there as a clott of
earth by the wall. Tferfore in the whele of fortune is written this verse.
Regnabo regno. regnaui. su^ sine regno. Man in his youth when he is toward
in hope of welthe. he says Regnabo. I shall reign. But when he is in his
myddyl age and has the world at will and so sytteth above on the whele. than
he says i^ his pride. Regno. Now I regne. I am all above But anon the whele
turns dou^warde anon cu^meth age sickness / feblenesse / loss of catel and
aduersite ^ than he may say Regnaui. I have reigned. su^tyme I was a man But
when he lies on diynge he may say Sum sine regno. I am without kingdom. My
reign my kingdom. my wealth is done. Also in the whele of fortune / that is i^
the one side / anon it is in the other side For they that been this day a
man's friends and stand on his side to help him / the next day they shall be
his enemies and sto^de against him with his adversary Of this whele speaks
David. In circuitu impii ambula^t. Wicked couetouse folk goo about as a
whele. Posuisti eos vt rota^. et sicut stipulam ante facie^ ve^ti. Lord says
he thou have put the^ as a whele / and a stoble bifor^ the face of the wind
For as the stoble while the wind blows wauereth and flees above in their.
now high. now low / but anon as the wind passith it fallith a down to the
earth and lies there stylle. Right so the proud covetous folk wauere in this
world in welthe and worship / now higher / ne lower / And as the stoble and
the straw in his flighte kepith no certain way / so keep they no wey of
gods law / till at the last the wynd passith out. of their body and they
fall down into there grave / and many of the^ into the pytte of hell. Also this
world is lykned to a ship. in the sea saylyng For be the ship euir so great of
him self and have the wind with him al at will. and bear he his sail neuir
so high and go he neuir so yerne / be he passed there is no toke^ where he went
Right so be a man neuir so great in this world / and have the wi^d of mennys
mouth neuir so well with him to bear his name. to pryse him and to flatere him /
though his name spring neuir so wide and bear him neuir so high in pride / or
be he so sole^pne and so mighty. yt no man dare quycche against him ne do / be
he deed. and passed out of this world / sone he is for yetten. Men shall find
no toke^ of him within a few years / Uneaths shall he find one friend. that
wole do sing a mess for his soul. Go to the churchyerd and thou shall know
by the bodies. the rich from the pore / the fair. from the foul / the wise
from the foles / the free fro the bond. But at they turn there to earth and
asshe^ to worms mete / to stynche and uncleaness Al these great kings that
were su^tym so great of name where ben they al bicome. Alexander. Julius caesar
Nabugodonosor. Octouyan. Arthur^. king charles and al such other / where be
they bicome. Therefore they may say that is written in the book of wisdom Quid
nobis profuit superbia etc. What profited to us our great pride. What halpe us
our po^pe and our great richesses. All is passed away as a shadow / and as a
ship yt passith the wawes of the sea / of which be it passed me^ may find no
token Sap^. v. c. Man's life may well be lykened to a ship which is streyt and
narowe at both ends / but in the mids it is wide and large. Right so is
man's life / for his birth and his beginning is full strayt and full narowe. For
he cu^meth into this world naked and pore / weeping and walyng / vnmighty.
vnwytty / and noght may ne can help him self / and with much travail is
brought forth / til by litel and litel he cu^meth to man's age. There the ship
of his life is su^dele wide and large / for in his myddel age he has most his
miyht / his wit and his will. But anon the ship of this lif draws to
another strayte end. Anon cu^myth age / feblenesse seknes. aduersite / loss
of catel / and pouert / and at the last death makes a full strayte end /
wha^ne he dies with bitter pain i^ much dread. and much sorrow and wendith
hens nakyd and pore / right as he came / and naught berith with him but his deeds
good and wicked. Of these ii. streyte ends says Job thus.

Nudus egressus sum de vtero matris me: et nudus reuertar illuc. Nakyd I came
out of my moders womb / and nakyd I shall turn again into the earth mother of
all. And if a man wole stire well a ship or a boat / he may not sto^d in the
mids of the ship / ne i^ the former end. but he must sto^de i^ the last
end / and there he may stir^ the ship as he wole. Right so he yt wole styre
well the ship of his life in this world / he may not sto^de in the mids of
his ship / not set bis thought and his heart in welthe yt he has in his middel
age / ne he shall not stand in the former e^de not set his heart ne his
thought. in his birth ne in his begynni^ge to think much of his kynrede. ne
of alliance to stire him to pride. Butt he must sto^de in the last end of his
ship. and of his life and think on his death / and on last his end. And
how myscheuously / and how perilously. he shall wend hens / and how whedyr ne
when / wot he neuir. And in that manner he shall best stere the ship of
his life to the siker hauene of heuyn bliss Therefore the wyseman says Memorare
nouissima tua et in eternum non peccabis. Think in wardly of thy last things
and of thine end. and thou shall neuir do syn Ecclesiastes vii. In the
beginning of every deed / thynk on the end what end it may have and what may
fall thereof.


The ix. chapter.
ALso wealth of this world is lykned to a flower that sone fades and fallith to
ye ground For as the rose flower is fair to the sight / sweet in smellyng /
soft in handlynge / so welthe of this world is fair to the sight of man and
likynge in the having But right as the rose wexith always among the thorns /
and he that gadrith roses but he be more ware shall lightly hurt him and pryck
him. Right so wealth and richesses of this world wexith al among thorns of
hard travail of thought of business and of many perels. both bodily and
gostly For a man has much traueil in the gettyng / much dread i^ the keeping
/ much bitter sorrow in the lesyng. Dives diuicias no^ congregat absque
labor. Non tenet absque metu. nec deserit absque dolor. When a man has
trauayled all his life time to gadre good / and to have wealth and worship in
this world / it wole sone welke fade and fall away as the rose. Suddenly
cu^meth moreyn and his beestes dye / cu^meth aduersite and loss of catel. and
at last death takith away every deel And who so wole be besy to gadre the rose
of worldly wealth and of richesses / but he be right ware he shall hurt him
both bodily. and gostly And therefore seint Poule says that they that coueyte
to be rich in this world / they fall in the feendes snare and into full hard
temptacions For these skylles seint James says yt the rich man shall pass
away as the flower of the grass and of the hay For when the son shyneth hot
on the hey it welkith and dries and his flower fadith. and his beauty passithe
Right so says he the rich man welkith and fadith in his weyis that is to say
in his living Iacobi. i. Also worldly wealth is lykned to the shadow always
passing For all our living in this world is but a passing and a wantynge of
light of heuene bliss In the mids of the day when the son is highest /
thanne is the shadow shortest Right so when a man wenyth to be butt in the
mids of his life. and is highest in welthe. and in his pride / thanne is his
lif shortest / for thanne men dye sonest i^ their most prosperity And the
nigher even and the end of the day. the longer is a mannys shadow. Right so
these worldly covetous men the le^ger that they live and when they been at
their lives end / thanne they think most to live longer Thanne they purchase
/ than they house / than they begin to plete till their life pass. suddenly away
as the shadow at eue^ Therefore man's life is lykned to a slyder wey For when
a man gothe by a slyder wey / the more that he gasith about / and the ferther
that he looks fro him the sooner and the harder he shall fall But if he look
well to his feet. and to his way / he may keep him on lofte / and though he fall.
he shall take no great harm. Right so it farithe by the life of this world. It
is so slyder. that there might neuir man ne woman pass by this wey / but at
the last he slydethe into sickness and myscheif / and fell down and dyed. or
else shall come to the same end And common / ly when men look ferthest fro
them self and think to live lengest / and begin most to house. and to
purchase / and purpose many shrewyd turns / and to live most in wealth and in
delices tha^ne they dye sonest and pass away. suddenly / as a shadow at even.
Example Crist tellith in the gospel Luce. xii. There was says Criste sumtyme a
rich man and had in a year a plenteous crop. on his land. in somoche that
he had not houses ynowe to ley it in He tha^kyd not god of his yift butt
turnyd him to proud covetous thoughtis / and said to him self / what shall I
do I have no housyng to ley in my corn and my good I shall distroy mine old
bernys and garneris and make new longer and larger. and stuff the^ full of
good. and thanne shall I say to my soul. Now soul thou haste good enough
for many years / now take thy rest. Now ete and drink and make feast So he
thought al of his life in this world and naught of the life in the other world.
Anon god said to him. Fool this night fendes shall take thy soul from the
whose thanne shall be all the gods yt thou have arrayed and gadryd to gidder He
might say that they should be their / that traueyled not therefore.

The x. chapter
Clerks that trete of kind say that the fox in winter when he goth to seek
his pray if he cu^me to a frosen water / he lies his ere down to the ice /
and if he here any water rynnynge vndrenethe / he wole not pass ouyr ther^ /
for the ice is not syker But he sekith him a another siker way. Thus I would yt
al synful couetouse men did / when they goo about to seek their pray of false
couetyse / of falls purchase / or to rob and begyle any man of his good. Thanne I
would they leyd their erys to the ice and thought how freyle a man's life is
For as the ice cu^meth of the water and turns again to the water / right so
al we came of the earth. and shall turn again. to the earth / and if they
would thus ley their ere to this ice / they should here water re^nyng They should
here say / there dies a pope / there a king / there a prince. there a duyke.
there dyethe a busshoppe. there a knighte. there a squire. They should here
that as soon dies the rich / as the pore / the great as the small / the young
as the old. Therefore holy writ says. Ome^s morimur et in terra^ quasi aqua
dilabimur All we dye and slide into the earth as water ii. Regu^ xiiii.
Therefore seint Bernarde in his meditacion repreueth the proud couetouse folk of
this world and says thus. Vbi sunt amatores seculi. qui nobiscum a^te pauca
te^pora. fuerunt. Tell me now says he where ben now these lords and leders
/ these proud iettours and these false couetouse men yt were here with us
within a few years where be they now bicome There is no thing of them left but
asshe^ powder and worms Thake head what they were and what they been They were
me^ as thou art. ete and drank as thou doste / and led their days in much
mirth / and i^ tuynkling of an iye many of the^ sanke down into the pytt of
hell where their flesh is youen unto worms / and where their soul is put
i^to endless pain. What help them their vein glory / there po^pe / their
pride / their mirth / their gaame and glee. Where is now there game and their
laughing / their boost and their high berynge / al is past as a shadow From
great mirth they ben fallen into endeles sorrow / from lust and likyng they be
fall into bitr^ pain from plente into endless myscheif

Dives. These words stire me. and so they may many other / little to set by
welthe and worship of this world But well is he yt may have help of his good
after his death. and thanne find friends and true atturneys


Pauper. But much better he is yt has grace to help him self before his death.
With his own good For one penny shall profyt more before his death thanne tuenty
penys after. And more profits one candel before a man / than xx. behynd him
Therefore saint Lucye taught her mother to do alms by her life / and not abide
till after her death / and said to her mother Here ye my cou^seyl It is no yift
full plesau^t to god wha^ man or woman yeueth thing yt he may not use hi^self^
therefore if ye wole yt god be plesyd with your yift / give ye to him thing yt
ye may use your self For yt ye give i^ your diynge therefore ye give it. for ye
may not bear it with you And therefore mother while ye live and have health of your
body / give to god. that ye have.


The xi. chapter.
When a man wole natt do for him self while he may. though his executoures
and his attourneys do naught for him it is no great woundre For each man and
woman is most holden to him self But it farith often by hem that dye and by
their executoures / as it did onys by ii. fools. that duellyd in a lords
court. The oone was a fool sage / the other was a naturel fool. It bifel on a
day. they came to giddre into a bakehouse when folk were at the oven / and
the oven was glowi^g hot Thanne said the fool sage to the naturel fool.
Whether the ouene be now hot as it semyth wole we assaye said the other. yhe
said the fool sage / but which of us shall go into the ouene for to assaye Than
said the naturel fool. I shall go in / and thou shall have a bolle fulle of
water. and stand at the ouene mouth. And if I feel hete and I cry cast
cast. anon cast the water after me / and quench the fire about me It shall be
done said the other. fool. Thanne the fool naturel took the fool sage a
bolle fulle of water in his hand / and he went and crepte into the ouene. and
anon as he was in. he began to brenne. And anoone he cried cast cast. Wha^ne
the other sole saw his soly he laughed so enterely at his folly yt uneaths he
^^ght stand on his fete Tha^ne the fool in the oven cried cast man cast I
brenne to death Thanne the other fool answered. brenne if thou brenne will /
die if thou dye wylt / I laugh so that I may not cast. And so the fool brent
to death in the oven. By tho ii. foles I understand men yt dye and their false
executoures / for both been they fools. For the executours been great foles
in that / yt they bind them to hell pain. for their falshede Butt they that
dye been more foles / in that that they trust more to other men / tha^ to
themself. For when they shall crepe into purgatory. that is hoter thanne any
ouene. than they take to their executoures a bolle fulle of water in their hond
that is to say gold and silver / and other richesses / for to do alms for
them / and by almesdede. by messes syngyng and holy prayers refresshe them in
their peynes / and kele the fire about them But commonly when they have this
boll of water in their hand / and have the gods at their will / they laughe
so and make so merry and fare so well with the gods of the deed yt they may no
thing cast after them / for they be full loathe to for go any of the gods And
therwhiles the synful soul lies in purgatory. and suff^ith full much woe and
cries after help night and day saying in this manner. Miseremini mei
miseremin^ mei / salte^ vos amici mei. qr manus dn^i tetigit me Job. xix. Have
ye mercy on me have ye mercy on me / namely ye my fre^die ^ for the ho^de of
god full hard has touched me And wha^ they find no help of the^ yt should
help them they axe vengeance on them night and day. A great clecke turpinus
de gestis Karoli tellith / yt the king charles had with him a knighte in his
ooste. a man of good conscience / and wha^ he should die he clepyd to him his
neuewe praynge him that when he were deed he should sell his horse and his harneys
and do alms. and do sing thritty messes for his love. He behight him well
but lastyd him full evil / and kept it still to his own use. and did not as he
badde him do. When the thritty days were passed i^ the night following / the
knight apperyd i^ sleep to his neuewe and axed him why he had not don as he bad
him do. Than he excused hi^ by diverse besynesses yt he feyned not that he
had And he axed his eme how he faryde.

And than he answered and said I shall tell the how I fare / and how thou
shall fare. All these thritty days I have be in purgatory and suffered full
much woo. and pain for defaute of help But now thankyd be god I am passed
purgatory and go up to heuene bliss withouten end. But for thou would not
help me as I badde the / therefore er this day mydmorwe thou shall dye and goo
to hell withouten end. On the next day following as he rode in the ooste on
the same horse and told these dreemys to his felawes. as for a iape / at
mydmorowe came suddenly a blake sky with thundre and lightnyng and great no^bre
of feendis in lyknesse of rave nys and rokes and hent him up fro the horse in
the mids of the oost and flewe away with him / so yt they saw no more of him
till they came four days journey thens. among the mountes of nauer / ne
There they found him all to rent and drawn lith from lythe.

Butte his soul was drawn to hell. By his cote armure they knew well that
it was the same man.

Dives Be a man deed he fyndeth few friends.


The xii. chapter.
PAuper I read in vita Barlaam. yt there was a rich man which had iii. friends
The first friend and the secou^de he louyd with al his heart / but the third
friend he louyd little or naught This man fell in such a danger against his king
yt al his good was forfetted and eschetyd to the king / and himself wenyd to
have been slain Tha^ he went to his first friend yt he louyde so much prayng
him of help. and yt he would go to the king and speak for him and save his life
if he might Than he aunsweryd and said Fare well fast I know the not I have
other felawes and friends ynowe with whom I have my myrthes and solace.
Nathelesse if thou be slain I shall give the a shete to burye the in. Than he
went to the secounde friend yat he louyd so much prayng him also of help And
he excused him and said I pray the have me excuse^ for I am so besi yt I may
not ate^d to the But yet for old felauship I shall go with the on way to the
yate. Thanne went he to the thridde freende that he louyd so little. and prayed
him of help. and said. Leave friend I am ashamyd to speak to the for I have
been to the full unkind and litel love showed to the Butt I pray the have
reuthe on me. and for gods saake. help me in this need. And thanne. he
aunsweryd and said. Leave friend welcome be thou / and be of good comfort /
for I am thy friend and wole be thy freende / and to help the that I may do /
thou shall find me ready. And anon he went and did so and spoke to the king
that he sauyd his life. and delivered him out of al his danger.


Dives. So it fares these days as long as a man is in welthe / so long he
shall have fre^des ynowe to take of hi^ what they may and to flater him / and
to please him. But if he begin to go dou^warde / thanne fyndeth he few
friends and many enemies. Therefore says the wise man. Tempore felici multi
numerantur amici. Cum fortuna perit nullus amicus erit. In time of wealth a man
shall find fre^des ynowe But wha^ne richesses and hap is gone. he shall find
few friends and feel fone. Say forth thy tale


Pauper. By this rich man I understood every man yt has richesses and goods
of this world By his first friend yt he louyd so much / which yaue him but a
shete to be buriyed in / I understood the world / which worldly me^ love so
much / that for love thereof they travail night and day and put them in peril
of body and soul / and often lose them self both body and soul. And yet at the
last e^de uneaths yeueth it to them a shete to be buried in For many of them
when they die have less thanne naught And if they have ought yet their
excutoures wole say that they have naught / and yt they owe more than they
have By the secounde friend yt went with him to the yate I understood a mannys
wife / his children and his bodily friends And a woma^nes husbonde. her
children. and her bodily friends / which when they ben deed / shall go with
them on wey to the yate and bring the^ to their grave / and perauenture sto^de
and weep on them But be man. or woman deed and doluen under clay / he is sone
foryeten / and out of mind passed away Be the belles ru^ge and the mess
su^g he is sone foryeten. Uneaths shall he find oone freende that wole sing
for him one mess uneaths in the year. By the thridde friend which he loved
so little. and which halpe him at his need. I understand alms deed. Which
the worldely coueytouse men love fulle little. And yitt at the dredeful doom
when they shall stand at the bar before the sovereign judge. Crist ihesu
/ thanne alms deed shall be the best friend. that they shall have For that
shall speak for them and pray for hem and save hem if they shall be saved And
therefore solomon says Conclude elimo sinam in sinu pauperis / et ipsa pro te
exorabit ab omni malo Ecclesiastici. xxix. Therefore leave friend do ye as Tobye
taught his son. Ex substancia tua fac elimo sinam. Do alms of thy good
and of thy catel. and nyl thou turn away thy face from any poor man / and as
thou might be thou merciable.

If thou have mooche give thou mooche. Butt and if thou have but little study
thou to give litel with good will For tha^ thou tresourest to the a great yift
in the day of need For alms delivers souls from every sin and from
death / and suffers not the soul to go into derknes Tobie quarto.


The xiii. chapter.
Dives To whom shall I do mine alms.


Pauper. Do as Crist bids i^ the gospel. Oi^petenti te tribue. give to
every nedye yt axith the / if thou might Luce vi.


Dives. Co^tra Crist in the gospel Luce xiiii. says thus. Wha^ thou make a
fest nyl thou clepe thereto thy friends / thy nighboures / thy cosyns and rich
me^. but clepe thou pore me^ feeble bli^d and halt / by which words it semyth
to me yt I should do none alms but to pore yt ben feeble bli^d and halt


Pauper Crist forbedith not men to bid their fre^des and their nighboures and
rich men to the feast But he had hem yt they should not only bid their fre^des
and the rich. but also pore folk / nedy and feeble. Also he bad yt me^ should
not bid the rich folk and their friends to feast with no wicked intencion. i^
hope of false wynnyng / for po^pe / for glutony. for lechery / or to get them
a great worldly name. but principaly for to norisshe peace and charity And in
token yt festis made with good i^tencion both to rich and pore ben plesaunt to
god. criste clepith us al rich and pore to the endless feast. And crist him
self though he were pore. in our ma^hede / he was not feeble blind ne halt
when the pharise to who^ he said tho words bad him to mete / ne when he was
at the brydales with his mother in the chane of galile / ne when mary magdaleyn
and her sustre martha / and zacheus made hi^ great feestes / and yet they were
prysed of Crist for there dedys / and all that fed Christ. and his apostles /
and his disciples when they went about the world preching and teching been
praysyde. And yitt the apostles and his disciples / were strong me^ neither
blind ne halt And crist him self fed his disciples neither blind ne halte
And sumtyme he fed iiii. thousand of me^ / sumtyme five thousand that
followed him fro cu^tre to cu^tre to here his preching / and to se the woundres
that he did / and yitt were they not blind ne halt For as the gospel says he
made them hole of their bodily seknesse / or yt he fed them Luce. ix. et Mt
xiiii Also tho ii. disciples yt took criste to herborowe in the lyknesse of a
pilgryme on esterne day at even ben praised / and yet was he neither blind ne
halt. Also abraham and Loath and many other holy men resceyued angels in the
liknesse of worshipful men neither blind ne lame to mete and herborowe And
saint Petyr resceyued knights and worshipful men to mete and to herborowe
which came to him on message from the great lord cornely / as we read in holy
wrytt / actuu^ x.c. And all these been prised of god / and had much thank of
god for their almesdede. Therefore I said first Crist badde that men should do
alms to all that need both friend and foo And the apostle bids if thine
enemy have hu^gre feed him / if he have thirst. give him drink. The charity
of christian faith outaketh no person man ne woman ne state ne degree / ne sect.
hethen ne criste^ / from almesdede when they had need. Butt us must have pity
on all / and help all at our power Nathelesse us must keep order in yeuynge
and taking head to the cause / and to the manner of need in them. that we give
alms to. For why some be pore by their will and some against their will And
they yt ben pore by their will su^me ben pore for the love of god / and su^me
for the love of the world. They that been pore for the love of god must be
helped passing other for their poverty is medeful parfyte and virtuous. They
yt been pore wylfully not for god. but for the world. as the romans were /
and as these days much folk dismytte them of their own good and tak it to
there children to make them great in this world / and much folk take so much
head to other mennys profit / that they take none head to them self / and so
fall in pouerte and in need / such pore folk must principaly be helped of them
/ to whom their gods profityd and rather help them thanne other. that been
pore against their will. but they shall not be put before them that be pore for
the love of god but the need be the more.


The xiiii. chapter
OF them that be pore against their will / su^me ben pore by fortune / by
mysauentures as they to who^ fortune serves not at their will / ne god
multiplyeth not their good as they would and that / yt they have they lose by
mysauentures / and by the dome of god. And su^me been pore only by sin / and
for the love of syn as they that wast their good in lechery and glutonye / in
pride and pletyng / and in mysuse at the dyce in riot and in vanite. Such pore
folk been last in the order of alms doing / but their need be the more
And nathlesse if they have patience with their pouerte they shall have mede for
their patience. if they repent them. for their mysdedys. And in the same
manner su^me been feeble blind. and lame for gods cause and for gods love.
Su^me against their will by course of kind. Su^me against there will for love of
sin as theuys fighters baratoures / which in fight and barett lose their
iyen. their feet / their hondes / and often ben punysshed by the law. God
forbede yt such pore folk blind and halt should be put in the order of alms
doing before them yt be pore and feeble by virtue. and for gods sake. Such
shall be helped natt to lust of their flesh / ne to do them worship / but
oonly to save their kind. till the dome of god pass upon hem by process of
law and by gods mynistres.

Dives. Much folk think yt it is none alms to do good to such folk.


Pauper. yhis forsothe For god wole yt me^ help them / and at the dome he shall
say I was in prisone and ye visited me / and yt ye did to the leest of mine /
ye did it to me.


Dives. Seint austyn de verbis dn^i sermon xxxv. says. yet god shall say the
words to them yt be pore in spiryt and low of heart / and yt such been
clepyd the brethren of Crist and leest for lowness by which they set leest
by them self


Pauper. They ben no folk pore in spirit. but they that be pore for gods
sake And so seint austyne shewyth there yt god shall accept more the alms yt is
done to them yt ben pore for gods sake. than to them yt been pore ayenste
their will and for sin sake. Which conclusion all though is besothe. yitt
me thinks yt Criste shall say tho words for tho words for the alms that
he has done to al manner pore men both parfyte and imperfect For thanne he
shall yield mede for every good deed For why wicked doers and synful pore men
been clepyd the lest of gods menye / for they be leest set by in the court of
heuene. And therefore he says in the gospel that who so brekith one of his
leest commandments and techich other by word or by evil ensample. so to
break his co^maundmentes he shall be clepyd leeste in the kingdom of heuenes.
God shall show at the dome great pite and much mercy / when thing that is
done for his sake to his enemies and to his leest servants. most unworthy /
he shall accept it and reward it as it were done to his own person / and say
I tha^k you For that ye did to the leest of mine / ye did it to me


Dives. Why shall he clepe them brethren that by leest worthy / and many of
them to who^ the alms was done shall be dampened.


Pauper Er he shall give the sentence of dampnacion he shall clepe al me^
brethren for lyknesse of kind. For in that he is man he is brother to us al
by lyknesse of kind / but not by grace ne by bliss / but only to them that been
in grace Tha^ the meke judge shall clepe all me^ brethren to confort of them
that shall be saved / and to great disconforte of them that shall be dampened when
they shall see the meke judge not foryete the brotherhede ne lyknesse in kind.
Which he has with them / and yet catched and in manner co^petlyd by his
rightfulnesse to dampne them. Great matter shall they have than to sighe and
sorrow / wha^ne they shall know their sins so grievous and so great. and
their unkindness so much / that there oune brother so meke a judge must dampne
them.


Dives. This opinion is more plesaunt to rich me^ and to other synful wreches.
that hope than to be helped by almesdede. For in many cuntrees. been but few
pore folk in spirit. ne by their will Few that forsaken the world for gods
sake. But many there be that the world has forsaken / many that for syn sake
ben full pore / and many for their mysdedis lie bound in prison in great pouert
/ hungre cold and bitter peynes. And to such folk in many cuntrees men do
most commonly their alms / i^ hope to be thankyd and rewardyd. therefore at the
last dome


Pauper They shall be thanked and be medyd. therefore as I said first. and
sithen Criste rightful judge shall thanne thank men for the alms that they did
for his love to his enemies and wicked doers as many such ben / much more he
shall thank them for the alms that they did to his frendis and to his true
servants. And sithen they shall be dampened that would not give to his enemies
at need. for his sake / much sooner shall they be dampened yt would not help his
free^des and his true servants at need for his sake. yt putt the^ self for
his love to pouert and much travail for help of man's soul And if it be so
plesaunt and medfull to give alms to such pore folk forsakinge the world
/ of which many neither shall be resceyued into endless tabernacles of bliss /
neither shall resceyue in to that bliss. much more it is plesau^t to god and
meritorie to help them that been pore in spirit. and in will for the love of
god. For as Crist says in the gospel. the ki^gdome of heuenes is theirs and
it is grauntyd to them to resceyue folk that have helped the^ into endless
tabernacles.


The xv. chapter
And therefore leave free^d wytye it well yt if man or woman have more will to
give to them that been pore against their will and for the love of sin /
thanne for to give to them that been pore for gods sake. and for gods cause.
they sin full grievously. and lose the mede of their alms in that they putt
gods enemies before his friends / and vice before virtue. And therefore ye
shall releue all the pore and nedy as ye may / but pri^cipaly them that be nedy
and pore for gods sake and by wey of virtue. For if ye leeue by false opinion
the more alms. for the less. When ye may do both in good manner / ye lose
mede both for the more and for the less. Therefore seint austyn says thus.
Thou shall not do to the pore prechoure of gods word. as thou do to the
beggar passi^g by the wey. To the beggar thou yeuest. for Crist biddith the
that thou give to each that axith the. Butt to the pore prechoure thou owyst to
give though he axe the not. And therefore look that the pore pechour gods
knight need not to axe the For if he need to axe for thy defaute / and thy
defaute and thy lacchesse / he shewithe the dampnable or he axe And right as it
is said of the beggar. that sekith the / give thou every man that axith the /
so it is said of him that thou owyst to seek Let thine alms sweet in thine
hand / till thou find him to who^ thou must give. give thou to every man that
axith the / but much rather and more give to gods servants / to the knight
of criste though he axe not. Hec augustinus. et ponitur in glosa super iliud
p^i. Producens fenu^ tumentis. And therefore says the law. that who so wol not
give alms to men that follow the life of the apostles i^ pouert and to the pore
prechoures for their nedeful use. he dampneth him self. xvi. q^. i. apli^cis.
For as the apostle says it is due dett to the pore prechour of gods word to
live by his p^chyng Therefore Reymu^de de hospilitate ordinand. seyth yt some
axe alms of debt / su^me only for need to sustain the body. They that axe
alms of det eith^r they be known for such / or not known for such If
they be known for such they must nedly be helped. If they be not known /
they shall be examyned wisely whether it be as they say For it were great peril
to let them if it be so For in that they give gostly things bodily things be
due dett to them / as says poule and the law.xlii. distinctione quiescaus.
And if they axe only for sustena^ce of the body. either thou might give al for
stead and time / either thou might not give all If thou may give al / thou
owyst to give al after the need that they pretend / and after their state well
ruled. Take ensample of Abraham and Loath which resceyued folk indifferently
to hospitalite and so they resceyued au^gelis And if they had putt su^me
away / peraue^ture they should have put awey aungelis for men As says
Crisostom. super epla^m ad hebreos. Therefore he says that god shall not yield
the thy mede / for the good life of them which thou resceyuest / but for thy
good will / and for the worship that thou do to the^ for gods sake / for
thy mercy and thy godenesse. And therefore the law says / that me^ owe to give
their alms to cursed folk. and to synful folk. be they neuir so wicked. xi.
q^.iii. qm^ multos. et d. lxxxvi. pasce etc. no^ satis in fine. But they do the
worse. for yt they ben syker of their lyuclode. For as seint austeyn says. if
the sinner do the worse for mennys alms / it is better to withdraw it from
him tha^ne to give it him. v. q^.v. no^ oi^s. Nathelesse if he be in vttter

The vi. chapter.
And in case when thou mit not help all / thou must take heed to x things.
To feith cause / place. time. manner. nedeneighnesse of blood. and of affinite.
age / feblenesse. nobley. First take heed head to feith / for i^ caas thou shall
put a christian man before an hethen man. Also take heed to the cause of his
need / whether he i^ com^ to need for gods cause. or by cause of sin Take heed also to the place / as when the rightful man is turmentyd in prison for
dett / and help him if thou may For since we be bound to help al if we may /
much more we be bounden to help the rightful man / and woman. Also take
heed to the time / for if he get no thing of the in time of his tribulacion.
and in time of perell when he is led to his death unrightfully / but thou
settyst more by thy money. than thou do by his life / it is no light sin
Also take heed to the manner of yeuing / that thou give so one day that thou may
give a another day / and so to one that thou may give to a another. butt thou
will forsake the world all at ony^ for gods sake and for perperfeccion
Also take heed to need and give them after that they have need Also take heed
to nighnesse of blood and of affinite For by wey of kind they must be helped
rather thanne strangers if the need of both be even Also take heed to age /
for old folk must be put before young folk. Alsoo take heed to the
feblenesse. for bli^de and lame and other feeble folk must be helped rather than
hole folk. in even need Also take heed to ye nobley of the person / namely i^
the^ yt withoute^ sin ben fallen to poverty and myscheyf / for commonly such
ben shamfast to axe. di. lxxxvi. Non satis. Et eade^ dicit ambrum. libro de

Dives. I suppose yt I met with ii. pore men strangers elyke nedye / both
they axe / and I have naught that I may give but only to the one of them.


Pauper Seint Austyn in the same place. bids that thou should tha^ne give
it by lot.


Dives. I assent. say forth what thou wylt


Pauper Also in thy yeuyng thou must take heed to the holiness and to the
profitablenesse / and the nighnes of the person that nedith help For to the
holyer man and to him yat is or has been more profitable to to the comynte if
he need / thou shall give rather and better / tha^ to a person nigh of kyn or
of affinite not so / holy ne so profitable. but thou have the more specialle
cure of him / and but he be in the greter need. Also to them that be pore for
cristis sake and to the pore prechoures that preche principally for the worship
of god and help of man's soul. puttyng away al spices of false couetise.
thou shall give them that is nedeful to them after the time and after thy power
/ as to disciples of crist But to other pore folk that been pore against their
will which the world has forsaken / not they the world / it suffiseth to
give of thy relif honest and wholesome. For it is sin to give deyntees. to
such pore come^ beggars wha^ they ben not convenient to them As the law
says. di.xxv. vnu^. S. multi. et di.xli. Non cogant Of other pore men spekith
saint austyne. in a sermon of clerks life and says thus If the rich man have
but one child / wene he that crist be his other child. If he have two children
/ weue he that crist be the third. If he have x. make he Crist the elleuenth.
that is say give he to crist that he should spend on the elleuenth.xiiii. q^ ii.
si quis irascitur. And thus leave friend ye may se ye rich men which be gods
reues and gods bailes owe to ordeyne for them that been pore for gods love
and wylfully have forsaken the world for his sake that they have no need But
to comen beggars and nedy folk which the world has forsaken. it suffiseth so
to help them and to give hem that they perissh not Also leave friend as says
seint austyn in the book of the cite of god libro xxi.co.xxvi. they that wol
not amend their life. ne forsake their great sins / done no pleasant
alms. For why says he. alms should be done to get for yeuenesse of
sins that be past. not to get leave to duelle still in sin / and to do a
mys.


Here endith the.ix. precepte. And begins the tenthe.
Dives. Me thinks thy speech skylfulle. good and proufitable / and well
co^^ermyd by great auctorite. I thank the for thy words and thy good
informacion in the nynthe precepte. Now I pray the enfourme me in the tenthe
co^maundment


Pauper. The tenthe commaundmente is this. Non desiderabis vxorem proximi tui /
no^ seruu^ / no^ ancilla^. no^ boue^ / no^ asinu^ / nec omi^a que illius sunt.
Exodi. xx. Thou shall not desire thy neighbors wife / not his servant not his
maiden. not his ox / not his ass / ne no thing that to him longith. In the
nynthe commandment. god forbidith couetise of a another man's good not
mouable. In this last he forbedith all manner false couetise of a another man's
good meuable Also in the nynthe p^cept he forbedith couetise of the iye / in
this last principaly he for / bedith couetise of the flessh. And therefore says
saint austyne that the tenthe p^cepte is this alloone. thou shall not desir^
thy nighboure^ wif. And all yt folowith after wha^ne he says not his
seruau^te. not his ox ne his ass / ne no thing yt to him lo^gith / it is of
the nynth p^cepte. And it is also a new forbedynge of all manner mys couetise.
both of thing meuable and not meuable both of couetise of the iye and of the
flessh. And therefore if a man myscoueyt a another man's servant / or his wife /
or his child / as for possession. and service / it is against the nynthe
precepte / and principally against couetise of the iye And if he coueyte them
for mysluste of the flesh. thanne it is against the tenthe commandment.


Dives. I hope yt not every miscouetise is dedely sin against gods precept
For couetise both of the iye and of the flesh fallith lightly in man's heart
And it is not in our power always to flee thoughts of falls couetise For as
saint poule says. the flesh couetith always against the spirit


Pauper. God forbedith not such couetise that is not in our power to flee /
but he forbedith all manner myscouetyse. With assent to perform it a long
lyking therein And therefore though men do not in deed their falls couetise / if
they be in will to do it in deed if they might or durst. for dread of the
world / than they sin dedly against gods heest.


Dives Since it is so that false couetise with assent and will to perform / it
is dedly sin / and against gods p^cepte / and as seynte poule says / It is
root and beginning of every evil. Radix oi^m malorum est cupiditas. Sithen
wicked will gothe before wicked deed / why puttith not god ye forbeding of
falls couetise and of wicked will. in the order of ten. commandments before
the forbedyng of the deed of lecherye / and of theft / sithen that false
couetise and evil will is beginning of both. For wicked will goth before
every syn in somoche / yt ne were not wicked will. there should no sin be.


Pauper. God yaue the tenthe commandment to the people as souereyne techer
and as sovereign leche And every teching must begin at things that been
most easy to know / and every cur^ and lechecraft both of body and of soul
must begin there the seknesseis felt most grievous. And for asmoche as the
unwise people has more knowing yt mysdede was sin thanne myswylle / and felt
them more agreuyd by mysdede. than myswylle / therefore god forbedith first the
deed of false couetyse / and after he forbedith the will and the assent to
myscouetyse.


Dives. yitt contra te God forbedith no thing but sin. and sin of deed and
will is all one. For sin begins at evil will and endith in evil deed. As
we read in the secounde book of kings / of king David First he desired the
fair woman Bersabee. that was wife to the true knighte Dry / and fro that
wicked desire he fell into auoutre / and from a uoutrie into glotonye / and
from glotonye into false traytourye / and from tratourye into murdre / and
manslaughter / and blasphemye. and to dispisyng of gods high majesty /
wherefore god punisshed him full hard / for the child so mysgote^ dyed sone
after the birthe And his son absolon say openly by his wives i^ sight of the
people and drove him out of his kingdom. His other sone Amo^ lay by his own
suster. thamar. And therefore absolon her brother and his slew him And solomon
his sone slew his brother Adony And so david had litel joy of his children /
because of his auoutrye And was there neuir after stabilite i^ his kingdom for
ye auoutrye and murdre / and other sins yt came al of his wicked desire and
evil will / for yt he so mysdesired a another man's wife / against the heest of
god when he says Non des sidabis vxore^ proximi tui. Thou shall not desire thy
neighbors wife


Pauper. When wicked deed is knyt to wicked will / it is one sin / and both
been forboden by the same co^maundme^t in which he forbedith lechery and
theft. But wha^ne the will and the assente be not done in deed. thanne the
sin stondeth only in evil will and such syn principaly is forbode^ by these
ii. last co^mauu^dmentes in which god shewith openly yt evil will withouten
the deed is dedely sin.


The ii. chapter.
Dives. When god yaue the commaundementis in the monte of synay to moses /
there he forbade first couetise of the iye But when moses rehersid again the
law to the children of israel. Wha^ne they should enter into the sonde of
biheest / there moses forbad first couetise of flesh and puttith it before.
as we read Deutro. v. c. what was cause of this diversity.


Pauper. When god yaue them the law in the mount of synay. they were in desert
in great myscheif / and therefore they were more inclyned to robberye tha^ne to
lecherye. And therefore god for that time forbedith them first couetise of the
iye and than couetise of the flesh But when moses rehercyd again the law to
them in his last days / they were at the enter of the lord of bihest in a
full plenteuous cu^tre / where they were more enclyned to lecherye. for welfare
than to robbery for mysfare And therefore moses for that time forbade them
first couetise. of the flesh and thanne couetise of the iye. and of richesse
Another skylle leave friend is this For all the pilgrymage of the children of
israel xl. year in desert betokneth our pilgrymage here i^ this world from our
beginning unto our ending In token than that man and woman in his youth and
in his beginning is sonner temptyde to couetise of the iye and of worldly good
/ thanne couetise of the flesh / and in his e^dyng and in his age latter
temptyd to couetyse of the iye and of worldly good thanne to couetise of the
flessh for in old folk when al other temptaciones cese thanne is te^ptacion
of couetyse of the iye and of worldly good most breme. For right as their
body by age nighith to the earth / so their heart cleueth thanne most to
erthlye things. And therefore in the beginning of their pilgrymage in deserte
as to beginning folk. god forbadde them first and pri^cipally couetise of
the iye / and in the end of their pilgramage. as to folk nigh their end / he
forbedeth them principaly and last / and most openly withouten often
rehersynge couetise of the iye. For commonly the more that men nigh there e^de
the more couetouse they been.


The iii. chapter.
Dives Thy skilles be good say forth what thou will


Pauper. God in the sixte biheest forbidith the deed of lichery and of
spousebreche. and in this heest he forbedith the will. and the consent of heart
to lechery. and to spousebreche. For as the deed of lechery. is dedly sin /
so is the foul consent and the desire. of heart dedly sin / For as Crist
says in the gospel Mt v. He that sees a woman and coueytithe her by desire to
do lechery with her / he has do lechery i^ his heart / though he do it not in
deed. And therefore each man should take heed visily what thouthtes enter i^to
his heart and if any thoughts ben about to draw the reason of his soul to
consent to sin / anon put he awey tho thoughts mightilye / and let hi^
think on the bitter peynes. yt crist suffryd in his side / hondes and feet and
^o turn his myslust into devotion of cristes passion / and quench the
brennyng thoughts of lichery with the blood and the water yt ra^ne out af
cristes side / when his heart was cloven a two with yt sharp spear / and thynk on
ye endless love yt christ showed than to him and to all mankind And so to turn
his foul stinkinge love yt he begins to fall in shame and shenship. i^to
the sweet clean love of ihu^ full of joy and worship Tellith the master of
kind.li.xii. yt there is a bird in egypt yt is clepyd a pellicane.

And of all foulis he is most chere ouir his briddes and most loves the^
There is a great enemyte bitwene him and the adder / wherfor^ the adder waits
when the pellicane is out of his neste to seek. mete for him and for his
briddes / and than he gothe into the nest of the pellicane / and stingith his
briddes. and enuenemyth them and sleeth them wha^ the pellicane cu^meth again.
and fyndeth his briddes thus slain he makes much sorrow and moan. and by wey
of kind three days and three nights he morneth for death of his briddes. And at
the thridde days end he settith him again ouir his briddes and with his bylle.
he smytith him self in the side / and lettith his bode fall down on the
briddes. And anon as the blood touches his briddes / anoone by wey of kind
and by virtue of the blood they quyken again / and risen from death to life By
this pellicane yt loves so well his briddes. is understand Crist ihu^ gods
son yt loves man's soul and woman's more than euir did the pellicane his
briddes. And he says himself Similis factus su^ pellicano solitudiniis. I am
made like to the pellicaue of deserte By the birds I vndsto^de ada^. eve and
all ma^kynd. By the nest I vndsto^d the bliss of paradise For right as birds
be brout forth i^ ye nest / so mankind had his beginning / and was brought
forth in paradise. By the adder I vndsto^d the fee^d which appeared in the
lyknesse of an adder. to eve and stange her full evil and ada^ also with his
wicked fo^dyng and slew them both body. and soul. And not only he slew them
but also he slew al mankind i^ them For if adam had not sinned / we should
neuir have dyed. ne have wyste of woo. Wherefore this pellicane Jesus crist
seeing the myscheif yt mankind was fall in be gyle of the fee^d / he had ruth
on mankind. And for great love yt he had to mankind / as seint Poule says.
he auentisshed himself and took flessh and blood of the maiden marye / and
bicame man in the lyknesse of a servant / and in our ma^hede. and in our
kind suffered to be taken and be bound and beten / forspited / dispysed /
discourgyd at the pyler. be crowned with thorns / be naled to the tree hondes
and feet / and hangyd on the cross as a thief among theuys / and besto^ge to
the heart with the sharp spear. and so dyed bitter death / al for our gilt and
not for his gilt. for he did neuir amysse in word. ne in deed. as says seint
petyr in his pistel And thus for our love yt ben to bi^ full unkind / he shed
his p^cious blood out of every perte of his blisful body borne of the mayde^.
And his i^ner heart blood he shed so to wasshe us fro our sins / and to raise
us fro the death of syn into the life of grace. And after fro bodily death / into
the life of endless bliss Therefore seint John says. Dilexit nos. and lauit
nos. a peti^s nr^is i^ sa^guine suo. apoc. i. c. He louyd us so much. yt he
washed us from our sins with his p^cious blood. Love drove hi^ down fro heaven
i^to earth. love led him into the maidens bosom and brought h^ into this wicked
world Love bo^de hi^ i^ cradyl and wo^de him i^ cloutes full pore / and leyde
hi^ in an ox stalle Love heelde him here in sorrow and care hu^gre and thrist
and much trauayl.xxxii. year and more At last love took hi^ and bo^de hi^
and set him at the bar before the synful justice pou^ce pylate Love leyde
him on the cross and nailed him to the tree Love led him to his death. and
cleef his heart a two. And for whose love leeue friend Forsooth for love of you
and of me and of other synful wretches yt neuir did him good but offendyd him
night and day and been to him full unkind.

Therefore he may well say the words that solomon said Forty est vt mors
dilectio Cant viii Love is strong as death / yhe for sothe much strenger than
death. For love led his life to his death and he that neuir might die by wey of
kind. love made him die for mankind. And so says salomo^ there. Broondes of
his love. ben bro^des of fire and of flames. both For the love that he showed
to mankind / and also for the love that we ought to show to him. For right as
the hete of the su^ne. With his light when he shyneth i^ the fire in the house
/ wastith the fire and quenchith it / so the love of god and the endless
charity of his passion if it shone in man's soul with his hete it should
que^che and waste the broondes and the fire of lechery brennyng in man's soul
by foul lust and wicked desire. And therefore he says to every christian soul
Pone me vt signaculu^ super cor tuu^ Cant. viii Set me as a token upon thine
heart And seint poule says Spu^ u^bulate and desidia carnis no^ perficietis.
ad gala. v. Goo ye with the the holy host yt is clepyd well of gostly fire /
and ye shall not do the desire of the flesh For devotion. and mind of cristis
passion is the best remedy against te^ptacio^ of lechery


The iiii.. chapter
AAlso it is a good remedy. to man to think on his death and on his freelte
and on the bitter peynes of hell euirlastyng / and of the high offense of god
/ and of the endelesse joys yt they lose / if they asse^t to lechery Therefore
salomo^ says Memorare nouissima tua and in eternu^ no^ peccabis. Ecclsiastici
vii. Think on thy last thingis and thou shall neuir do sin. Each man and
woman / should be war^ yt neither by nyce contenaunce ne by folly speech / ne by
nyce array. of body they stire any man or woman to lechery. And though
reasonable arraye and honesty be co^mendyd both in man and woman after their
state reuled by gods law and reason / and so they must be well ware that by
such array they fall not in pride ne in lechery. ne stire other to lecherye.
Wyllyng and wetynge. We read in vitis patrum* that there was a holy woman whose
name was alexandre. and she was a full fair woman / and when she herd. say
that a man was fallen into hard temptacion of lecherye because of her beauty /
she closed herself in an house and neuir would se man after. ne come out of ye
house / but took her living in to her by a small wyket Men axid her why she
did so And she said that she had leuyr to shytte herself all quycke in the
grave / than to harm any soul yt god maade to his lyknesse / and boughte so
dear with his preciouse blood. we read also in the lif of seynte Bride / yt a
man would have wed did her for her beauty / and she prayed god yt he would se^d
her su^me blemyss^ynge of her face / whereby yt man's temptacion might cese.
An^ on her one iye braste out of her head / wherefore her fader made her a
nu^ne. as a woman unable to the world. And when she was made a nu^ne and had
forsaken the world / anon she had her iye and her ^ight again. Thus should
wymen be^^ly keep them in chastity and clennesse / maidens in chastity of
maydenhode / widows in chastity of widowehode / wives in chastity of wedlok /
and keep there body truly to their husbondes / and so the husbo^des truly to
their wives. Forsothe it is a dedly syn a man. to desire a another man's wife or
his maiden or his daughter. to flesshely lust Much more it is dedly sin to
opresse them. and defoule them and lie by them.

The v. chapter.
Dives. Saint poule says. yt the flesh desires and couetith always anenst
the soul. And it is full hard to withstonde his lustis and his desires.


Pauper Therefore man should govern and chastise his body / as a good man of
arms governs and chastises his horse / For as Job says Al our lyui^ge
upon earth. is knighthode and fightyng against the feende / the world and the
flesh Job vii. And in this bateyle our body is our horse which we must
chastise and rule. as a knight does his horse. For if the horse be to proud
and evil tached / he may lightly lose his master and be cause of his death. And
if he be tame to his master / and well tacched / it shall do hi^ worship / and
help him at need and in caas save his life Three things been nedeful to the
knight to rule well his horse He must have a brydell. and sadyl / and two spores
By the bridel I understand abstinence. and travail. by the which the flesh
must be refrayned fro his lusts. and his evil tacches wha^ he begins to
wexe proud and wynsyng. and kikyng ayenste his master yt is the soul And if
he be ouir proud and to rebel to his master / he must have a sharp bridel of
sharp abstinence and of hard travail And if he be meke and tretable / give
him a smothe brydel of easy abstine^ce and of common travail The raynes of thy
bridel should be ii. perties of temporaunce yt is to say neither to much ne to
little knyt togidre i^ a knot of good discrecion

And thanne thine horse shall goo right forth in the weye of life and bear the
to heavenly bliss. If thou give thy flesh ^o much mete and drink and eese.
it wol be thy master and flee the.

And if thou give it to little / it shall be to feeble and fail the at need and
let the of thy journey The sadyl of thyn horse shall be patience and meknesse yt
thou be paciente in aduersite / and in seknesse / yt thou follow not the
gruchynges and the sterynges of thy flesh. The steroppes of thy sadel should
be lowness and sadness Lowness against pride / sadness against the world and
the flesh That thou be not to sorry for no woe / ne to glade for no well ne for
no welefare Sytt sadly in thy sadyl and keep well thy steroppes / and for no
pride. ne for no wrath / for no seknesse for no aduersite / let not thy horse
cast the down out of ye sadyl of patience But tha^ sit fast by the virtue of
gostly strength. and keep thy soul in the sadel of patience as crist byddeth
i^ the gospel wha^ he says. In paciencia vestra possidebitis ai^as vras. ye
shall keep your souls in your patience And as the sadel makes an horse semely
and plesaunte to the sight so patience makes a man plesa^t. to the sight of
god / and of men and makes them have love in every cu^pany where they ben And
wrath. and i^ patience and hastynesse. makes a man vnplesau^t and withoute^
love Of this sadyl god spak to caym wha^ he was wroth with his brother abel why
said god art thou wroy and why is thy face and thy chere so fallen For he was
fallen out of the sadyl of patience If thou do well thou shall resceyue of me
good mede And if thou do evil anon thy sin comes at the yate to be
punysshed But the desire of syn shall be under the and in thy power. as the horse
under the knit And thou shall be lord thereof if thou wylt Gen^ iiii. But caym
by mysgouernaunce of his horse fell out of his sadyl of patience. i^to
manslaughter of his brother. for he would not keep him in the sadyl of patience
/ ne refrain the wicked desire of his flessh / and therefore god cursed him
first of al me^ Therefore leave freende keep you well in the sadyl of patience /
and let no anger / no loss of catel / ne death of friends / none aduersite /
no tribulacion / no seknesse vnsadle you of patience. But sytt ye fast as Job
did / and say ye as he said. When he had lost al his good and al his
children were slain. and him self smyten wtth hard. sickness / and orrible
and foul. than he said thus. If we have taken good things of gods hand /
why should not we suffer wicked things and peynful of his soond^. God yaue.
and god has taken away / as god will so it is done. blessed be our lords
name. Job io. et iio.c. Thus sit ye sadly in the sadel of patience. and rule ye
your horse by the brydel of abstinence / and by the reins of temperaunce / and
if your horse be so dulle in gods wey / pryke him with ii. spores yt been
dread of hell pain. and love of god. and of heuene bliss And so with dread and
love compel ye your horse to hie him forth in godds wey. Let not your horse yt
is your flesh be to carnalle by ease and welfare / ne to feeble for misfare
and ouirtrauayle.


The vi. chapter.
THe master of kind li.iiii. de qualitate elime^tari tellith. that there is
bridde that is clepyd a bernak. This bridde wexith out of a tree ouir the
water. But aslong as it hangith on the tree. it is deed / but anon as it
lousith from the tree. and fallith down into the water / anon it quykneth and
swymmeth forth. This bridde he says has little flesh and less blood. By
this tree I understand mankind yt came al of Ada^ and eve as the tree and his
branches come al of the rote bynethe. By this bridde I understand every man
and woman which wha^ they be first borne of their mother they be deed by
original sin of Adam and not able to the lif of grace ne of bliss For as
seint poule says we ben all borne children of wrath. and of death But anon
as we fall into the fontstone. and in the water of baptyme and ben baptized /
anon we resceyue the life of grace / and be able to the life of heaven bliss. if
we keep us besily from the blood of sin / and from the carnalite of the
body. and desires of the flesh For seint petyr bids us Abstinete vos a
carnalibus desideriis que milita^t aduersus a^az i. petri ii. Absteyne ye you
from flesshely desires that fight against the soul But for asmoch as Job says
yt al man's life upon earth is knighthode and fightyng aye^ste gostly enemies.
Milicia est vita hoi^s super terra^ Job vii. Therefore it is nedeful to every
christian man to govern well the horse of his body as I have said. But more
ouir as saint Poule says. he must arm him with gostly armure against the
dyntes. and the darts of the fendes temptacion For as seint poule says. Ad
ephesians. vi. All our fighting is against the wicked spirits of derknessis which
be princes and powers and gouernoures of synful men. Therefore he says Arm ye
you in the armure of god that ye may withstonde the bussheme^t and the slightes
of the devil / and stand perfyte in all things. Stand ye says he in treuthe
/ and gyrde ye your lendes with the gyrdel of chastity / and do ye on the
habergeon of rightfulnesse / and sheo ye your feet in dightyng of the gospel
of pees. And in all things take ye to you the shield of feith / with which ye
may quench all the brennyng darts of the wicked feende And take ye you the
basynett of health and the sword of the holy gooste / yt is gods word. Which
as he says i^ a another place is sharper tha^ any ii. eggyd sword. Ad hebreos
iiiio. And by all manner prayers and besechyng pray ye every time and always in
spirit / and wake ye always in him in all manner business And thus seint poule
by the lyknes of bodily armure / techith us gostly armure / and techith us well
to arm our leendes by the virtue of chastity / when he byddeth us gyrde well
our leendes. And tha^ he byddeth us do on the habergeon of rightfulnesse in
defense both of body and soul / yt we do right to al and yield to god and to
every creature yt lo^gith to him. both to our sovereigns and to our felawes /
and to our subgettes. and to them that been before us past out of this world
/ by alms yeuynge / and yeldyng of dettes for them that been deed / and to
them that been behind us to cu^me by saving of their right and of their due
heritage. And thus arm we us behind and before and i^ every side with the
habergeon of rightfulnes And right as in the habergeon every ryng accords with
other and is knytt with other / So should al our rightfulnes accord to giddre
and so be knytt to gyddre. yt we do right to all / so that we do no man ne
woman wrong. For if we do somoche right and favor to one yt it be hyndrynge
to another right / tha^ the rings in our habergeon of rightfulnes. accord
not ne be well knytte togider But there is an hole whereby the feende may hurt
our soul Also he byddeth us arm our feet and our legs with leg harneys
yt is gostly pouert yt we withdraw our hertes and our affections. from
erthly things / and not set our love to much in erthely things ne in worldly
gods / not to strive / not to plete for no worldly gods / but the more need
compel us thereto / but seek to live i^ pees with all men if it may be. And thus
arm us with gostly pouert our legs and our feet / that is to say our love
and our affections against the temptacions of false couetise. And therefore he
byddeth us shoe our feet into the dighti^g of the gospel of peace. For every
christian man and woman owethe to have gostly pouert which crist taught in the
gospel / and to forther the gospel of crist that is the gospel of pees i^ will
and deed to his power / and to tech it if he ca^. And if he can not. help and
forther the^ that can in teching of the gospel. and of gods law / and help
the^ with his good to their nedeful sustenau^ce if he may and and they have
need. Also he bids us take to us the shield of feith / for as ye sheld is a
triangle and has three corners / in which triangle if fro the mids be drawn
three lines. in to the three corners / there should be three triangles / which
three be but one triangle / and yet none of the^ is other And therefore he says.
feith of the holy trinyte is likned to a shield / for there been three persons
in the holy trinyte / the fader. the son. and the holy gooste / and each of
them is god. and none of them is other. And though they ben all three but one
god in majesty / this sheld of feithe of the holy Trinyte. us must take to us
in gostly fight and bileue in the holy trinyte and set all our feith and
all our trust in one god in trinyte / and pray to the fadre almighty / that
he se^de us might. to the son al witty that he grant us wytt and wisdom.
to the boly gooste all gracious and full of mercy / that he grant us grace /
so that we may have mit wytt and grace to withstonde al gostly enemies. Also he
byddeth us to take to us. the basynett of health. and of salvation / as says
the gloss / hope to have the maistre of our enemies by the help of god / and
heuene bliss to our mede for our fighting and for our travail For there
will no man put him to lauful fight / but in hope to have the maistrie / and
mede for his travail And as the basynet well arrayed is clean furbusshed from
rust / and made slyke and smothe. that shot may sone glide of / and it is
highest of al armure going and gaderyng upward into a small point / so
must our hope and our trust. principaly go up to god / and not set our
hope ne our trust to much in man's might ne in erthly help / which is but
ruste wasti^g the basynet of hope that we owe to god. Therefore says the
prophet Ieremye. Cursed be the man that trustith in man / and in flesshelye
might / and lettith his heart go all ey fro god And blissed be that man. Which
settith his hope and his trust in our lord god Ieremye xvii. Also seint poule
bids that we should take with us rerebras and va^bras and gloves of plate
that is to say good occupaciones and business in good works And therefore he
bids us wake in all manner business of good werkis For as the wise man says
Ec. xxxiii. Idelship and sluth is cause of much wickedness For an ydel man and
lustles is like a man hondlesse / and wepenles among his enemies. and like a
man in batteyl with naked arms and hondes / which for nakedness and for
defaut of armure lesith both arm and hand Also we must do above the ^acke or
the acton of charity For as the jack is soft and nesshe and by his softness
and nesshenesse softithe and feynteth al strokes yat cu^meth therayenst / so
charity softith and feyntith all the dyntes of the fee^des temptacion. Therefore
seint poule says / that charity suffers al thing patiently / and makes
every travail soft and berith al thing easily. Omnia suffert. oi^a sustinet.
Prima ad little. xiiii And therefore seyth the gloss there that charity and
patience and benignyte. With compassion of otheres myscheif / been the
principal armure that lo^gith to christian people This jack of charity is
betokenyd by the clothe of crist withoute^ seem all wo^ne above into one which
in time of his passion the knights would not ky^ / but kept it hole / and kest
lot who should have it hole In token that every good knight of god should be
besy to arm him with the clothe and the jack and the armure of charity / and
travail to save peace and unity. and make no division For the end of every
battle should be pees / and to ye end and for none other me^ of arms should
traueil and fight / as says seint austyn. Thus leave friend I pray you yt ye
arm you in gostly armure. as gods good knight. For though ye be not able to
bodily batayl / ye be yet able to gostly fight In that yt ye be christian ye be
cristes knight ordained to fit in this gostly bateyl / if ye wol be saved. And
therefore arm ye you well as I have now said and gird ye you with the sword
of goddis word / by which ye should defend you from al gostly enemies For as
the sword persith / kyttith and makes seperacion / so gods word. and
prechinge techinge and redyng of gods word and of gods law. persith
man's heart / and woman's and makes seperacion bitwene synful souls and their
sin / and departith. atwynne wicked cu^pany and makes seperacion of mannnes
heart. from erthely couetise. Therefore crist seith that he came not to make
sinful peace / but to se^de swerd of seperatione in earth / to distroye wicked
peace yt men have in their sin Therefore leave friend as gods good knight gyde
ye you with this sword of gods word yt is to say fastne ye it well in your
heart by heryng and reding / by techi^g and by deed doing / and than take ye to
you the spear of cristes passion and think how he was smyten to the heart for
your sake with ye sharp spear. and his side opned. and his heart cloven a two to
show you how much he louyd you And thanne he shed out his heart blood and
water in token. yt if he had had more blood more he would have shed. for your
love Moreouir ye shall understood yt in bodily fight a man must chese him a
good ground and a plain place to sight in For it is no good fightyng in myres.
ne among corn / in slidre wey. and pity ground / ne in stoble ground And
therefore seint poule bids us stand in treuthe and equite yt in all our
doing we look to our ground and our cause be true and rightful / clear and
clean. and make no stryf in uncertain Also a wise knight in his fight wole
take with him the hyl and the su^ne and the wi^de if he may. and so must us in
gostly fight take with us the hyl of holy living yt we may say with the
apostle. Nr^a co^uersato^ in celis e^ Our living and co^uesacione is in
heuenes and in heuynly things. And therefore seint poule bids us sto^de
perfect in all things. Also we must take with us in our fight the su^ne and
the light of gods grace / and the wind of holy p^yer. And therefore seint
poule biddeeth us pray in every time and always / by all manner prayer and
bisechyng in the holy ghost / yt is to sey with the grace of the holy gooste In
this manner leave friend. arm ye you in gostly armure / and dispose ye you to
gostly batteyl aye^ste al gostly enemies / and govern ye well your horse of
your boody as I haf said Let it not be to feeble by oudone abstine^ce and
traueil / ne to wild by ouirdon rest / by glutonye / by lechery / by wicked
desires of the flesh and evil wylles for in caas such wicked wylles and
desires been dedly sin in gods sight and against this last p^cept Therefore
david says yt god p^ueth and knowith man's heart and his lee^des yt is to say
god knowith man's will and his lust For he knowith more verily the thoughts
of me^nes hertis and wyme^s / thanne any man may. knowithe others works He
sees and knowith all thing And therefore such as man or woman is in heart and
in soul / and in will such he is before god yt knowyth both body and soul.

The vii. chapter.
Now leave friend I have i^ party declared thou the x commandments. by
which ye must govern your lif / if ye wole be sauyd For crist says to each
man and woman Si vis ad vitam i^gre di serua mandata. Mt. xix. If thou wy^te
enter euirlasting life. keep gods co^maundmentes.

And therefore do ye as salamon says. Deu^ time et ma^data eius obserua. hoc
est oi^s ho^. Ec. vlti^o Dread ye god and keep his co^mau^dmentes. this is
every man and woman For asmoche as man or woman plesith god by kepinge of his
heestis / so much is he in gods sight. And asmoche as man or woman is in
gods sight / so much he is and no more. as says seint austyne de
ciuitate.li.xxo.c.iiii. For as he says. there is no man ought but the keeper of
gods conmau^dme^tes / for as he seith who so is not keeper of gods
commandments / he is naught. For he is not reformyd aye^ to the lyknesse of
treuthe / yt he was made after / but duellith stylle in the lyknesse of vanitye
yt he was not made to. Therefore dauyd said Maledicti q declina^t a ma^dtis
tuis. Cursed be they yt bow away fro thy co^mau^dme^tis / and wole not keep
them. We read in holy wryt Deutro. xxvii. yt god badde the children of israel
yt when they came newly into the lord of beheest vi. kynredes of jacob / yt is
to say Symeon. leuy. judah. ysachar / joseph. and beniamyn / should stand on
the hyl of garizym. there to thank god / and to bless all the kepers of
gods law And against them should stand other vi. kynredes of jacob. yt is to
say Ruben / gad. aser / zabulon. Dan / and Neptilym on the hill y^ hight ebal.
and curs with high voice all that break gods hestis and say in this wise. Cursed
be ye man and woman yt makes any graue^ image that is abhominacion to god /
work of the hondes of men of craft to worship it outward with his body / and
settith it in pryue place / yt is to say. i^ his heart. to set his feith and
his trust. therein / so to worship it with his heart i^warde / and at gods
byddyng all the people should au^swer^ and sey amen. So mote it be. Cursyd be he
yt not worshipeth fader. and mother. ame^ seide the people Cursyd be he yt
flitteth the bounds and the doles or terms of his neigheboure / and puttith
him out of his right / amen seyde all the people. Cursed be he yt makes the
bli^de. to will or to err in his wey. ame^ seyde all the people. Cursyd be he yt
peruertith the rightful doom of the comelyng and of the stranger. and of the
faderlesse child and of the moderlesse child / and of the widow. Amen said
all the people. Cursed be he that lies by his faders wife / or by any of his nigh
kynred / or of nigh affinity. Amen said all the people. Cursed be he that
medlith flesshely with any unreasonable beeste / Amen said all the people. Cursed
be he yt lies by his nighboures wif Amen said all the people. Cursyd. be he
that privily sleeth and murdreth his nighboure / amen said all the people.
Cursed be he that takith yiftes to slay hi^ that is not gilty. amen said all
the people. Cursed be he yt duellith not in the words of gods law. ne does
them not in deed. Amen said all the peole. This is the high curse. and the
sole^pne sentence which god yeueth to al tho yt wole not keep his heestis and
law / and what curse and mischief should fall to them yt wyttyngly or wyllyng
break his hestes / he shewyth in the same book the next chapter where he
says thus.

The viii. chapter.
IF thou will not here the voice of thy lord god. to keep and to do al his
commandments and his laws / al these curses and myscheuys shall fall to the.
and take the. Thou shall be cursed in cite. in town in feld / thy bern thy
gerner. and thy seller shall be cursyd. and that ye leueth the ouir the year
shall be cursed. The fruit of thy body shall be cursed / and the fruit of thy land
shall be cursed / thy best is thy sheep shall be cursed. Thou shall be cursed wha^
thou cu^mest in / and wha^ thou we^dest out. God shall se^de upon the hu^gre and
myscheif and myshap / and blame to al thy works yt thou doste He shall smite
the with pestilence / till he shall waste the and distroye the. He shall smite
the with hard fevers both cold and hot / and with venemouse. eyr. God shall
make heuene and the air above the brase^ / and therth byneth the yreny. that
is to say bareyne for defaute of reyne For thy reyne shall be powder and ashes.
and myldewe to distroye the. God shall take the into thy enemies hondes / and
thou shall fall before thyn enemies. Thou shalt goo against them by one weye /
and fle awey by vii. weyes / and briddes / and beestis shall ete thy body in the
feelde God shall smite the with seknesse that may not be helyd God shall smite
the with wodenesse. and blyndnesse of wit. and so bisot the that thou shall
not with what is for to do / ne cu^ne no read ne co^seyl. Thou shall house and
other shall duel therein Thou shall till and other shall in that thou tylest Thy
ox / thine ass / thy horse. thy sheep and thy beestis / shall be take fro the /
and thy wife and thy children led away prisoners. God shall smite the with
seknes incurable / from the sole of thy sete unto the top of the head. ^hatt is
to say god shall punysshe the people that wole not cu^ne. ne keep his laws from
the lowest staate to the highest And but thou wylt keep his laws and amend
the. he shall led the and thy king yt thou shall make upon the / prisoners
into far cu^tre yt thou neuir knew ne thy faders before the. Al these curses
and many mo thereto which be written in the same place shall take the. and pursue
the. till thou be distroyed For thou herdist not the voice of thy lord god ne
kepist not his heestis and his laws yt he bad the keep And at the day of doom
he shall give to all tho yt despise his laws / his e^dlesse curse bitterest of
all / when he shall say to them. Discedite ^ me maledicti in ignem eternu^.
Mt. xxv Go ye hens fro me ye cursed wretches into the fire of hell / ther^ to
duel with the fee^de and his angels withoute^ e^de.

Dives. ye last curse is most for to dread / for other curses of temporal
mischief fall as sone to the good as to the wicked


Pauper. Temporal mischief sumtyme fallith to person in special / sumtyme to
comynte in general In special. it fallith su^tyme for sin / su^tyme withouten
sin / to encreasyng of a man's mede But than ye mischief is no curse but a
louetyk of god. Butt comen mischief fallith not to the comyntie / but for sin
of the comyntie And of such comen myscheues yt should fall to the people. if
they despised gods hestis speaks god in ye place And such comyne myscheuys
yt fall to the comynte for comen sin be clepid curses.


Dives. Why were tho vi kynredes of Jacob so assigned of god to curse the
brekers of gods law / and the other vi. assigned to bless the kepers of
gods law


Pauper. Them yt were most vngentyl of birthe god assignyde to curse For all tho
vi. sons of Jacob. Were borne of the secu^darye wives that were but servants
to his chief wives / lya. and rachel. saaf. ruben. Which lost his worship /
for that he lay by his faders secundarie wife. that highte bala. The other vi.
kynredes were borne gentyl of birthe / for they were borne of the principal and
more gentyl wives / Lya and Rachel. four of lya / and ii. of rachel. And
therefore god ordained them to bless / in token yt no man should be chosen to
preesthode. but he were gentyl by wantyng of cursed co^dicions. And also in
toke^ that it is more kyndely to worshipful persons as al prestes should be /
to bless than to curse. And therefore busshopes and other p^stes should not
curse but for a full greuouse open syn and for great need. Therefore poule
says. to me^ of perfeccion as al p^stes should be. Benedicite. et nolite
maledicere. Bless ye and be ye not in will ne ready to curs but for great need
/ and that it be done in charity to worship For cursyng in the self is a deed
of imperfeccion. And therefore god chose them that were most imperfyte. and
leest worshipful of the birth to pronounce the curse / and the most perfect
and worshipful in birthe to pronounce his blessing to ye kepers of his law.
Which seyde thus / i^ gods name to the people.


The ix. chapter.
IF thou here the voice. of thy lord god. to cu^ne and to keep al his heestes
yt I bid the keep / thy lord god shall make the higher thanne al naciouns yt
duelle upon earth And al these blessings shall come to the and tak the. so that
thou keep gods hestes. thou shall be blessed in cite. in town and in feelde
The fruit of thy body / the fruit of thy land. the fruit of thy beestes
shall be blessed / thy berne / thy garner / thy seller shall be blessed / and al
thy leui^ges shall be blessed. Thou shalt. be blessed cu^myng in and going out.
God shall make thyn enemies that rise against the. to fall in fight before the.
They shall come against the by one wey. and they shall fle away by vii. weyes. God
shall give his blessing prosperity and speed to al thy works / so^ yt thou keep
gods heestis and go in his weyes and in his laws / yt al people on earth shall
se and know yt the name of our lord is clepyd on the / and they shall dread
the / and worship the / and our lord god shall make the plenteouse in all gods
God shall undo his be tresour. above from heuene. and give the reyne in time.
Thou shall lene to other nations / and thou shall have no need to borowe of
other nations God shall make the i^to the head and not into the tail. For he
shall putt the always above and not byneth / so yt thou keep his heeftis and his
laws. And at the day of dome he shall give to all the kepers of his laws his
endless blissing. of euirlasting joy / and say to them in this wise. Venite
bn^dicti ptis mei. possidete paratu^ vobis regnu^ a constituto^e mu^di. Mt xxv.
Come ye with me ye blissed children of my fadris / and take ye i^ possessione
the kingdom of heuene arrayed and ordained to you. from the setti^g or maki^g
of the world.

In which kingdom as says austyn shall be light without derkenesse / endless
joy withoute^ heaviness / endlesses life withouten woe. endless myrthe and
gladness. With the blisful cu^pany of au^gelis apostles and al seintes. There
says he is light of light / and well of brit shynynge There is the cite of
sei^tes yt is clepyd Jerusalem of heaven There is the great covent of martires
and of holy prophets and patriarchs abraham Isaac and jacob and of all seyntes
There is no sorrow ne heaviness. after joy. There shall be no night / none age
/ no fe / blenesse. There is charity withoute^ end and euirlasting peace / no
debate no discension. There every man and woman has yt he loves. and what he
desires There is al love withouten woe and withouten sorrow and care. There shall
we be angels peris and felawes in bliss / with the high potestatis cherubyn
and seraphin / and with all nine ordres of angels There shall be ma^na our
heavenly fode withoute^ corrupcion There shall be au^gelis life / and to say
shortly. there shall be sown no sorrow no disese none evil. and what may be
thought of any godnes: there shall be found.

The x. chapter.
THe kingdom of heaven is clepyd in holy writ a cite set on a full high hylle
in stabilite and sikernesse withouten dread. and withouten peril / for there may
none enemy / no peril no disease neigh thereto It stondithe so high and in so
great wealth* For men have in this cite what euir they desire There is nout to

sanacion occupy the walls of this cytee / keep them and defend them and
praisyng of god. withoute^ ceasyng. occupies the yates and so kepith hem yt
there may no sorrow enter. In this cite says he shall thou not need / to have ye

There shall be no weping. no criyng / none hu^gre / no thurst no sorrow For all the
woe and diseases yt were before. ben all past from them yt come to this cite
All the people of this city shall be good and rightful / there shall no
shrewe no briger / no lechour. no wicked liver. enter into this cite. There

The xi. chapter.
OF this cite spekithe syent John in the book of gods priueties xxio.c. and
says thus The aungel led me in spirit by vision i^to a full high hylle and
a full great. And there he shewid me the holy cite of Jerusalem ordained of god
/ and having the brightness and the beauty of god The light of this cite was
like the p^cious stone iaspis and cristel which stone betokneth crist son of
rightwysnesse. Which says in the gospel Ego su^ lux mu^di Io. viii I am light
of the world This cite had a wall full great and full hi and it had xii. yates /
and each yate xii au^gelis ready porters. to lead in all good souls / and i^ the
yates were written all the names of the xii. ki^redes of israel. yt is to say /
of all yt shall be saved and be able to se god i^ his face For the names of all
yt shall be saved been registered in the book of lif in heuene and ready written i^
the yates of heaven / against our cu^myng in toke^ yt we shall be welcome and siker
of our bliss if we do our deuer. This cite stood i^ square and it had three
yates into the eest three into the north. three into the south / and iii. into
the west / in toke^ yt out of iiii. pertes of the world. yt is to say / out
of every perte of the world souls enter into heuene bliss of young and old
rich and pore by the feyth of the holy trinitye. yt is betoknyde by the three
yates. young folk ben understand by the eest / there the day begins Old
folk by the weste there the day e^dith Rich folk by the south Pore folk by the
north. for yt cu^tre is most sharp and bareyne The wall of the cite was set and
grou^did on xii. p^cious stones. The first was Iaspis. the ii. saphirus. the
iii. calcidonius. the iiii. smaragdus. the v. sardenyx. the vi. sardinus. the
vii. crisolitus. the viii. berillus. the ix topasius / the x. crisopassus. the
elleuenthe iacinctus. the xii. amatistus And in tho stoones were written the
names of the xii. apostles and of gods lo^be And all the wall was made of
p^ciouse stones / and the yates made of saphires and smaragdes. as to bye says
in his book.xiii.c. And as sei^t john says. every yate was as a margarite or
margery stone The stretis of the cite were clean gold as clear as glass And
as to by seith the stretis of this cytee were pauyd with full white clean stone
/ and always in the stretis is song alleluya. Which song could neuir clerk
well declare ne expowne to the vtterest / for the joy the mirth / the melody /
and gladness yt is there may no tunge tell / ne heart think / ne hand write /
ne wit deuyse and declare In this city seint John saw no temple / for
almighty and gods lombe crist Ihesus verrey god and man he is the temple of
this cite. This cite as seith seint John nedith neither su^ne ne moan. For the
brightness of god well of light and the su^ne of rightfulnesse illumyneth this

The xii. chapter.
ANd as says a great clerk Doctor de lyra. by the xii. p^ciouse stones. on
which this cite is groundyd. / in which stones the names of the xii. apostles
be written ben vndstonde the xii. articles of the feith. Which the xii.
apostles gaderyd into one creed. in which xii articles al our salvation is
set and groundyd And therefore seint poule says Fide statis. ye stand in
faith. for our feith is ground of our salvation By the twelve yatis ben
vndstonde the x. co^maundmentes. and the ii. p^ceptes of chari^e Of which
yatis crist says Si vis ad vita^ ingredi. serua ma^data Mt xix

If thou wylt enter into the life of this blisfull cite there no man dies.
keep thou the commandments This scripture is wretyn in every yate of this
city. in token that into this cite cu^methe no man ne woman but the kepers of
gods co^maundementis For the commandments ben the yates of heuene / by
which us must enter / and they ben also the weye ledyng to the yate of heuene
And therefore david said Viam mandatoru^ tuorum cucurri: cu^ dilatasti cor
meu^. p^o. Cxviii. I ran the weye of thy co^mau^dme^tes when thou made mine
heart large by charity For when me^ be to strait at the breest by false
couetise and nygardship / they may natt well run in the weye of gods
hestes. For false couetise byndethe them so streit at the heart yt they have no
likynge in gods heestes. Therefore david said. Deduc me dn^e in semita
mandatoru^ tuoru^: qr ip^am volui. Inclina cor meu^deus in testimonia tua: et
non in auaricia^. p^o Cxviii. Lord led thou me in the pathe of thy
commau^deme^tes / for it is my desire. and my will to go that wey Bow mine
heart into thy witnessingis and into thy co^maundme^tes / and not into avarice
and couetise Thus leave friend holy wrytt and holy men declare the bliss of
heuene by things visible yt we may see at iye / so to lead us into knowing of
the bliss that we may se with our bodily iye while we live i^ the lord of
death. Butt leave freende believe ye it forsothe yt there is an hundryd thousa^de
thousand fold more bliss than any tunge may tell. or any heart think.

The xiii. chapter
Dives If men had sad feith to have such bliss for their good deeds / there
would no man ne woman do amys. for dread to lose that bliss.


Pauper. It farith by folk borne in prisone. of the wicked world as it does
by a child borne in the deep derk pytt of the prison when it fallith a woman
with child be put i^ prisone. The mother that knowithe the welfare yt she had
out of prison is in much sorrow and care and longith full much to be out of
prisone again in her welfare Butt the child borne in the myscheyf of the
prisone and neuir had knowing of better fare yeueth little tale of ye myscheif
in prison. But aslonge as he has his mother with him and his sustenaunce though
it be fulfeble / he makes no sorrow ne care. He lo^gith after no better fare.
for he knowith no better. For if his mother tell him of the joy and welfare
out of prisone of the su^ne / moan and of the sterres. of the fair flowers
spryngynge. upon earth. of the briddes syngi^g of myrthe / of melodye / of rich
arraye / of lords of ladies / and wealth yt is out of prison. all her tale is
but a dreme to the child. he bileuyth it not / and therefore he longith not
thereafter. and wole natt for all this bliss / and the welefare yt she spekith
of / forsake his modre ne the feeble fare. that he has with her / and that is for
he bileueth it not And yet it is as the modre tellith the child But were the
child onys out of prison. and saw the welthe and myrthe and the welfare which
his mother told him of. he would be full sorry for to we^de aye^ to prison there to
live with his mother For all his life in prison yt was first likinge enough to hi^
should than be full bitter. and he should neuir have joy ne rest in heart till he
came again to that welefare. yt he saw out of prison. Right thus folk of this
world borne and broug^t forth in sorrow and care and much travail in the
prisone of this world / they have so much love and likynge to their erthly
mother and to there cu^pany / yt is to say in earth and in erthely things / for
earth is mother of all. yt they have no likyng in heavenly things / ne long not
thereafter And yet their gostly mother holy church and there gostly fader and god
himself fader of al tellith them of the bliss of heaven It is to the^ butt a
dreme / as is the moders tale to her child in prison / and they have no sad
feith therein And though it be so as our mother holy church tellith us though the
child bileue not yt such welfare be out of prisone / the welfare is neuir the
less. and though erthly couetouse me^ have no liki^g but in earth and in erthly
things bileue not yt such bliss be in heaven yet there is such bliss. and
neuir the less for their falls bileue But had they onys seen and assayed a
little of that bliss / all the joy and likyng yt they have in this world and
in erthly things should be to the^ full great bytternes full of sorrow. and care.
Example we have of sei^t petyr. Whom Criste led upon the hylle of Thabor.
With saint John and James. and there he shewid them but a litel of the bliss
of his manhood. His face shone as bright as the su^ne / his clothes were white
as snow. Moses and Hely aperyd with hi^ i^ great bliss and majesty. Tha^
petir said to our lord. ihu^ Lord it is good to us to be her^ Make we her^
iii. tabernacles one to ye. another to moises and anoyer to hely. and let us al
duel her^ Luce ix. And ^^io^ i^ sight of litel bliss he foryat all the blis of
this world He cared neither for mete dri^k ne clothing For hi^ thought he mit
have lived withoute^ end by the blisful sight and with that cu^pany Also when
seint poule was rauysshed into heuene and had seen the vision of god /
afterward al his lif in this world was to hi^ a pain. so much he longyd
aye^ to yt bliss. And therefore he said Infelix ego quis me liberabit de morte
corporis huius. To. vii. I an vnsely man who shall deliver me fro the death of
this body I coueit to be departed / the soul from the body and be withoute^
end with crist Moses was with god in the mount of synay xl. days. and xl.
nights metelesse and drynkles / fed by the speech of god / and by his
p^sence / and yitt saw he butt little of this bliss For he was not able to see
his bliss / ne no man living in this world / as god said to hi^ that time
Butt leave friend after our death if we keep well gods co^maundmentes and
amend our misdeeds by our life / we shall see his great bliss which neither
Petir ne poule ne moses might se i^ earth And we shall be siker of that bliss
withoute^ end / which bliss as seint poule says yt none erthly iye may se /
ne ere here / ne heart think. ne wit comp^hende In this bliss leave friend I
hope to se you and duelle with you in the high cite of jerusalem in the kings
court of heuene. To which bliss he bring us / that for us dyed on the rode
tree. Amen.


Here endith a compendiouse treetise dyalogue. of Dives and pauper. that is to
say. the rich and the pore fructuously tretyng upon the x. co^mau^dmentes /
