TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVL, RALPH ASSHETON Esquire: one of her Majesty's Justices of
Peace, and Quorum: and of the Oier and terminer in the County Palantine of
Lancaster, and Receiver of her highness Duchy revenues, in the said County:
and the County Palantine of Chester.
RIght worshipful, It would be too tedious, to make particular declaration of
your worshipful favors, from time to time, toward me. I having been
hitherto altogether unable, so much as to make any show of thankfulness for the
same. And seeing it has pleased GOD to make you, many ways, a principal
patron of my good: by means whereof, I have at length attained to somewhat,
whereby I may manifest my self, a well affected member of the common wealth. I
have thought it my duty, to present unto your worship, these first fruits of
my simple skill. Beseeching you, favorably to accept them, as the indeauors
of a young wit, and tokens of a thankful mind. And because I have always
known you a favorer of all good exercises, and namely of Music: I am
imbouldned, to crave your worshipful Patronage of these my labors; whereby I
shall be encouraged, to indeauor my self with all diligence, to put in
practice some others, that may deserve better acceptance. Thus leaving them to
your delightful recreation, and your worship to the protection of the most
high, I humbly take my leave.

Your worships in all duty, John Bennet.
