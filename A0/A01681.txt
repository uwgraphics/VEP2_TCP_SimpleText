terrible. Deu, 10, 17, He is a God of revenge. Deuteronomy, 32, 35 He is able to cast
both body and soul into hell. Math, 10 If a man sin against the Lord who

IT is better to fall into the hands of God then of men, (for his mercies are
great.) 2, Sam, 24, 14 As his greatness is so is his mercy. Ecclus, 2, 21, He
is a gracious God and a merciful. Micha, 4, 2 He is a God of patience and

Our life we lead Gods laws to learn, with will to do the same:

A caveat for Rich-men: Be rich in Faith.
To the end you may use and bestow your goods to your own good, and his
glory that gave them, consider of these sentences pronounced against such as
abuse them. And
Amongst others, read Esaias, chap. 5. verse. 8. Amos, chap. 8. verse. 4. James.
chap. 5. verse. 1.
Like Sheep they lie in grave, Death deuoureth them. Psalm. 49. 14.

Special causes to dehort you from such greedines in gathering, and griplenes
in keeping your goods.
1. The desire of money is the root of all evil. 1. Tim. 6. 10. 2. A man's
life stands not in his goods though he have abundance. Luke 12. 15 3. When
he dies he shall carry nothing away with him. Psalm. 49. 14. 17 4. His goods
will not avail him in the day of wrath. Prou. 11. 4.
Having goods, you ought to give and do good with them, partly to this end.
1. For the glory of GOD. Honor GOD with thy riches. Proverbs. 3. 9. 2. For
good example to others. Let your light so shine before men that they may see
your good works. Math. 5. 16. 3. For a sign of the sincerity of your
prosession. A good Tree brings forth good fruit. Math. 7. 18. James. 2. 18.
If you would know to whom you should give, read Job, chap. 31. verse, 16.
Esaias, chap. 58. verse, 7, Luke, chap. 14. verse, 13.
Zacheus gave the one half of his goods to ye poor. Luke. 19. verse 8.

Why you ought to give to the poor. Because God has commanded ye should
give. Deu. 15. 10. Give to the poor for commandment sake. Ecclus. 29. 9.
Because he has made them as his instruments to try your hearts and charity,
as appears. Deu. 15. 11. Mat. 26. 11


How you ought to bestow your benevolence. It must be done Simply.
Cheerfully. Liberally.
For GOD loves no vain ostentation. Math. 6. 2. For he loves a cheerful
giver. Ecclus. 35. 10 For it is a plague to a rich man to want a liberal heart.
Eccles. 6. 1. 2. etc.


What good insueth in giving to the poor.
1. He that gives to the^ lends to ye lord. Pro. 19. 17. and shall not lack.
Pro. 20. 27 2. He lays up a good store for himself against the day of
necessity. Tob, 4, 9. 3. He shall have great reward in heaven. Math. 25. 40.
What hurt follows by withholding from such.
1. He that hides his eyes from them shall have many curses. Pro. 28. 27. 2.
If they curse thee in ye bitterness of their soul their prayer shall be heard.
Ecclus. 4 3. He that stops his ear at their cry, shall cry and not be
heard. Pro. 21. 13. 4. He that shows no mercy, shall have merciless
condemnation. Iam. 2. 13.
Therefore do good whilst ye may, remembering this saying.
What shall it advantage a man to win the whole world, and afterward loose
his own soul. Luke. 9. 25.

A comfort for Poore-men: Be poor in Spyrite.
To the end thou may bear thy poouerty more patiently, enter into this
consideration.
1. Have thou not a house to hold thy head in. Our Savior Christ himself had
not whereon to rest his head. Math. 8. 20. 2. Have thou little food or raiment.
Paul suffered hunger and cold, and yet (says he) I have learned in whatsoever
state I am in, therewith to be content. Phil. 4. 3. Have thou any thing at all.
Solomon says, better is a little with the fear of GOD, then great treasure
and trouble therewith. Prou. 15. 16. 4. Have thou nothing at all. David says,
he that seeks the Lord shall lack no manner of thing that is good. Psalm. 34.
10. 5. Have thou a few crosses and cares in this world. We must by many enter
the kingdom of heaven. Acts. 14. 22. 6. Have thou many miseries and
afflictions. All that we suffer here are not counted worthy the glory of the
life to come. Romans 8. 18.
Thy poverty may be laid upon thee For trial of thy faith and patience, For
thine amendment.
As it was upon Job. Job. 1. The prodigal son.


Seeing poverty and riches come of God, use these three things in thy
extremity.
1. Prayer. Not to despair of Gods providence. For he is faithful, and will lay
no more upon thee the^ he will make thee able to bear. 1. Cor. 10. 13. 2.
Patience. to take thy cross thankfully. For it is an easy thing in his sight,
suddainlye to make a poor man rich. Ecclus. 11. 21. 3. Labor. to get thy
living if it be possible. For better it were to die the^ beg. Ecclus. 40. 28
and it is a blessed thing to give rather then receive. Act. 20. 35.
If thou do consider what inconveniences and evils be incident, and come
oftentimes with prosperity and riches, thou would be better contented with
thy poor estate.
David said in his prosperity he should not be moved. Psalm. 30. 6.

Riches often times Withdraw us from well doing. Move us to security. Be the
means of our misery.
as appear by the parble of The young man. Mar. 10. The rich man. Luke 12.
Dives and Lazarus.


Heerof it is said. A rich man shall hardly enter the kingdom of heaven. Mat.
19. 23.

Therefore comfort thy self with these consolations, remembering this saying:
Godliness is great riches if a man be content with that he has. 1. Tim. 6. 6.
