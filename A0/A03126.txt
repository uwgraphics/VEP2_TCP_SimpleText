The land of Asye.
THe realm of Cathay is counted and holden for ye most noble and rich realm of
ye world This Realm marches on the cost of ye Occean see. So many yles be
there about in the sea that men may not well know the nombre of them. The
people which inhabet this realm of Cathay be called Cathayns / and among
them be found many fair and comely men and women after their nation. But all
have their eyes very small / and little here on their berdes This people in
their writing have letters / which in beauty and fayrnesse of draught resemble
and are much like unto latten letters / and they speak a language which is
much diverse from other languages of the world. The believe of this people is
much diverse / for some beleuyth in the son some in the moon / some in the
sterres / some in naturs of things / some in the fire / some in the water /
some in the trees / and some believe in oxen because they labor the ground /
where upon this people have their lively sustenau^ce. And some people of this
realm have no law / nor believe at all / but live as brute beestes
unreasonable. These same people which are this simple in their believe and in
things spyritual ar more subtle than all other people in corporal or bodily
works and busynes. And as the Cathayns say / these people be they / which
seyth with both eyes / because of their subtle insyght / in bodyly works.
And they say the Lattyns sees but of one eye / as them reputing less
ingenious and less inuentyfe. But the other nations say that these Cathayns
are but blind / as in reprouynge their subtylyte. By this may we understand
that these Cathayns repute other people of gross wit and understanding / and
them self only ingenyous / and for very treuth out of this realm of Cathay /
are brought many strange and marvelous things of subtle labor and art
ingenyous / whereby this people well seem to be ye most subtell and inuentife of
the world in art and labor of hands. The men of this country ar no strong
warryours nor valyant in arms but they be much subtle and ingenyous / by
mean whereof often times they have dysconfyted and overcome their ennymes by
their engyns. And they have diverse sorts and manners of armours / and engyns of
war which other nations have not In the same land is money current / for
comen and universal dyspences / which money is made of papir inform quadrate
or fouresquared / sygned or imprynted with diverse sygnettes of the lord of the
same land. And ye same coygne is of valor more or less after as it is signed
with diverse impressyons. With this same money there they by and sell all things
co^cerninge their exchaunges and when this same money is impered or worn by
oldnesse or otherwise / he which has the same in possession / shall render it
up in the court of the lord of that land and for the same shall receive new of
equal valor. In this same land / the oil of olyffe is in great scarcyte /
and holden at very dear price. And when the kings and lords may find of the
same they cause it to be kept as a great dear thing / and for medycine. Unto
this land of Cathay marches or bordreth none other land / save only ye
realm of Tharsay on the occident or west part where it adioyneth nerest on all
other parts this realm of Cathay is inuyroned or co^pased about other with
desert / or with Occean see.

Of the realm of Tharsey.
IN this realm of Tarsey / be three prouynces or countries. And the lords of
the same do themself to be called kings they all have one like letter / and
language semblable. The people of these countries be named Iobgontans / and all
times they have been Idolatrers / and so they continue to this present day /
save the nation or kynred of those three kings / which came to worship our
lord Ihesu Christ at his natiuyte / by demonstracyon of the sterre. And the
lineage of the same three kings be yet unto this day great lords about the
land of Tartary / which ferme and steadfastly believe in the faith of Christ the
people of this land of Tharsay / travail nor labor not in feat of arms /
but they be of subtle understanding / and much ingenious to learn arts and
sciences. All ye most part of this people eteth no flesh nor drynketh no
wine / nor kylleth nothing which bears life. They have good cytees and rich
with very great temples wherein they hold their ydols whom they have in great
reverence. In this same land grows plenty of corn / and of other sedys
enough. But wine have they none / but count it great sin to drink wine.
This same realm of Tharsay marches toward to Orient / or Est upon the realm
of Cathay beforesayd / and toward the Occedent or West / it marches to a
realm named Turquestan / toward ye north it marches on a desert / toward the
south it marches on a prouynce / which is called the land of Sune which is
between ye land of Cathay and the realm of Inde. In this same land be found
ye fine dyama^tes.

Of the land of Turquestan.
THe realm of Turquesta^ / marchith on the Est part to the realm of Tharsey
/ on the West part to the realm of Persy / toward the North it bordreth on
the realm of Corasme / and on the Southe part it extends toward one heed of
the wyldernes of Inde. In this realm be few good Cytees / but in it be many
great playns and large feldes of plentyfull and good pasture. Wherefore this
people be al for the most part pastors or Heerdme^ and they be loged intentes
and other such houses which they may lightlye carry from place to place. The
heed cite of this realm is named Hoctecar. In this land grows right little
where / or barley. The people eteth and feed for the most part on Mystlyn and
rysse wine have they none / but they drink Alys and other manner of drinks The
people of the same land be named Turks and all they for the most part /
believe in the false doctrine of ye law of Machumit. And some be among them which
have another / law / faith / nor believe. They have no letters proper unto their
langage / but use ye letters of Arrabya^s by their cytes and towns where
lettred me^ frequent.

Of the realm of Corasme.
THe realm of Corasme is well garnisshed with cytis and towns / and the land
well furnysshed and stored with people. There grows corn sufficyent / but
wine have they little or none. This same realm of Corasme / marches toward
ye Est toward a part of the desert contaynynge largely a hundredth days
iournay in length / toward the west if extends unto ye see called in latten
(mare chaspium) englysshed the sea of Caspy / toward the North it marches on
the realm of Co^manye / toward the Southe it marches on the realm of
Turquestan. The heed cite of this realm is named Corasme / the people of the
land be called Corasmyns. All be panyms and have another law / nor letters
proper unto them self / but believe as greeks and ar under obedience of the
patriarch of Antyoch. In their churches their singing and service is much
diverse / they celebrate and consecrate as greeks. But their language is not
greek.

Of the realm of Comanye.
THe realm of Comany is on of the gretyst realms of the world. This land is
ill in habited for great distemperaunce of the air of the same land / for
some parts of the same be so cold that another man nor best may live in the
same for excessyue coldness. And some other parts and countries be in the same
land / which be so hot in somer that no man may endure there for great hete /
and for flies which there abou^de / this land of Comani is all plain / but no
tree there grows whereof me^ may make timber / nor no busshe there groeth save
in some certain places / Where the inhabytauns have planted some trees for to
make gardens and orchyards. A great part of the people dwells in tents / and
their chief fuel for fire is beestes donge dried. This land of Comany on the
Est part marches on the realm of Corasme / and in part of the same side on a
great desert / toward the West / it marches to the great see and to the sea
called the sea of Reme / toward ye north it marches to the realm of Roussy
/ and on the southe part it extends unto the grettest flodde which men know
in the world / which is called the flode of Etyll. This flod freseth every
year / and sometime dureth frosen all ye hole year in such manner that men women
and beestes pass over the same / as upon steadfast land on hordes / or banks
of the same flode grows some small trees / but on the other part of this
flode toward the west and toward the southe dwell diverse nacyons of pepyll
which count not themself of the realm of Comanie and be not obedient to the
king of Comanye. This nations inhabet about the mou^tain of Cocas which
mountayn is very great and hye, On this same mountayn be bred many great birds
of diverse ky^de and all be white of color. This mou^tayn of Cocas is
between.ii. sees yt is to say the great see which is on the west part of the
same / and the sea of Caspys which is on the Est part of the same. This see of
Caspys has but only one entry toward the Occean see / all the remiuaunt
within is but like a lake or standing water. But for gretnes of the same it is
called a see or Mer. For it is the grettest lake and largest of the world /
this lake or Mer of Caspys extends forth it self from the mountayn of Cocas
unto the heed or begynnge of the realm of Persy / and it departs in fonder
all they countray of Asye. And that same part which is on the Est part of
this lake is called Asya ye less or lower Asya. But that part which is on ye
West side is called Asya the greter / the water of this Mer is not salt but
fresshe and sweet / and in the same is great abou^dance of diverse fysshe Also
in this same land of Comanie are found wild oxen / and in the foresaid mer
of Caspys be diverse yles in which birds of sundry kind make their nestes /
and namely fawkons and marlyons / of such shape and quantyte yt none like may
be found any where else / save in the same yles. The chief cite of the realm
of Comanye is named Sartay which was i^ aunsyant time a right good and rich
cite but at this time it is welnere all wasted and dystroyed by the Tartaryans.

Of the realm of Inde.
THe realm of Inde is a very long land / and bordreth alonge upon the Occean
see which see is called in those country is the sea of Inde. This realm of Inde
begi^neth at the bounds of ye land of Persy / and so exte^deth forth to a
proui^ce or land named Ba^ and I^ these country to be found precious stones
which be called Bal^yses. Toward the north (...) by the long and great desert
of In^ where king Alexandre (...) so great dyuersite of serpe^tes and of
beestes as his history recou^teth: there be found namely all ye Balayses. In
the same land of Inde saint Thomas ye apostle preched the says of Christ and
converted many provinces and countries of the same to the christen faith.
Nevertheless for that the same countries and people be far distant from other
lands where the faith of christ is worshipped right few be in ye same land
which maynten ye faith of Christ for there is but one city alone where christen
men inhabit. And all the other ar become ydolaters. Toward the South part of
this realm of Inde is thoccea^ see. And there about be many yles wherein Indyans
or men of Inde inhabet which be all black / and all go naked because of great
heat. and all these worship ydols. In these yles be found precious stones:
also in the^ groeth right good spices. There is also one isle preemine^t above
the other which isle is named Cela^ / wherein be found the best Rubyes and
Saffirs of the world. The king of the same isle has the most rich Ruby and
grettest which is in ye world. and when the king of the same isle is crowned
he bears the said Rubye this hand for excellence and royalty. This kingdom
of Inde is also in manner of an isle / for on the one part it is enuyroned or set
about with the occean see / by which part^ the entryng into the same land is
not easy sa^e only on the side of the land of Persey. Wherefore such as will
enter into this land of Inde resorteth first of all unto a city named Hermeis
yt which cite the famous philosopher Hermeys made by his great art as it is
written and called it by his own name. From this city of Hermeys they pass
by a streit passage of the sea. Unto a city which is called Courbaeth. In this
city and in the country about ar found ye strange birds called Popyngays and
as great plenty of the same birds is in that country as of Sparois in these
parties. In the same land fyndeth merchants all manner of marchau^dises /
little where and barley grows in this land: but ye people of the same eteth
rysse mystlyne / milk / butter / dates / and other manner of fruytes whereof
they have great plenty.

Of the realm of Persey.
THe realm of Persey is diuyded in.ii. perties howbeit it is all but one
realm / for one lord has always had governance of the same. The first part
of this realm of Persy is exte^ded by the west part unto a fludde named
Physon: which is one of the four fluddes floynge forth of Paredise terrestre
toward ye North it exte^deth unto the sea of Caspis / toward the South it
stretches forth it self unto the sea of Inde. This land of Persy is also in
manner all plain and in the same (...) great and rich cities of wh^ ye one is
named Borraca / and the other Semorgraunt. The people of this country be
called Persyens / and they have a langage proper which they speak. they live
most on marchaundyses and tyllyng of ye ground. Armor nor war^ they meddyll
not gladly at this time vnconstrayned / in ancient time they worshipped ydols
but namely they honored the fire for their god but since time that ye wicked
and false sect of Mahomet spredynge abroad came into those parties yt Persyens
have all ben Sarasy^s and believe in ye false law of Mahumet. The other part of
Persey begins at the fludde of Physo^ and extends on the Weest side unto
the realm of Mede / and of Armeny the great. Toward ye South it marches at
one province of the realm of Inde and in some part at the occean see / and
other part at ye land of Mede. In the same party of Persey be also two great
cities / the one is named Nezabor ye other Spahan / and the manner and custom
of the people of this part of Persey is semblable to she of the other part
aforenamed.

Of the realm of M^de.
THe realm of M^de is ^ry king toward the Eest but it is (...) large. Toward
the East it begins at the (...) of Persy and at the realm of Inde the
lesser in part of the same and (...)death forth by the Weest part unto the
realm of Calde. Toward ye North it begins at the realm of Armeny and
extends (...) by ye South unto the Aquissan which is on the Occean see: and
there be found the grettest and thyrest perlys. In ye realm of Mede be great
mountains and little playing round in the realm of Mede be mountayn^. manner
of people / the one is called sarasyns / and the other Gordyns. And in this
country ben. ii. great cities / the one is called Sarras / and the other Quere^
/ and there they keep the law of Mahumet. And use of Arabyke letters / before
they be good archers.

Of the realm of Armeny.
IN the realm of Armeny be^nit realms of yt which one lord holds all the
lordship / the length of the land of Armeny begins at the realm of Persy /
and extends forth by O^^edent to the realm of Turkey. The bread of Armeny
toward Occedent begins at the great city / which is called Port de ferr /
that is in english the yren gate / the which king Alexander commanded should
be shytte for because of diverse nations of people that resorted into the deep
Asye / yt which he would not that they should pass in the great Asye without his
commandment The said city is in the narow of Caspis see and recheth to the
great mountayn of Cocas. The bread of the realm of Armeny from the said city
extends forth to the realm of Mede. In ye realm of Armeny be diverse great
cities and rich / among the which Towers is the most named in ye land of
Armeny. In Armeny be great mou^tayns and broad playnes great waters / and
fluddes / salt / and sweet / with great plenty of fysshe The people that
inhabit in ye land of Armeny be named by diverse names / after ye manner of ye
cou^trei yt they be inhabited, and there they be good men of war both before and
a horsbacke. And as for harnes and vestme^t they follow the manner of the tartas
/ because that they have been long under their lord. There letes be diverse and
some be named Armonoses and the other Alcen. In Armeny is a great mountayn the
which is the grettest / and that mou^tayn is named Ararach. And there was set
the arcke of Noe after the Deluge / but yet there can no man clyme upon that
mountayn for ye great noise and murmr yt is there both wnyter and somer / but
in the very top of it appears a great black thing which they say that is
the arcke of Noe.

Of the realm of Georgie.
THe realm of Georgie toward thorient has agret mountayn / which is named
Abbers and is inhabited with many diverse nations of people. And for that cause
it is named the country Alayne. And from thens extends the realm of Georgy
by thoccyde^t toward Septe^rrion / to ye proui^ce of the realm of Turkey / ye
length of the realm of Georgie exte^deth all upon the sea toward ye South and
finysshed with ye great Armeni. this realm of Georgi is deuydyd in two realms
/ the one is named Georgie / and the other Abcas. The realm of Georgy is under
the jurisdiction and subjection of the emperor of Asye. The realm of Abcas is
mighty of people and of strong castles and was never subget to the emperor of
Asie nor to the tartas. In ye realm of Georgi appeared a great marvel which I
darre not tell nor rehearse if I had not seen it but for because I was there
and se I dare say. That in Georgi is a prouynce which is called Haynsen yt
which is well of.iii. days journey of length or there about. And as long as
this said prouynce lasts in every place is so great obscurite yt no man is so
hard to come into ye said land / for they cannat cum out again. And the
dwellers within the same land / said that often times there comes noise of
men / cocks crowyng / and horses neynge. And by a fuldd that comes out of
that place come tokens appering that there is resorting of people. Verily they
find in thistores of Armeny redyng and Georgi that there was a cruel emperor
in Persy named Sanorelx this emperor worshypped the ydols / and cruelly
persecuted the criste^men. upon a day he commanded yt all they that dwelled in
Asye should come to do sacrifice to ye ydols / and they yt would not come should
be put to death. Among the which it happened that some true criste^men received
the martyrdom or they would sacrifice ye ydols. some sacrified for fere of death
/ and for fere of losyng of their te^porall goods / and the other fledd a way
into the mountayns. In that time inhabyted diverse good criste^men in a country
which is called Morgan. which criste^men for soke their goods and fled away
toward Greece. And when they were in ye country abouesayd / the said cruel
emperor met with the^ / and commanded that all the said christian men should be
cut all to pieces. and tha^ the said criste^me^ made a great cry to our lord god.
And sone after came this great darkness that blinded the emperor and all his men.
and so the criste^men escaped and the said emperor with his me^ caryd in ye said
darkness* and there they shall abyd as they believe to ye worlds end.

Of the realm of Caldee.
THe realm of Caldees toward thorient begins at the mountayns of Mede and
exte^deth to the great Ninyue the old city which is nygh to the fludde of
Tygres. This Ninyue is the city of the which ye holy scripture speaks. And in
yt which was Jonas the profet send to prech ye commandment of god. This
city is now all wasted but for cause yt it is yet well apparau^t it is seen
that it is one of the most grettest cities of all ye world / the brebe of the
realm of Calde toward Septe^trion begy^neth at a city yt is called Maraga /
and exte^deth to the South to thoccean see. The grettest cite in the realm of
Calde is called Babylone. In this land Nagabudonosor brought Anthetinoyson the
children of Israel when he took Iherusale^. In ye realm of Calde be great
playnes and few mou^tay^s and not much coming waters. the people that is
inhabyted in Calde be called Nostoryus and used of Arabe letters / and keep the
false law of Mahomet.

The realm of Mesopotamy.
THe realm of Mesopotamy toward or^^r begi^neth at the great city Mosell yt is
nigh to the flud of Tigres. and exte^deth by thoccydent to ye cite of Rohais
which is set upon ye flud named Eufrates. this city of Rohays was king Agers
to who^ our lord send the ve^nicle yt is no wat Ro^e. and nygh to this city
is the land of Baram in yt which dwelled Abraham and his kynred in the old
time When our lord commanded him that he should leave this land and pass ye
flode of Eufrates / and come to the land of promyssson that is the Holy land
as is contained in ye bible. This is called Grioise and the land of Mesop. for
cause that it is between the two great flodes Tygris and Eufrates. The bread of
the realm begins at a mountayn / which is called Sanson in Armenie and
extends by mydday to the desert of Arabe the least / in this land of
Mesopota. be great playnes abundant and delectable. And great mountayns with
great plenty of fruytes and of goods One of the mountains is called Symar /
and the other Lysson. In the said realm is not much ronnynge water / but the
people of this country drynketh well water out of cesterns. In this realm of
Mesopotamy inhabet christen men / some be Siryens / some Armyns and the other
sarasyns. The syriens and the sarasyns of the said country medyll with no deed
of arms / but they be shepardes and laborers of the ground for the most
part / except some that dwelled in a country that is called Meredyn / the
which be good archers And they ben called Cordyns.

The realm of Turkey.
THe realm of Turkey is much rich and there be mines of silver brass / and
other good enough. And also there is plenty of where / wynes / and fruytes /
and also there is much catell / and good horses.his land ends by ye great
Armeny / toward the orient and with the realm of Georgy / toward the occydent /
and extends to the cite of Satalie / which is upon ye see of greece toward
Septentrio^ and has no ends with any other land. And extends of length in
length upon the sea side / and toward Midday ends part with the second
Armeny / and with Sylice / and part extends to the sea of greece and to the
sight of the isle of Cipres. And the said realm of Cipres is called greece of
all the people of the Orient / for cause that in the old time the emperor of
greece kept that land as his own / and ruled all the land by officers yt he
send thither every year. And after that the Turks took the said lordship of
Turkey. They ordained a lord among them yt which they called their sowdan /
and from that time the Turks inhabyted in the said land / and than it was
named Turkey. And there be many good cities. The first province is called
Helcone / yt is the noblest cite of Elconye. The.ii. is named Capadoce / that
is the cite of the great Caesar of greece. The thryde province is called Saury
and there is the cite of Salern. The.iiii. is called Briquie and there is ye
cite of Lichoe of greece. The.v. is called Quisiton and there is the cite of
Effeson. The.vi. is called Depictrony and there is the cite of Niquie. The.vii.
is called Pascagonie and there is the cite of Germana polis. The.viii. is
called Genesti and there is the cite of Trapesonde and this only prouynce is
made a realm within few years. For when the turks took the lordship of turkey
they could not take the cite of Trapesond nor no place lo^gyng thereto /
because there were so many strong castles. And so it remained to the emperor of
Constantinoble / and the said emperor had a custom to send a bailey yt was
called duke to govern the said land And it fortuned so that one of the dukes
rebelled against the emperor and took the lordship of Trapesonde for him self
and made him self to be called emperor / all they yt dwell in the said land
be greeks. we put Tarpesonde in ye nombre of ye proui^ces and not in ye nombre
of the realms. After as we find in the histores of ye Orie^t. In the realm

Sithe that we have spoken of the.xiiii. pryncipall realms that be in Asye we
shall speak after of the emperors of Asye the which has holden the lordship
of Asye after the birth of our lord Ihesu Christ after the rehersynge of the
hystores of the Oryent.

How the king of Persy was first emperor of Asye.
AS saint Luke says in his gospel the emperor of Rome Caesar Augustus held
the lordshippes of all the world in that time that our lord Ihesu Christ was
borne / after that came a king of Persye which was called Cosserossath he rose
against the emperor of Rome and made him self to be called ye emperor of
Asye. This emperor took the lordeshippe of Persy / of Mede / of Armeny / and
of Calde / and his power encerased somoch that he drove the emperor of Rome and
his men from all the foresaid lands. And the Persyens reigned in Asye the
space of.CCC. years. And after the Sarasyns took the said lordship from them
as here after shall be declared.

When the sarasyns entered into Syri.
IN the year of the incarnacion of our lord.vi.C. and xxxii. years / the
euyllsede of Mahomet came into ye realm of Syri^ And first they took from the
greeks hands then oble city of Damas and after they ocupyed all ye realm of
Sirie. After they came and be seged the city of Antyoche. When the emperor
Eracles men were come to a plain that is named Pofferit the sarasyns came and
met them / and thrre began a great battle that lasted long / but at the end
the sarasyns had the victory. And so many me^ were slain in the same battle /
that ye bones yet be seen in ye field / of the which thing the greeks yt kept
the city of Antioch were so a frayed in so much that they delyuerd the land
into the sarasyns hands by appoyntme^tes. Than the enemies of the holy faith
ocupyed / Cylice / Capadoce / Lyconie / and other rich lands / whereof they
rose in so great pride that they apparellyd galeys and ships and went to
Constantynople / and first they aryued in Cipres / and there they took a city
that was called Constance / and there was the grave of saint Barnabe ye apostle
/ and when they had taken all ye riches of the said city / they brake ye
walls down to the foundation / and never sith the said city was inhabyted.
And than they departed and came to the isle of Rhodes and took it / with other
diverse yles of the Rhomayns lands / and brought prisoners without nombre. And
after they went to Constantinople and laid thereto sege both by see and by
land / in great fere were the cytizens in somoche that they cried our lord
mercy / whereof it fortuned god that is merciful send a great tempest of wynd
and rain in that somer. That all the galeis of the sarasyns were broken and
the enemis almoost all drowned / and than the sarasyns returned without doing
any other thing.

How that the sarasyns entered into the realm of Mesopotamy.
When the christen me^ of Consta^tynople se that they were delyuerd by the
grace of god / they made a sole^pne day for to worship god for ye honor of
their salvation which day is kept every year to this day with great worship
After that the sarasyns were refresshed a certain time after they thought to
gather a great number of people to take the realm of Mesopotamy / and Calde.
That were of the lordship of the realm of Persy / the king of Persy that was
called Asobari oath feringe the great might of ye sarasyns send his messangers
to the king and to ye lords his neighbors that were at the side of the flode
of Phison / and required the^ of help and socoure promysinge great gifts to
all them yt should come. And upon that they came together to the realm of
Turkey about four thousand men of arms that were called Turkmens and they
moved for to com and help the king of Persy against the sarasyns / and so
they passed over ye flode of Physon. But for cause it is the manner of that
people to carry wives and chyldern with them where so ever they go / they could
not take great iourneis. The sarasyns that were in the realm of Calde that had
taken the said realm thought that if the host of the Turkmens should come to
gether with the host of Persy they should not lightly aco^plyssh there own
men of the realm of Persy and took counsel to send to the king of Persy /
and ye king of Persy yt could not choose put hy^ against the^. And thereby a city
yt is called Maraga / began a great battle which lasted long in yt which was
of both parts many men slain. and at the later end ye king was slain in
the battle and so dyed this was in the year of our lord god.vi.C. and.xxxiii.

How the sarasyns chose their sowdan.
AFter that the Sarasyns had taken the lordshyp of Persye and diverse realms /
in Asye they chose there among them a lord the which they called the Sowdan
that is to say king in latten tongue / the foresaid Sarasyns took the
lordshyppe of the land of the great Asye except the realm of Abcas that is in
Georgy and a countray in the realm of Armeny yt is called Gla^segarfordis /
these two countries holden against the Sarazyns so well that they could never
have ye lordship of it. And there the cryste^ men fled a way for fere of
their enemies of ye Turkmens yt came for to help the king of Persy we shall say
some thing shortly because that their hystory shall be of more clear
understanding / the abouesayd Turkemens came to a land that is called Corasten
and there they herd tydinges of ye undoing of the Persyens and of the kings
death / wherefore they would go no farther / but they thought to hold this said
land of Corasten for them self and thought that they should keep it well
against the said Sarasyns whereof it hapened that ye Sarasyns brought a great
host together and came against the^ / the Turkme^s feryng ye battle / did
send their messe^gers to the Calyfe of baldach proferynge them to his
commandment the which thing pleased much ye said Calyfe and to ye sarsyns /
and so the received the Turkmens to a trust and chased them out of the said
land of Corasten and put them out to dwell i^ a another land where yt they
should not fere their rebellion and ordained that they should pay every year a
tribute to the lordeshyp. And in this manner abode the Turkemens under the
lordshyp of the Sarasyns long time / to ye time that the sarasyns took ye
lordshyp of Persy / Mede / and of Calde. And there they turned all to the false
law of Mahomet. And after it fortuned that the Calyfe of baldach commanded to
come before him all the most old and wysest men of the Turkmens and desired
them yt they should believe in Mahometes law. And yt they should teache the other
Turkmens to believe so / and promised them to do them great grace and honor if
they would do his commaundment / the Turkmens that had no law were lightly
consenting to the Calyfes will / whereof it came that ye Turkemens yt
were.lxiiii. nations were made all sarasyns / except two kynredes that were
deceived of the others. And tha^ they began to love the Turkmens and to do them
honor and grace. And so long dwelled there the Turkme^s that they multiplied
of goods and people / and there humbly and wisely kept themself. And the
sarasy^s kept ye lordshyppe of Asye.iiii.C. and.xviii. years / and after they
lost the said lordshyp as we shall deuyse here after.

A cuniuracyon among the sarasyns.
IN that time it happed that a great debate fell among the Sarasyns which
lasted in co^tynuau^ce.xxx. years / that the sowdans and the lords of the
lands would not obey to the sowdan of Baldache / but they rose against him /
and so the Sarsyns power began to mynisshe. In yt time was in Consta^tynople a
valiant Emperor which was called Diogines / the which began valiantly to enter
into the lands that the Sarasyns had taken from the christian men in the emperor
Eraclos time / and to recover the noble cytyes of Antyoch / sylice / and
Mesopotamy the other lands the sarasins kept till the time that the Turkmens
took it from them as it shall be dyuysed here after.

The first reygnynge of the turks in Asye.
IN the year of the Incarnacion of our lord. M.li. began first the Turkmens
to have the lordshyp in Asye in such manner that when the Turkme^s were
multiplied of men and goods and se the great trouble yt was among the
sarasins they thought to have risen again wherefore they came together and chose
among them a king that was Salyoth / and before that they had never lord of
their kindred wha^ they had yt done they began so valyantly upon the sarasyns
that in short shace they had and ocupyed the lordship of Asye but to the
Calyfe of Baldoche they did him no grefe / but they yielded him great honor /
whereof it came that ye Calyfe more for fere than for love ordained Saliothe
lord of the Turkmens. But not long after the emperor Salioth dyed and after
him was his son made lord which was called Doloryssa / this man moved ye
war against the emperor of Constantyple and took diverse lands and castles a
Greece. And after he send to the realm of Mesopotamy one of his cosyns which was
called Artothe unto ye which he gave men ynow and gave him the realm of
Mesopotamy and all the other lands that he might get against the Greeks / than
the great Artothe went with a great no^bre of men and laid sege to (...) city
of Rohays and took all the land of Mesopotamy / he took his own sege in the
city of Meredy^ / and there made himself sowdan / in that time dyed Dolorissa
king of Persy / and his son which was called Alpassele^ / kept the lordship
after him / this Alpasselem had a neuewe yt was called Solyma^ / which long
time had served his father / this Solomon was much valiant in arms /
wherefore the foresaid king of Persy Alpasselem gave a great number of men of
war to his neue we Solomon / and send him to Capadoce and granted him to hold
and keep all yt he could take upon the greeks. And upon that went Solomon and
entered in the realm of Turkey and there took cytes realms / and castles and
almoost all ye land put them under his lordship wherefore he did chau^g his name
and was called Solymansa. and of these men the hystores makes mention of
Godfray debullayns passage when he fought with the pylgrimes and did them
much harm or they could pass ye lands of Turkey.

How ye Greeks were driven out of Asye.
AFter that dyed Alpasselem the turks emperor / and tha^ was his son made
emperor / which was called Melacaceraf the which send a commaundment to Artoth
ye sowdan of Mesopotamy and to Solimansa the sowdan of Turkey that they should go
and lay sege to the cite of Antyoche / wherefore they brought together a great
host and laid sege to Antyoche the which the greeks kept. And not long after
they took it / and so were the greeks driven out of all the lands of Asye /
by the might of the enemies of ye christian faith. And than after Melacaceraf
the emperor of ye turks dyed and laft two chyldern the first was called
Balryaro the which kept the lordshyp after him / but his brother that was more
valya^t in arms ocupyed a great part of the lands of Persy / and at that time
that Godfray de bullen passed the said Balryaroth was emperor of Asye and
Solymansa was sowdan of Turkey and did many enterprises to ye pylgrems or they
could pass the lands of Turkey.

How the Christian men laid sege to Antyoche
When the Emperor of Persy understood that the christian men had laid sege to the
cite of Antyoche / he brough together a great people of the realm of Turkey /
and send for them for to socour the cite. Or the turks could come / yt might
of ye enemies were so great yt they laid sege round about the cite / wherefore
the christian men that had laid sege before / were themself beseged / and at
the later end our pilgrims fought against this great number of enemies so well
that by the grace of god ye other were all disco^fyted / and Corberam ye chief
captayn slain / they yt escaped out of ye battle went again into Persy And
there the found yt their emperor Balryarothe was deed / than his brother would
have take ye lordship but his enmis did rone upon him and kylde him / great
trouble was among the sarasyns in somoch that never sith they could not agree
to make no emperor nor general lord / but they began to make war the one
against ye other wherefore the Greces and the Armenys of the great Armenye entered
upon them and drove them out of all the lands of Persye both their wives
and chyldern and so they went into Turkey and there they kept the lordship i
great prosperyte till the coming of ye Tartas the which ocupyed the land and
lordship of Turkey as it shall be declared here after.

How the Corasmyns conquered the realm of Persy.
IN the realm of Corasmy^s was a manner of pepyll that dwelled in the mountayns
and in the feldys fedynge their beestes the which were bold men of arms /
these men understood that the realm of Persy was without a lord wherefore they
thought for to conquer it lightly. And than they came together and did chose a
lord among the^ which was called Ialaady^ and when they had so done they went
to the noble city of Torys without any co^tradictyon of / any man / and there
they dwelled and made their lord Ialaadyn Emperor of Asye for they thought to
occupy other realms of Asye as they had taken ye realm of Persy / this
Corasmy^s rested there certain days and there they were al full of goods and
riches of Persy / whereof they took so great pride yt they entered into ye realm
of Turkye and thought to have ocupyed it and enjoyed it / but the sowdan of
Turkey that was called Ialaady^ gethared his host and fought against the
Corasmyns and over came them and drove them out of Turkey and Ialaadyn their
Emperor was slain in battle / and they that escaped went into the realm of
Mesopotamy / and than came to gyther into the plain of Royhas and there they
took cou^sayl between them to enter into the realm of Syry which was at that
time governed by a Lady / and then the Corasmyns came and brought together
again the host and entered in to Siry. And this noble Lady brought her men
together in ye cite of Halap and nygh to the flode of Eufrates / came to mete the
Corasmyns and fought there great was ye battle / but at the later end the
Corasmyns were overcome / and fled away toward the desert of Arabe / and
after they passed over the flod of Eufrates nygh to a castle that was called
Racabe and entered into the realm of Syry and came to the province of Palastyne
that is in the realm of Hyerusale^ and did great damage to the christian me^ as
it apereth in ye historis of the passage of Godfray debullayn / and at the last
this Corasmins began to murmr and would not obey to their lord / and than
they departed so that some went to the sowdan of Harms and to other sowdans.
Which were.v. in Syry. When that ye Corasmins duke that was called Beretall /
se yt his men were wasted / send his messa^gere to the sowdan of Babylon and
proffered him his service / whereof the sowdan was right glad and received him
with a good will and did great honor to ye duke and to them yt came with him
and departed the Corasmyns by all his lands because that he would not have
them all together. And because of that / the sowdans power of Babylon rose
much for the coming of the Corasmyns / that before was right small. And in
conclusyon and in short time the natyon of the Corasmyns came to naught And then
after the Tartas began to have the lordshippe.

What cou^tray the Tartas inhabited first.
THe land and country there as the Tartas dwelled / first is between the
great mountain of Beligian of this mountayn speaks the hystores of Alexander
there as he makes me^cyon of the wild men yt he found. In that country
dwelled first ye Tartas as beestysshe men that had no faith / nor law. But
went from place to place as beestes fedynge. And of other natyons they were
kept subgettes to the which they were servants to diverse natyo^s of Tartas
that were named Malgothz came together and ordained captayns and governors
among them. And so they multyplied so much that they were departed in vii.
nations. And to this day these nations be taken more noble then the other. The
first of this nation is called Tartar / the second Ta^gothe / the thryde Curach
/ ye.iiii. Jason / the.v. Sonithe / the syxte Mangly / and the.vii. Tebethe.
And as it happened that these.vii nations dwelled in the subgectio^ of their
neighbors as is before said. It fortuned a poor old man that was called
Cangius saw in dremynge a visyon / the which to him semyng was a knight in
armor upon a white horse / that called him by his name. And said unto him
Cangius yt will of thy immortal god is such that he owes to beshortli
governor made upon the.vii. natyons of ye Tartas yt ben called Malgothz and yt
by him they shall be delyuerd out of the saruage that they had long ben in /
and shall have worship upon their neighbors / Cangius rose up merrily herynge
the word of Christ / and rehearsed the vision yt he se to all the gentilmen /
but they would not believe but skorned him wherefore it fortuned the night
following the captayns of the.vii. nations se the white horse in vision as
Cangius had rehearsed. Which commanded by the immortal god ye they should obey
all to Ca^gius / and that they should keep all his commandments. wherefore
ye.vii. captayns abouesaid / brought the people together / and did make
obesaunce and reverence to Cangius. And they them self did so as to their
natural lord.

How Cangius was elect emperor of the Tartas.
AFter that the Tartas ordained a seat in ye mids of them all and put there
upon the ground a black carpet and made Cangius to sit thereupon. And ye vii.
captayns of the.vii. natyons raised him up with the said carpet and set him
upon the seat. And named him Can / and with knelinge did him all honor and
reverence as to their own lord.

Of the solempnyte yt the Tartas did to their lord In ye time should no man
maruayle of it / for peradventure they could do no better or they had no
fayrer clothe to set him on / but for that they would not change their first
usage. It is marueyle seeing yt they have conquered so many lands and realms
and yet they keep their first manner / for they will choose their lord and twyse
have I ben at thelectyo^ of the Tartas emperor / they assemble together in a
great field / and he that should be their lord they caused him to sytte upon a
black carpet and put a rich seat in the mids of them all. And than after
came the noble men and ye chief of his kynred and lift him up on hye and set him
upon the seat / and after did him all honor and reverence as to their
natural lord / and for all the lordship or riches yt they have conquered they
wode never change their first gyse. And after that Ca^gius Can was made
emperor by the common will and consent of all the Tartas. First of all or
Cang. Can would do any other thing he would know if they all would be obedient
unto him and than he commanded.iii. commandments. The first commandment
was that they should all believe and worship one god immortal by ye which he
was made emperor And forth withal the Tartas began to believe and worship god
/ and reclamed ye name of god in all their warkes and deeds. The second
commandment was yt they should view and nombre all them that were able to
bear harnes / and ordained that upon every.x. should be a captayn / and over.C.
a captayn and over.x.M. was a captayn / and they called the company of the.x.
thousand Thoman.

After that he commanded to the captayns of the.vii. natyons and lynages of
the Tartas that they should yield up all their arms and lordships. And yt they
should hold and pay unto him as he should or dayn them. The.iii. commau^deme^t
that Ca^gius Can made was thought much cruel to them all / for he commanded
to the foresaid vii. great captains that every one should bring his eldest
son before him / and when they had so done. He commanded them yt every
captayn should stryke of his sons heed / the which co^maundme^t they thought
was much felon / and not for because yt they should fere ye people. But because
yt they knew well yt Cangius Can was made emperor by commandment of ye
immortal god. And so every one of the.vii. captayns struck of his sons heed.
And than when Ca^gius Can knew the good will of his people / and se that they
would obey him unto the death. Than he commanded that they should be
apperylled in knights armor with him.

How Cangius Can was saved by a bird.
When Cangius Can had ordained well and wyselye his battle he entered into the
lands of the^ yt had long time kept the Tartas subgettes and fought with
them and over came them all / and put their lands in his subiectyon. After
that Cangius Can went forth co^querynge lands and countries / and all things
went as he would. Upon a day it happened that Cangius Can rode with a small
company / and met with a great nombre of his enemies / which set sharpley upon
him. Ca^gius Can defended him valyantly but at the last his horse was slain
under him. And wha^ Cangius men se that their lord was in the prese
incontinent they lost their corages and began to fle away. And their enemies
chased after the^ / and took no head to Ca^gius Can the emperor that was a foot.
When Ca^gius Can se that he hyd him in a little busshe that was nere. The
enemis that had ye victory began to search for them that were fled / and as
they would have serched the said busshe wherein Ca^gius Can was hyd. A byrd that
is called a duke / came and sat upon the said busshe. And when they that sought
for Ca^gius Can se the bird sitting upon ye said busshe there as Ca^gius Can
was they supposed no body to be there And deperted saying if any body were
there the bird would not sit there / and so they went away with out any more
serchinge thinkyng that no body should be in the said busshe.

How and wherefore the Tartas were feathers.
When that night came Cangius Can went out of the busshe / and did so much
that he came to his men and counted to the^ all his adventure. And how ye byrd
light upon the busshe there as he was hyd / and for that cause his enemies
serched not for him. And than the Tartas re^dred grace to god / and from
thensforthe they had the said bird / which was called duke in great reverence.
For who that might have a feder of ye said bird gladly would were it upon his
heed. Of this history I have made mencyon to the end that ye should know whereof
the Tartas were the feders upon their heedes Cangius Can rendered grace to god
that he was so delyuerd in yt manner.

After yt he assembled his host together and fought with his enemies and
discomfyt them and put them all in his subjection. And Cangius Can conquered
all the lands that were from thens to ye mountayn of Belgyan and held them /
so much that he se an other vision as it shall be devised here after. When
Cangius Can had conquered ye lordships of all those countries that were a this
side ye mountain of Belgyan upon a night it happened that he se in vysion the
white knight again the which said unto him Cang. Can the will of the immortal
god is that thou pass the mountayn of Belgyan / and thou shall co^quere the
realms and countries of diverse nations / and shall reygne and be lord over
them. And to the end yt thou shall know that this that I say is the will of the
immortal god.

Rise up and goo to the mount of Belgian with all thy men / and wha^ thou shall
come there where ye see is joining to the said mou^tayn you shall discende with
all thy men / and shall knele.ix. times against the Orient / and shall pray to
the immortal god / that he will show yt the way. And he shall show yt / the
way and so thou may pass with all thy people. When Cangins Can was waked out
of his sleep / he believed well in ye vision and forthwith commanded his men yt
they should get the^ to horse for he would pass the mountayn of Belgian. Than
they rode forth till they came to the sea and there they could not pass over
/ because there was no passage great nor small. And in contynent Cangius Can
descended from his horse / and commanded to all his army yt they should light
and knele down.ix. times toward the Orient / and yt they should pray to
almighty god immortal / that he would show the^ the way to pass. And all ye
night Cangius Can and his men abode i prayers. And on the morrow Ca^gius Can se
that the sea was gone from the mountayn.ix. foot and they had a fair large
way. when Ca^gius Can and his people se that thing they marueyled much of it
wherefore they yielded grac to god and passed all toward the parts of the Orient
as it is rehearsed in the Tartas histores.

How Cangius Can fell sick.
AFter ye Cangius Can had passed the mountain of Belgian he found much water
marese and the land desert so much that or he and his people could come in a
good land they suffered great penure. After yt they found good lands and
plentyfull of all things wherefore they dwelled in the country many days and
reposed them. And as it plesed god a great sykenesse took Cangius Can and than
he commanded to come before him.xii. sons that he had and commanded them
that they should ever be all of one will and acorde and gave them such
example. He commanded that every one of the^ should bring an arowe. And wha^
the.xii. sons were com together he commanded to his first son yt he should
take all the arowes and that he should break them with his hands. And so his
first sonn^ took the said arowes but he could not break them with his hands /
and than he took them to his second son but he could not break the^. And
than Cangius commanded that the arowes should be deperted and commanded to
the leest of his sons yt he should take every one of the arowes by theymselfe
/ and that he should break them. And tha^ the child brake all the.xii. arowes.
And than Ca^gius Can turned him toward his chyldern and said to them /
wherefore could you not break the arowes as I commanded you / and they said
because that they were all together. And than he said wherefore has this little
child broken them / and they answered that because that he brake them every
one by themself. Than said Cangius Can it shall come so by you for as long as
ye shall be all of one will and one acorde / your lordshyps shall ever last / and
when ye shall be departed one from an other / soon after your lordshipes shall
torn to naught and shall not continue. Diverse more commandments and examples
gave Ca^gius Can to his children and to his men / which the Tartas keep yet in
great reverence.

How Cangius Can the emperor dyed.
When Cangius Can had that done seeing yt he could not live long he made one of
his sons / the best and wysest lord and emperor after him. And commanded
that they all should obey unto him and serve him as their natural lord. And
this said son was called Hactoca. After that the good emperor and first of
the Tartas dyed and passed out of this world / and his son Hoctoca held the
lordships after him. And before yt we make an end of thistory of Ca^gius Ca^
we shall say how the Tartas have the no^bre of.ix. in great reverence and honor
/ in worship of the.ix. knelynges / and of the.ix. foot that the sea went back
from the coost and made way of.ix. foot. Where they passed all they mountayn of
Belgyan by the commandment of god / the Tartas have the no^bre of.ix. in
great reverence. Wherefore he that will present any thing to his lord / and
would that his present should be received graciously. He must present the
nombre of ix. and so is the usage of the Tartas unto this day.

How Hoctoca Can made war in Asie.
HOctoca Can yt was emperor of the Tartas after the death of his father
Ca^gius Ca^ which was valya^t good and wise / and also his people loved him
well / and were to him faithful and true evermore. Hoctoca Can thought to
conquer all the land of Asie / and before that he deperted from the land
there as he was / he would know the power of all the kings that were in Asie /
and would know which was the most pusaunt. Purposynge to fight first with him
/ for he thought that he should lightly overcome the other if he might co^quer
ye most mighty. Tha^ Hoctoca Can send a wise and a valiant captayn which was
named Gebesabada / and send with him.x. thousand fighting men and commanded
them yt they should enter into the lands of Asie. And to view the state and
condicyon of the said land / and if they found any mighty lord whom they were
not able to resyst / they should shortly return back again. As Hoctoca Can
commanded it was acomplysshed for ye said captayn with his x. thousand Tartas
entered sode^lye into the lands of Asie / and there he took cities and lands.
Or the inhabitauntes were ware / or before that they could make them ready to
battle or defend the^ / they kylde all the men of arms / but they did no
harm to the people They took horse / harnes / vitayle and all such things
that they neded / and went so far in the land that they came to the mou^tayn
of Cocas. For this mou^tayn of Cocas one can not pass the deep of Asie into
great Asie / but by the license of the people of a cite that the king Alexander
closed upon a narowe see that touches the mountain of Cocas. This said city
was taken by these.x. thousand Tartas / in such manner that the inhabytantes
of the said cite had no space nor time to defend them self. And than they took
this cite and all that was therein / and put all the me^ and women to ye swerd
And after that they brake down all the walls of the cite / because that wha^
they should come again they should find nothing against them. This city was in
the old time called Alexander / but now it is called port de far. The
renown of the Tartas was sprede over all the countries and lands whereof it
fortuned that the king of Georgi which was caled ynaims brought his host
together and came against the tartas and fought with them in a plain that is
called Morgam. The battle lasted long / but at the end the Georgyens were
constrained to fle away as discomfyt. The tartas passed so far that they came
to a cite of turkey that is called Arseon / and than they understood that the
sowdan of turkey was nere / and how he had assembled his host together.
Therefore the tartas durst go no farther / seeing that they were not able to
encounter against the sowda^ of turkey / they went back again by an other way
to their lord. The which they found in a cite that is called Amelect / and
told him all that they had done / and found in the land of Asie

When the tartas learned first letters.
When Hoctoca Can understood the manner and condicyon of the land of Asie. He
thought that there was no prince that was able to withstand him. And than he
called three sons yt he had / and gave them great riches with a great nombre
of men of arms. And commanded them to enter into the land of Asie /
conquering all the realms and lands. And commanded to his son^ Iochi that he
should go toward the parties of Occident unto the flode of Physon. And to his
second son that was called Bacho he commanded that he should keep his way
toward Septe^trion / and to ye leest that was called Chasada commanded that
he should ride toward ye South. In this manner he departed his three children and
send the^ for to conquer these lands and prouynces. After that Hoctoca Can
sprede his host abroad by ye countries / so much that the fore front of his
host rought to the realm of Cathay / and the other front to the realm of
Trase. In those parts the tartas learned leters / for before that time they had
no letters and therefore the dwellers of the said country were all ydolatours.
The tartas began to honor the ydols but many of them confessed ye immortal
god gretter than ye other. After that the emperor Hoctoca Can gave to his eldest
son that was called Bacho.xxx. thousand tartas that were called Tanachy that
is to say conquerers / and commanded that they should go that way yt the.x.
thousand tartas kept and yt they should tarry in no land till they should come
into ye realm of Turkey / and more over he commanded yt they should prove if
they were able to fight against the sowdan of Turkey / and if that they did se
yt the sowdans power were to great they should not fight with him / but they
should do so much to one of his children which should be next them yt he would
give them help and men of war. And than after they met began the battle of
Bacho with.xxx. thousand tartas went so much by their iourneis yt they came to
the realm of Turkey / and there he understood that the sowdan that had dryued
away the.x.M. tartas was deed. After him one of his son^es yt was called
Giriacadyn was made lord. this sodan was in great fere for the tartas coming
/ and than he gathered and waged all manner of men that he could have as
Barbarins and Latyns / yt had two captayns of the which one was called John de
la limynate / which was of the ple of Cipre. And ye other was called Bonyface
de moulins / and he was of the cite of Venyse.

Of the battle ye was between the sowdan of Turkey and ye tartas.
When the sowdan of Turkey had gathered his host of all the parties. He came
and fought with the tartas in a place that is called Asadache / the batell was
great and many men slain of both parties / but at the laterend the tartas had
ye victory / and entered into the lands of Turkey and conquered the said lands.
In the yer of our lord god.M.CC.xliii. And than not long time after Hoctoca
Can the emperor of the tartas dyed. And after him one of his sons was made
lord / which was called Guyot Ca^ / this Guyot Ca^ lived not long after him.
One of his cosyns was made lord which was called Ma^go Can / ye which was much
valyant and wise and conquered many lands and lordships / but at the end as a
man that has a great heart he entered upon ye see. And as he laid sege to an
isle the which he would have taken by ye see side. The men of that land that
were subtle send for men yt coud swym under the water / which me^ entered under
the vessel in ye which Mango Can was in. And there they tarried so long under
ye water that they brake the vessel i^ diverse places / so much ye the water
entered into the said vessel of the which thing Ma^go Can took no head till the
said vessel was well nygh full / and began to synke under ye water. And so was
Ma^go Ca^ the emperor of the tartas drowned / his me^ went home again and made
his brother lord yt was called Cobila Can / the which kept the lordship of the
tartas.xlii. years. And made them christen men and closed a cite which is
called Ioing / yt is gretter than Rhome. And in this city dwelled Cobila Can
which was the.v. emperor of the tartas till the last end of his days. We
shall leave to speak of Ma^go Can and shall return to speak of Hoctoca Cans
children of Halcon of his heirs and of his warkes.

How Iochy conquered the realm of Turquestan and Persy.
IOchy the first son of Hoctoca Ca^ rode toward Occyde^t with all his men that
his father had given hy^ And conquered the realm of Turquestan and of Persy the
left / and than he went to ye flodde of Physon / and there he found the
countries full of all goods and dwelled in the said country in rest / and
peace / and multiplied in great richesse. And unto this day ye heirs of the
foresaid Iochy hold ye lordeship of the said land. And there be two lords
that hold the lordshippe of the said land. The one is called Chapar / and the
other Thochay / and they be brethern and live in rest and peace.

How Bacho and a great part of his men were drowned in ye river of Austrich.
BAcho the second son^ of Hoctoca Ca^ with the men that his father had given
unto him rode toward ye parties of Septentrion / and did so much that he came
to the realm of Comany. The king of Comany thinking well for to defend his
land / gathered his host and fought against the tartas / but at the end the
Comayns were disco^fyt. And they drove the^ Comains unto the realm of Hongrye
and yet unto this day be many Comayns dwelling in Hongry.

After that Bacho had driven the Comayns out of the realm of Comany. He
entered into the realm of Roussy and took it / and he conquered the realm of
Gezere / and the realm of Bulgary. And after he rode to the realm of Hongry /
and there he found some Comayns and took them. After yt ye tartas passed toward
Almayn and did so much yt they came to ye river syd ye ran by Almain by ye
duchy of Austrych. ye tartas thought to pass by a bridge that was there but the
duke of Austrych caused the bridge to be garnysshed / so yt the tartas could
not pass over. and when Bacho se that he could not pass over the bridge.
Herydde into the water with his horse and did begin to swym / and than he
commanded to his men that they should pass over swymming Wherein he put him
self and his men in great danger. For before that they could pass over their
horses was so weary yt they could swymme no lengar. And so Bacho and a great
part of his men were drowned in the foresaid river of Austrych or they could
pas over / or come to the other side.

When the other Tartas that were not entered into the water se their lord Bacho
/ and their other company drowned. Full sorry and heavy they daperted and went
back to the realm of Roussi and of Comany. And never after the Tartas entered
into Almayn.

The heirs of the said Bacho hold the lordshippe of the realm of Corasme /
the realm of Comany / and the realm of Roussy. And he that is now lord was
Hoctoca Can^ third son which was called Chacaday.

How Iochy received his brother Chacaday.
CHacaday the third son^ of Hoctoca Can with his me^ that his father had given
unto him rode toward the Southe / till he came to the perties of Inde the
leest. And there he found much void land and no men dwelling therein. And so
he could not pass but he lost his men and many of his beestes. After that he
went toward the Occydent / and did so much that he came to his brother Iochy
and rehearsed to him all his fortune.

Iochy received his brother and his company full humbly and gave unto them part
of his lands that he had conquered. And in contine^t were the two brothers to
gyder and there men in good peace and rest. And he that is now lord is called
Baretath.

How and when the king of Armeny laft his own country and came to the king
of the Tartas. And how he required.vii. peticyons of him.
IN ye year of our lord god a thousand two houderde and three and fyfti. Hayton
ye king of Armeny of good remembrance seeing that the tartas had conquered
all the countries and realms to the realm of Turkey. He took counsel for to
go to the king of the Tartas and to take with him his goods and his friends.
The king of Armeny by the counsel of his barownes send before for his brother
sir Symme Batat constable of the realm of Armeny. And than the constable went
to the realm of the Tartas and to the lord Mango Can and brought him many
rich presents / and was courtesly received.

And when he had accomplysshed well all his besynesses for the which his
brother the king of Armeny had send him for. Veryli he tarried four years or
that he came again into Armeny / and when he had told to his brother the king
what he had done and found. By and by the king apparylled him and his men of
armens and went pryuely he and his men by Turkey / for that / that he would not
be known. And he merre with a captayn of the Tartas the which had over come
the sowdan of Turkey / the king of Armeny gave him knowledge and told to him
how that he was going to the emperor of the tartas. And than the said captain
gave him company to bring him to ye port de ferr. And after yt the king found
other company yt brought him to the city of Maleth / and there was Mango Can
the emperor of the Tartas / the which was eight glad of the king of Armenes
coming. And received hy^ honorably and gave him great gyf^es and great graces.
After that the king of Armeny had tarried certain days / he made his requests
and required of the emperor seven things.

The first thing that the king required of the emperor was / that he and his
men should become christian men / and that they should be baptized. The second
that he required that perpetual peace and love should be between the tartas
and the christen men. The third he required that in all the lands that the
tartas had conquered and should conquer the churches of ye christen men as
priests / clerks / and all the relygious persons should be fre and delyuerd of
all seruagl. The.iiii. yt the king required of Mango was to give help and
counsel to deliver the holy land out of the Sarasyns hands / and to put it
again into the christenme^s hands. The fifth he required that he would give
commandment to the tartas that were in Turkey yt they should help to distroy
the city of Baldach and the Calyf that is chief and techer of the false law of
Mahomet. The sixth he required a privilege and co^maundme^t that he might have
help of ye tartas that were nygh to the realm of Armeny when he should require
them. The.vii. request was / that all the lands yt the sarasyns had taken that
were of ye realm of Armeny / that after was come into ye tartas hands should
he restored freely unto him. And also all ye lands yt he might conquer against
the sarasyns that he might hold them without any co^tradiction of the tartas
in rest and peace.

How the emperor Mango Can and his barownes agreed to the vii. peticio^s of ye
king of Armeni.
When Ma^go Can understood the requests of the king of Armeny before his
barownes and all his court answered and said. Because that ye king of Armeny is
come from far countries into our empire of his own frewyll. It is metely yt
we shall fulfill all his requests. To you king of Armeny we shall say as we be
emperor we shall be baptized first / and shall believe in ye faith of christ / and
shall do christen all the^ of our house. And shall keep all ye faith that the
christe^men hold to this day / and to the other we shall give them counsel
that they shall do likewise / for ye faith will have no body by force. The
second request we answer and will that perpetual peace and love shall be among
the christe^men and the tartas / but we will that ye shall be pledge that the
christenmen shall hold good peace and true love toward us as we shall do
toward the^* And we will that all the churches of the thristenmen / prestes /
cleckes / and all other persons of what degree or condicyon so ever they be
seculer / or relygiouse persons shall be free and delyuerd of all seruages. And
also they shall be defended from all manner of hurt both of body and goods.

And upon the deed of the holy land we say that we shall go personally with a
right good will for the honor of our lord Ihu christ But for because yt we
have much to do in those parties / we shall command to our brother Halcon yt
he shall go with you for to fulfill this warke. And shall deliver the holy land
fro the sarasyns power and shall restore it to the christenmen. And we shall
send our commandment to Bacho and to the other Tartas that be in Turkey and
to the other yt be in that countries that they shall obey to our brother
Halcon. And he shall go to take ye cite of Baldach and shall distroy ye Calyfe
as our mortal ennemy.

Of the privilege that the king of Armenye requyringe to have help of the
Tartas / we will that the privilege shall be diuysed all after his own mind
and pleasure all we command and confirm.

And all the lands that ye king of Armeny required that should be restored
unto him / we grant it with a right good will. And command to our brother
Halcon that he yield to him all the lands that were of his lordshyppe and more
over we give unto all the lands that he may co^quere against the sarasyns. And
of outspecyall grace we give him all the castles that be nere to his land.

How Ma^go Can was christened at the request and desire of the king of Armeny
/ and diverse other of his people. And how the king of Armeny and Halcon went
to the Assasyns countries.
When Mango Can had fynisshed all the peticions and requests of the king of
Armeny. Soon after he caused a bishop to christen him / which bishop was
chaunceler to the said king of Armeny. And after he caused all his household
servants to be chrystened / and many other both men and women. Than after he
ordained men of war that should go with his brother. And than Halcon and the
king of Armeni with a great compani of men of arms rod till they came to the
flodde of Physon / and did so well that or syx months were at an end
Halcone occupied the realm of Persy / and took all the lands and countries
there as the Assasyns dwelled. That be men without any faith or belefe save that
they have a lord the which is called ye old mountayn did teache them to
believe and they be so much obedient to their lord yt they put themself to
death at his commandment.

In the said land of Assasyns was a strong castle well fornysshed with all
manner of things that was called Tigado. Halcon commanded to one of his
captayns of the tartas that he should lay sege to the said castle / and that he
should not depart away till he had taken the said castle. And than the tartas
tarried to besege ye said castle without any deperting.xxvii. years And at
thend the Assasins yielded the castle for defaut of clothyng and for no other
thing. When Halcon understood the taking of the said castle the king took leave
of Halco^ and returned unto Armeny and tarried there.iii. years and a half after
in good health thanked be god.

After that Halcon had ordained the guard of the realm of Persy he went into a
delycate country that was named Soloch and there he tarried all the so^mer in
great rest when the wether was cold again Halcon went and beseged the cite of
Baldach and the Calyf that was master and techer of Mahometz law. And when he
had gathared his host he caused the cite of Baldach to be assailed upon all
perties And did so much that they took it by force / and as many men and
women as they found they put the^ to the swerd. The Calyf was brought alive
before Halco^ / so much richesse they found in the city of Baldache that it
was wonder to behold it. And than Halcon commanded that the Calyf with all
his treasoure should be brought before him. And than he said to the Calyfe
know thou not that all this tresour was thyn / and he answered ye. Than said
Halcon unto him / wherefore did you make no good ordinance and prouysio^ for to
defend your lands from our power. And than the Calyf answered him / he
thought that the old women had been sufficyent to defend the land. Than said
Halco^ to the Calyf of Baldach / because that you art master and techer of
Mahometz law / we shall make the feed of these preciouse tresour and richesses
that thou have loved so much in thy life. And than Halcon commanded that the
Calyf should be put in a close chamber and that some of his tresour should be
laid before him / and yt he should eat of it if he would. And in the same
manner the wretched Calyfe endede his life / and never sithe was Calyfe in
Baldache.

When Halcon had taken the city of Baldach and the Calyf and all the countries
about. He departed the lordships / and put in each of them baylies / and
governors as it plesed him self. And he did much honor to the christen men
and put the sarasyns in great seruage ever after.

A woman that was called Descotacon / which was a good christen woman and was
of the lynage of the three kings yt came to worship the nativity of our lord
Ihu^ Christ. This said woman made to be builded again all the churches of the
christen men / and caused all the temples of the sarasyns to be put down / and
put them in so great seruag and subiectyon that they durst not come abroad.

Why Halcon send for ye king of Armeny for to come to him.
When Halco^ had refresshed him the space of an yer and his men in the cite of
Rohais. He send for the king of Armeni that he should come to him / for he was
disposed to go and deliver ye holy land and to restore it again into ye
christen men's hands. The king of good remembrance was full glad of the said
commandment and gathered a great host of valyant men a foot and a horsbacke.
For in ye time the realm of Armeny was iprosperyte so yt he made.xii.
thousa^de horsemen / and.xii. thousand afote and that have I seen in my days
When the king of Armeny was come he held a parlyment and counsel / to Halcon
upon the deed of ye holy land. Than said the king to Halcon / sir the sowdan of
Halap / holds the lordship of the king of Anyne and of Syrie. And sith yt ye
entende to go to the holy land me think it for ye best to lay sege first to
the cite of Halap / which is the most strongest cite in the realm of Syrie.
For if we may take the cite of Halap all the other may be lightly taken. Halcon
was well pleased with the king of Armenis counsel. And than he laid sege to
the cite of Halap / which had full strong walls / but the tartas took the
city by mines that they had made under the ground / and by other craft and
ingins that they did make / they took the city byforce in nine days. But
there was within the city a castle that was so strong that it defended them
that were within a leven days after that they had take ye city Great
haboundaunce of riches and other substance found the tartas When they were
entered within the city of Halape. And so Halap was taken / and after that all
the realm of Syrie.

In the year of our lord god a thousand two hundred and threskore. When the
soudan of Halap that was at that time in the city of Damas understood that the
city of Halap was taken by the tartas. And that they had taken his wife and
his children / he knew not what to do / but yield him self to the mercy of
Halcon thynkinge by that mean that Halcon should render to him his wife and his
children and part of his land. Than Halcon did send the sowdan his wife and
his children to the realm of Persy because that he might be ye more surer of
him.

After that Halcone departed great richesse among his men / and to the king he
gave a great nombre of goods. And also he gave him of his lands and castles
that he had conquered / and specially diverse that were nygh to the realm of
Armenie. And after the king furnysshed the castles with his men. Than after
that Halcon did send for the prince of Antioch which was the king of Armenes
son / and did him great grace and honor. And did give him all the lands
and lordships that he had taken from the sarasyns.

After that Halcon had ordained all that was needful about the city of Halap
/ Damasse / and the other lands the which they had conquered and taken from
the sarasyns. As he had thought to entered into the realm of Jerusalem for to
deliver the holy land unto the christen men again. There came a messangere to
him and brought him word that his brotheh was deed and passed out of this
world / and how the barownes fought for to have made him emperor.

How ye Halcon departed out of the realm of Syrie.
When Halcon had herd this tidings he was full sorye for his brothers
death. And by the counsel of his me^ he went away and left one of his
barownes that was called Garboga with.x. thousand tartas / for to keep the
realm of Syrie. And commanded that all the lands that had been in the
estriste^ men's hands should be restored again. After that he went toward the
Orient / and left one of his sons at Thores which was called Agaba / and from
thens departed Halcon and went to the realm of Persy. And when that he was
com thither tydinges was brought unto him how Cobyla his cosyn was made emperor.

Wha^ Halcon understood those news he would go no farther but returned again to
Thores there as he had left his son his household / and his servants. As
Halcone tarried at Thores there came new tydinges unto him ye Barta / which at
that time held the lordship yt Bacho held. Which was drowned in the flodde
of Austrich as he was cominge to have e^tred into Halco^s lands. And wha^
Halcon herd that he gathered his host together and came against his ennemys.
And between Halcons men / and Bartas men was a great battle upon a frosen
river or an yse / and for the great heaviness of the men and beestes the yse
brake and there was drowned above.xxx. thousand of the tartas. And than the
both parties returned back again without doing any more And made great
lamentatyon for the death of their friends.

How Ginboga and the men of Saiectfyll at varyaunce.
GInboga the which Helcon had left with him.x. thousand Tartas in the realm of
Syri / and went to the Palestines perte / which kept the land in peace and
worshipped and loved much the christen men For he was of the three kings kynred
which came to Bethelem to honor the birth of Christ / Ginboga trauayled much
to recover ye Holy land. And than the devil put great trouble between him and
the christen men yt were of the parts of Saiect. For in the land of Belfort
that was of the lordshyp of Saiect was diverse towns in the which the sarasyns
dwelled and paid a tribute to ye Tartas whereof it came that the men of Saiect
and of Belfort came together to make a course and robed the said towns from
the said sarasyns / some were slain / and some were brought prisoners. One of
Ginbogas neuiewes was in that country and went after the christen men with a
small company a horseback and as he began to blame them of that / that they
had done and would take the prey that they brought. Some of the christen men
ran upon him and so kylde him. wha^ Ginboga understood that ye christen men
of Saiect had slain his neuiewe. He rode with his men and came to Sarepte / and
as many christen men as he found put the^ to the sword / but ye people of
Sarepte went away in the isle and but few slain / Ginboga did put fire in
the cite and brake the walls and never sithe Ginboga had never trust nor love
with the christen men of Syrie nor his men. After that the Tartas were driven
out of the realm of Syrie / by ye power of the sowda^ of Egypt As it shall be
declared here after.

How ye sowda^ of Egypt drove the Tartas out of Syri.
IN that time ye Barca began war against Helcone / as we have said before /
the sowdan of Egypt gathered his army and came into the Palestins countries.
In a place that is called Haymelot and there he fought with the Tartas / but
they could not abide the sowdans power and so they fled back with their
captayns. It was said that Gynboga was slain in the battle / the Tartas that
escaped from the said battle went into Armenie. At ye time the realm of Syrie
turned to the sowdans power / but some cytes that were by the sea that the
christen men kept. When Helcon understood that the sowdan of Egypt was entered
into the realm of Syrie / and yt he had betyn his me^ and kylde them. He
gathered his host and send to the king of Armenie / to the king of Georgy /
and to the other christen men of the parties of Syrie / that they should be
ready to go with him against the sowdan of Egypt. And when Halcon had all his
army ready for to go to the realm of Syri a sharp synenesse took him that
held him.xv. days of which he dyed and so his death let the going into the
holy land. After hy^ his son Albaca he^de^ the lordeshippe of Halcon. This
Albaga would ye Ambyla his uncle should confirm him his lordship which thing
he did with a good will because that he knew well ye Albaga was the best and
the wysest son that Halcon had / and so he was called Albaga Can. And began
as raygne in the year of our lord god a thousand.CC.lxiiii.

How Albaga would not become christen which fortuned him ill.
ALbaga yt was much valyant and kept wisely his lordeshyp and was much
fortunat in all manner of things save that he would not become christian as his
father Halco^ was / and so he was any do^er. And an other thing was that he
made war upon his neighbors / which caused him that he could not overcome
the sodan of Egypt / and because of that the ^dan of Egiptes power increases
much. yet the sowdan of Egypt did an other subtle point for he send his
messangers to the ta^tas that were in the realm of Comany and of Roussy / and
made couenable peace and love with them And ordained if Albaga would come into
the land of Egypt that they should invade his lands and that they should war
upon him. And for this co^posicyon the sowdan had great ^y to have ye
christe^mens lands of Syri / and for that cause the christe^men lost the cite
of Antyoch and many other. As it is written in ye cronicle book of the holy
land.

Bendonedar which was sowdan of Egypt was much mighty and puysaunt. He send
his host into Armeny / but the king was gone to the tartas. Than his two
sons gathared the host of Armeny / which was at that time of great power and
came against their ennemys and fought with the^ The battle was great but at
the end the christenmen were over come / and of the two sons the one was
taken prisoner / and the other slain in battle. And than the sarasyns entered
in the land and wasted all the plain of Armeny. The christe^mens power was
much minyshed because of that / and the puytaunce of the sarasyns power was
much enhaunced. When ye king of Armeny understood this tidings of his sons
and of the land he was much sorrowful and thought in his mind how yt he might
do harm to his ennemys. Thanne went he to Albaga and to ye other tartas
desiryng and prayeng the^ that they would come to help the christe^men. The
king trauayled much but Albaga would not go for because yt he had war with his
neighbors. The king seeing yt he could not have help so shortly of the tartas
/ send his messa^gers to the sowdan of Egypt and confirmed peace with him to
thyntent that he might have his son out of prison. And the Sowda^ made
poyntment with the king that he should render unto him one of his fellows which
was called Sangolagar that the tartas kept / and that he should yield to him
again the castle of the land of Halap / yt he held / and he should give to
him his son again. The king did so much that the tartas gave him Sa^golagar
the sowdans fellow above said / and the king yielded to the said fellow ye
castle of Trepessache / and two other castles that he brake down at the
sowda^s request. And in this manner the king of Armenis son Baron Lynon was
delyuerd out of the prison of the sarasyns.

After that the king Hayton of good remembrance which had done great good to
the christe^dom i^ his life / gave his realm and lordship to his son^ Lynon
above named / and left the pride of this world and took ye order of relygion
and changed his name after the gife of the Armins and was called Macayres and
than the king Hayto^ dyed monk. In the year of our lord god a thousand two
honderd.lxx.

How Albaga took the traitor Pernana and put him to death.
THe son^ of king Hayton Baron Lynon^ was wise and valy (...) and governed his
realm and his lordship wisely. He was well beloved of his people and the
tartas did to him great honor. This fayd king Lyno^ took much labor for to
grave the sarasyns by the tartas. And diverse times send his messangers to
Albaga yt he should come for to help to recover the holy land / and to
confound the power of Egypt. At that time the sowdan of Egypt entered with his
power into the realm of Turkey / he kyld and drope out all ye tartas that were
there / and took many lands and countries. By a traitor that Albaga had made
chief captain of Turkey that was called Parnana / which turned and was
obeydient to the sowdan of Egypt / and took much labor for to drive the tartas
out of Turkey. When Albaga understood this tydinges. He gathered his host and
rod hastily / for of.xl. days iornay he made but.xv. and came to Turkey. Wha^
the sowdan knew of the tartas coming / he durst not abide but fled away
hastily and Albaga send his men forward and before yt the sowdan might come
and return into the realm of Egypt. The tartas over took ye last part of the
Sarasyns host in a place is called Lepas Blaur, and entered into the sarasins
host and took.ii.M. horsemen and gate great tichesse / and more over they
took.v.M. houses of Cordyns that were in the said parties. And than Albaga had
counsel that he should not enter into the land of Egypt for ye great hete yt
was there / and for their horses that had so much labored And than Albaga
returned to turkey and took the lands and the cites / and did so much yt he
took Parnana And sone after as the manner of ye tartas was / Pernana was put to
death / and than Albaga commanded that in all manner of his mete that he should
ete / should have some of ye flessh of Parnana / and so Albaga did ete of the
flesh / and gave some to his men. And yt was the vengeance that Albaga took
of the traitor Parnana.

How Albaga proffered ye realm of Turkey to the king of Armeny.
When Albaga had taken all the lands and had ordered ye realm of Turkey to his
pleasure. He did call before him / the king of Armeny and profred him to have
and hold the realm of Turkey at his pleasur / by cause yt the king of Armeni
and his kynred had ever ben true to ye tartas. The king of Armeny as a wiseman
thanked much Albaga of so great a gift / and excused him saying yt he was not
sufficient to govern two realms. For the sowda^ of Egypt took much labor for
to do hurt to the realm of Armeni / and than ye king of Armeny cou^selled to
Albaga that he should not give the lordship of the realm of Turkey to a sarasyn.
This counsel plesed much to Albaga / and so he would yt no sarasyn should have
no land nor hold in Turkey.

After that the king of Armeni prayed to Albaga yt he would go or send his
brother to deliver ye holy land out of the sarasyns hands and to give it to
the christe^men again. Albaga promised him that he should do it with a good will
and commanded to the king of Armeny that he should send to the pope and to
the other kings and lords / of ye christe^men of ye occydent that they should
come or send their men to ye help of the holy land / for to keep the lands
and the cytes yt they should co^quer. Than ye king of Armeny deperted and
returned into his lands and send his messa^gers to the pope and to ye kings
of the occident / and wha^ he had ordained yt / that was needful to the realm
of Turkey He came to the realm of Corasten there as he had left his household /
Be^donedar was poisoned as he returned to Egypt and could not return on live
to the cite of Damas. Of Bendonaders death were the christe^men glad / and the
sarasyns much sorry for he was a valy ant man of arms. After Be^dona der was
one made sowdan yt was called Melecset / but he tarried not long for he was put
from ye lordshippe. And one that was called Esly was made sowdan.

Of the battle between Mangadamor and the sowdan.
When the time and ye season came that Albaga might ryd for to enter into ye
land of Egypt. First he send Mangadamor with.xxx.M. tartas / and badde that
they should occupy the king Anyne of Syri. and he would ride after. And if ye
sowdan should come against the^ that they should valya^tly fight with him. And if
the sowdan durst not come in the battle / he commanded that they should occupy
the lands and the cities / and that they should deliver them into the
christe^mens hands to keep. Ma^gadamor rod with.xxx. thousand tartas that
Albaga his brother had given him And the king of Armeny put him in his company
with a great nombre of horsemen. when Mangadamor and the king of Armeny entered
into the realm of Syri they went wastyng the sarasyns lands to the cite of
Hames / that is called la Chalemelle. Which is in the mids of the realm of
Syrie / Before this cite is a fair plain and there was the sowdan with all his
power. The sarasyns on one part / the tartas / and the christen men of an
other part. Began to fight. The king of Armeny that co^ducted the right part
of ye host set them in array / and set upon the lift part of the sarasyns
host and discomfyt the^ / and drove the^ be end the city of Hames three leges
and more. And ye constable of the tartas yt was called Halmach Bech / set upon
the right part of ye sarasyns host and overcame the^ And than every of them
went to a city that is called Thara / Mangadamor that tarried in the field se
come a company of Bednyns / and put him in great fere / as a man that had
never seen battle / and without reason departed from the field with the
victori. And left the king of Armeny and the constable that were gone after
their ennemys. When the sowdan se yt the tartas were departed from the field. He
went upon an hill with iiii. thousand horsemen / when the king of Armeny
returned fro the disconfiture / and found not Ma^gadamor. He was much a
basshed which way he was gone he rode after. Ameleth the constable tarried.ii.
days for his lord Ma^gadamor / and also he was much abashed of the way that
he went / and when he knew that he was gone. He rode after with his men till
he came to the river of Eufrates and could not overtake Ma^gadamor. And so by
the fault of the said Magadamor they left ye field and the battle / when they
had the victory. The tartas went again into their countries / but the king of
Armeny suffered great travail and much loss of his people through fault of
vitayle / the me^ and beestes were so weary that they could not go. And than
they departed a sonder and went by diverse ways / there as the sarasins were
and dwelled in the said countries which took and slew many of the christian
men. And so ye most part of the king of Armenis host was lost / and almoost
all the gentylmen were slain. This mysfortune happened. In the year of our
lord god.M.CC.lxxxii.

How Albaga and his brother was poisoned by their famulyer servants.
When Albaga understood this tidings he send and commanded that his barownes
should come in all the have unto him. And so Albaga gathered a great host to
thyn ^Lent to enter into the realm of Egypt / but it happened that a sarasyn
came into the realm of Persy the which did so much and gave gifts to Albagas
famyliar servants / that they gave to Albaga and to his brother poison / and
so they lived but.viii. days after And so Albaga Can dyed. In the year of our
lord god a thousand two honderde foureskore and two.

After the death of Albaga Can the barownes came together and ordained one of
Albaga Ca^s brothers that was called Tangader this Tangader was greter than any
of the other brethern. When he was a child his name was Nychole / but after
that he was made lord / he took the sarasyns company and did call him self
Mahomet Can. He put all his wit to convert ye tartas to the false law of
Mahomet. When many of the tartas were converted to the sarasyns law. This
Mahomet that was the deuyls son did break down all the christenmens
churches / and commanded yt they should not worship the law of Christ / nor
the name of Christ. and put away all the christe^men / prestes / and
relygiousmen / and did prech Mahometes law through all his lands. And he send
his messangers to the sowdan of Egypt and made promise of peace and love / and
promised to the sowda^ that he should cause all the christe^men that were in
his land to torn^ and to be sarasyns / or else he should put them all to death.
Of this the sarasyns were all glad / and the christe^men were sorry and of
great disconfort. In so much that they wist not what they should do / but put
them self into the mercy of our lord god. For they se come upon them great
persecucions. The said Mahomet send to ye king of Armeny / to the king of
Georgy / and to the other christen men of the Orient that they should come to
him. The good christenmen were in great thought and great fete. All the while
that the christe^men werein so much trybulation under the lordshippe of this
evil Mahomet / but god yt is with the^ that belyue in him send to the
christe^men a great confort. For a brother of the said Mahomet and one of his
neuewes that was called Morgo^ / rose against him for his evil warkes / and
gave knowledge to the emperor Cobyla Can how he distroyed and preched to the
tartas that they should torn to the sarasyns law. When Cobyla Can understood
that he send a commandment to Mahomet / that he should leave his evil warkes /
or else he should rise against him. Of this matter Mahomet was sore dyspleased
and did so much that he took his brother and kylde him. And than after he went
for to take Argon / but Argo^ put him in a strong castle that was in a
mountain. Mahomet did lay sege to the said castle / and at the end Argon
yield him self saving his own life and his servants.

How the false Mahomet was slain by his neniew Argon.
When Mahomet had his neuiewe under his power he delyuerd him to one of his
constables for to keep. And after ordained that his men should come softly
after him and he hy^ self would go toward Thoris / there as he had left his
wife. And commanded to the constable that he should secretly kill his neuiewe
Argon / and that he should bring hy^ his heed to Thoris. A great mighty man
found him / yt which Argons father had norysshed and done much good to him.
This said man had great py^e upon Argon / and than upon a night came and slew
the constable / and all them that were of his company. And delyuerd Argon from
death and out of prison and made Argon lord over them all / and to him they
were obeyd^ent and ready to do him service. When this was done Argo^ rydde
hastily and did so much that he ouertoke Mahomet Can or yt he came to Thoris
/ and incontynently he cut him all in pieces. And after this manner the cursed
dog Mahomet fynisshed his life / the second year of his reygne.

In the year of our lord god a thowsande two honderde.lxxxv. After yt Mahomet
was deed Argon was made lord of the Tartas and the great emperor confermed
him in his lordship / and would that he should be called Argon Can. And because
of that Argon was much more worshipped than any of his au^cytours. This Argon
was fair and plesaunt of visage and a storng man of body and kept his
lordshyppe wisely. He governed well his lordshippe and he loved well and
honored much the christe^men. And ye churches of the christe^men that Mahomet
brake down / Argon caused the^ to be new made again. And than came to him the
king of Armeny / the king of Georgy / and ye other christe^men of the Orient /
and prayed Argon that he would take pain to deliver the holy land. Whereupon
Argon took aduysme^t entendyng to make peace first with his neighbors / to
thyntent that he might go the more surer against the sowdans power. And as it
happened that Argon was in yt good purpose. In the fourth year of his raygne /
as it pleased god he dyed. And one of his brethern yt was called Kalgato was
made lord after him. This said Kalgato was the vnprofitablyst lord that ever
reigned in that country since Ca^gius Can was made lord as it shall be rehearsed
here after.

How Kalgato was drowned by his own people.
IN the year of our lord god M.CC.lxxxix. After ye death of Argon Can his
brother Kalga to held the lordship. This said Kalgaro believed not well / nor
he was nothing worth i^ arms / but demeaned him self like a foul be / in
etyng of denteth meres and drinking of sweet wynes to fill his belly. Non
other thy^g did he in.vi. years while he kept his lordshippe. For the great
peuisshnesse that was in him his own people began to hate him and to disprayse
him / and so at the end his own people drowned him. After ye death of this
Kalgato one of his cosyns was mad lord / which was called Baydo. This said
Baido was a good christe^ma^ / and did much good to the christe^men but he
lived not long in this world.

After the death of Kalgato Baydo had the lordship of his brother This man as a
good christe^man caused the churches of the christe^men to be builded up again
/ and commanded that none should prech the law of Mahomet in his land. Of yt
the sarasyns that were multyplied were sore grieved. and tha^ the sarasyns and
the tartas send pryuely / to Consan messa^ges which was Argons son / and
promised him yt they would make him lord and that they should give him Baydos
lordship if he would forsake ye christen faith. Casan that set not much by the
faith of Christ was lightly turned / for he was much couytus to have the
lordship / and was content to do after their desire. Whereupon Co^san rose /
than Baydo gathered his host and came against Consan / and knew not the
treason of his people.

How Casan was deceived by the traitor Chapchap.
When Baydo thought to come against Co^san all they that kept Mahometz law
deperted and went toward Casan. When Baydose yt his men had betrayed him he
turned back again / but Casan send after and took him and so as Baydo fled
away he was kylde and than Casan took the lordshippe.

After Baydos death Casa^ kept the lordship he showed him self much proud to
the christe^men / and that did he for the pleasure of the^ that had put him in
the lordship above said but sith yt he was fermed in his lordshyp. He began to
love much the christe^men and hated the sarasyns / and he did much profet to
the christen land. First he put to death all them that gave hy^ counsel to
do hurt to the christenmen. After that Casan commanded that all his men should
be ready wtin a year / of all manner of things that they had ^^ed to. For he
would enter into the land of Egypt and put out the sowdan / and send to the
king of Armeny / to the king of Georgy / and to the christe^men of the parties
of the Orient / that they should be ready to come with him. When the season was
come Casan rode with all his power and came into the city of Baldache. When
Casan came into the sowdans lands / he brought his men together. The sowdan of
Egypt that was called Malecuaser gathered all his power before the city of
Hames / that is in the mids of the realm of Syrie. Casan understood that the
sowdan was coming for to fight against him. And for cause of yt he would not
tarry / for to take castle / nor town / but he went straight to the place
there as the sowdan was / and lodged by the host / within a days journey. In
a medowe wherein was great plenty of grass / than Casan commanded that they
should give rest to all their beestes / that were labored in coming haste lie
so far way. In the company of Casan was a sarasyn that was called Chapchap /
which had been baylie of Damas and was fled away for fere of the souda^.
Casan had don many honors and graces to the said Chapchap and trusted him
well. And than it happened that the said Chapchap / send by his letters to ye
sowdan of Egypt all the secrettes and counsel of the Tartas / and send to the
sowdan that he should come hastily against Casan to the battle. And as his men
and his beestes were weary / than it fortuned that the sowdan of Egypt / which
did purposlye tarry for Casan / went into the countries of Hames by the counsel
of the said Chapcha the traytoure. And came hastily with all his power to
begin upon Casan / and to make him a frayed. The kepers of Casa^s host gave
knowledge of the sowda^s coming And than Casan commanded to all his barownes
that they should ride all in order i^ their batayles / against the sowdan and
his men / and Casan rode ever with as many of his men yt were by him / and came
against the sowdan which came hastily with a great nombre of the beast men of
his host. When Casan se that he could not undertake the tail and that his me^
that were abroad could not come to him so soon. He tarried there and commanded
to all them that were with him that they should light a foot / and that they
should put their horses about them. And with bows and arowes they should beat
their ennemys down / that were coming and ro^nyng as fast as their horses
coud bear them / than ye tartas descended before and put their horses between
them / and held their bows and their arowes ready in their hands / abydinge
till their ennemys were come nere to them Than the tartas shot their arowes all
together and made the^ that came ro^nynge first to fall upon ye ground / and
the other that came after fill upon them / and so ye one fill upon an other.
And they shot still and well for they were good shoters / so that few of ye
sarasins skaped / but yt they were slain or hurt. When the sowdan se that he
went back again. And tha^ Casan commanded inco^tinently to his men that they
should lepe upon their horses / and that they should valiantly set upon their
ennemys Casan was the first that went to fight against ye sowdan and ran into
the prese with such small company that he had with him till all the barownes
came to the battle Than began the battle that lasted from the son^ rising
till none / at the end the sowdans host coud not endure before Casan. For with
his own hands he did great meruelles / and the sowdan with his people fled
away. Casan and his me^ chased them till it was dark night / and they slew as
many of their ennemys as they coud take Than there was so many sarasy^s slain
that the ground was all covered with them. The said night Casa^ tarried in a
place that is called Caner / full glad of the victory that god had given him.
This battle was / in ye year of our lord god a thousa^de three hundred and one
/ the wednisday before Christmasse.

How the city of Hames was conquered.
AFter that Casan commanded to the king of Armeni and to one of his barownes
that was called Molay / that with forty thousand Tartas they should go after
the sowdan unto the desert of Egypt that was well twelfe days journey from ye
place there as the battle was / and commanded that they should tarry his
coming in the country of Cassore. The king of Armeny and Molay with.xl.M.
tartas deperted and went after the sowdan / and as many sarasyns as they could
take they kyld them. The third day after Casan commanded that the king of
Armeni should come back again for he would lay sege to ye cite of Hames and
commanded ye Molay should go after ye sowdan. But ye sowda^ ran away night and
day upon co^nynge horses / in the company of Bednyns that were his gyde. And i^
this manner myserably the sowdan entered into Babylon without any company / the
sarasyns fled away into diverse wodes there as they thought to skape better.
and a great part of the Sarasins kept the way toward Triple the which were
taken and kylde by the christe^men that dwelled at the mount of Lyban. The
king of Armeny returned to Casan and found that the cite of Hames was yielded
to Casan / and all the riches that the sowdan and his men had was brought be
fore Casan. And they marueyled greatly all that the sowdan and his men had
brought with the^ so great riches there as they though to feyght. When Casan had
brought to gyder all the tresure and riches that were gotten he deperted all to
his me^ And I fere Hayton has been present to all the great besinesse that the
tartas had to do with the sarasyns. From Halcons time hyderto / but I herd
never speak that no lord of the tartas did so great a deed in two days as
Casa^ did. For the first day of ye battle Casan with a small company of men
proved himself against the sowdan and a great no^bre of his men / and of his
person did sowell that he was named above all other in battle / and of his
person shall be spoken among the tartas evermore. The second day the fredome of
Casan was great for all ye riches that he had gote^ that was without nombre he
deperted it to his men in such manner / that he kept for him self but one swerd
and a purse of ledderfull of writings and deeds of the land of Egypt. And all
the remnant he gave freely / and marueyll it was yt so little a body might have
so great virtue for among a.M. men coud not be so skle^der a man nor so evil mad
nor a fouler man / he surmou^ted all other in prowess and virtue. And for
because that Casan is of our time we must speak of him le^ger than of the other
/ for this sowdan that was overcome by Casan is yet lyuenge. And moreover all
them that tarry the passage of the holy land may take there many good examples.

How they of Damas yielded them self to Casan.
AFter ye Casa^ had rested certain days and ordered his besinesses he rode to
the cite of Damas. wha^ they of Damas understood the coming of Casan they were
afraid / for if Casan should take the^ by force / he should take all without
any mercy. And tha^ they send their messangers to Casan with great gifts and
send to hy^ the keys of the town of Damas. Than it happened that Casan
received the gifts / and commanded to the messangers that they should retorn
to Damas. And yt they should make vitayle ready for his host and that they should
not fere his coming / for he would do no hurt to the cite of Damas / but would
keep it as his chamber. The messangers deperted full glad for ye good answer
yt Casan gave the^. And tha^ Casan rod after and lodged nere the river of Damas
/ and commanded yt no man should hurt nor oppres the cite. They of Damas send
to Casan great gifts and habondaunce of vitayle for him and his host / and so
Casan soiorned many days in Damas with his host besydde ye xl.M. tartas that
were with Molay / the which were at Acasere tarieng for Casa^s coming. As Casan
and his people tarried and reposed them at Damas / there came a messa^ger that
brought tidings yt Baydo was entered into ye realm of Persy / and that he had
done much harm in ye land / and they thought he should do more hurt tha^ he
had done. wherefore Casan commanded to Catholasa yt he should tarry for to keep
ye realm of Syri / and commanded to Molay and to ye other tartas that were with
him in Casere that they should obey to Catholasa yt which Casa^ had laft in his
plac And than after he ordained baylies and gouerners in every cite / and made
Cachap baylie of Damasse Casan understood not ye Cachap was a traitor. After
all that Casan called the king of Armeny and showed him how he would retorn^ to
Persy. Casan said we have delyuerd you the land of Syrie to keep for ye
christe^men if they come we leave our commandment to Catholasa yt he shall
deliver the holy land to ye christe^men and yt he should give counsel and
help to make ye lands again. when Casa^ had done that he went toward
Mesopotamy and when he was at the flode of Eufrates. He commanded to Catholasa
that he should leave Molay with.xx.M. men to keep the land and that he should come
in all the have to him with the remna^t of the host / of the king Anyne of
Mesopotamy. And so Catholasa departed and did as Casan commanded him / and
Molay tarried for to keep ye land of Syri / by ye counsel of the traitor
Capchap. Molay went into the perties of Jerusalem into a place that is called
Gant where was good pastur for their horses. when the so^mer was com Capchap
send his messangers to the sowdan and promised to deliver him Damas / and all
the other lands that ye tartas kept of the realm of Syri. And ye sowdan
promised to Capchap that he should give him ye lordship of Damas / and a great
part of his tresure and his sister to be his wife / than Capchap rose and made
to rysse all the countres for he knew well yt the tartas coud not come upon
them because of the great hete of the so^mer When Molay se that Damas and the
other countries were up he durst not abide in the realm of Syrie with so few
men / but went toward Mesopotamy and there he found Casan and rehearsed to him
what Capchap the traitor had done. When Casan understood those tydinges he was
greatly displeased but he coud no remedy for the great here yt was there. When
the so^mer was paste and the winter began Casan gathared a great host upon ye
flode side of Eufrates and send first for Catholasa with.xxx. thousa^de
tartas. And commanded that they should go toward the cite of Antioche / and
that he should send for ye king of Armeny and for the christe^men that were at
that time in realm of Cipres / and so they came by the sea to the cite of
Corcose / and there was the lord Sut brother to the king of Cipres / which
conducted the lords and knights / and there was the masters of the temple and
of the hospital. And as they were apparelled to do our lord god service
tydinges came yt a sore sykenesse had taken Casan. Wherefore Catholasa was fayn
to return to Casan with his men / and the king returned to his cou^trei And
the christe^men that were com to ye isle of Carcon went to Ciprez and for this
cause ye war of the holy land was last. This matter was in the year of our
lord a thousa^de three honderde and one.

When the king of Armeny and Catholasa took ye cite of Hames.
IN the year of our lord god M.CCC. and.iii. Casan gathared his host again
upon the flodde of Eufrates to thentent yt he might enter into the realm of
Siri / and to distroy ye sowdan of Egypt. And to recover ye holy land and
deliver it to the christe^men again. When the sarasyns understood the coming
of Casan and that they were not able to fight against his power / they wasted
and brende all the land and country by they which they should pass with their
beestes and catell and all that they could find the brought to a strong place
and all they remna^t they set on fire / for cause yt their horess should
find name at. wha^ Casan understood this that the sarasyns had done /
thinking that the horses should find no mete to live on. He took counsel to
tarry ye same wi^ter at ye flode of Eufrates And when the grass should begin to
spring they would take their way / but they had more thought for their horses
mete tha^ they did for themself as men but of small fedynge. Casan was upon ye
flod side with his host and send for the king of Armeni. Casa^s host was so
great that it lasted.iii. days journey of length. From the castle yt is
called Racale to another that is called la Bire / these two castles were longing
to the sarasyns but they yielded them to Casa^ and as Casan was tarieng at the
flod of Eufrates for the seson and wether forto deliver the holy land out of
the sarasyns power he herd tidy^ges that Baydo was come again into his land /
and how he had done much harm there / and driven his men away that he left
there forto keep ye land / upon that Casan had counsel that he should return
into his country. And in ye next year he might well enter into the realm of
Syrie. Casan was sore displeased that the matter of ye holy land tarried so
long. Than he commanded to Catholosa that he should enter into the realm of
Syrie with.xl. thousand tartas and that he should take the cite of Damas / and
that he should put to the sword as many as he should take. And commanded to
the king of Armeny that he should go with his men with Catholosa with.xl.
thousand Tartas on horsbacke and that they should enter into the realm of
Syrie / and as they should go to wast all the country. They had thought to have
found the sodan in that country as they had done in times past / but they
found him not but they herd say that he was at Gazette. And that he would not
depart out of that country. Wherefore Catholosa and ye king of Armeny did
assail and set upon the cite of Hames / so well that with in few days they
took it byforce and put all the men and women to the swerd without any mercy.
They found there great riches and great plenty of beestes and vitayles. And
after that they went before ye city of Dames / to the intent to set upon it. But
the burges of the cite desired them that they should give the^ term for three
days / and after yt they should yield them to mercy. The term was granted to
them but ronners made a course from the tartas host well a days journey be
end Damas / and took a certain nombre of sarasyns which they send to
Catholosa their captayn. And by those sarasyns Catholosa knew that within.ii.
days journey from thens were.xii. thousand sarasyns on horsbacke taryeng for
the sowdans coming When Catholosa understood this tidings he rode hastily and
did so much that he came to the place there as the.xii. thousand sarasi^s were
to euynsong time / thinkyng to overtake the^ or ye sowdan should come. But a
little while before ye sowda^ was come with his power When Catholosa and the
king of Armeny se that the sowdan was come they took counsel what they should
do / and because it was almoost night they had counsel to rest them. And upon
the next day they should set wisely upon ye sowdan / but Catholosa that
dspiraysed the sowdan would not tarry so long. But commanded that his me^
should take courage / and that valyantly they should set upon their ennemys. The
sarasyns yt were lodged in a strong place between.ii. waters / would not depart
to fight for they knew well that ye tartas could not come to them without
great loss. And because of that ye sarasyns would not depart from thens / ye
tartas rode hastily to set upon their e^nemys / but they found a little water yt
they could not pass in diverse places that troubled the^ much or they could
pass the said water when Catholosa the king of Armeny / and the most part of
their men was passed they set valiantly upon their enenmys / they kylde all
them yt they met in their way and chased them till yt night the sowdan would
not come from his place nor come to the battle. That night Catholosa lodged by
a mou^tayn with his me^ except.x.M. that could not pass ye water by day light.
Than the next day Catholosa ordained his men for to fight / but the sowdan would
not come out of that place nor come to ye battle. The tartas took much labor
forto have ye sarasyns out of that place / but they could not in no wise. The
battle lasted till none / but for fault of water ye tartas were weary and went
back forto find water. And went in order one after an other till they came to
the plain of Damas / and there they found pasture and water I nough. And
Catholosa ordained to rest his me^ and his horses a certain while there /
because yt they should be the fressher forto return and fight against the
sowdan. Wha^ the tartas host was lodged in ye plain and thought to be in rest
/ the men of Damas let run the water of the fludde by cundittes and dyches
/ so much that or.viii. of the clock in the morning the plain was all
covered with water and the ways. Wherefore the Tartas were feign to rise hastily
and also the night was dark the diches and the ways were al full of water.
Wherefore the host was in great confusyon horse / beestes / and harnes were
lost / and many men drowned to great loss. Tha^ the day come and so they were
delyuerd by the grace of god out of that danger / but the bows and the arowes
/ whereof the Tartas occupied ye most in battle were so weyt that they cound
not help them therewith. In this manner the Tartas host were sore troubled that
if the sarasyns had come suddenly upon the^ they might have overcome them. The
tartas began to go back again softly because of their horses lost / and came
i.viii. days journey to the fludde of Eufrates they were feign to pass over
upon their horses / the best yt they could do. The flud was great and deep so
much that many Georgyns / and tartas were lost there And so the Tartas went
back again to their co^fusyon not for ye power of their e^nemys / but by
evil counsel / for Catholosa might avoided all that myscheffe if he would
have believed good counsel.

How the king of Armeny went to Casan.
I Friar Hayton that makes mention of this history was present. And if I have
spoken to long of this matter I pray you perdon me / for I have done it to the
intent to put of the dangers. In like matter for the warkes that be done by
counsel ought for to have good end. After that the king of Armeny had passed
the fludde of Eufrates / not without great labor and loss of his men. He took
counsel to go se Casan or he should go into Armeny. Than the king took his way
and went straight to the cite of Ninyue there as Casa^ dwelled at that time
Casan received ye king honorably / and had pity of the great loss that he had
of his men. And for because that the king of Armeny and his men had served
truly in all their besynesses Casan did a special grace to the king. For he
gave him a.M. tartas that were good horsemen / and commanded that they should
dwell there forto keep ye land of Armeny to the king of Turks cost / till
that he should be able to give wages to a.C. other knights to his will. After
that ye king took his leave at Casan and went into his country. and Casan
said to him se that ye keep your land well till yt I shall come personably
forto recover ye holy land.

How the sowdan made trewse with the king of Armeny.
THe king of Armeny returned into his country / but sith his coming there he
had but little rest. For the sowdan send in the same year almoost every month
a great no^bre of men a war that ran almoost all ye land of Armeny / and
wasted all ye plain. wherefore the realm of Armeny was worse than ever it was
before / but god almighty that is with them that serve him / had mercy of ye
people and christe^men of Armeny. whereof it happened that in the month of
July.vii.M. sarasyns of the best of the sowda^ of Egiptz house entered into the
realm of Armeni and ronned all the plain wastyng and robbing to the cite of
Tersot. In the which saint Paul was borne This ennemys did much hurt / and
as they were going back again. The king of Armeny gathered his host / and
met with them and nygh the cite of Layas was the battle. And by the grace of
our lord god their ennemys were overcome / in such manner that of ye vii.M.
sarasyns skaped not.iii. hundred / but they were slain or taken. And that was
upon a sunday the.viii. day of July / and after that battle they durst no more
come i^ the realm of Armeny. But the sodan send and made truese with the king
of Armeni. And I friar Hayton maker of this warke was present to this things /
and long time before yt I was purposed to take ye order of relygio^. But I coud
not for the great besinesse yt the king of Armeny had at yt time. I coud not
for mine honor forsake my lords and my friends in all nedis but since god of
his grace has given us the victory against our ennemys. And also given grace
to leave the realm of Armeny in suffycient good state / shortly after I thought
forto make an end of my bow. And than I took leave of the king and of my kynred
and friends / and in that time yt our lord gave us the victory against the
ennemys of our faith. I took my way and ca^ i^ to Egypt and there into our lady
Delepiscopie chirch of ye order of Premontrey / I took the abyte of relygion
and long I had been knight in this world to thyntent forto serve god the
remenau^t of my life. And this was in the year of our lord god. M.CCC.v. grace
and mercy to god / for the realm of Armeny is reformed in better state than it
was by the young king my lord Lynon in the old time baron the which is full
of virtue and grace. And also we trust yt in this young king of Armenys days.
The realm of Armeni shall be in his good first state with the help of our lord
Ihesu Christ.

The auctour.
yet I that has made this book se all that is in the third part of this book
/ I know it in.iii. manners. For from the beginning of Cangius Can / that was
the first emperor of the tartas / till Mango Can that was the forth emperor.
I se all as ye Tartas historis rehearsed. And from Mango Can till Halco^ dyed I
speak as I have herd and learned of my lord mine uncle the king Hayton / the
king of Armeny which has been present in great dilygence rehearsed to his sons
and to his neuewes / and did us put in writynge for a remembrance. And from
the beginny^g of Albaga Halcous son^ till ye third part of this book there as
the tartas history finysshed I speak as he that was present in person and of
that I have seen I may rehearse truly. We have said of the tartas dedis and
hystoris yet we shall speak of their power.

Of the three kings that did honor to the great emperor.
THe great emperor of ye tartas yt kept the lord shype is called Tamor Cann
which was the vi. emperor and held his sege in the realm of Catay in a cite
that is called Iunig / the which his father founded. The might of this emperor
is great for him self alone might do mor than all the tartas princes /
themperours men be taken for more noble / more riches / and more garnisshed of
all things than others. For in the realm of Catay is a great haboundaunce of
riches. And after the.iii. kings of Tartas that have a great power / and do
all reverence to the great emperor / and obedient by his Judgment. The first
of these kings is called Tapar / the second Totay / and the third Tarbanda.
Tarpar held the lordship of Turkesten and is more nygh of themperours lands
than the others / this king may bring with him in battle.iiii.C. thousand
men of war an horsbacke / this men be valyant and hardy / they have good
harnis / and good horses. Somtymes the emperor makes war against Chapchap and
would take his lands from him but he defended him valyantly. The lordshippe of
Capar was all under one lord how beit that his brother Totay held a great
part of his land.

Totay the king of the tartas held the king of Cumanys lordship and his sege
in a city that is called Sarra. This prince may bring to the battle.vii.C.
thousand men an horsbacke as ye saying is / but they be not so valyant in
battle and i^ deed of arms as Capars men be. How be it yt they have better
harnes / and better horses. Sometime they make war against Carba^da / sometime
they make war against the king of Bulgarie / sometime they have war among
them. But now Totay keeps the lordship in rest and peace.

How they of Lices have know lege by birds when any of their ennemys be
coming toward the^.
CArba^da held his power in the great Asie and kept his sege in ye cite of
Toris / he may bring to the battle about.iii.C. thousand men of arms an
horsbacke / but they be men of diverse nations / rych and well furnisshed of
all manner such things as they have need. Capar and Totay make war often
times against Carbanda / but he defended his land wisely. Carbanda meddled not
with no war against no man but the Turk of Egypt / to the which all his
ancestors have had war with the above said princes. Tapar and Totay would
feign put Carbanda out of his lordship if they coud / but they have no might
How beit yt they be more mighty of men and of lands / this is ye reason how
Carbanda defended his lands from the might of his neybours. For Asie is
divided in.ii. parts / the one part is called the deep Asie / the other is
called the mayor Asie. And in that part Carbanda dwelled there is no more but
three ways by the which they may enter out of Asie the profonde / and Asie the
great. The one way is by the which they go from ye realm of Turquesten to the
realm of Persy / the other way is by the end that goes nigh to the cite yt
Alexander founded / that is called Port de ferr. The other way is toward the sea of Mayor and pass by the realm of Dabcas by ye first way. Capars me^ can
not enter in Carba^das lands without great danger and pain. For cause that
they could not find pasture for their horses till many days iourneys end /
for this country is dry and bar. And so or they coud come to they good lands
their horses should dye for lack of meat. And with a small company of e^nemys
they that should pass might lose their lives by the other way / at ye end
Totays me^ might enter i^to Carba^das lands.vi. months in ye yer in ye
winter time. but Albaga did make a days journey of length lysses dykes and
things i^ a place that is called Cyba / and now there be men of war forto
keep ye passages. Totays men have many times proved forto pass / privily but
they could not. For they must pass by a plain that is called Mongan. In this
plain be ever in winter a manner of wylde-foule yt they call Seyserach / these
birds be as great as fesa^tes and with feyre feders. And when any men come
into this plain these birds fle away and pass the Lyces toward the plain of
Mongan / and by the token of these birds coming. The kepars of the said Lices
know the coming of their ennemys / and than they puruey for them for the
keeping of the said passage. By ye other way toward the mayor see they durst
not enter for they should be fayn to enter and pass by the realm of Dabcas.
Which is garnysshed with men and strong lands / and so they can not pass.
And by this manner Carba^da and his auncetours have defended their lands from
the great might of their ennemys and neighbors.

The manner and gyse yt the tartar use among them.
yEt shall we say some thing of the tartas manner and custom. The tartas be
much diverse of manner and custom. It is not possible to rehearse the dyuersite
of them / the Tartas believe in god and name god only and they say that god is
immortal. And none other reverence they do to god / another by prayer fasting /
aflictions / nor none other good deeds. The tartas thy^ke no sin to have
kylde a man if ye byt was in the horse mouth / they think to have sy^ned
deedly. The tartas think that ye deed of lechery is no sin / they have
diverse wives and by their guyse and custom after the death of their father /
the son^ must take for his wife his mother in law. And the brother the wife
that was his brothers wife and make their beds together. The tartas be good
me^ of arms / to their lords they be obedyent more tha^ any other nation.
There lord gives them no wages / but he may take from the^ what it please him.
Nor for cost or ridynge their lord is not bound to give them any thing / but
they be feign to live on their pray and hau^tyng yt they take upon their
e^nemies. wha^ ye tartas ryd and pass by a passage there as they think to find
no vitayles they bring with the^ great plenty of beestes / kyne / and mares.
and live of the milk and of the flesh of these beestes and ete it and say
that it is good flesh. The tartas be much light in deed of arms a horsbake
but a foot they be not much worth for they can not go a foot wha^ they be
ordained forto fight they understand shortly their captayns will and know
what they have to do. Wherefore the captayns rule their men lightly without any
labor / the Tartas be subtle forto take towns and castles. The tartas seek
ever there advantage upon their ennemys in battle and will do none other thing
to their profet. The tartas have more vauntage than other men / for if they be
in a field together forto fight against their ennemys if it please the^ they
shall fight / and if the battle pleased not the^ / their e^nemis can not fight
against the^ nor come nygh the^. The tartas battle is much mortal / for in
one little battle of the tartas / there should be more me^ slain and wounded
than in a great battle of other men / and that is for the bows and arowes
that they ocupyed, when the tartas be over com they ron^ all together as nigh
as it can be possible / and is a peryllous thing to follow them / for in going
they kill with their bows horses and me^ / and shote backward as they do
forward. and if they se yt their ennemys followed folysshely they torn upon
them. And sometime it happened that they that ran after them by killed and
slain. The tartas host is not of great mustre because that they go nygh one
with an other / so nygh that.x. housa^de tartas show not.v. hunderd. the
tartas be of fair speking to their hoostes and courtesly they spend their
meat. And likewise yt they should ben done with them or else they would take
some parforce the tartas can well conquer ye strange things but they can not
keep it / For they loved better to be in tents and in the feldes thanne in the
towns / the tartas be much couytouse and occupied much to take other men's
goods and they ca^ not keep their own and naught they will spend. when ye
tartas be in company there as they may be masters they be of great courage and
proud. And wha^ they se yt they ca^ not have ye mastry they be courts and
honest. the tartas will ever take things to their profet and shortly they be
up / and in.ii. things they dar not make a lie / nor say yt they had done any
good deed of arms if they had not done / nor deny their evil deeds if they
had done any. The other before the lord or the Judge in iugme^t he dare not
deny the troth though he should be co^de^pned or lose his life / and as much
as is sufficyent yt tartas speaks.

The manner how a king or a prince shlud order the^ to war.
REason requires that who so ever will move war against his ennemys / ought
to consider.iiii. things. First he ought to have Just and reasonable cause or
good little to move ye war / these conde thing that he ought to se to his
power if he be sufficient for all the cost and furnyssh other things belongyng
to the war / to begin maynteyn and finysshe. the third is that he ought
wisely enquer of the co^dicyon and manner of his ennemis / the fourth is that he
ought to begin war in a co^uenyent sea son and time. And friar Hayton that by
the commandment of our lord the apostle ought to speak of this matter I may
say truly that the christe^men have Just and reasonable cause to move war
against the sarasyns to the valiant kynred of Mahomet. For they have occupied
their own heritage that is the holy land / the which almyghti god promised
to ye cristenmen. And there they find the sepulture of our lord Ihesu that is
the beginning of the christen faith. And for ye great dishonesty and great
loss of blood that ye criste^men have had by the sarasyns / and evil lyuers
in time passed and for other diverse reasons yt should be long to rehearse. The
second reason I say that no man ought to be in doubt for ye holy church of rome
which is lady and masters of all the world has will power by ye grace of god
/ and with the help of the good kings and princes of ye christian faith. And
the servants of Christ to deliver the sepulture and the holy land from the
sarasyns power / the which land they hold and occupy by our sins. Of the
third reason and the fourth I speak it is to know the manner and condition of
his e^nemys and to chose time place and season conuenye^t forto begin war. I
must speak more at length / for a good surgyen that ought to know the syckenes
of yt which he will give health Likewise a king or a prince ought te enquer
the intent condicyon and state of his ennemys to the intent yt he may begin his
war wisely / maynteyn and bring to a good end. To a prince in deeds of war
the secret of his ennemys ought not to be hid from him. For the things yt
be proved before hand can do no grefe / and in the matters unpurveyed somtymes
trouble. Many me^ coragious is deeds of arms and bataylles / when they have no
time nor rome to beware of the people and dangers that be ready to come in all
other manner of warkes. A remedy may be found except in battle if it be any
fault in / for soon after the pain follows aft the cost. wherefore to thi^tent
that more euydent understanding should be upon oursayeng we shall speak of ye
passage of ye holy land. And also we shall say some things of the state and
condicyon of ye land of Egypt the host of Babylon / and of the ennemys power.

How the sowdan orders his barownes and his knights.
THe sowdan that holds now the realm of Egypt and of Syrie / is named
Melcuaser and is a Cumany by his natyon. The knights and ye host of Egypt be
men of diverse parts and of strange lands / for ye men of that countrei be
naught bowed a foot nor an horsbacke another by see nor land. The sowda^ of
Egiptes power of foteme^ is not great but of horsemen is mighty. Verily the
most part of the^ be Sclauys that have been bought and sold / the which the
evil criste^men brought there forto sell them for couetise of money. And other
be they yt were taken in battle / which be constrained to forsake the law of
Christ. But the Sclauys that be sold be more praised and more honored and
diverse times it happened yt many would be sold because that they shall be the
better beloved of their lord and master. The sowda^ of Egypt is ever in great
dout and suspection of his men / for they be of such co^dicyon that they ever
take the lordshyppe of their pry^ce And by reason of that many sowdans has been
slain. The host of Egypt may be about.xx. thousand knights / and some of
them be good warryours and used to do verily the grettest part is but of small
price. when ye sowda^ goes with his host he takes with him / a great quantyte
of stoffe / and of laden horses for the war. They have resonably of goods
and light forto run / their horses and mules be but small / nor they ca^ not
do much labor and they have great need of good keeping. The host of Egypt is
ever ready and apparylled to the sowdans commandment / for all they inhabit in
ye cite of Cayre. The condicyon of the host of Egypt is such / every man of
arms has his wages which passes not.vi. skore floryns / and every man is
bound to keep.iii. horses and a camel forto bear his stoffe. And when ye
sowdan brings his men out of the realm of Egypt he gives them somewhat more
if it please him. The sowda^ departs his wages and offices and give them in
keeping to his barownes that he called Admiralles / to some he gives a hunderd
to some.ii. honderd more and less. After that he will do more honor and profet
to one than to an other For if the sowdan give power to one admyrall to keep an
hunderd or two honderd knights / he shall give him for all the hole wages as
much as it shall come to in a hole som^e. And by reason of this the sodan has
great faure i^ his service. For this Admyrall that give service to an hu^derd
or two hu^derd knights / they be Sclauo^s of their own money and delyuerd
harnes / and horses and put them in service for men of war / and received
their wagis. And sykeme^ of small price and gave them some things and delyuerd
them horses and harnes And receive wages for them and all ye remena^t they put
i^ their purses. Wherefore diverse times among sur he men / is found but few
valyant men.

Of the subtyltie of the sowdan of Egypt to conquer cities.
THe might of the sowda^ in the realm of Syrie may well be.v.M. knights that
have their lyueng upon the rentes of ye land / and yet there is a great no^bre
of Bednyns / and turkmens that be woodmen / and do great help to the sowdan.
When he will put sege to any land / for if he will without any wages but
gyueng them some He may have them forto go in battle or forto defend his
land. The above said Bedny^s / and turkmens / would do nothing for ye sodan
without great wages and if the sowdan would cause the^ to do byforce they should
go away. The turkme^s joined to the mou^tayns and the Bednyns joined to ye
deserts of Arabe. yet the sowda^ has a sergeantre a foot in the countries of
Moyllebech / and about the mount Lyban / and in the land of the Assasy^s. And
might have help of the^ to put the sege to a cite or to a castle / or forto
keep ye land in their country. But out of their country they would not go
for the sowdan nor he can not constrayn them for the great mou^tayns there as
they be. The sowda^ of Egypt is much subtle for to take cytyes and castles and
i^ diverse manners they set upon the lands. Forby trosbowes / stones / and mines
under the ground / and by fire that ca^ not be put out. And by other manner yt
they take ye lands lightly without any peril.

Why they of Egypt yielded the^ to the sarasyns.
The Emperor of Greece kept the lordshyp of Egypt. And governed the land by
dukes / and by officers that he send every yer to receive the rentes of the
lands / and send them to the emperor of Constantinople / and so the lordshyppe
of the greeks was in the land of Egypt till in the year of our lord
god.vii.C. hunderde and.iiii. They of the land of Egypt could not suffer the
wrongs that the Greeks did unto the^ and than they yield them to the sarasyns
and chose a lord among them of Mahometz kynred / and named him Calyfe / and
all their lords were called Calyfe. And kept the lordshippe of Egypt those of
Mahometz kynred.CCC.xlvii. years. After that ye sarasyns took the lands / and
the Medyens that be called Cordins ocupied ye lordshyppe of Egypt as we shall
say here after.

How the christenmen were driven out of Egypt.
IN ye year of our lord god a thousand.liii. king Almaur king of Jerusalem of
good mind gathered his host in all ye land of Jerusalem and entered into
Egypt and conquered many lands and cytes / as it is written in the book of the
holy land conquestes. The Calyfe seeing that he could abide again the
christe^me^s power / send his messangers to the sowdan of Halap that kept
Mahometez law. And thought to have a great treasour of the Calyfe that was
called Saraton / he and a great company of men a war came to help the Calyfe /
and those men did so much that they drove the christe^men out of the land of
Egypt rich and delectable. And the power of the Calyf was small the sowdan
coueyted the lordship wherefore he took him and put hy^ in prison and than after
he set upon the land valyantly and put it in his subjection / and made him
sodan and lord of Egypt / this Paraton was of the Corasmyns nation and was the
first lord in Egypt of his nation.

After the death of Sarato^ one of his sons was made lord of Egypt that was
called Salzadin And this Salzadyn did so much that he vndyde the king of
Jerusalem and took his cities byforce and took diverse other lands of the
christe^mens / as it apperith by the book of the co^questes of the holy land.
After the death of Salzadyn / his brother and one of his neuiewes one after an
other kept the lordship of Egypt till ye sowda^s time that was called
Mellecasa. This Mellecasa was sowdan of Egypt at that time that the Tartas took
the realm of Cumany ye sowdan herd say that the tartas sold the Cumayns that
they had taken to a good ship. And tha^ he send diverse merchants with a
great quantite of good for to by some of the said Cumayns / and i^ specylly of
the youngest / and many of them was brought into Egypt Malacasa did norysshed
them and loved them much / and learned the^ to ride and to the arms / and true
sted them well and kept them ever nygh him. And in that time yt the king of
France Loys passed over the sea and was taken of the sarasyns the above said
Cucuma^s that were bought and sold kylde there lord Malecasa / and made one
of them lord that was called Turkmen / and by the reason of this the king of
France and his brother that were in the sarasyns prison were the sooner bought
again and delyuerd out of prison. In this manner began the Cucuma^s to have
lordship in Egypt / this kindred of ye Cucuma^s is called chapchap into the
Orie^t parts not many days after one of this Sclauons which was called Cochos
killed the said Turkeme^t and made him sowdan / and was called Melomees. This
man went into the realm of Syrie / and driued out Gynbago and.x. thousand
tartas / the which Halcon had left for to keep the land of Syrie. As he
returned to Egypt an other of the said Cucumans kylde him. Which was called
Be^docdar and made him sowda^ and made him call Meldaer. This was much wise
and valyant to ye arms and to his power he rose much / the sarasyns power in
the realm of Sirie and Egypt. And took many cities and lands that the
christenmen kept. And took byforce the noble cite of Antyoch. In the year of
our lord god. M.CC.lxviii.

In the realm of Cucumanie this man did much harm in this Bendocdar days.
When sir Edward king of England passed over the sea. The sowda^ thought to
have kylde him by an Assasyn by the which Assasyn ye king was hurt / with a
knyfe that was poisoned / but he was hole again by the grace of god. Tha^
after it happened yt the sowdan had a drink with mortal venym / and dyed in
the cite of Damas. After his death his son that was called Melecsart was mad
sowda^ / but he kept not long the lordshippe of Egypt for an other Cucumant
that was called Elsy drive him out of the lordship and the land of Egypt and
made him sodan. This Elsy was he that laid sege before the cite of Triple / and
took it byforce. In ye year of our lord god a thousand two hundred foureskore
and nine.

How Elsy was poisoned.
IN the yer after the said Elsy brought all his power to gyder nygh Babylone /
taryenge forto put sege before Acre. Upon a day as he put him in a pleasant
place for to ease him self / yt fortuned that a servant the which he trusted
well / and had made him constable of his host / gave him poison to drink and
dyed soon after. This constable occupied the lordshyp / but the other ran upon
him and cut him all in pecys. After that one of Elsy sons was made sowdan
yt was named Melecasseraph / the which took the city of Acre / and put out of
the lands of Syrie all the christenmen. This was in the year of our lord god
a thousand. CC.lxxxxi.

How Melcuaser was made sowdan of Egypt.
WHa^ Melecasseraph was returned into Egypt upon a day he went a huntyng and
there a servant kylde him in the wode / and soon after the servant was kylde
by ye other. And after that he that is sowdan now was made sowdan in Egypt
that is called Melcuaser which was Melecasseraph brother. And because that this
Melecuaser was young he was put under an ouersear which was of the tartas
nation and was called Ginboga / this Gynboga put away this child Melecuase
and put him inward into the crake of mount royal and took the lordship and
made himself sowdan / and was called Melecadell. In this Melechadels days was
so great need of vitayles that all the sarasyns dyed for hunger if it had not
ben for the false christenmen that brought them vitayle Enough for couytes of
money. Aft that it happened ye tidings came of the tartas coming / tha^
Ginboga gathered his host and went into the realm of Syrie forto defend the
land against ye tartas. This Ginboga honored much those yt had be^ tartas and
kept the^ nere him of this ye Cucuma^s had great envy. Wherefore it happed yt as
Ginboga returned to Egypt the Cucumans put him out of his lordeship / and made
one of tha^ sowdan that was called Lachyn and was called after Melecuaser. This
Lachyn would not kill Gynboga because that he would be his fellow / but gave him
a country yt was called Sarta. and after that he gave him the lordshyp of
Haman / but he would not suffer that Ginboga should dwell in Egypt. This sowdan
tarried.iii. years in the castle of Cayre for fere of his men except a day yt
he came down to ye plain and came there to play at the foreball / his horse
fill under him and brake his leg. After it happed that upon a day this sowdan
Lachyn played at cheker and had put his sword nygh him and one of his own
servants took the sword and struck him and sone after the other ran upon him
yt had done ye deed / and cut him all in pecis and after that the sarasyns were
in great debate for to make a sowdan but i^ thend they agreyd and put
Melecuaser aforesaid in the lordship the which Ginboga had last in the crake of
mount royal. This sowdan is he that overcame Casan in the field and is yet
sowdan of Egypt It shall be forgyuen me if I speak to lange of the Cucumans that
be subgettes bought and sold / and of the sowdans of their kindred for I do to
show yt the sarasins can not be long without such a fortune should come unto
the^ / by the which they might not come out of Egypt nor go with an host in
an other land.

How the land of Egypt is watered with the water of flud Gyon.
THe realm of Egypt is much rich and delyctable. It is.xv. days journey of
length and three days journey in bread. The land of Egypt is a isle / for by
both the sides is deserts and sand is and of the other part is the sea of
greece toward thorient is more nygh of the land of Syrie than of any other
land. Verily between ye.ii. realms is well.viii. days journey of way / and
all lands toward thoccydent finysshed to one of the Barbare prouynce / that
is called Darta / and between these two lands is well.xv. days journey of
deserts / toward mydday fynisshed with the realm of Nabye which be criste^men
and all black for the hete of the son. And between ye two lands is
well.xii. days journey and all sands. In the realm of Egypt be.v. provinces.
The first is called Says / the second Meser the third Alexander / the.iiii.
Rychy. This country is closed of the sea and fluddes of an isle / and the other
Damyette. The chief city of the realm of Egypt is called Cayre / and is nygh
of an old city that is called Meser. These two cities be upon ye fuld of Nyll
side / which ro^neth by the land of Egypt that is called Gion. This fludde is
much profitable for it watreth all the lands there as it passes and makes all
the lands fruit full / and habondaunte of all manner of goods. In the flud of
Nyll be fysshes enough and bear great ships for it is great and deep. and
above all the fluddes ye Nyll may be prased if it were not that there is a
manner of beestes that be called dragons / and devoured horses and men that be
upon the water and upon the sea when they may have them. These beestes be
called Cocalx / ye fludd of Nyll rises ones in a yer and begins to rise at
mids of August and so risynge till saint Michaels day. And when it is so high
that it can no more the me^ of the country let the water ron by bykes and
small ryuers so that they water all the country. And so the water tarieth
there.xl. days and when the gound is dry the people sow and set all the
ground. And because of the said watryng all manner of goods grow in ye land /
for in these parts is never rain nor snow / nor ye ran not know the winter
from the somer, yet the habytauntes of Egypt has put a colombe of Marble in
the mids of ye flude of Nyll in a little isle yt is called meser and have made
tokens in the said colombe. And wha^ the fludde is flowen as much as it may
they look upon the colombe tokens and after the risyng of the water they shall
know if they shall have great plenty of goods that year / or toskant. And
upon yt they set price upon their marchau^dyse The water of the fludde of Nyll
is wholesome to drink / but when it is taken out of the fludde it is to hot.
But they put it in a vessel of yerth / and than it is clear cold and wholesome.
In the realm of Egypt be two see ports / or havens. the one is called
Alexander / and the other Damyette. In Alexanders port may well come in
ships and galyes / and the cite is strong and well walled. The waters that
they drink in Alexandre comes in cundittes from the flude of Nyll of yt which
they filled their cesterns / that they have enough in the cite. They have none
other water yt they might drink. Wherefore if ye water that ronned in the
cundytes might be stopped they should be in great pain / and long they could
not live by any other wise it should be hard to take Alexander biforce. The
city of Damyette is upon the flude of Nyll which was well closed in the old
time / but it was taken twyse by the christe^me^. Ones by ye king of Jerusalem
/ and by the other cryste^men of thorient. And the other time by the king of
France saint Loys and because of that the sarasins brake it down / and
transported far from the sea and they made no walls nor strong place and
called this new land / new Damy ette. And the old Damyette is all wasted
with the ports of Alexandre and Damyette. The sowdan has great goods / the
land of Egypt yield great haboundance of socour and of almaner of goods they
have not much wines / but ye wine that grows there is very good / the
sarasyns dare not drink wyn because that it is for bydden them by their law /
moten / he^nes / and gottes they have enough / but they have not much befe. And
ere horse flesh / in the realm of Egypt be some christe^men dwelling there /
that be called kepty and hold the manner of the Iacobyns. And in that parties
they have diverse abbeys and hold them fre and in peace / and these Keptys were
the oldest heirs of the land of Egypt for ye sarasyns began to inheryt the
land sithe that they had the lordship ye things that they can not find in
Egypt and that the Egipcie^s could not find if they should not have of other men
they should have great need / as iron and other things because and fault of
that they coud not live long in all the realm of Egypt is no city nor
castle walled but the cite of Alexandre yt which is well walled. The sowdan
dwelled in the castle of Cayre / which was not strong all ye land of Egypt
is kept and defended by knights. Than sith the host of Egypt was overcome the
land might be shortly co^q^red and without any danger.

When time is to move war.
IN few words I say that I may say these words. Ecce nunc tempus acceptabile
/ ecce nunc dies salutis. For verily it is co^uenyent time and acceptable and
counable time to move war against his e^nemys of ye holy faith Now is time
couenable to give help to the holy land / the which has been long in ye
evil beleuers hands / now is time conuenye^t in the which the corages of
Christ's lovers ought to be in mind to the holy lands passage to thin tent
that the holy sepulture of our lord may be delyuerd out of thennemys hands
that is the beginning of our faith. Nor we have not remembered in times passed
of such conuenyent time as we have now / as god by his pity and mercy showed
us in diverse manners. For first god almighty full of mercy has given us
pastoure and right holy father right christian and full of virtue. which sith
that he was set in the holy apostolyque sete both night and day thought and
desired how he might socour the holy land forto have it out of the ennemys of
ye holy faythes hands which blamed ye name of crist and the holy sepulcre of
our lord. And because that they may truly believe yt god has turned his
merciful eyes to behold ye holyland And has given him upon ye earth his
redemer it is ye father apostell In the which days by the mercy of god the
holy land of Jerusalem that has been long time kept under ye seruage of our
ennemys by our sins shall be delivered and brought to the first frau^ches and
to the first power of the christe^men.

Why thy go into ye holy land.
NOw is the time conuenyent and acceptable in the which god has showed us
clerly that ye holy land shall be delyuerd out of the ennemys power / for by the
grace of god the kings and the princes of christen lands be now in good state
and in peace between them / and have no more war nor debate as they were wont
to have in the old time. Wherefore it is like that god almyghtie will deliver
the holy land and yet all christenmen of diverse lands and of diverse realms
by faith and devotion be apparelled to took the cross / and to pass over the sea into the holy land. Help and to put their body and goods for ye honor
and reverence of our lord Ihu^ Crist valyauntly and with a good will.

How the ennemis of the christian faith was mynisshed and put down
NOw it is convenient time and acceptable by yt which god showed to the
christen people that ye power of the christian faithes ennemys is dimynisshed.
Also by the tartaras war by the which they were overcome and lost me^
without nombre in battle. Also for this sowda^ that reigned those days in
Egypt / that was a man of no goodness and nothing worth Moreover all the
sarasyns princes be deed that were wo^t to give help to the sowdan by the
power of the tartas. And one was left alone that was named sowdan de Meredyn /
the which is turned lately to the tartas subjection. And therefore at this time
without any danger or pain / the holy land might be recovered / and ye realm
of Egypt and of Syrie conquered. And also with all the power of the ennemys
might be the more easly brought down now / than in times passed.

How Carbanda king of ye tartas proffered himself and his power to go to the
holy land.
yEt is co^uenyent time yt which god showed to the christe^men because that the
tartas has proffered the^ self to give help to the christenmen against the
sarasyns. And for this reason Carbanda king of the tartas send his messangers
profferinge to put all his power to undo the ennemys of the christe^land And
so in this time the holy land might be recovered by the help of the tartas and
the realm of Egypt conquered lightly without peril or danger. And so it were
need that the christe^men should set upon the holy land without any taryenge /
for in the taryenge is great danger. For fere of Carbanda that is now friend
should fail / and an other might come that should use the mahometz ways and
that should agree with ye sarasyns And so it might turn to great damage and
paryll of the christen land / and of the holy land over the sea.

Before your reverence holy father I say and confess that I am not of
sufficyent science to give counsel without great doing as the maker of the
passage over the sea to the holy land. But because that I have yet the pain
of ye inobediente soon I will obey to ye commandment of your holiness
against the which no good christe^men ought to go than requyring first perdon
of any thing yt I should say more or less. I shall say mine aduysement after my
little knowledge all as the wysemen counsel.

Of the aduersytes and prosperiteys of the ennemys.
TO the hounour of our lord Ihesu Christ I trust to acco^plyshe my fault I
say to the intent that the holy land may be conquered with leest pain and
trouble. It is conuenyent that the cristenmen shall enter into the land and
that they should set upon their ennemys in the said time yt their ennemys shall be
troubled of some fortune for if the christe^men would do this enterprise at that
time yt their ennemys should be in prosperytie they could not fulfill their
enterprise without great danger and pain. we shall deuyse truly which is the
prosperytie and which is the aduersytie. The aduersyte of ennemys is this.
When the sarasyns have a sowdan and a lord wise and valiant / and such that he
may without any fere of his rebellynge hold and keep his lordshippe. The other
prosperytie of the e^nemys may be when they have been long in peace and without
any war of the tartas or other me^ And yet when they have great haboundau^ce
of corn and other goods in the realm of Syrie / and yet when the ways be
sure by the sea and by the land and open. And such things yt the ennemys have
ned may be brought to the^ without any co^tradit out of strange countries and
yet when the sarasyns be in peace with Nubiens / and with the Bednins of Egypt
desert so they move no war nor quetell and yet when ye truqueniens and bedny^s
yt dwelled in the realm of Egypt / and Syrie obedyent to the sowdan of Egypt
because of the above said thyngees and prosperites the ennemys power should rise
so much yt it should be impossible to overcome them.

The names of the.ix. sowda^s that were slain and poisoned.
By the contrary aduersytes it might come to the ennemys in diverse manners. It
is when the ennemys do rise and kill their sowdan or lord as they have done in
times past and do often times. For sith the kynred of the Cucumans began to
have the lordshippe in Egypt.ix. have been ordained sodans and lords upon them.
And of these.ix. sowda^s that have been in Egypt they have been slain by sword
it is to know Turquenien / Chocas / Lachyn / and.ii. other that were poisoned
/ that was Be^docdac / and Elsy. The two other Melecuaser / and Gynboga were
put in exyle. And this Melecuaser that is now sowdan was ons put out of
his office and lordship and his life in variaunce tarienge to an ill end.

Provision against the sowdan of Egypt.
ITem the enemies might come to aduersyte. It is wha^ ye flude of Nyll rises
not so much that they may water the ground as need is. Than the sarasyns of
Egypt should have great need and hunger / and yet it is not long yt it came so
much that if it had not ben for christenmen that brought them by ye see for
couytouse of money they had been deed for hunger And when such a need should
come to thennemys they should be come poor and should be feign forto sell their
horses and bring away their children and servants. And by this reason they
should not have power to depart out of Egypt nor come i^to Syrie. Every one
must carry with him all such things and baggage that they have need of
for.vlii. days for him self his beestes and his household for they find but
sands / and downs in ye said.viii. days journey. Wherefore he that should not
have horses nor camels should not have power to depart out of Egypt. And by
this manner the sowdan should be so troubled that he could not com to socoure ye
realm of Syrie. yet when thennemys have had long time war / yet great
aduersytes and thoughtfull to thennemys. if the ways upon the sea were kept
that nothing should be brought into their country of such things as they
have most ned to / as iron / stele and other things that they coud not have
but it were brought unto them out of strange countries. And without such
things they could not long endure yet when the Nubyens / or ye Bednyns moved
war to the Sowdan he might be by such war so troubled that he could not
depart out of Egypt nor go in Syrie / yet when the land of Syrie has need and
not good season by drynes or by war of the tartas or in other manner / for if
ye ways should fail the host of Egypt coud not come forto dwell in Sire. for
out of Egypt and other lands their coud bring nothing into Syrie / and by
this reason the host of thennemys could not depart out of Egypt. Than if
the^nemys should have some of these aduersytes without any fault they could not
depert out of Egypt / forto come to Syrie. Than the christian men might occupy
the realm of Jerusalem and might repare the cities and castles and garnysshe
them in such manner that they should never fere the power of their ennemys.

How imbassadours were send to Carbanda a king of ye tartas that the ennemys
should have nothing brought to them.
Since that we have resonably spoken and devised of the prosperites and
adversities yt might come to thennemys. We shall say in this party the
beginning of the passage of ye holy land. I think for ye suerti and ye
profet of the passage that at beginning a certain nombre of horsemen and
fotemen might know the power of thennemys and as me seems. For this present
time it should be sufficient to the nombre of a thousand knights.x. galeys and
three thousand dykers. and upon this men should be send a legate by the church
and a wise captayn and a valiant that should pass with them over the sea to
ye isle of Cypres in the realm of Armeny / as they should think the best to do
Aft that without any tarienge by the king of Armenys counsel they should send
messangers to Carbanda a king of the tartas / requiring two things. The one
should be that Carbanda should defend in all his lands yt nothing should be
brought in the land / of the ennemis. The other was yt he should send his
messa^gers and of his men a war / into the countries of Meletur that they
should ron^ and waste Halaps lands. After that we pylgrims and them of the
realm of Cypres and of Armeny / by see and by land we should move war and
undertake valyantly the ennemys lands / and that they should take pain to
keep the sea in such manner that nothing should be brought into the ennemys
lands. yet our christe^men might garnysshe the isle of Corcose which is in a
good place for to receive the galleys and there they might do a great damage to
the e^nemis. Now verily I shall leave to speak of ye manner of the beginning of
war and to set upon the ennemys / for after the condicyon and state of the
ennemys should be nedys to change counsel and use / by the wyseme^s counsel
yt should be present to the deed. The profettes and ye goods ye might come of
this first vyage and passage I shall shortly herafter declare.

How ye sowda^ of Egypt should be brought subget to the christenmen and to the
Tartas.
THe first profet should before this first passage might be ordained so that
the^nemis might be so sore troubled by the help of the other christe^men that
be in the parties of thorie^t and by the tartas that they could have no rest /
but they should suffer great thoughts and great damages for if by the
christe^men and by ye tartas the war was done to the sowdan of Egypt by see
and by land into the realm of Syrie. The sowda^ should be feign to send his
men forto keep and defend the passages and cities that be nygh of the sea /
and all other that might be assailed. And if by the tartas ye war was moved in
the parties of Meleton in the lands of Halap / the sowda^s men should befaynt
to come where it is well.xxv. days journey. And yt they should come from
Babylone to this service should be in short time a foot / and should lose their
horses / and their harnes. And should be so weary and so trobled that they could
not endure. In.iii. or four manners thennemys should lose their goods and
should suffer many great da^mages. yet by the first passage the ennemys might
have much trouble for with the coming of the.x. galeys of the passage with the
help of these yt might be arrived of the realm of Armeny / and of Cipres
the^nemys lands might be roned all. And ye galeys might return safe into ye
isle of Corcose. And if ye sowda^ would keep and defend the said lands he
should befayn to come himself in person / and with him all his power of Babylon
i^ Syrie or he coud have sufficiently men to give help to all the lands that
be nygh of ye see. The coming out of the realm of Egypt to come in Syrie should
by peryllous and damageable to ye sowdan for fere of his men trayso^ full of
envy. For by the setynge of the christenmen they might be so troubled that they
should have no rest damageable. For he should consume and wast all his tresoure
so much that it was hard to believe the great some of good that the sodan and
his men spend and consumed every time that they came out of Egypt lands /
forto come i^ Syrie. yet by the said galeys the ways and the ports of the
said see might be kept in such manner that it should be brought nothing to
the^nemys of such things yt they have more need / and that they could not
endure long without as iron stele and other things that be brought unto them
out of strange cou^tres. yet more the^nemys should lose the rentes of ye see
ports that is a great some of good and tresure.

yEt if it should happen yt the ennemys were troubled by some aduersite and
that they could not depart out of Egypt nor give help to the lands of Syrie.
Than the pylgryms of this first passage with help of other christe^men of
thoryent parts might well redress ye cite of Triple / and to the mount Lyban
be criste^men dwelling / good sergeantes about.xl. thousand yt should give the
pilgrims great help. And many times they have risen against the sowdan and do
him and to his me^ great harm and damage. And tha^ if the city of Triple should
be formed / the christe^men might hold it till the coming of the passage
general and might take all the country about / and keep the country of
Triple. And might return easly by the men that should come to the general
passage for they should find ye port ready there they might surely come. yet if
it should hapen that the tartas should occupy the realm and the holy land.
The christe^men of the first passage should be ready to receive the tartas
lands and to keep them in such manner And I that know resonably the tartas
will I believe that all ye lands that they should conquer upon the sarasins
that with a good will they should give them in keeping to the christe^men frank
and quyte. For the tartas could not dwell in that country for the great here
yt is there in somer / wherefore they should be glad that the christenmen should
hold the lands and keep the^ The tartas do never fight with the sowda^ of
Egypt for couytous to get lands and cities. For they have all Asie i^ their
subjection / but they fight for cause that the sowda^ has ever ben their
princypall ennemy. And has done them more harm and damage than any other /
and specially when they have had war against their neighbors. And for this
reasons above said I trust that the nombre above is sufficye^t. It is to know
a thousand knights.x. galleys / and.iii.M. sergeantes and many think that in
this beginning that they should not make so many men that this should do / and
the exspences and cost should multiply much.

yEt by this first passage might come.iii. other profettes. For sith yt the
pylgryms of the first passage has tarried in the parts be end the sea a season
/ and had known the co^dicyon and manner of the land and of the ennemys. They
might give warning to the other pylgrims that should come to ye general
passage. yet take we ye tartas for war or for other things / or for excuse
that they would not give help to the christe^men against the sarasyns / And yt
the sowdan and his men were in there prosperity / and that it should not be an
easy thing to conquer the holy land. And to deliver it out of the enemies
power. your holy paternite knowing the condicyon of the holy land. And seeing
the general passage might have better counsel and aduertisme^t upon such
things that should be co^uenyent forto do or forto pass / over the general
passage or to tarry for conuenyent time. And by ye reason of this all the
dangers of the enemies may be avoided.

yEt your holiness shall perdon me I dare say two other words. The one is
that your holiness would write to the king of the Georgiens that be christe^men /
and that they be more devout people tha^ any other nacyo^ to ye pylgrimages /
and to the holy relykes of ye holy land yt they should give help and socour to
the pylgrims to recover ye holy land. I believe verily for the honor of god
and for the reverence of your holiness they fulfill your commandment for they
be devout christe^men and men of great power / and valyant men of arms and
neighbors of the realm of Armeny. And yet that your holy paternyte would write
to the king of Nubiens / which be christe^men and were converted to the faith of
Christ / by saint Thomas in ye holy land of Etyope. Sendynge yt they should
move war against ye sowdan and his men. And I believe verily that the above
said Nubyens for the honor of our lord and for the reverence of your holiness
they should move war against ye sowdan and his men / and should do the^ harm
and damage to their power / and that should be great trouble for the sowdan and
for his men. And the said letters might be send to the king of Armeny that
should translate them in their langage and send them by your messangers.

Devoutly and truly I have rehearsed after my little understanding such things
as is needful to the begynnige of the passage and help of ye holy land. And
aftur wylly^g to obey the comaundeme^t of your holy paternyte / upon this yt is
need to ye general passage over ye see.

Of the general passage.
THe general passage may be in.iii. ways The one should be by the way of
Barbary But this way I would not give counsel to them that know the condition
of the country. The other should be by they way of Constantynople / it is to
know by the way that Godfray de bullyen and other pylgrims / in that time kept
as I believe parfetly the passage general might go lightly to the city of
Constantynople. But going over the braz of Georgie and going by the turks /
the way should not be sure. For the turk men's yt be sarasyns and ye dwell in
turkey / truly the tartas may deliver and ensur the way / and might ordain
that in the land of turkey should be brought vitayles enough into ye pylgrims
host and horses of a reasonable price. The other way that every body knows it
is by the sea / therefore if ye passage will go by ye see there must be at every
port of ye see ships ready apperelled and other necessary things to pass
with the pylgrims. And moreover it should be co^uenyent to a prefeke term and a
couenable season that all ye pylgrimes should be ready to go in the ships and
pass together / and so they might come to Cipres and rest them and their horses
of the sea labor. After yt the passage gen^all should be aryued in Cipres and
should be refresshed a certain days / if ye pylgrims of the first passage had
closed the city of Triple / or an other upon the sea in Syrie. The passage
might come thither and that should be to them great ease. And if the pylgrims of
ye first passage had not closed some land i^ Sire It should be need that the
passage general should take the way by ye realm of Armeny. In this manner it is
to know that the pylgrimes should refreshe them and their horses in the realm
of Cipres / till Myhelmas day that they might pass surely to the realm of
Armeny / and there they should find such things as they should need to. Verily
they might tarry in the city of Tersot more easily because yt they should find
there great plente of waters and pastor for their horses. And from the realm
of turkey that is nygh they should bring vitayle and horses and such things yt
they should have need of in the land of Armeny. Also and they might tarry all
the winter in Armeny and when the pastur should be coming the pylgri^s host
might go to Antioch that is from ye land of Armeny a days journey. And from
thens the ships mygth go by the sea to the port of Antioch / and so the sea
host and the land host should be neighbors After that the pylgrims should
have occupied the city of Antioche the which they should shortly take with ye
help of god. The pylgrimes might refresshe them in this land certain days
and might ron^ and rauysshe their ennemys lands that be there above. And there
with they might know the condicyon state and will of their ennemis that be
there about. And in this perties of Antioch there be christe^me^ dwelling that
be good sergeantes and should come with a good will to the christe^mens host /
and might do them good service. After that the pylgrims should depart out of
Antioch they might go by the sea side to the cite of Lyche. this way should be
shorter and better for the sea does flow to the host of ye land. Verily nygh
to the Margat by ye see fyd is a passage that troubles much the people yt
pass by. And if it should happen yt the ennemys had garnysshed this passage i^
such manner yt the pylgrems might not pass. Our men might retorn without any
danger into Antyoche / and might go by ye way of Ephemye toward Caesar by the
syd of the flud of Revel upward and by that way ye host should find good
pasture and good waters and the ennemies lands garnisshed with vytayle and
other goods of the which the host might have great ease / And by this way our
men might go by the cite of Haman which is a rich city / the which the
christian men might occupy shortly. And if it should happen yt the enemis would
defend Haman for because it is a rich cite and that they should not come to the
battle against the christe^men they should have a great vau^tage to fight in
that place and should lighty overcome their ennemies / and if the christe^men
might ones overcome the sowdans host. After that they should find nothing
against them / and so they might go straight to the city of Damas the which
they should take or they should yield themself by some treaty. For sith the
sowdan should be overcome / they of Damas should not hold but they would yield
the^ with a good will. They live safe as they did to Halcon and to Casan after
that they had overcome yt so dan. And tha^ if the criste^men had taken Damas
they should lightly conquer the remynaunt. And if the ennemies should lose ye
battle the criste^men might come to Tryple in.iiii. days from Damas and might
make again ye cite of Triple. and with this the criste^men that be of the mount
Lyban should give great help to the pylgrimes / and so if the christe^men might
keep the cite of Triple they might co^quer ye cite of Jerusalem with help of god.

OF the company of the christenmen and of the tartas I thy^ke that a certain
nombre about.xx. thousand tartas might do great ease and proffet to the
christe^men going by the cou^tres for fere of the tartas / the Bednyns / nor
tuckemens durst not come nygh to the christe^mens host / the other ease should
be that the tartas should puruay for vitayle to the christe^mens host / and
should come out of far countries forto get money or some other thing. yet
by the tartas they might enquere and know the communycation of the enemies
for the tartas be light for to ron^ in and out. and can well enter and come out
night and day of their frewyll to battle and to beat cities. The tartas might
be thrifty for they be much subtle in such things. And if it should happen
that Carbanda or an other in his rome with men should come for to enter in the
land of Egypt / than it should be well done to shyft and go far from their
company For the tartas would not do after the christe^mens will / and the
christe^men might not follow the tartas will that be a horsbacke and go hastly.
And the christe^men might not follow them for the fotemen.

YEt when ye tartas know that they be strong and have power they be much
proud and without reason. And could not be without doing harm to the
christe^men / the which thing the christenmen might not suffer. Whereof might
come great sklau^dre and evil will among them / but upon this they might put
good remedy. It is to know yt the tartas should go by Damas way as they be
used to do ever. And ye criste^men should go in the parties of Iherusalem / and
in this manner going far one from an other it should be good peace between the
tartas and the christe^men and love kept / and the might of the ennemies should
be confounded rather by two than by one. yet an other thing I will remember to
your holiness it is this the christe^mens counsel should be kept wisely for in
time passed they would not keep their counsel Wherefore they have had many
great sorrows and the ennemys have skaped many great dangers / and have taken
from the christe^men ye manner to acco^plyssh their desires And if it be so that
the passage gefiall name might not be kept close for they should go by the
universal world. Nevertheless that could not torn to no danger nor loss to
ennemies for they could not have no help of no port / and in diverse manners the
christe^mens counsel might be kept doing manner to do a thing and do an other
/ and the cause that the tartas coud not keep their counsel. Which thing has
done them often times great harm / the tartas has such a manner that at first
moan of Ianuarii they take counsel of all such things that they have to do in
ye year Wherefore if it fortune yt they will move war against the sowda^ of
Egypt soon after their counsel is known of all and so ye sarasyns send
word to the sowdan / and upon that the sowdan makes him ready against the^.
the sacasyns can keep well their counsel which thy^g has done the^ many times
good. And so it is sufficiently spoken and said for this present time upon ye
deed of the passage general of the holy land by end the sea.

AFter all this I pray humbly that blessed holiness will receive this yt my
devotion writes upon the passage of the holy land. And if I have said more or
less yt it should be I put it to your correctyon. For I had not ben so hardy to
give counsel upon so great a matter as the passage of the holilande if it were
not by the commandment of your holy painite which syth^ that it was set to
the sege pastoral by the co^maundment of god / of all his hurt desired
procured and labored. How the holy land that was a rose of the precious blood
of our lord Ihu^ Christ should be delyuerd fro the evil lyuers. and for this
reso^ all christian ky^ges and pri^nces be called to his counsel to thi^tent yt
he may have counsel and be aduertysed upon ye help of ye holy lands passage.
How beit ye out lord is full of mercy which has showed us by very experience
that he will deliver ye holy land out of the^nemis hands to ye time of your
holy paternite. we ought all to pray humbly that long life and good give hy^
yt reigns in scla sclorum. Ame^.

man friar Hayton friar of Premo^stre order / sometime lord of court and cosyn
german to the king of Armeny upon ye passage of the holy land. By the
commandment of ye holy fader ye apostle of Rome Clement the.v. in ye cite of
Potiers Which book I Nicholas Falcon / writ first in french as ye friar Hayton
said with his mouth. without any note or example and out of french I have
translated it in latin. For our holy father ye pope. In the year of our lord
god.M.CCC.vil. in ye month of August. Deo gr^as.
Here begy^neth ye book of all the proui^ces and cites of universal world which
shows the names of all ye cytes / and how many be in eu^^y prouynce after the
knowledge and power of the Rhomayns churches.

The first part of the book makes me^cyon how many churches be in the cite of
Rome / as patriarchs and other / and how ye cardinals be intytuled upon ye
said churches.

The second part of this book makes me^cyon how many kings be in ye world
and their names and the which be crowned sacred and anoy^ted / and the names of
the christe^men the which be bound to pay tribute to the court of Rhome / and
which kings be chief and heed of ye said church of Rhome.

The third part shows how the noble men of ye world be crowned and chosen.
It is to know the emperor of Rhome and of Constantinople / and first of Rhome
how he is chosen / and by what prelates / princes and barownes of Almayn and
names them al and shows how the emperor is crowned with.iii. crowns and how
our holy fader the pope crowns him with a crown of gold which is the last
crown as it is written in the said book.

The.v. part and the last makes mencyon of all the castles and cities that
