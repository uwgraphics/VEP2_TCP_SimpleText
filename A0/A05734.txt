A MOST PLAIN and easy way for the finding of the Suns Amplitude and
Azimuth, and thereby the Variation of the Compass, by Logarithme.

Written by W.B.

Also another plain way for the Azimuth, by the Table of Sines in five
several Cases. By I.T.

Of the Variation of the Compass.
THe Variation of the Compass, is the difference between the true Meridian of
the world, and the Meridian of the Loadstone, which is pointed out by the
Compass or Needle; and is for the most part variable, as you sail to
different places; But fixed and permanent being the same, always in one and the
same place; (although there may be difference in the touch of the Stone, and in
the observations of different men)

Now for the finding of this Difference or Variation, the usual and most
easiest way; is by taking the Suns Amplitude at rising or setting, and
compared with the true; But this way serves chiefly in all places not far
distant from the Equinoctial, whose Latitude is not great; For if you were to
sail far to the South or North, near or beyond the Artict or Antartict
Circles, it were of no force at all;

The other way commonly used, is by taking the height or Almicanter of the
Sun, and at the same time the Azimuth also, which is in use from each Pole to
30. or 40. degrees of Latitude, and at any place where the Sun does not
usually rise and set clear, for in diverse places you shall not see it rise or
set, yet seldom but it may be seen either forenoone or afternoon: Now the
working of both these ways are found diversely; either by Instrument or
Arethmeticks: But I will here only show the work by Logarithme, which is the
most easiest of all Arethmaticall work and first of the Amplitude.

To find the Amplitude.
THe Amplitude or breadth of the Suns rising or setting from the true East or
West point; is found by Sines thus, As the sine of the Complement of the
Latitude, is to the sine of the Declination, so is the Radius to the sine of
the Amplitude;

But in Logarithme, you are only to look the Logar: of the Complement of the
Latitude, and the Logar: of the Declination; and substract one from the other,
the remainer is the Logarithme of the Amplitude,

Example.
Data
Complement, Latitude -- 40.degrees.30. North Declination -- 20. -- 40. North

I demand the Amplitude?

the Logar: of the Amplitude 32. degrees. 55. and somewhat more.

To find the Azimuth.
IT is to be considered that in the Doctrine of Triangles, it is required in
the solution of any question there are three things to be given in any
Triangle, before the question can be answered, which in this for finding the
true Azimuth of the Sun; you are to know or imagine your Latitude, the
Complement thereof is one side of a Triangle (which is the distance between
the Pole and the Zenith) the Complement of the Suns Declination is another
side of the same Triangle (which is the distance between the Sun and the
Pole) then is the Complement of the Almicanter the other side (which is the
distance between the Sun and the Zenith.)

Here have you an oblique Sphaericall Triangle whose three sides are known,
and it is desired to know the angle at the Zenith: whose quantity being found
is the Suns true distance from the North, (if the north Pole be eleuate) or
the distance from the South, (if the south Pole be eleuate,) and in this
question there are two cases.

The first Case.
THe first is, when you are on the same side of the Equinoctial the Sun is
on: then are the Triangle sides all less then Quadrants, and may be resolved
by Logarithme, 2. Book, 6. Chapter, and 8. section: As thus,

Add half the base, and half the difference of the containing sides
together; and to the Logarithme thereof, add the Loga: of the difference of
them, out of which sum, substract the sum of the Loga: of the two sides,
and the half of the remainer is the Loga: of an Arch, which being doubled, is
the quantity of the angle of the Zenith, or vertical angle.

Example.
Data
Latitude North* 51.degrees.30. Declination North 20.00. Almicanter 48. 30.

I demand the Azimuth?

Let P.Z. be the Complement of the Latitude 38.d.30. P.S. being the base, by
the Comp. of the Declinat. 70.00. S.Z. by the Complement of the Almicanter

The second Case.
THe other Case is, when you are on the one side of the Equinoctial, and the
Sun on the other; then is the base P. S. more then a Quadrant, and is to be
resolved by Logar: 2. Book, 6. Chapter, 10. section: Thus,

Add the differentiall of the sum of ye legs; to the differentiall of the
difference of the legs: and from the Product substract the differentiall of the
true base, and the remainer shall be the differentiall of the alterne base:
which alterne base added to the true base is the greater case, M. S. also the
same subtracted from the same. true base is the lesser case P. M:
distinguishing two right angled Triangles; which do make known both their
own parts, and all the parts of the Triangle proposed.

Which two Angles so found and added together, makes 128. degrees. 42.. the Suns
true distance from the North point, from which if you substract 90. the
remainer leaves 38. d. 42. 30 the distance from the East or West demanded.

1. For the Suns Azimuth having no Declination.
Add the Complement of the Latitude, to the complement of the Almicanter,
which if the total be more then a quadrant, substract 90. and set down the
sine of the remainer for the first number: Again, add the complement of the
Latitude and the Almicanter, and add the sine thereof to the former: from the
one half of that total substract your first number or sine, and set down the
remainer: Then,

As the of the 2. first numbers added is in proportion to ye whole fine, so is
the said remainer to the sine of the Suns true Azimuth.

Example.
Latit. 51. d. 30. the Comple. 38.d.30. Almicant. 20. d. Complem. 70.0. Added
makes 108 d. 30. 90. subtracted, leaves 18. degrees. 30. whose sine 3173. is the
first number. Again, complement of the Latitude 38. d. 30. Almic. 20. d. added
makes 58. 30. whose sine 8526. is the second number, those 2. numbers added
makes 11699. the thereof 5849. from which substract 3173. the first number rests
2676. for the remain: then say,

As 5849. the of the 2. first numbers is to 10000. the whole sine, so is 2676.
the remain to the Azimuth desired.

Facit, 4575. whose arch 27. d. 14. is the Azimuth from the East Southward.

2. When the Sun has North Declination, the 2. Complements being equal to a
quadrant.
Add the complement of the Latit. with the Almicanter only, and from the sine
thereof, substract the sine of the Declination, and setting down the remainer,

As the aforesaid, is to the whole sine, so is the remainer aforesaid to the
sine of the Azimuth desired.

3. When the Sun has North Declination, the 2. Complements less then a
quadrant.
Add the complement of the Latit. and the complement of the Almican. setting
down the sine of the complement thereof, then add the Almicanter and the
complement of the Latitude, and from the sine thereof substract the former,
setting down. of the remain for the first found number: again substract the
sine of the first Complement from the sine of the Declination and the remain
thereof, again substract from your first found number, and set the remain
thereof down for your second number: and then,

As the first found is to the whole sine, so is the second to the Azimuth
desired.

4. When the Sun has North Declination, and the 2. Complemements more then a
quadrant.
Add the complement of the Latitude and complement of the Almicanter, which
being more then 90. substract 90. and set down the sine of the remainer, then
add the Almicant. and complement of the Latit. and set down the sine thereof,
add both the sines together and take the thereof for the first found number,
then to the sine of the first 2. complements add the sine of the Declination,
and from that total substract the first found, and set down the remainer for
the second found: and then,

As the first found is to the whole sine, so is the second found to the sine of
the Azimuth desired.

5. When the Sun has South Declination, and the 2. Complements more then a
quadrant.
Add the 2. Complements, substract 90. set down the sine of the remainer,
add also the Almicanter and complement of Latitude, add both their sines and
set down of the total for the first found, then substract the sine of the
Declination from the sine of the remain of the first 2. Complements, and that
remain again from the first found, which last remain set down and say,

As the first found is to the whole sine, so is the second found to the sine of
the Azimuth desired.
