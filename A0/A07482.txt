To the right worshipful Master Edward Stanley Esquire.
SIR, were I not more comforted with assurance of your Generous disposition,
than persuaded of any merit on my part, by offering the Patronage of this
History to your hands; I should as certainly despair of the acceptaunce, as I
am uncertain whether it be worthy to be accepted From the time of my first
entrance in Printing till now, it is the first Book of this kind I ever had
power to dedicate, from my first years of capacity to read any printed thing,
my affectionate duty has to your W. been dedicated.

Enisham one of your Lordships was my birthplace; and as my Friends there pay
duties for the place they live in, so tender I this here as part of my duteous
love.

The Author of the Book has left it to the wide world without a Patron,
perchance esteeming it unworthy protection: neither do I think it in the
least part worthy your protection, before whose excelent judgment (so daily
conversant among the most judicial) it cannot but vanish like light smoke
before a bright flame. All my excuse is love, all my request is pardon; which
as (I first inferd) your noble disposition assures me of. On which foundation
building, I cease now to be more bold.

Your Worships, most dutifully affectionate: John Danter.

The famous History of Chinon of England, Son to Lord Cador Earl of
Cornwall, with his rare atchiuements for fair Cellestina daughter to Jews
King of France.
CHAP. I.
How Chinon the Earl of Cornewalles Son was borne a fool, and of the
excellent ornaments of nature wherewith his fair Sister Laura was beautefied.

IN the beginning of this flourishing Kingdom, when Arthur then Monarch of
this little world, with his attendant Knights, whose valorous exployts every
where acted for their Countries honor, has eternized their everliving names,
even in the farthest coasts of the barbarous Pagans, where yet in despite of
consuming time lives their eternal Trophies as spectacles for all posteritics.

In this time lived there in England an ancient Knight, whom this famous king
for his many merits and well deserving deeds, had installed in the Earldom
of Cornwall, a dignity as he thought fitting the deserts of this famous man,
that had so often undergone the furious attempts of the uncivil Pagans,
enemies to God, foes to his country, and great hindrances to the then but
young plants of springing Christianity, as also endeavoring himself every where
to defend the fame of his country, then of all other only fame worthy the
Honor of his order every where honored, and the duty belonging to his
Knighthood, which he always performed, till at the last when the weight of
many weary years, began bow his declining body down to the lowly earth,
making his often tried Armor too heavy a burden for his now war weakened body,
his brandishing sword beating down his age fallen arms, and every supporter
of his lusty limbs begins to fail of their former force, he determins to
end his life in peace at home, whose beginning he had spent in wars abroad,
encouraging younger men with the spectacle of his former valors, courageously
themselves to attempt the like endeavors.

In which time of his home abode, the heavens blessed him with two goodly
Children, a Son and a Daughter: but yet as it is the continual course of al
ruling fortune to mix with every good some ill, with every sweet a sour, and
with every sunshine show of promising hap, a tempestuous storm of ill boading
hurt, so fared it in the issue of this yet unhappy Prince: for when the
stealing hours of all ripening time had brought them from their Infant
Cradelles to some participation of sencible knowledge, his Daughter whose name
was Laura, so forwardly prospered in every Liniament of her beautiful body,
and all eternal quallities of a virtuous mind: so that in short time she
became the censured subject of all wise judgments, in determination whether
nature had better beautified her body, (where indeed she had exceeded her
self) or the Gods quallified her mind, wherein they had made her the only
similitude of themselves. No pen that was not busied in painting her praises,
though all too little for that purpose, and no tongue but was still telling her
perfections, though they never could attain them: for too bright was her
beauty, to be shadowed in the couloring cunning of a mortal capacity, and
too high her heavenly mind, to be enstauld with the earthly weeds of man's
base wit, that as the toil some Sailers in the dangerous Seas watching the
misfortunes of a tedious night, does with themselves mightily admire the
gorgeous state of many twinkling stars, till when the silver Moon proudly
rising from her glorious bed, draws back their daseled eyes to behold her
more than common countenance: so fares it in this age of theirs, where no
star may compare with her state, no face with her fair fortune, nor no grace
with the least glimce of her glory: so to leave to express that in words,
which could not be comprehended in all wits, never did nature before compose
of so rude a Chaos, so comely a creature: But her Brother whose name was
Chynon, outwardly formed in as fair a fashion, as might well beseem the son
to such a fire, but in his mind more than a maimed man, wanting that portion
of sensible capacity which commonly does accompany even the meanest
seruillitie: So that by how much his Sister exceeded in extraordinary
wisdom, by so much was he scanted in ordinary wit, where in steed of
Princely feature, was nothing found but foolish behavior, for high
atchiuementes boyish follies: for that which is required in a man, not so much
as is commonly found in a child, incapable of the rudiments of good counsel,
and unfit to conceive the commodity of comely quallitie: whence as all men
with admiration wondered at the one, so none but with commisseration pitied the
other, that so well fashioned a body should contain so ill formed a mind,
strongly had nature forged his limbs, which promised his valor, but weakly
had the envious Fates framed his mind, where was no hope of better, So that
here nature unnaturally handling so good a subject, had enclosed in the
perfect body of a man, little better than the imperfect soul of a beast, like
almost the imitating of an apish artificer, that in fair shows deciphers a
formal substance, in curious cunning colors painting a Princely perfection,
which satisfies the outward sense as the same, but cannot content the inward
conceit, being but a bare show: So by every outward appearance was he judged
well, till trial by experience to every one proved him worse, but how great a
corsiue it was to his careful Parents, I leave it to the^ to consider whom
experience has taught to conceive the like inconvenience, great grief was it
to his old father that had been himself full of valor, to see his young
son though able, yet unfit for any such endeavor, which turned his hoped for
rest to hapless ruin, his aged mirth to angry moan, and what so ever other
content, into a contrary conceit, to see his poor neighbors comfort their
servile lives with the sight of their forward Children, and he their
unfortunate Lord wanting that redress which those poor creatures in respect
of him in such plentiful manner do daily possess.

Thus grieuing to remember that which he cannot forget and sorry to have so
discontented an object to his aged eyes, which he still be wailed, though by no
means his grief could be healed, atlast learnes with patience to bear that
which with pains he cannot amend, and instantly solicites the great Parliament
of heaven, in whose dispose rests the estate of all creatures, that in their
unsearchable wisdom they would either open the eyes of his blinded soul,
forged in the mistie vale of a cloudy ignorance, or else cut short the
unpleasant date of his weary life, and so prevent the ensuing ignominy of his
future times: where we must now leave him a while in his folly, till the
process of our History bring us thither again.

CHAP. II.
How two of King Arthurs Knights, arrived in Earl Cadors Court, and how
Lancelot du Lake obtained the Jove of fair Laura.

DUring which time this young Lady Daughter to this worthy Earl Cador, with
the report of her matchles beauty, resounded in every ear the welcome sound
of self pleasing love, and thereby incited many aduent^rous Princes, and
matchles Knights to forsake their farthest Countries with contented travails,
to confirm with their eyes what had so filled their longing ears, as does the
never moving pole draw the adamantine touch of every steely compass, still
to direct their purpose to one point, so fared it here, whether declines the
glance of al eyes, the thoughts of all hearts, and the aim of all actions,
amongst whom arrived two Knights of the honorable order of King Arthurs
round Table, which was then so fully furnished with a peareles troop of
courageous Cauileers, as justly compared with all countries for like company,
whose names were Sir Lancelot du-lake, and Sir Tristram du-Lions, two wonders
for their worthiness, matchles for their might, and for their courtesy exceeding
compare: who amongst many millions of other brave Gallants there all for one
purpose assembled, proudly opposes themselves against all approaching powers
both of foreign and homeborne foes that durst any way set themselves against
her Soueraignetie, wherein they so valiantly behaved themselves, especially
Sir Lancelot du-lake, whose undaunted courage stroke such terror to the hearts
of his foes, and won such favor in the sight of his friends, as he was
generally admired of all, but especially of Laura whose maiden heart being
now touched with the prick of affection, received so deep an impression, as
could never after be raced forth again, and look as there is no substance
without his accident, no fire without his smoke, nor shadow without his body:
so is there no love how closely soever it be shadowed, how cunningly soever
it be dissembled, or how far so ever removed, but will by some means
manifest it self, which in her proved true: for though her modest countenance
blushing, ashamed at first to discover the earnest affection of a so soon
conquered lover, labored what in her lay still to repres her new mounting
thoughts winged with the aspiring defense of a restles lover: yet like fire the
more it is kept down the fiercer it rises, floods the surer they are stopped,
the sooner they ouerflow their banks, and winds the greater that are their
oppositions, the more furious are their forces: so fared it with the laboring
heart of this lawles lover, sometimes determining to disclose with her tongue
what lay so hid in her heart, and then she blushed for shame: then determined
to smother it in oblivion; and then looks she pale as fainting in despair: no
minute but there entered into her mind the thought of a thousand doubts, no
doubt but redoubled her trouble some thoughts, and both more and more dou^tes,
still increases she unquenchable fire of her loue-thirsting soul.

In that things by how much they are hard to compass, by so much are more
worth being once compassed, gladly would she forget that which most she
delights to remember, feign would she shun the snare that she so willingly
runs into, and desires to wink at that she does most desire: On the other
side the worthy Knight dispairing of his good fortune, or else doubting his
former force, grew with melancholy demeanor to spend half in despair, the
days he was wont to ouerpasse in the fulness of desire, thinking either her
affections were else where so thoroughly settled as could not be severed, or his
worth merriting demeanor deserved not so much as a fair aspect from those
powerful plannets that guides the distressed estate of his sickly soul. Look
as a weary wayfaring man, that tired with the toilsome labor of a tedioust
avail, dispayring with in his time to enjoy the end of his journey, and
therefore uses a speedier pace to perform his purpose, so fares it with the
still troubled mind of this distr^ssed Knight, who determining with himself
how he might work some means that might merrite mercy in the moodie censure
of that disdainefull Judge, who as he thought with a severe sentence, would
rather pronounce his death than promise his life, determined with himself how
he might do his endeavor to obtain her friendly favor, which with long
consultation he thus concluded, namely to undertake some hardy adventure, and
dedicate his labor to her love, and so if peradventure the happy course of
all helping heavens did so prosperously further his attempts, as that in his
weary plotted way, he might but fortunately find any worthy work, whose
conquest might deserve commendations, he fed himself with this hope, that the
settled perswation of his sure love confirmed by the dangerous endeavors of his
longing life, perfectly presented to her memory, by the atcheiuements of his
worthy victory, would somewhat assuage the fury of her contemptuous conceit,
and if not at the first win her, yet by little and little wear out the blot
from her memory, that detaines his love from her mind: yet least his abrupt
departure might be a greater cause of his disgrace, he determined before he
went to paint forth that passion in the vnblushing lines of an amoreus letter,
which he could not disclose with the inforsiue words of a pity moving lover,
and therefore sequestring himself from the resort of all company, he thus in
pitiful terms discouers his pure love.

Lancelot du-Lake, to the Sovereign of his soul, matchles fair Laura.
LAura, pardon my rude proceeding, in that I so barely begin with thy naked
name, for that thou dimmest all accents of fair, and exceedest all Epethites
of wit, the Poets thought Venus fairest when she was naked, for that her
beauty being sufficient of it self, scorned all the artificial ornaments of
rich apparel: And so of thee, whose shadow fairer than her substance, can
not be fitted with any style which thou do not far surmount: Look down
upon the servile estate of a subject slave, that burning in the fierce flame
of a never dying fire, prostrates his silly soul at thy perfections shrine,
so deeply imprinted in his heart, as but the comfort of thy pleasing self, no
salve may ease his dying smart, only thou have hurt me, and save thy self
none can heal me. Ah do not then triumph in my tragedy, because peculiarly
from thee proceeds my remedy: nor be not proud of thine Art, because thus
piteously I implore thine aid, but with gentle favor intertaine what with
humble submission I entreat, and in requital of that deed I will impose to my
self a toil without rest, a travel without end, and be a Conqueror without
conquest, till my ceaselesse pain may deserve thy pity, my toilesome travel
procure our truce, and the Trophies of my victory requite some part of thy
courtesy: Thus what I do or what I suffer, what I presently possess, or
whatsoever I shall have, I sacrifice at thy Altar, as propitiatory offerings,
and with the sad sighs of a sorrowful heart cense thy sacred shrine, still
entreating but this, that thou would gently accept these rude lines of a
rude Lover, and when discontented distance shall divorce me from thy
Angelical presence, thou would at the least pity my sorrow, though thou will not salve my sore.

Thine whilst his own Lancelot du Lake.


THis Letter he delivered to a Page atten^ant upon him, and whilst his servant
was gone to convey it to her, himself went in to take his leave of the Duke
and the rest of his Noble friends and fellow Knights, where with a tedious
discourse he discouers the cause of his so sudden departure, vowing his
devoted service wholly to her honor, for whose love he was now forced to leave
his Country, an^ seek strange Adventures in foreign Coasts, whom they all
were sorry to forgo; yet seeing his importance, solemnly commits him and his
intended enterprises to the good fortune of his still favorable stars,
except Sir Tristram du-Lyons, who for love of him, and honorable care of his
solemn order, would needs in despite of what ever contrary perswations,
accompany him in his course: whom when Sir Lancelot had with many perswasiue
arguments of forceable friendship diswaded from his endeavor, laying open unto
him the great cause of his delefull departure, which so devoutly he had vowed
to perform, as also what discontent the absence of so many Knights would breed
in their King and Captain Arthur of England, whose royal furnished Table had
ransacked the treasury of the world for to supply his want: yet all in vain
strove his words to dissuade the other from his will, for not all the sugered
words the others oratorie could afford, would any whit diswade him from his
former purpose: but in despite of what ever accident should ensue, he would
needs accompany him in his journey, vowing to sustain what hardy storms of
abject misfortune soever should betide this thrice famous Lancelot his vowed
brother, that never should the burning heat of all springing summer, nor the
cruel cold of dead killing winter, weal nor woe, prosperous felicity, nor
adverse extreamitie, sunder their souls whilst life did uphold their bodies:
Whom when Lancelot saw that by no means he could diswade, he gently admits
his so long desired company, and with as many thanks accepts it, as the other
with millions of offers had urged it.

CHAP. III.
How Lancelot du-Lake, and Tristram du-Lions arrived in the French Kings Court,
and how Lancelot du-Lake overcame Roderigo Duke of Austria, and won the
chiefest prizes in the Turnament, with other things that happened.

THus these two adventurers for honor, after they had solemnly taken their
leaves, joyfully set forward on their journey, and with a prosperous wind
quickly cuts over the calm consenting Seas unto the bordering rocks that
walls their country France from the fury of the sometime surging Sea, and
after their ariual, being proudly mounted upon stately Steedes, stout of
courage, able of limbs, and beauteous in show, attended only with two Pages,
who for that purpose they had appointed, takes upon them the nearest and
directest way that bordered upon that coast where they lately landed, and
spending the partching heat almost of a whole summers day wandering through
desert woods and many unpeopled plains: till when the sweating Horses, of the
weary sun swiftly descending from the highest top of that heavenly hill,
whence in his glory he ouerlookes the mightiest mountains that the earth
affordes, and by their fiery tract summoned the silent night up to her weary
watch, they began to look out where they might espy any convenient place for
their purpose, where that night they might repose themselves to rest.

At last after much curious search descending down into the pleasant bottom of
a lowly dale, where by chance ran from forth, the bowels of a mighty
mountain, a cool fresh spring, whose silver current shadowed over with the
heat expelling power of thick tuffted trees, refreshes the increase of all
adjoining valleys, who weary with wandering, and willing no thing more than
such pleasure as there was plentifully promised, they alighted, and rayning all
their horses to the big bows of an aged neighboring Oak, gins with the fresh
cool current of that pleasant spring to alay the thirst of their hot stomachs,
where they had not long solicited themselves in the shade after their great
travail, but that an ancient Hermit inhabiting the desert rooms of that
unaccquainted corner, walking his accustomed journey, by chance lights upon
these weary knights, as they were cooling their weak limbs in the
delightsome depth of that pleasant spring, who as joyful to see some creature,
of whom they might be better directed for the furderance of their affairs, as
the other was willing to supply their wants, with that poor provision that
himself wanted not, they with courteous salutation entertain him, and he
courteously regreeting them with the like wishes of good luck, requires what,
whence, and who they were that had so far wandered from the beaten ways of
those wide Deserts, to whom Lancelot with reverent regard to his old age,
mildely answers that they were two Knights of the round Table, aduenterers in
Arms, that had for the honor of their order, the credit of their country, and
the love of their love worthy Ladies, undertaken to travail even as far as
sun and seas, the one would give them light, and the other afford them land.

Then answered the old Hermit, are you happily come into these Confines: for
not far from hence is the great Court of that mighty Monarch Jews of France,
that for the eternal memory of all succeeding posterity, has for to try the
strength, valor, and manhood that all the wide world can afford, appointed
three Prises, the first a rich Armor curiouslye wrought, and richly be decked
with precious stones, whose worth I cannot in words sufficiently set forth,
with all the habilliaments thereunto belonging: the next a gorgeous Bed
curiously covered over with beaten gold, the fashion whereof far exceeds
the worth of the massy work, and all the rich adorninge^ thereunto
appertaining: the last but best, fair Celestina his daughter and heir, whom
I may well call the wonder of our world, whose beauty I will not labor to
blase, least failing in furdering that rare report, I should discredit my
self in seeming curiously to commend that whose least moytic exceeds the
highest reach of any earthly mind: There may you try the trust you have in
your selves, and cut short the process of your long pretended journey: for
that thither will resort all the flowers of Cheualrie, that now flourishe over
the face of the whole world: To morrow begins these triumphs, whether in good
time you shall attain, and for that this day well nigh done, will not afford
you any further travail, please it you but to accept the turfi^ Cabbine of a
homely Hermitage, and the simple supper of a silly ^questered man, that having
forsaken the vain delights of his young days, has be taken himself to the
melancholy remembrance of his after life: where to supply your want of
meat, you shall have store of welcomes, and when the next morn shall bring
glad tidings of the swift ensuing sun, my self will direct^ you back thither,
from whence you far erred in declining your weary journey hither.

These two Knights courteously accepting the pleasure of this aged Hermit,
contented themselves that night with the vnbolstred bed of a hard hurdle, and
when the lively Lark a gladsome Harrald to the dawning day, began with her
silver sounding note to discharg^ the melancholy glooming night, hence haste
these same following adventurers, to practice their forward endeavors, whom
the old Hermit duclie directes how they should again get into the great
traced way that directly would carry them to the Court, and so with many
prayers for their good speed, commits them to the charge of him that
carries the care of all creatures: from whence they had not long travailed
recounting to themselves the happy chance of their speedy ariuall, but before
them over an even leuelled plain, they might epsy a wide beaten way, being
full fraught with still approaching trauailers, that like a huge and mighty
stream sending all his force to the sea, turns all the course of their
conueiance to one end, directs their iournney with all speed thither, supposing
that to be the way that should lead them to the Court, and those trauailers
wandering thither to be witnesses of the rare report of those deeds of Arms,
whereof their old Host had the other night given such great commendations:
where when they came, they found it to be even so as they before imagined, and
turning themselves that way whither pressed the stream of the increasing
company: At la^^ they ouertooke a mighty knight clad in habilliment^ of gold,
such as was the Armor of Achilles, mounted on a black Barbarian Steed, that
with his stately gate stoutly contendes to put down his Master in pride,
trapped with the rich pomp of Persian work^, curiously set with stars like
Diamonds, that playing with the dazeling beams of the golden Sun, dimes all
the gazing eyes of the greedy beholders: before him rides richly mounted ten
Esquiers bearing ten lusty Lances, and thus martching in as triumphant a
state as ever did Caesar in the Roman street^, he comes to the Court, where
were ready prepared all necessary circumstances for such Knightly services:
where before the Court upon a plain green provided for that purpose, the
attendants appointed to be erected a rich Pauillion of wealthy wrought
Crimson silk, the ropes of the same color wrought with ^^luer threads, and
what else belonged to the supporting thereof was workemanlike wrought of the
same metal: there till the time that every thin^ was ready for the Tilt, he
reposes himself, where Lancelot longing to know and prove what was contained
with in all this Port, boldly gins inquire of an attendant upon him what he
should be, who answered that his M^^ter was son and heir to the great Sultan
of Babylon, drawn from his Country with the same of fair Celesti^a, for whose
love he came thither, to adventure his life.

Shortly after approaches the place another puisant Knight clad all in black,
and he only attended by a little Page that bore his Lance, erected a sable
Tent, of whom when he required to know, it was answered that he was called
Triamore, son to the Duke of Britain, who for that he had long affected
this beauteous Prince (for whose sake all this was provided) and she with like
affection answered his love, seemed discontented in himself, that she should
be offered to any but himself.

Next him came many other of whom were too long severally to dilate. But in
the end when all were ready, and every thing for these stately triumphs
orderly provided, the Prizes brought forth, the Judges set, and every other
appurtenance orderly appointed, the first that entered the Lists was Ferdinand
heir to the Emperor of Alma^ne, mounted on a white Courser, that being
artificially arrayed with cunning conceited wings, Peggasean-like deceived the
earnest eyes of every beholder, with a show of fained flight.

Against him prepares a Pagan, mighty of body, and cruel of countenance, who
furiously meeting, like the fatal opposition of two Elements, shiuers their
strong staves, whose splinters spinning in the empty Air, with their buzsing
sound, tells the brave encounters of their furious fight from whom they flew,
which course the Pagan borne from his Horse, and sore bruised with the big bound
of his vnweildie body, was conuayed from the place of their Chivalry, almost
past hope of recovery.

In whose revenge stepped footh many mighty men, hardy and approved Knights
whom this young Prince with like fury, forced to fall with their fellows:
till at last like an angry Bore newly roused from his drowsy den, busling up
his big brissels, as aiming at an act of rigorous revenge, steps forth the
proud Soldans son, and he pricking his Palfray to the end he might rigorosly
root out the springing hope of this young Prince, clapping as heavy a Lance
in his strong rest, as ever Ajax fore the walls of Troy, shiuered for the
recovery of their unhappy loss: even like the furious stroke of two strong
streams, that with their tirrible thunder affrights the unaccustomed ears of
their near neighbors: meets in the midest of the Lists the lively Lords,
where with equal encounters they were both dung down to the ground, where
Ferdinand his horse unhappily falling upon his Masters leg, so bruised it, as
he was not able again to recover his saddle, but was conveyed thence: which
when the young Sultan perceived, stoutlye triumphing in his valiant victory
gins saucely to proclaim aproud challenge against all Christians, for the
revenge of those fore punished Pagans: which vain glorious vaunt so stirred up
the never va^^quished valor of valiant Lancelot, as that addressing him to the
fight, gins show himself at the other end of the Listes, as ready to recover
the almost lost Honor of his Christian Country, whom so soon as the Sultan
had espied, spreading his wings like a greedy Goshauke houering over a
fearful ^ouie of cowardly Fowls, gins address himself to his former
demeanor: whom Lancelot with such courage encountered, as bearing down both
horse and man to the ground, astonished the vnchristned slave with so fearful
a fall, as almost quite expelled the vital spirits from his big swollen
breasts: But yet feeling himself in so great a danger of devouring death, and
out of all hope of the pitiful compassion of his eager enemy, began again
to rouse himself, and speedily preparing his strong fencing furniture, so
assay the fortune of a furious fight, casting over his shoulder a large
sheltering shield and brandishing in his hand a keen edged Turtle-axe, gins no
we a foot to assail him, that before on Horse back he did assault.

When Lancelot perceived it, he provided himself for the like purpose, and
courageously encounters this harm hammering Heathem, where betwixt them again
began a far more fiercer fray on foot, then was cruel encounters before
with their Horse, which continuing very long on both sides confirmed with the
fierce falls of their unwieldy weapons, makes at length Sir Lancelot du-Lakes
arms (weakened with the issue of much blood, that the Pagan had spilt with his
blows) almost to fail of his former forces, which being espied of the
Christians, and especially of the King, who above all other, despised a Pagan
should possess so Princely a Prize, as they had there provided, gins every
where to enquire of that Knight, on whose strength almost now depended their
whole estate, to whom at length word was brought that it was a Knight of King
Arthurs round Table, whose name was Sir Lancelot du-Lake, to whom all the
Confines of Christendom hardly in Chivalry afforded a fellow: which stroke
such a dismal dumpe into the moodie mind of this discontented King, to see
the Champion of Christendom so near vanquished, under the pitiless power of
a most hellish heathen, as almost drives the bright Rosiall color from his
before well colored Cheeks.

Till when this still triumphant Knight shakeing himself as from a sluggish
slumber, reaches at the Pagan with such power, as that at one blow with his
well tempered sword, he quite cuts a sunder the strong turret that hemmed in
his head, and settling further down to his harmefull head, batters a sunder
the silver wall that shieldes the principal parts of soul serving sense, and
the rest remaining remnants of that little world, wanting the direction of
their greatest guide, altogether fail any further to sense their fainting
fellows from his battring blows, which sight bred no small content to the
almost sickly soul of the King, who expected nothing less then the so speedy
death of his spiteful foe, who being by the conquered disarmed of his rich
habilliaments, was by the rest of his company quickly conuaied to his curions
Tent, and all his attendants sent home with sorrow, that whilome flourished in
such hope for felicity.

After this approached many other Knights to try their fortunes in that fight:
from whence Sir Tristram du-Lions won the honor of that day, still working for
greater glory with more manlike demeanor: Till when the nights black shadow,
gin^ set an end to that days bright shows, and so every one expecting the end
of their adventures, thronged to hear the just judgment of that sure
censuring Senate, forepointed by the King to determine of this doubt, who with
one assent after they had highly commended the many valerous deeds of diverse
courageous Cauileers, did above all wholly attribute the honor of that days
duty to Sir Lancelot du-Lake, as one that had best deserved it of them all,
and so putting him to the King, at whose hands he was to receive this renowned
reward: he there with no less pleasure to hear the murmering noise of the
muttering multitud, buzsing the report of his valerous deeds: then with the
hope of those rich rewards appointed for the Conquerours meed, received at his
Kingly hands al those robes, of more than estimable estate, and whatsoever by
due was sitting his desert.

Amongst which was that more than fair Celestina, for whom rather than the
rest was assembled such and so many mighty men, even from the furthiest Coasts
of all the Esterne Kingdoms to the Western Isles, bound up in the Oceans
bosom: but for that himself had before settled his service, to honor that
Saint whose Idea graven with the Diamond points of Crystal caruing eyes, in
the impregnable table of his secret heart, whence no fury of new assaulting
force, can ever wash it away, determines in this to win to himself the
report of more worth, than by his former acts he had fully achieved: and
therefore with many thanks to his Majesty, receiving the rewards of his
honor, which now lay all in his power to dispose after some conference, such
as to like affairs are most fit, calling for Sir Tryamore, of whom we before
told you, that he was son and heir to the Britain Duke, gins thus
discourse his honorable intent.

Since quoth he the vnmerited mercy of ever helping heaven, from the great
attemptes of many more mightier than my self, has attributed the honor of
this day to the undeserved duty of my deedse: By the censure of which
sentence, I am to enjoy the possession of all this pleasure, whose especial
good, rests in the glory of this more than a Goddess: yet since my mind not
cappiable of her loves impression, because alrerady it retains the beauty of
another, in such sure possession, as that no time can try it, no beutie blot
it, nor other love with languishment lavish it away, to thee will I give what I
might by right take away, and so gain more honor by the voluntary release of
her love to thee, then I should get fame by the forceable detayning of her
affections to my self: In which I shall bind thy love to me, as to a friend,
her liking as to a fauorer of her fortunes, and further the fair fruit of a
yet scarce blooming bud, in the blessed bosom of another beauty; and so
delivering her freely over to Sir Triamore, twixt whom there had been before
such settled likeing of likely love, to the Kings great content, the lovers
full consent, and his own more furthered intent, he disposed of the greatest
part of his prize: the other several rewards he determined to send over into
England to present to his Laura: for whose conueyance he adressed a trusty
Esquire of his own, that from a child had followed him in all his actions of
honor: where awhile we must leave him to his further adventures, and prosecute
the presentment of his Prize to his peareles Parramour, which by his Page was
quickly performed: who flying with the favorable fortune of well wishing
winds, in shorter space than commonly acompanieth such tired travelers,
arrived in England at the old Earl Cadors Court, where was then a Royal
assembly of Courtlike company: to whom when it was known that there was
arrived one ready to tell strange tidings of the admirable atchiuements of
their late fortune finding friends, assembled all together to hear those
welcome words into the Earls great Hall: where both himself, his daughter
and his unseemly son, as also the rest of that Royal resort orderly placed
with attentive diligence, quieted themselves to hear expressed these strange
exploits: to whose presence did prease a comely Esquire attended by a drudging
Dwarffe that was loaded with a rich Armor, who after he had in order rendered
deserving duty to every several assemblant, thus delivered his message.

Great Earl to whose honor wholly submites it self the whole worth of his
work, that from the fierce fury of Alians arms has bravely born away these
Princely rewards Grant pardon to my rash resort, and give license to my truth
telling tongue in few words to disclose the especial cause of my hasty
coming: and then with the honorable accidents of these worth worthy wars,
gins he to paint forth the praises of that famous fight: wherein from the still
flowing force of many furious foes, had his matchles master bravely borne away
the home brought booties: Which tale he so furnished with fitting Epethites,
and true titles of aduenterous valor, as never sung the sweet tuned tongue of
heavenly Tullie in the famous Capitol of still renowned Room, with more
applausiue speeches of a truth urging tale, extolling the eternized honor of
those thrice famous aduenterours with the heaven scaling style of a more than
earthly Oration: and then with the black tragic tunes of strange misfortune,
such as was the Art framed action of that Thracian Knight, when he described to
doleful Dido the true story of Troys estate: To whose powerful speech listened
the attentive care of that pity moving Prince of whom we before told, when the
happy heavens dispersing now the sable vale of sad faced folly, that so long
in the dark dungeon of ignominy, had locked up the happiness of his after hopes,
being now able in himself to see, that which before in another he could not
discern, even as the Eagle after her age casts her bill, the Serpent slides
off his skin, or the wanton Bucke his harmles head: So he to the great
admiration of all those worthy witnesses, suddenly starting at the strange
tale of this well spoken Page, griuouslie be wailed the lucklesse date of his
forespent days that had so sluggishly over slipped the young years of his
youthful iollitie in the fabling fancies of childish folly: wherein he
neither had discharged the duty of a son, satisfied the honor owing to his
countries service, nor won the least part of that worth, that by due desert he
saw generally attributed to many men of far meaner birth, and therefore now
turning his former foolish demeanors to more Princely promising ^ndeuours, he
suddenly solicited his old sorrow tired sire, that he would thus far
further his intent, as to grant him leave a while to forsake his native soil,
and learn thus to adventure for honor in far foreign lands, whose instant
entreaty not brooking the deferring of further delay, earnestly urged his now
more fortunate Father to further so his forward Son, as that presently
providing all such necessaries as to him was most needful, without any more
means made for his bootlesse abode, fitly furnished him in every point for
such a purpose: where every necessary being provided, and himself now ready
to depart, blessed with the many prayers of his joyful father to see his
forward son recovered from the helples horror of dark ignorance, to the
approving prowess of Princely pusance, and with the well willing wishes of all
his friendly favorites, he departs his home to seek his so long lost glory
abroad.

Mean while whilst thus Lancelot has sent over to his Mistress the before named
favors, speedy preparation was provided in France for the solemnezing of this
Royal marriage betwixt Sir Triamore, and fair Celestina: which for that his
father then resident upon his Dukedom, was desirous to content his old conceit
with the sight of his sons marriage: Sir Triamore earnestly entreated of the
King, that he would so far further his old fathers request, as to license
their departure home into Brittanie, whereto the old King willingly
condiscended and most Royally furnished this their joyful journey: whither
being attended with sir Lancelot du Lake, and sir Tristram du Lions, besides
many other as well valiant Knights as beauty brauing Dames, drawn out from the
chiefest choice of all that Country, merrily sets forward on their way.

In the mean time the Sultan hearing of the disgraced death of his son, and
certefied by some of his ^spials, of the pretended purpose of these Christian
Princes were the only sharers of that glory, gins presently to leuy what
forces his Country in so short a time was able to lend, and imbarking with all
speed his Army, in short time landed all his men upon the unhappy Coast of
Britanie, where orderly incamping themselves, about the warlike walls of that
strong defended Town, where the Duke with all his attendants kept then a
puisant Court for the welcomming of his son and his beauteous Bride; cutting
off all those conueying passages, that leads any way to their neighbor
compassing Confines, remoouing all semblance of succor from their longing
fight: And being further certefied of the near approach of that triumphant
troop of valiant Victors, that fearing nothing less than such trothlesse
treason, wears out their journey with such joy, as experience in far meaner
men's matters proves passing all other pleasure.

Whose purpose the subtle Sultan purposing to prevent, in an old ouergrowne
wood, situate some four miles from the City, flily insconse^ a great Scout
both of horse and foot: who as soo^e as they had encompassed this careless
company within their ill intending Arms, rudely rusht out upon them: who for
because their coming somewhat too sudden in with the other Knights, could
hardly provide to resist their foreplotted purpose, and the numbers so far
different, as scarcely might they afford one Christian to twenty Pagans,
whereby they were forced to a furious sight: In which sane only Lancelot,
Tristram, and Triamore all were slain, and Celestina maugre all their force,
conveyed away in the sight. Which when they perceived, like three enraged
Lions, amidst the troops of the Forests fearful inhabitants, prays upon
the cursed carkases of these unchristened Curres, till when no more fuel was
left for the^ fire, no remainder whereon they might, work their further
revenge, nor any other subject for their conquering swords, hope of recovery
was past, because their numbers were too great; the fury of further fight in
vain, because themselves were too weak; and being desperate almost, what way
to take to find relief.

Long time they spent in disputing what were best to do in this extreme
danger, themselves being sore wounded with the many blows of their over
numbered foes, their Armor bruised with the often falling forces of their Foe-mens
swords, and their weapons almost all broken in this barbarous battle, incites
to their sad thoughts what secure means they might seek for their best
safeguard.

Being thus left destitute welnigh of all defenc^, they wandered up and down
the untrodden ways of those wast woods, one reciting this, another inditing
that, and the third misliking both; till when the comfortless covering of the
sad faced night, gins hide away the life ioying sight of the lightsome day,
when these sorrowful sighing souls wandering in the unpeopled paths of these
wide woods, spent all that tedious night in tired travels, sometimes straying
this way, and then stepping that way again, till the sorrow of their sower
chance had almost quite taken away the ready remembrance of them selves.

At last as every sorrow has an end, so had this long night, and the
pleasant spring of the next ensuing day gins somewhat to cheer up their
troubled minds from the cruel cares of their over passed pains, when
determining with themselves to make speedy post to every several Christian
Kingdom, and from thence to leuy such powers of people, as should perforce
make this heathen Hel-hound again to render up to their hands this beauty
staining Bride, whom he had so cowardly caught away: Till wandering together
down the pleasant side of a summer showing hill they might espy beneath in the
broad bottom of a dismal dale a great worn way, yet not such as
accustomably are the conueyances of peopled beaten ^athes, but as it were the
fatal footsteps of some mighty Monster that with his ill favored feet had
poyson^d the sprouting springes of that pleasant Plain. Which after they had a
long time followed, prying every way what this wonder should import: At last
they a far off might hear the unaccustomed cries (as it should seem) of
some tormented soul, that being grievously afflicted with some strange
torments, made those ruthful moanes to move the compassionate minds of some
wayfaring wanderer to deliver her from that great misery: which they like two
lost fellows in a great grown wood, that with the resounding Echoes of
their loud scriking cries, brings themselves after long search together
again, who listening from what likeliest place this same might grow, at last
under the dark shade o^ a sh^ltring Cipresse that overhung the mouth o^ a
traggie Cave, h^ went out (as it should seem) of the big bo^y of a ruinous
Rock, they might perfectly perceive the same to proceed: Whither po^s^ing in
all have, striving who should stand in most sted for the release of this loss
(as they supposed) rudely they together ran down without regard into this
dark Den, who as s^^ne as they were in, from out the dark covert of another
cabbining Cave st^pt forth a mighty Monster, framed with the deceitful face
of a fair woman, but the big body of a subtle Serpent, whose poison swollen
bowelles bearing the breadth of a mighty Tun, was supported with the ioyntles
legs of a Castle carrying Elephant, hands had she in form like a man, but in
the substance of her frame more than a monster, a tail that Serpent like
catches in the unprovided trauailers, her back strongly fenced with broad
buckling scales, that proudly opposes it self against the toughest steel, her
force more than could be comprehended within the reach of a reasonable
conceit: for she (after her Crokadile complaints she had) ^rawing the
harmless Knight into that subtle snare, quickly routes up against the mouth
of the hole a mighty stone, which the force of many men could not else remove,
and so locking in these well meaning men within the compass of her loathsome
Den, she leaves them to the comfortless consort of their now almost
curelesse cares.

CHAP. IIII.
How Chinon after his transformation from his foolishnes, betook himself to
seek for foreign adventures, and after how he encountered Sir Lancelot, and
Sir Tristram in a Forest, where happened a strange adventure, and how Chinon
pulled a sword from an inchaunted Rock of stone.

By this had Chinon crossed the Sea^ out of his own country, and arrived in
France where he never ca^e before, and himself yet ignorant in the course of
travail, wandered up and down a long time, seeking some worthy work wh^r^n he
might make trial of his strength. But for that the desolate Coasts bordering
upon the sea side, afforded no matter for his manly courage, after he had there
spent some few days, he takes a new course of travel over the untrodden
hills into the bosom of the next bounding Country.

Which weary way, for that his horse being young and not yet used to the hard
hap of adventures himself, even as a child that new sprung from his cradle,
can hardly counteruail the worlds weary works; so fared it with this new
Knight, who was greedy of glory, but unfit to find it: yet hoping of better
hap, draws out his journey over many high hills, and then settles he down
into the melancholy shade of deep darkened valleys, where before never footed
any earthly creature, save foul Serpents, no noise but the sorrowful sound of
the ill boading Owl; no light save the glimmering of a little beam that
shining through the transparant leaves of black Cypress boughe^ showed him
some comfort amidst this more than the shadow of death: No meat could he come
by, save such as that unfruitful earth did afford, nor drink save the troubled
streams of an unpleasant spring, that mixed with the unwholesome sorts of dead
dropping leaves full of the filthy slime of sluggish Toades, and many such
unwholesome creatures: his Bed the ouergrowne moss upon the side of the
mountain; his pillowe the top of an uneven ston^; his covering nothing save
the ouershadowing bows of age trembling trees; his nightly sleeps often
affrighted with the hissing of many soul s^^ks, vnacustomable antomes to his
ears: yet as he that will travel upon the sea, must address himself to
abide the trouble of every storm; he that will enjoy the sweet content of
felicity, must needs undergo all the hard haps of envious adversity: so he
that will in this spacious world seek the advantage of Honor, must bear base
direction of unseemly misfortune.

So this young Prince after he had long time wandered thus without the direction
of any way, at length espies a far off a chalkie path, scaling the top of a
high hill, whether with much ado at length he came unto, and after he had long
time climed upon the side of this mount, at length with many weary steps he
attains the top: from whose height he might again look back at his
ouerspent journey: following a long while the broad tract of that beaten way,
presently he came to a narrow cut of passage out of the side of a flintie
Rock, where the high hill steep ore his head, troubles the course of the
wind wandering clouds, beneath the lowly bottom of a black dismal Dale,
filled with the furious force of aspyring springs, that working from the womb
of the sea, even unto the highest top of that mighty Promontany, breaks out
again, and with a fierce fall down into the dismal Dales, makes such a
hidious noise: as when the unbridled force of the ouerflowing sea breaks down
the bounds of his neighboring banks, and drownes all the nere placed plains,
with his euerworking waters: Yet Chinon still hoping that after showers, at
length would come a sun; after woes, weal; and after these hard passages
pleasanter plains; with as much patience as he could, ouergoes this grief he
had, and gins at last to see the farther side of his weary way: from whence
looking down, he might epsy a more pleasant dale, whether descending by a
down falling path that went into the bottom of a Hill he gladly at length
attained, and there in a more fresher and pleasanter stream than before of a
long time he had met withal: he some what refreshes himself, and being
content with such fruit as that soil did afforde him, he goes forward on his
journey, still searching for that he could not find: At last he came as he
thought to the mouth of some Cave that was fully filled up with the strong
bulk of a mighty big stone, whose hugeness was such as could not be
removed by the might of many men, where in old almost outworne letters, were
these lines engraven.

In prison here a puisant wight,
Betrayed by cunning craft now lies:
Whence no man but a maiden Knight,
Can free him from his miseries,
Whose first tried valor must assay,
To rid this wretched man away.
Which when he had red and curiously considered, gins to resolve with himself,
to assay whether his fortune should be so good as to perform this service,
where looking round about for him that did here in a peremptory painted
challenge keep the passage of that place, where this Knight whereof mention
was there made, is by subtlety enclosed, at last suddenly, but from whence
he saw not, there was a huge deformed Monster, such as before he seldeme or
never had seen, whose shape neither imported the proportion of man nor beast,
but a mixture of them both: from forth the furnace of whose fiery belly,
issues like the ashes of Aetna, many cloudie mists of dark smoke, that almost
smoothered this famous follower of hardy deeds before he began the fight, and
in this Fogge armed with the bulk of a young springing Dake, the fell force of
whose fall, had been sufficient to have ground him a sunder, gins unawares to
assail him: which when perceived, nimbly leaping back to eschew the heavy
stroke, prepared in as short space as he could to provide himself for this
fray, but ere he ^ould be in every point armed, gins again this monster the
second time to assault him, which he in the best sort he could devise, sought
means to escape, for to undergo it he could not: and then nimbly conueying
himself within the end of his mighty weapon, with his well tempered sword
gins assay to work upon the Monster, but all in vain, for so strongly was it
every where buckled with insconsing scales, as no more entrance was affoorded
for his sword, then if he had stricken upon the hard face of a flinty Rock,
when the subtle serpent with a sudden turn gave the Knight such a heavy blow
with the poisoned weight of her strong tail, as perforce beat him down to the
ground, and almost banished the breath from his body: But he mindful of what
he had in hand, to encounter so unnatural an enemy; long lies not in that
case, but nimbly rousing up himself again, gins freshly to assail his
enemy: who still threatening him with the bigg blows of his unwieldy weapon,
puts him every way to his shi^t how he might best shun them.

At last spying a fit opportunity, he with his sword endeavored to cut asunder
her unaccustomed kind of weapon, which in short time he performed, so that now
free means he had for to assay what he could do upon her unwieldy body: But
all his labor was lost, for so safely was she guarded from all entrance, as
not the keenest steel the smoakie Cyclops forged for the mighty God of
wrathful war, could ever enter into her: when he troubled at once with two
illes, the furious force of her serpentine tail, which now proves her best
weapon, and the brimstone flaming which still issued out at the Furnace of her
fiery mouth.

At the last after much labor, the weary Knight tired almost with this tedious
toil, gins somewhat to return back, to the end he might recover again his
nie lost breath: which flight for that the Serpent did not with such eager
force pursue, as she was went to do in the beginning of their fight, he made
longer stay to recover thereby better strength, and then as two furious
fighting Stagges that fetching a far flight, thereby to encounter with more
force, begins again these new old enuies and with their furious blows so
plagued one another, as if the opposition of two great Armies had sent the
noise of their battering Arms from every resounding echo: till at length
after the many fierce assaults of the furious Knight, his foiled enemy in a
sudden as she came, vanishes away, which he suspecting but to be some devilish
devise, with an intent to set upon him again at unawares, gins circumspectly
to pry into every corner, to the end he might be sure that no intrapping
ambushes of her hobgoblin companions, might privily lurk to ensnare his life:
when unawares he perceived the mighty stone so meruailously laid over the Cave
of it self to roll away, and from forth the hole issues out three goodly
Knights, two whereof he knew, for his Countrymen and old acquaintance: but the
third which was a stranger he never saw before, these were they of whom we
said before were by the subtle shift of a deceauing Siren, cunningly compassed
in that Cave: where when Sir Lancelot du Lake and his fellow Tristram saw
Chinon, that at their departure from England they left foolish in their
friends, and his fathers house, miraculously transformed to a valiant Knight,
and so luckily there arrived, for their relief: no marvel if with admiration,
their woondering wits were drawn into a laborinth of such deep conceits,
how this might come to pass; that being amazed as were those stone turned
people, which gazing upon Gorgons head, could hardly believe in their
minds, what was so lively presented to their eyes, till Chinon perceiving
their passion, gins thus to waken them from their drowsy and sluggishe dream.

Fellows in Arms (quoth he) the very report of whose valor has from the
heavy weight of obscure folly, rowsed my dead drooping thoughts to the
lively remembrance of a higher mounting mind, not happier shall you be in this
your release, than I in bringing you relief; in that the succession of after
growing ages, shall eternize my name for the opening of this worse than hellish
mouth, and for the vanquishing of that more than miraculous Monster, for that
by the one I again restored to the world two such valiant Knights: and by the
other, rid them of a pestilent plague.

Stand not in a maze, for I am the man that lately you left in a world of
folly, but now by the power of provident heaven, raised from that deiection.
At last Lancelot (ouercloied with joy to see him thus fortunate, that whilome
was so foolish) regreetes his good hap with many joyful words, such as
commonly pass betwixt long parted friends at their unexpected meeting, and
then sir Tristram likewise salutes his honorable adventure, with the many great
thanks and good wishes of like future good fortune: then sir Triamore for that
he ^^mselfe altogether unacquainted with Chinon, although he had often heard
his friends and then followers in Arms, with mickle grief to relate the
woeful case wherein they left such a Prince, as there they named in England:
yet he begins to enquire of sir Lancelot the whole passed story of his
friends estate, who with joy repea^i^g, what often with sorrow he had seen
performed: gins certesse him in every point according to hs asking, which when
sir Triamore understood that he was a Knight of comely carriage and courteous
demeanor, he forthwith with many gentle greetings and more thanks to heaven
and him for their happy delivery, vowed unto him all the honor of his actions:
Who long professing kindly friendship and duteous endeavor, to deserve this
more then common courtesy, they were presented with a troop of Fairies; among
whom was Oboram there King, who especially choosing Chinon from the rest,
began with many words of wonder to commend his Cheualry, for that last being
his first Combat, he had so valiantly behaved himself, as had all the chief
choice of powerful Christendom strove with themselves to have exceeded his
worth, their Forces all joined in one, in respect of him had been none: And
then turning to the rest of the Knights, told them that the Monster by whose
devise they were there deceived, was no other than himself, who for the desire
he had to approve the Prowess of this new come Knight, undertook that shape,
in requital of which wrong he had provided a costly sword, which by his Art
was fastened within the close binding body of a strong Rock, and he of them
that should stoutly pull it out, should for his pains enjoy a Jewel of rich
price: which sword was artificially framed for Julius Caesar, by the cunning
craft of a migh^y Magitian, inhabiting within the desolate places of those
dark valleys, and for that it so pleased the great Director of all men's
dealinges, that that work should come to naught, for that the valiant Roman
was before the perfection thereof unluckily slain in the Senate, he had
closely reserved it to another use: But who that should be of al them four,
(of which by necessity (...) needs be one) that as yet was not known to
himself, and then leading them through the dark shades of many light lacking
vaultes, she wing them the seacrets of his close couched Kingdom, bound up
within the bowels of the earth: whether when they were a little descended, they
might partly see armies of many little Elues come posting toward him, as
special attendants on his train, whose busy fingers would gladly have been
pinching their weary legs* for higher they could not reach: but that
forbidden by the great charge of their commanding King, they durst not
adventure it again,

Thus after their long walk in those close kept countries, he brought them at
length into a broad vale, in midst whereof was graven up a mighty ragged
Rock, wherein was a fair fashioned sword curiously contrived of many sundry
metals, which should seem by some or other means to have been stricken
thereinto, where this fairie King told them they were all to approve their
forces at the pulling of it, and he whose lot it should be to win it, for his
pains should always were it, whose temperature was so good as would clearly
cut a sunder what ever, stone, metal, or any harder object was opposed
against it, the virtue this, that whosoever wore it should never be assailed
by base crosbiting of any sly deceitful Inchanter.

And thus with many words extolling the excellency of the thing, and promising
good fortune to them whosoever should attain it. He first appoints Sir
Lancelot, who as greedy of this goodly weapon, as a hungry hawk of her pray,
stoutly steps forth, and laying hold of the sword with a maine force, offering
to vnsheath it, could nothing at all remove it. The next was sir Tristram, and
he also offering to do his endeavor therein was also at the first expelled:
Next him steps T^iamore, but his force as feeble as the rest let stand still
that for which they also strove: till Chinon taking sure hold upon the hilt,
with one hand did more than they were able to effect with all their power:
which when he had done, brandishing it about his head, as promising therewith
to work some extraordinary wonders, he ^traight ways by Oborams direction
was presented with a rich Armor, and all necessary furniture thereunto
belonging, borne by two little Elues, which he straight put on, and then
girding himself with his new got sword, makes all possibe speed to return as
one longing to approve what those rich habilliments did promise: to whom
Oboram after a long oration of much prefiguring valor and valiant exploytes by
him to be performed, with many offered assurances of what ready help rested
in his power to perform, whereof quoth he thou shall ere long stand in need:
gives him further, a fair shield, composed by the cunning of a famous
Inchantres: wherein was in rich metal curiouslye engraven a statelye flintie
Rock, shiuered i^ pieces by the power of a naked man, under which in letters
of gold was engraven this posie, Nihil d^fficile, and appointing him a Page of
his own bringing up, a little ill favored Eluish Dwarffe, but trusty it all
assayes, commits him to the keeping of good ^uoring fortune, till time and his
necessity shall agai^e bring them together.

CHAP. V.
How Chinon and Tiamore redeemed Celestina from the Sultan of Babylon, after a
most strange manner, with other Noble atchiuementes that they performed in the
same exploit.

THus in a sudden trance they being back again conveyed to the place whence
he first led them: where they then begin to acquaint him with all the manner
of their triumph in France, the loss of their Lady, the victory of the Pagan,
and what else ill hap had betyded them since their departure from the King of
Frances Court, which tragic tale so whetted the longing lust of this
pearelesse Prince, to revenge the injuries of those his so happy met mates, as
that he straight gins to devise how he might best work some speedy means for
her deliliuerie, that now was closely pent up in delights, far more worse
unto her than dark Dungeons: which with many hammering plots: At length he
thus purposed to bring to pass.

Thou Triamore quoth he, for that by thy default this Lady so vnluckely lost
her liberty, shall venture with me thus to recover her, and these my friends
shall in a another sort employ themselves, as I will direct them: then seeing
thy years are yet young, thy face lovely, and every well fashioned part of thy
body fit to further our intent, thou shall take upon thee the shape of some
inchantres, I and my dwarffe trimmed up in other apparel will attend upon
thee as dilligent servants which thou shall pretend thou imployest in such
secret a ^aires, as none save such simple slaves, will abide to bear: where
thou shall undertake to procure the likeing of fair Celestina, to affect him
which for that no welcommer news can come to his besotted mind, than the
sound of such service, he will easily condescend to do any thing that thou
shall direct him to: which being done, leave the rest to my disposition, and
in the mean time these my ancient friends shall whilst we work within,
attend here without, and the next night when the Queen of shades gin in her
quiet rule to dim the glimering show of lesser lights, in some secret place,
that thou (for that the best cannot direct us in this cuntrie) shall appoint to
attend our coming: where for the next days arise we will work a deed of
such worth, as shall eternize our honor in all ages, and make unborn Children
hereafter to repeat what exceeding valor, we for our Christian Country
(ouerloaden with the hateful burden of barbarous Pagans) performed, and then
instructing them thoroughly in every point of his purpose, and carefully
providing to take away every obstacle of adverse suspicion, that might any
ways be a hindrance to their well intended purpose, they meeting all again on
their sturdie Steedes rides forth, till they came near to the place whereas
the Pagan with all his Army lay, and there in the same place whereby treason
they were surprised, stays Lancelot and Tristram in a thick Castle, covered
over with thick leaued hollie, where they might ea^^y shroud themselves from
the sight of all passeng^^s: whilst Chinon; Triamore, and his Dwarffe sets
boldly forward to execute the fore plotted purpose: who coming into the Camp,
made it straight known to some of the Soldans nearest attendantes what they
were: Triamore pretending himself to be (as before we told) an Inchauntresse,
that was come from far, to further the love of the great Sultan to fair
Celestina: Which news when it was told him, sounded no less pleasant in his
ears than Ane Caesar at his Coronation: where charging them straight to be
brought to his presence, he gins to question with Triamore of his skill, posing
him in the relation of kings past, as how, when, and where he first surprised
that Lady: which Triamore for that himself was an unfortunate acter in that
doleful Tragedy could in every point ^^tly answer him: which the Pagan simply
attributing to his great skill, gives thanks to his gods that in so good time
had thither directed the skillful Inchantresse, by whose means he hoped not
only to enjoy his new ioyles love: but also to perform such prodigious
exployts, as should redound to the eternal dishonor of all Christtan
Countries, and then begins to question with him about the recovery of his love.

Triamore with a fine forged tale, gins tell him that if he would but practice
such means as he should apprint, he would so Inchaunt the lovely mind of that
fair Christian Princess to assert him, as mangeral the malice of whatsoever
opposing power, she should forsake father and friends, kinsfolks and Country,
and only bind herself to tarry with him.

Which soul pleasing sound, did ring such sweet music in his rude ears, as
that he with all speed willed her but to determine what was herein to be
d^^e, and he with as much expedition would fully effect, if it were to the loss
even of half his Kingdom.

Then quoth Triamore, this night has Cinthia filled fully up her empty
horns, whose favorable aspects will fitly futher our purpose: when therefore
the silent night has shut the eyes of every watchful creature, thou, thy
love, and my self, must by some such means as thou shall best appoint, be
conveyed secretly from the Camp into the bosom of a near bordering wood,
where we may clearly see all the coarse of the ceasles frames of never resting
heaven: where I with my inuocations, and sorcesiue Magic spells, will so
Inchaunt the mind of thy beauteous love, as hence forth she shall never
affect any other save thy self, and then pretending to prepare such necessary
furniture as should fit her purpose, she desired that her self and her
servants might a while be removed into some secret place, where they might
provide all things fit for their purpose, and where they might have some
speech, with the Damsel, which was speedily done: for a secret servant nerely
belong^ to the Sultan, was appointed to direct them: where by themselves they
had free talk with fair Celestina: to whom Triamore begins to relate all that
had happened them since their inforcesiue departure, with the happy adventure of
Chinon for their delivery, and what else had befallen them, in that travel: and
then comforts her with the hope of escape, by their thus plotted purpose: where
long they were repeting their ouerpassed pains and rejoicing in their hoped
happiness, till time approached of their departure: when the Sultan not
unmindful of this matter, sent to the Sorcerer to see if all things were
ready for their purpose: which affirmed that she was orderly p^ouided.

At last the latest hour is come, when he calling together all the chiefest of
his Captains and acquaints them with the cause, which tended so much to the
furtherance of his desire, and entreating the most of them that they would
walk with him out into the next adjoining wood to be witnesses of this work:
to whom they willingly condescended, and then gathering themselves together,
after the watch was set, they secretly departed: where the Sultan still thinking
on the inioying of his love, never dreampt of any pretend^d treason that might
thereby ensue, but greedily catching like a foolish fish at the golden bait,
they still follow on their way, till they were come to the place where
Lancelot and Tristram lay hid: where Chinon casting off his disfiguring mask,
begins now to show himself in his own likeness, and with a watch word calling
for his fellows, bravely sets upon these their enemies: where in short time
they had sent to hell all the rest, save the Sultan himself, and taking him
prisoner, carries him away bound: when Triamore now once again reuelling in
the treasury of his love: gins with all humble submission, attribute to the
honor of Chinon all the fore passed proof of this their fortunate se^uice
which they had performed.

But Celestina that now like the Thracian Damsel returned with the Lord of
her love from the dismal Gates of Hell, begins with the tears of true joy
to prostrate her self at his honorable feet, whose force had again restored
her from the tedious slavery of loathsome captivity, to the pleasant presence
of life feeding liberty, vowing devoted service for this her second life: But
Chinon disdayning that the foul faced earth should enjoy so much as touch of
her heavenly hew, with gentle entreaty rayses her up, and thus replied to her
suppliant speech.

Fairer quoth he than is the common composition of earthly creatures, and
therefore of more worth than millions, if I have ought done in this that has
bred thy content, it is no more than the beseems the duty of my degree: Then
do not thus attribute more honor for my meede, than is due by deserts to my
deed: more is thy smile toward the reward of a well deserving work, than the
rich rewards of many millions of an others vows, more pleasant is the sight of
an hours sun, than the show of twenty shadowed days: but thy sight
exceeding the brightest shining sun, that day is at the mid days height the
pearcing beams of every bright eyes sight, more welcome to us, than day to the
weary watch, or the repose of a quiet Inn to a tired trauailer, gracest our
pains with thy presence. More worth is his work that rifles in the rich
bowels of the gold grown earth, than he that drudges in the bottom of a
dunghill ditch, and yet the last labor is more than the first: but that the
subject exceeding in worth, excels the reward of his work more than the
travail graces the thing: but the worth of the subject dignifies the desert of
the deed, whereby our credit by thee is maintained, and not thy matchles self
by our might magnified.

Look on him that for thy love adventured his life, and the reward of my
pains is this, that they redound to thy pleasure, and for thee Triamore, fish
^ew again thou have thy hearts content, remember the estate of thy old father
as thou toldest me, is compassed within the circle of yonder beseedged walls,
still expecting the speedy help of his forward friends: but yet has this
nights work so weakened hysfues, as that there is no doubt of further danger.

By this with such like that had they chased away the sable show of this
silent night, and next the sun gins with cheerful countenance to look upon
the honorable acts of their thrice praise worthy exployts, when by this time
they were wandered far from the place where they first gave the onset to
atchiue this honor: where Chinon calling to him his two countrymen, gives this
careful charge,

You two quoth he whose honors accents is every where blayed for your valors,
shall henceforth leave these wandering ways, and return with me into our
Country: where I will present to my longing Father this Pagan Prince, the
first frints of my Maiden manhood, doing all my humble duty to his Honorable
age: but first in safety let us conueye these Fair friends to their fathers
Court, and set them there safe from further sorrow at home, that have sustained
the hard brunt of fell misfortune abroad, where may as many pleasures attend
them there in peace, as honorable accidents happen to me in wars.

CHAP. VI.
Of Chinons return into England, accompanied with Sir Lancelot and Sir
Tristram, with their most honorable entertainment there.

AFter that he had thus adventured for the recovery of beauteous Celestina
from the hands of the Sultan, that had traitorously taken her away from Sir
Triamore, and sent them home to her fathers Court to solemnize their marriage.
Lancelot, Tristram, and himself, took the direct way that led then home into
their own country, that there they might in quiet tell those things with
pleasure amongst their friends, which they had in trouble performed with
l^bour amongst their foes: In which i^u^nie no occasion of further let
encountered them any more, but as fares with ordinary trauailers, they
peaceably pass over their journey, till they came home into Corn wall to
Earl Cadors Court, that was not a little glad to see the return of his son,
with good hap to answer the long expectation of his fair hope, he entertaines
them with such courtesy, as commonly pass betwixt lost friends, at their
unacquainted meetings.

Chinon discoursing to his old father the story of their travails whose very
words breeds new life in the dried sinnowes of his old limbs: as deeth the
approaching sun cherrish the decayed winter worn strength of the earths
increase. Lancelot he presents to his love the Trophies of his victory, with
many persuasions how for her love he had adventured his life in winning those
Princely Prizes, the chief whereof (whose worth exceeded all except herself)
he had bounteously bestowed upon sir Triamore, Tristram, he follows on his
friends with the praises of them both: first how by their means the Lady was
achieved: then how by Chino^s devise she was secondly attained, with all the
whole History of their former fortunes: where what joy was generally received,
as well of the King himself, and her, that whose life still lasts in the
everliving acts of succeeding ages, famoused as much for the renown of his
round table, as Alcides for his twelve labors, Jason for his journey to Caicos,
or the Greeks for their triumphs at Troy. He now in the winter of his waning
age, affecting to hear that now of others which before in his youth he had
effected the like himself, welcomes home all these weary wanderers, that had
been so long abroad, writing in the Registers of other realms the courage of
their own country: as also the poor inhabitants of this pappy Kingdom, that
ioyed to see their neighboring lands dispoyled of such rich rewards as was
brought home by their countrymen. Thus when every man had filled his ears with
t^^ report, A^thur willing also to further the courage of this young Caualeer,
summons a solemn meeting of all the Nobles and Peers of his country to his
Court: where when at the time appointed all were gathered together, the King at
a Royal banquet, gins to declare the cause of this their calling together, that
themselves should see how Princely he had, and would still pay the rewards of
such deserts, as by the adventures of their young countryman Chinon had been
prosperously performed, and then with Epethites accents of honor, telling the
victorious tale of his fight, as Aeneas the Tragic story of their fight he
concludes his speech with the performance of his promise, which was the solemn
orders he commonly used at the instalment of any of his Knights, and dubbing
him, therewithal appoints him his place at the Table: where a while he
remained, as well to comfort the decaying date of his Fathers years: whom
wrestling age had almost now laid along in his grave, and as Mariegold that
never spreads her flowers but against the sun: So he never opened his age
dimmed eyes to behold the cheerful countenance of any creature save his Son
Chinon, and like the melancholy Turtle when her mate is from her sight: So
fares it with this aged Earl, that never sleeps but dreams of his Son,
never is well waking when he sees him not, and never contented with any sounds
if he hear him not: as also the entire affection of his King and Captain
Arthur of England, that inamored with his courtesy, was lost to leave his
company, he was forced a while to refrain his affections, whose body thought
it was walled in at home, yet was his mind wandering abroad: which the fates
foreseeing, (as do the careful Parents provide for their forward children)
seek means for their furtherance in that quallitie whereto they are most
inclined, loath that so many virtues should be cooped within the compass of a
(...) Island, and not spread their branches abroad to the wide world, carefully
contrived a means to conuaye him away.

CHAP. VII.
How Chinon was by the Fairies conuaied into Egypt.

THus he spending the pride of his days at home in daliance, letting rust
eat away his well tempered Armor, that wars before had scoured, lying one
day upon a pleasant ouerspread bank, under the covert of a nature framed
Canopie, bound together with the bows of sweet smelling roses: upon whose
pleasant spraies sat the several sorts of music making ^irdes, that with
their natural notes, calls on inchaunting sleep to possess the quiet organes
of his body with all pleasing rest, in the midst of a sweet slumber, suddenly
appears to the view of his drowsy thoughts, two airie bodies such creatures
as we call Fairies, whom some immagine to be those spirits that fell dawne
upon the earth, and since that time inhabit the several corners thereof;
sometimes deluding men's senses with the shows of that they are not: other,
sometimes showing themselves in the semblances they commonly accustom to put
on, dancing roundelayes over the plesaunt ^neades, searing the secret corners
of every shade: in which sort it should seem they found this Knight, to whom
they began show a rich embrodered armor, curiously carved and richly set with
all manner of precious stones, and a fair sword with all the formal furniture
thereunto belonging, fair passing that which before he had pulled out of the
Rock, and there withal ginnes feed his fancy, that they nourished his
imagination in the perfectest joy of all natural delight, with the show of a
fair Virgin, whose rare countenance promised more than her outward color of
attire, for that meake were her weeds, such as commonly we read of the Arcadian
Shepheardesses, whose perfectio^s have put to silence so many pens in laboring
to portrait their picture. But her self more than a mortal Maid, looked upon
with the impartial censure of a judging eye, might draw into an endless
Laborynth, the laboring thought^ of an i^^euoring wit, striving with it self
to picture forth her worth. Where a while we must leave him (...)-like spending
his time in this sweet speculation, and for a time talk of this rare fight
here showed him in his sleep.

This Lady, was daughter to an ancient Lord, named Bessarian chief Counselor
to ^gba^a^ then King of Egypt, and was th^re earnestly beloved of a noble Man
named ^^^osin who for that he saw by no way he could compass h^^ desire,
neither by amorous demeanor of himself, instance of his friends, nor earnest
soliciting deserts of his dumb intermissiue gifts could-preuaile to draw
toward him the duty of her love he determining by another drift either to win
her to himself, or to w^are her out of conceit with all other, ^^^re^ly (...)
^e with an old Witch, whose name was Eurropa, who hired by him, hammered about
to work some mean how she might change the settled affections of her maidenlyke
mind, somewhat to incline themselves to his intent: which when by no means she
could bring about, she straight works a way to remove her quite from all
company, to live on the unpeopled Plains among ^rute beasts, and to that end
aiming her actions, by means of an ayrie Spirit attendant upon her, suddenly
conveyed her from the Courtly presence far off to, an unfrequented Plain,
scit^^^te by the ^tiuer Nylus, where she percesuing her ^^l^e displaced, but
seeing no reason of her remove, straitwaies begins to consider with her self
what luckles occasion might thus cross her in her hopeful course, and when
after long search in the self known record of her inward conscience, she
could find no ready reason, how her offenses should any ways have procured
so great a punishment, as this unnatural divorce, not only from the comfort
of her kindred, but ^ll other ^^^nds, (...) with all humble duty always
honore^ her superi^is, and with careful turto^^ ^intr^a^e^ her in^^^w^^ being
ever held as the my^rrc^^ of good demeanor. (...) thus findi^g her self as
cle^^e from those veng^^unc^ meriting ^^nes that ^^^wes do^^^^ the heavy wr^^h
of all-iudging Gods so sharply with such severe plagues to punish the o^^^^ces
of men, shedding many showers of a^ber ware^s, whose power were able to have
drawn pity from the steely hearts of h^ll-holden fu^ries, ^^ts her down by
the side of that silver stream, that with his seven heads, still sends fre^^
supply to the all eating sea, and tuning her voice to the bubling music of
his gliding course, and to the flocking sorts of sundry-fishes, that ^^ke the
dancing Dolphins at the sweet sound of Arions Harp gather themselves together.

She singes this Dittie.

Ye free borne people from the inthralling b^nds,
That we poor souls perforce are subject to:
You glide with pleasure ore these golden sands,
And feels no hope of weal, nor hap of woe.
Time, fortune, foes, nor any other power,
Changes, casts down, or turns your sweet to sower:
But we whom nature wrought unto the best,
Triumphant time still tosses up and down:
And they whom former fortune whilome blessed,
Cruel misfortune with a sudden frown:
Casts from a throane where sur'st we seem to dwell,
To worser woes than death, despair, or hell.
Thus while^^ with this song ^^ee sought to please her sorrow suddenly this
wicked woman, by whose means she was brought thither,) carried through the
empty (...) in ^^erie flaming (...), such as was that secret searching Medea,
(...) the sable shadow of the ^^ilent night, ouerr^^^ so many toys of hills to
^^^ade those herbs, that in the age worns limbs of a bloodles man, calls
back fresh spring to keep again his residence in that body: (...) presenting
her self unto her in the accustomed shape at other times she usually showed
her self: begins at her first entrance to disclose unto her the manner of
translation from her father and friends unto these peopleles plains,
confessing her self both to be Author and actor of this devilish devise:
where quoth she for the coy countenances that so often thou haste repayed to the
pity moving perswations of him, that for thy love well nie (...), wears out
in woe, the daye^ and watches with tirrible torments the night, that in every
sentence he speaks, so often cites thee by thy proper name, and himself with
bare conceit that he has, thee whom by consent he rightly should have had,
pines away poor soul in the physic fits of a passionate lover. In whose
revenge quoth she I have here seated thee by thy self, far from the resort of
men, where desolation shall here teach thee to tell thy self that thou art now
worse than wild beast^, that before esteemest of thy self better than fair
framed men: where quoth she, till thou can call back thy proud presuming
thought, to pity his case that for t^ee spends his life in such care, here
shall thou have thy abode, and be as far from any con! ^^^ation of others, as
then art from comforting of him, and so suddenly leaving her again to her
self ^he departed.

At which abrupt Oration, the maid seemed at the first dismayed: yet at length
com^ortes somewhat ma^e her conceit, in that she knew the means of her
re^^^^^, and ^^at last after she had long remained (...) in that people
wanting world, to eschew the ec^^^^^ (...), and the effect of idleness, she be
took (...) care^^ll keeping of some ^^imple natured ^^^^pe, whereof that place
was stored, o^ whose wool ^^e now ^^gi^^ to spinne her ^^^e some homely atire,
that was wont to be robed in ^he richest array that nature and Art could
a^^ord, and in the mean time, the weary works preventing all occasions of
further misfortune, that might else in the continuance of time have crossed
their intent; work or mea^e^ to disert and it her woeful Father: who now
destitute of all his children, his daughter the hope of comfort to his
diclining age, and having three g^^ly sons, whom nature had every way
furnished with gifts ^itting their degrees, whose names ^ere Michander,
Terpander, and Theonas: all those had he employed in the quest of their
sister, when as his foes taking the advantage of their time, Perosus that was
also a Coun^^ller, gins secretly to inform the King of certain treasons
pretended to his life and land, by Bessarian father to this new shepherdess,
of whom before we told you: to the end that having vnf^^^ished him of the
Kings favor, himself might the eas^ier effect what occasion soever should be
offered, and the poor father left destitute of all means to ^^^thr^ his
sons affairs: which the king at the first was ^o^th to believe, both for
that he had had so long trial of the faithful service old Bessarian had
always performed, as also that he supposed that such subtlety could not
harbor in a silver colored hear: for that quoth he Serpents always lurk in
young green tufftes, and not in winter wythered grass, ^age abolishes
deceits, as it abandons daine delights, and as the body waxes weak, by so
much more does the mind wax strong, as being now freed from all the intisin
^^^^eni^ns in (...) age, whereunto the vain pleasures of this wick^^^ world
did still intise him to in h^s y^^ (...) the other ready so reply with fre^^^
(...) ^^^^ment, shows straight to the King the intermissi^^^ letters that so
long had passed to and fro, betwixt Bessarian and many of his Maiestie^
enemies, for the effecting of their treasons, to which he had so cunningly
counterfetted the oldmans hand, as if himself had substantially set it down,
and the better to prove every several circumstance of this his surmised tale,
he presently produces two or three perjured companions, who for that purpose
he had subborned: whose substantial tale took such effect, and so far
incensed the King, that in all haste sending for the old guiltless soul who
was so far from pretending this ill, that notwithstanding all the cross
occasions that so vnluckely had happened unto him, he spends all his time
intending still naught but his Sovereigns good: where when he came, the King
breaking forth into impatience, begins with traitorous names to vpbraid him,
who God knows was so far from inuenting it, that he studied nothing more
than the preventing it: and then vntipping unto him the forged treason, showing
him the counterfeit letters signed by his own hand, the several circumstances
proved by such sufficient witnesses, as there pretended themselves to be,
impatient of excuse, and therefore utterly denying to hear his further
answer, still v^g^d by the envious invented persuasions of his subtle enemy,
gins thus to be wray his hatred.

Experience quoth he has taught us, and the daily proof of still present time
offers occasions to our ^^es of new examples, how in brute beasts the
countina^ce of long time groundee perfect love, as the silly deg^e that brought
up at his Masters trencher, in his ^inde remembers his courtesy, and whiles
nature lends him liberty of life, indeu^rs himself still in all duty to
requite i^, and shall th^n man their reasonable ruler, be worse than these
^eason^^s things, by him so ruled herbs, trees, and other vegitable creatures
increasing from the earth, to them that with care manure their roots, and pru^e
their branches render fruit for a reward, the beasts they in their sundry
kinds requites their owners cost: as one with his skin, another with his
flee^^; one with his ^uffe, and another with his horn; one with his labor,
and another with his lou^; and shall not then he whom God has made as Master
of all these creatures exceed them in his reasonable reign, that subject
themselves reasonles to be ruled. Since first I came to sway the heavy Scepter
of this great Kingdom, and took into my hands the tuition of so many people
as inhabit these spacious plains of wide west ^gipt, have nourished thee even
in my bosom; nearest have I kept thee to my self, because I would draw thy
affection from all other, and haste thou now with ^^opes ungrateful snake,
stinged him in the breast, that so carefully sought to preserve thee in his
bosom.

Can it be that under the reverend show of such honorable age, should rest the
undeserved thoughts of vnreuerent revenging rage. Is there found foul dross
in fair gold, bad shows on good substances, and can there be such hatred in
sure hearts? I, I, I see the fairest s^omer shine has his sudden shower she
best blossom is often times s^^ne ^^bla^^ed and the truest frien^ proves often
the most treacherous foe: But as no man co^mends the sunnie morning, nor the
showrie night, the frustrate hope of his fruit, for the bad blasted bud: so
let every man especially condemn the souls secret friend, when her turns to
a sore serching ^^e: which simile I to thy self must now a^plie: that under
the fair show of friendship, have secretly gone about to ouerturne my estate,
and bring this welgouerned common weal to a ruinous decayed wrack, which
fault is so apparent, both by thine own hand sufficiently set forth, as also
confirmed by the Testament of others: as that my patience, scarce ^^^t^^ning it
self within the bounds of evil behauior, cannot abide to hear any excuse,
and therefore will I against thee pronounce this heavy doom for thy ill
deserving deeds, the punishment of death were a pleasure to thee, so that so I
should ease thee of a great deal of sorrow, if thou should still continue
in thy best state thou were likely to sustain, and therefore from henceforth
like a cursed creature, shall thou wander in the world and eat the bitter
bread of banishment in a foreign soil, that whilome liuedst so sweetly in
thine own natural seat, and so for ever I banish thee from the compass of
this Kingdom, to bury thy silver hairs in sorrow, that had such hope to
harbor them in their grave with joy.

At which words the old man not able to speak for the abundance of fears
that stopped up the way of his words, was forced to leave him without further
reply and hopeles of any help, patiently to depart. By this time had the
King (more to punish his supposed amiss,) seized upon all his goods, to the end
he might leave him no succor to save himself abroad: which when he saw,
sorrowfully sighing to himself, desperately departes away without any further
following the King, for the repeal of this his punishment, and straight way
betakes himself to his travail: which when Perosus perceived how they now had
brought every thing even to the bent of their own bow, gins glory to
themselves in their likely prosperity, purchased by the hard hap of an others
adversity: but on a sudden Eu^ropa, the Witch by whose counsel all this
treachery was contrived, looking further into the matter what was likely to
follow: by these means perceived in the speculatiue glass, how that the
rig^tful revenging gods had by many means determined her release: (...) first
by Chinon, whom for that purpose they had brought out of England: then by her
brethren, who had undertaken to search all the world for their sister and
lastly by her father, whose giltles banishment could not long be concealed, and
the^ being called home to his former place, would seek such means for her
recovery, as their power could hardly prevent, and therefore to escape these
ensuing illes he thus determined to deal. The maid who though she was from
thence far remote, and in a place whether lay no ordenarie passage: yet
foreseeing how at length that all would hit upon that way incloses by her
wicked works this fair Damsel within the ruin of an old Rock hard by the
river side, upon whose banks before she made her abode: where accompanied
with shadows of natural creatures, having fair womanly faces like her self,
that seemed to outward sense of the far beholders, to make her merry with
melodious music, but to her self she found it far contrary, proouing
nothing else but a harsh discord of misliking sounds: which outward semblance
was for this purpose by them provided, that it might somewhat satisfy any idle
beholder, to see that her prison was rather a pleasure, than any such pain as
should move the minds of men to venture any thing for her release: where
poor soul she now coopt up in a Cage that before took her pleasure upon
these spacious plains, like to the beguiled bird that unawares falling into the
Fowlers gin, is now raged up in a little compass, that whilome was went to
play upon the broad branches of every springing Plant.

CHAP. VIII.
How Bessarian her father was by the Witch turned into the likeness of a Bear,
and how he met with his sons in that shape.

THVS having determined of her, they straight ways begin to strive with
themselves how they might devise some drift to remove the fear that they had
of her Fathers rising again to his former state, which by the means of
Eutropa the Witch they thus contrived.

She calling to counsel her attendant spirits: by whose means she brought
to pass all this matter, gins give them severally in charge to use their Arts
in plaging of this poor man, which they should so surely effect, as no hope
should be left of any more comfort to ^ome unto him: where beating together
their hell bred brains, they thus concluded with themselves, that they would
change him from the shape of a man, into the big body of an ugly Bear, and so
let him die a beast that was borne a man, and further yet, to aggreuate his
woes, which might notwithstanding this envy have an end, they intended in his
disguise to hasten on his death, leas^ by some crossing occasions, as
oftentimes are usually seen unexpectedly fall out for the release of Magic
bands, which they thus determined when they had wrought their wills in his
transformation, about his neck they hang a scroule, wherein were written two
verses which were these.

He whose good hap shall kill this bear,
That man shall have his hearts desire.
Thinking by this means the better to draw on every man's might, to the
effecting of their former plotted purpose, for that all men by a natural
instinct ar greedy to get any hope of pursuing their purposes, though often
times they do it with the danger of their lives; where the oldman turned after
this manner, wanders through the woods, clogged with the burden of self
feeling sorrow, and in despair of relief, settles himself to that thraldom
without hope of release. Many were the miseries in this shape he susstained,
as the many hungry days that in spite of himself he was forced to spend, for
that his stomach was not used to feed upon such filthy carrion, as those
beasts accustomably devour, the raw restless nights without covert he must
now continue, the want of his friends, and fear of his foes, with a countlesse
company of more griefs than the capacity of man can conceive was contained in
him, being then as a beast, saving that still he retained the use of his
reasonable soul, which they by no means could make to miscarie. In the mean
time the Witch now in the midst of her business, seeing in her speculatiue
Glass (wherein sho usually saw what accident soever was likely to happen) the
approach of her Brethren, who (by tracing up and down in the World) were some
of them come near (at unawares) to the place where she was; poasted her self
with all speed, the better to prosper her purpose, and with violence inforces a
spirit (one of her own Attendants) to use the organes of her body, to an end
which her self had devised: that was, to send sundry ways her Brethren, who
were like severally to come thither where now their Sister did soiourne.

And by that time this Hag had brought this purpose to pass, Michander her
eldest Er^ther (that now almost wearied with walking up and down among the
high desolate Hills) has framed his journey toward that River, the which with
his swelling waters moystens once every year those pleasant Egyptian Plains,
to refresh his tired limbs in the cool streams of that pleasant Current,
bathing his sweet body in those refreshing Springs; suddenly in the midst of a
cloven Rock he espies sitting a company of fair Creatures, whereof one
(exceeding all like the Huntresse amidst the naked troops of her attendant
Nimphs) he quickly startes up and hies to the place where he supposed they
should be: to which as he came nearer, he might perceive the middle most
Lady that so far exceeded the rest, to be Cassiopem his Sister, for whom he
had made such search; when in an ecstasy of joy, standing still as not able at
the first to utter the sudden mirth of his mind, the envious Stone closes his
sides and shuts them al from his sight. At which sudden accident, his senses as
far cast down as before they mounted themselves with the hope of recovering
his Sister, gins with himself devise what this matter might mean, till from
the Rock he heard one pitifully call him by his own name; which at length he
perceived to be the voice of his Sister whom before he had seen: and answering
again to her sudden call, ginnes demand by what means he might come unto
her. To whom straight she answers, that there was no passage to that p^ace:
for that by the wicked work of an envious Inchantresse, she was there so surely
enclosed, as neither force of man, edge of weapon, violence of fire, nor any
other earthly means whatsoever the World could afford was able to avail,
except himself would adventure one thing for her deliverance. And then she
coniures him by the duty he ought to his Father, the love to her his Sister,
and the care of preserving their Kindred, that he should undertake this
Adventure: which he with more earnest desire offers to do, than she could with
her former reasons persuade him too, desiring her to tell him his task, that
he might slip no time, but in all have hye him to the performance of this thing,
which was like so highly to pleasure th^^ both, her with comfort, and him with
content. To whom she thus begins to unfold her intent.

Under (quoth she) that toplesse Hill which we call by the name of Taurus, that
with his length gyrdells in the wide Continent of flowring Asia, under the
root of an everlasting Lilly, stands there a Vial full of Virgins tears,
that encou^tred with the like cross as I am now (poor Soul) in, and before
her release dyed there for sorrow: to whose eternal memory, against the
infectiue rage of this over ruling power, the Fates have there reserved that
powerful Potion, whose Virtue is to break the strongest inchaunte^ Bands; and
so She that by them was thus bound while she lived, have the Gods ordained as
an Instrument to unbind them now she is dead. But the still working wits of
these wicked wretches, hatching nothing but harm, intending nothing but what
is ill, and perfourming nothing but that which tends to our plague, have to
prevent that which is thus provided, strongly guarded the ground where this
Vyall stands, with the power of a sight killing Serpent, such as we call a
Cockatrice, against whom no power is able to prevail.

At which words Terpander breaking her from her further discourse, ginnes to
persuade his sister a little with patience, and ere long he doubted not by his
means to work her liberty. And thus like the greedy Greyhound that suddenly
sets out to follow the swift footed Hare, flies he to attain his purpose,
believing as his sorrowful Sister did, that there had been that virtue in the
water, but it was only the deceit of her deadly Enemy, that determined to
make away all her Brethren whose endeavors were else likely to work her
release: and therefore (as before we said enforced her tung to tattle that
which her mind did not mean, whereby she might be their deaths in seeking
to do her good.

Not long after Te^pander had thus b^taken himself to his journey, with hope
that her release from that place should repay the deserts of his pains,
comes to her the second brother, whose name was Micande^, and he as the first
joyful to see the end of his journey, which was the sight of his sister,
begins after the manner of new met friends to resalute her, and as he offered
to have kissed her hand for joy of his good hap suddenly the Rock shutting
her from him, deuorees a sunder both their desires to resalute whose proffered
kindness, she speaking from her prison, tells him with tea^es the manner of
her enclosure, entreating him by all the true love that nature works in the
minds of men, that he would undertake some means for her freedom; which he
readier to offer than she willing to inioyne, calls to his solemn vow all the
Gods of Heaven and Guiders of Earth, that were it a greater toil than to
number the sands of the Shore, the drops in the Sea, or the stars in the
Sky, more heavy than the burden of Atlas, more foylsome than the Labors of
Hercules, or more tedious than the Laborynth of Theseus, he would with ease
undergo it, with courage perform it, and with pleasure proceed in it: and
therefore hastened her forward (poor Soul) to pronounce his harm.

She gins tell him, that in the Deserts of Arabia rests Orions Harp, brought
thither by the means of an Inchauuntresse, to release from the thraldom of
such subjection as now I am in, a valorous Knight, whom another Magitian had
there imprisoned: and failing by some cross occassion to perform the purpose
whereunto it was brought, there still remains; but kept by a man-eating
Canniball, having neither the form of a man, nor the fashion of a beast, but
compound of them both. Him (quoth she) if thou can overcome, and bring back
that well tuned Instrument, at whose strokes the dancing Dolphin delighted,
bears on his back woeful Orion from the fury of the fierce swelling seas,
when by the Pirates he was cast among the waves. The sound whereof will be
sufficient to undo the doors of this devilish device: for which deed thou
shall be blessed, and I borrowed from this punishing prison. Which said, the
forward young Man, loath to loose time by standing on reply, gets speedily from
the place and hies him to his labor.

After whose departure, by chance (as did both the first) comes Theonas the
youngest and last of these brethren, who at a sudden seeing his Sister there
enclosed in the Rock, gins as did the other, to resalute her with such loving
looks as accustomable pass betwixt longing friends at their first meeting; where
after many words on both sides, Theonas wondering why she should sit so still
in her seat, and not offer the like courtesy he intended to her, gins to draw
nearer the place where she was, when on a sudden, the Rock (closing together)
denies his nearer approach: at which, she sorry within and he as sad without,
gins both of them dis^il as many amber tears from their christalcies, as
might have dissolved again the craggie cliffes of those ^ittiles Rocks. At
length she (as before to the other two) gins tell him the manner of her life,
and intreates his aid for her release, telling him of a perilous Island that was
somteime kept by a skillful woman named the wise Erganea, where on an Altar in
a Temple (there built unto her name) lies a golden Book, in which (quoth she)
is contained all the Enchauntments that Art can afford, and their several
releases again, kept by two Harpies (such were those monstrous birds with whom
Alcides fought, and for his conflict with them was so great, it was accounted
as one of the xii. Labors he achieved): thence if thou can but fetch it
away, it will be the only mean to work my release, and end thy long desires
and tedious labor.

Where too the young man attentively harkening, as one that longed to eternise
his name to succeeding posterities, for the perfourmance of some such famous
Work, makes small delay to prosecute this business, with comfortable promises
of fairer days, cheering and comforting her mind, leaves her to the mercy of
her Foe, till his happy return make her more fortunate.

These several Adventures by her imposed on her Brethren, had this Witch
before provided, only for a mean to destroy all them that should in this
labor endeavor themselves, and perforce made her tongue the unwilling
Instrument to incite them to this ill: who otherwise intended their endeavors
only for her good.

CHAP. IX.
How Chinon came to the Rock where the Lady was inchaunted, and what happened
thereof.

IN this time the Fayries (by whose means Chinon was couueighed out of
England) had brought him to the place, where in the Vision whilst he lay
asleep under the Arbor in England, they showed him the fair Shepherdess,
and had taken their leave, telling him, how (by his means) that Lady (now in
Captivity) was to be released: but how many dangers he must first pass
through, left him there to follow his farther fortune, with great promises that
after labor he should find rest, after storms calmes, and after frowning
adversity smyling prosperity: and so on a sudden vanished away. When he
(seeking up and down for her, whom by no means he could find) wondering how
so rare beutie could be bred in such a homely soil, whereas the Earth was
unfruitful for want of tillage, the Trees unorderly bearing fruit for lack of
pruning, and the several Beasts disagreeing in their own kinds for want of
ordering: plainly the true definition of solitary desolation, that often
abounding in all things, is cause of decay to every thing. At last as he
wandered along the River, he heard excellent music, and a more excellent
voice tune forth this Ditie.

How sweet a thing is this Content
To which poor country Swains are born?
These falls of Fortune they prevent,
And other hard mishaps do scorn.
Oh how thrice blessed had I been,
If (but obscurde in country weeds)
Those mighty men I nere had seen,
Whose loathed love my sorrow breeds?
But such is the unconstant state
Of this still-changing Worlds delight,
Making the mean a Princes mate,
Crossing high hopes with low despite.
Which makes my Soul (in sad despair)
Die here ten thousand times a day,
Woond up within a world of care,
Whence naught can it release away.
When he following the sound of the voice, at length found her where she was
sitting in the hollow side of a Rock, hemmed round about with a show of such
creatures as her self, to whom Chinon ginnes thus to bewray himself.

Ah thou more than thy self, in that thou retainest too heavenly a form for
any earthly frame. How impartial are the Fates that turns the never standing
Wheel of Fortune, to grace with so continual a Sun this Soil, and lowre
with obscure showers on other places. Goddess of these Plains that give
more grace to these fields, than did the Goddesses to the place where they
pleaded for the golden Prize. Had thou lived in those days when young Apollo
loved, then had thou been the Paramour of Learnings Prince, and guided his
will that now gouernes the World. For thy sake am I transported from the
furthest place of the wide western World, into these cynged Plains of ever
over dried Egypt. For thee will I follow the adventures of Arms, so that when
for thy sake I have sought the World, and with my sword engraued (in never
changing characters) thy God like name in the farthest corners of all-breeding
Earth, where no consuming fire, cutting sword, nor eating eternity shall ever
wear away thy memory: so that for my labor thou will reward me with thy
love.

When with exceeding passion he had delivered these speeches, with more than
common admiration he paused, like one that were suddenly amazed with the show
of some unacquainted sight, stood a long while as in a trance: when as the
wily Witch perceiving this new come Companion likely to mar what she and
false Perosus (by their practices) had been so long a making, begins to take
once more the charge of her tongue, and thus boldly begins to tie him to his
task.

Fair Knight quoth she, whose willing mind to do me service, wins more
reward than I am able any wise to bestow: If I were what now I am not, then
would I do what now I do not, with favor requite thy forward fortunes: but
thus it is, and then she begins in a long History to relate her frowning
fortunes. First drawn from the Court, then perforces long time by her self to
dwell solitarily upon that unpeopled soil, and lastly when she began to
comfort her self with that country content: then solitarily to shut her up in
that place, where was no passage for any people to come to her, and she
deprived of all power to come out to them, and then telling how there rested no
hope of redress, if that for her sake some mighty man would not undertake a
trebble task, worse than tormented Sisiphus his toil.

Which words wrought such a desire in the mind of this forward Knight, as
vowing to perform more mighty deeds than those deeds of the old Giantes
that heaping hill upon hill assayd the height of heaven, he instantly begins to
entreat that in this her charge, she would admit of him as her Champion.

At which words the Hag that all this while had hid her substance in an
invisible shade, gins urge her to impose upon him all those plagues she had
appointed the other three, and when his perswasiue Oration was scarce done, his
eager mind that already was working for so fair a reward, like the towering
hawke, that swiftly takes the advantage of the fearful foul fares he, that
proud to himself so fair a Saint should so soon accept of his service, and
employ him in so serious a piece of service as was the remedy of her release,
flies with at speed to effect his purpose, and she poor soul hoping well
that one of her workmen would at last return again with the reward of their
work, with comfort contents her self to abide the end: where we must a while
leave her very melancholily meditating with her self, how she might best
spend her time in that wicked Prison, thinking every hour to be a whole
year, and every year a thousand, till she had heard again some news of her
searching servants, that had spread them selves all abroad in the wide world to
seek her some means for to mittigate her misery, and restore her to her
former freedom again, and now a while follow our several Adventurers for
her aid, that by this time had travailed far from the place where they first
took in hand this journey.

CHAP. X.
How these brethren came to the several places appointed by the sister, and of
their adventure there.

TErpander the eldest brother, who first undertook this charge, iournying
through the spacious plains of Asia, hopeless to find: for that being long
since, he came to the side of the mountain, where he was promised to find
this vial of tears, and had almost sought every several corner of the same,
and yet could find no likelihood of any such matter: Notwithstanding loath to
leave unsought any place, where showed any appearance of such a matter. At last
he saw a far off the rising as it were of an Alablaster Rock that half
ouershadowed a hole, artificially cut into the side of the hill: whether hying
him apace to see what there by might be meant, came at last to the place, and
there at the first seacute;eing nothing that might any ways avail him, was
about to depart again, till hearing somewhat hasting it self forth of the
hole, he stood still to see what it might be, at last appears unto him the
forepart as it were of an ouergrowne Cock, but far greater than any of that
kind, that with his fiery eyes poisons every object he sees, against whose
force Terpander had prouidently provided a bright Armor of steel, which
covered every several part of him, on whom when he looked, the reflexe of his
sight, sending back again the dart of poison to himself, that he threw out
at another, powerfully poisoned himself, the hinder part of this beast was
framed after the manner of a Cocodriles tail, such as are commonly resident
about the banks of Nilus in Egypt, that with the force thereof had been able
to have bruised the best proved Armor: with which when by the retorquation of
his over sight, he had lost the use of his eyes he lustily laid about, till
such time as the upper part of his body forceably swelling with the inward
working poison, made him so unwieldy that now unable to weald his body any
more, was forced to fall down, and with the power of the poison shortly after
died: which when Terpander perceived that his we was so soon foiled, taking it
to be the place of which his sister had foretold, by reason that in her
disccurse, she discribed unto him such a like keeper of that precious water, as
was this same, that there killed with his own weapon, lay dead before him, gins
diligently to search up and down for the thing it self, which at last on the
other side of the rock he perceived: where under a fair Lillies root stood
the treasure for which he had spent so much pains: which when he said, heartily
thanking those helping heavens, that had so mightily, not only preserved him
from the force of his foe, but also helped him to the inheritance of that he
so much desired, goes boldly forward to the place, where he saw this Lilly
spring, and taking away the vial which he poor soul took to be no other
than the tears of a virgin, that by such kind of means as his sister had
discribed unto him was placed there, and about to return with joyful news of
his sisters deliverance, he had not gone far from the place where first he
found it, ere the Vial beginning to warm with the heat of his hand, suddenly
by virtue of the venomous water therein enclosed, infused such a contagious
heat into every several vain and sinnow of his body, as that wherewith the
poisoned shirt was that enraged madding Hercules: So this poor man, that for
his good meaning, was thus recompensed with ill measure enraged with the
extreme pain of his inuenomed limbs, gins fall into a frantike humor,
leaving the way should lead him back again to his Sister, and furiously
without regard of himself, gins revenge his injury upon sensles and brutish
beasts, that had now lost all the power of a man.

This was the end the sorceres had intended should beside to him, that in hope
to fetch his sisters blis should there find his own bane, and by some means
or other kill himself, or else unable so with reason to rule himself, should
fall into the danger of some wild beast, who without pitying his case, might
cast him away* where we must leave him in his lunacie, and come to the second
brother, who by this time was attained to the appointed place, situate in the
bosom of the Arabian deserts: where upon a Cypress branch he might a far off
discern the golden instrument, on whose trembling stringes the beauteous
beams of the sun delights to dally: There underneath this dismal shade, for
that now the sun at the Zenith of this Sphere, darts down his perpendicular
beams with such force upon the face of the earth, as makes every creature
seek to shelter himself in the cool shades: for which cause this monster was
then crept under the Cipresse shadows, and ouercommed with the heat of the
air war then fallen a sleep: to whom when Micander came near, diligently
vewing each several part of his deformed body, for that the Instrument hung
high upon the tree, and without styrring this stubborn beast could no ways be
come by prepares himself after the best manner he could to Combat with this
Curre, and when he had buckled on his Armor, made ready his weapon and was
now encouraged to encounter with his enemy, gins with some such noise as then
he made to rouse him from his rest.

When as the Canniball like the throted Dog whom Theseus awaked in the Gates
of hell, sends out such a hideous cry, as affrighted the neighboring Birds
and Beasts that inhabit that part of the world with his terrible sound, and
shaking of himself, gins show in his upper parts the perfect form of a Dog
with long ears, which long dangling ears that exceeded the substance of the
greatest spanniels, hung well nie down to his middle. From the middle
downward he had the shape of a man, big boned as are these wild people that
living lawless in such unruled places, seeding themselves after their fashion
upon the fat of the earth, cut grows the common sort of well guided people,
and taking up from the earth a great Iron club, such as was in his judgment
too big to be swayed by a man, without any warning gins fall to his weapon:
where betwixt them two was begun a dangerous fight, and long time continued
with uncertain hope of succes, till M^cander nimbly eschueing the weight of
his weapons fall, gins get within his reach, and so carues his skin and bones
with his well tempered sword: which for that purpose he had only provided, that
in short time he made him with the great issue of blood that ^^ll from his
wounds so weak, as he was not able any more to bear the weight of his blows,
but was forced to fall under his foe: which when Micander perceived, he
straight ways dismembers him of all his limbs and leaves nothing behind for
his help, but the naked bulk of his body, and then reaching down from the
tree that fatal instrument, (which the Witch to another end than he aimed at
had prepared,) gins turn back his course, and with that Consort, hie him home
to comfort his sister.

As thus he was travailing to his long wished for place of ariuall suddenly
he determined with him self to try what was the harmony of that famous
instrument, that with his sound could call the censelesse trees from their
roots, remove the craggie Rocks from their Cliffes, mittigate the revenging
wrath of brutish devouring beasts, compose concord betwixt the Lamb and the
Lion, the Hound and the Hare, the Fawcon and the silly foul: whose strings he
had no sooner touched, but determining with himself to sing some delightsome
Ditty to the sweet tenth of these silver sounding stringes, for joy he had
compassed his desire. The powers of his tongue denying any more to execute
their office, he was suddenly stricken dumb, which was the plague this witch
had pretended should light on him, by the Magic made sound of this
Instrument, which was nothing else but an illusion as were all the rest, to draw
these brethren into danger, where we will leave him making what shift his dumb
demeanes affordes him to travel homeward, and come now at last ^o the third
brother. Theonas that by the favorable hope of wind and weather was now
arrived upon the perilous Island: where coming into the Temple of Erga^^a the
wise Inchauntresse, that was richly adorned with all peculiar things thereunto
belonging. At the upper end thereof upon an Altar of clear Crystal that was
covered with a curious cloth of gold, over whom was hung the perfect picture
of an ancient woman, which woman was the fore named Erganea, there twixt two
golden Candlestickes that were filled with two continual burning Tayers
censing the Temple with sweet savors, lies a golden book which was kept by two
harpies, monsterous birds, half Women, and half Serpents, that with their
wings so beats the young aduenturer, as he was scarce able to abide their
force.

But as he that looking still upon the goles is better encouraged to go
forward, he that sees the harbor, takes greater pains to get home, he that
is near an end of his labor, thinks all the pains but little he has to
spend: So fares it with Theonas, that looking upon the end whereto he had
endeavored himself, thinks the pains but a pleasure he endured, and in short
time so behaved himself, as that he had overthrown one of his enemies, and
then like the Heart, that by casting his horn, renues his strength, the Eagle
by loosing his bill strengthens his flight so he at the sight of her fall,
begins to fight a fresh, and in short time had the like succes of the one as
before he had found in the other: so that now there was no partition betwixt
him and his pray, but that he might take away the book, to w^^ch when he
came, opening it that he might be an eye witness what was there included, in
sreed of those powerful spells that there he should have read, from out the
closure thereof came such a dustie fogge, as filling his eyes with a black
mist like unto pitchie smoke he was suddenly stricken blind, and there left to
grope his way back, that came thither with the perfect use of his eyes. This
Book (as were both the rest) was nothing else but a deceit of the
Inchaunteresse, to draw thither one of these Brethren; where (in stead of
releeuing their Sister) they might inthrall themselves. Thus poor Theonas
(even in the prime of his Spring) having lost the use of this light, which is
the especial comfort of mas life) wanders up and down like old forsaken
Oedipus in his exilde life: where we must a while leave him in this pitteous
case with his Brethren.

CHAP. XI
How Chinon met with these Brethren severally one after another, and what
became thereof.

BY this time was Chinon come to the place where we first left Thers^nder mad
after he had taken up the Violl of Water: who seeing him fare so with
himself, rending up trees by the roots, tearing up mighty stones from their
places where they stood, and tumbling them down from the tops of high hills,
into the bottomes of deep vallyes; who (notwithstanding his misfortune) kept
still the Uia^l about him untouched: to whom Chinon came wondering to see what
man should walk that way, begins to question with him about the manner of his
coming thither? To whom the mad man far unlike himself, (for that before he
was courteous, but now contrary to his kind he had changed his countenance
to hair-braind cruelty and in stead of courteous behavior, answers him in
railing opprobrious terms, and at the length begins with force to assail him
as an enemy; which Chinon perceiving, closing with the mad man as he came to
encounter with him forcibly casts him down, and taking from him the Uiall of
water, which all this while he had kept closely in his hands, begins to
look what it should be the poor soul had in such request, when suddenly by
the like mischance that the other was changed, himself was with Lunacie
presently possessed: and raging like Ajax after his foil for Ulysses his
armor, or mighty Al^ides when on the Mountain Oeta he built the Altar
whereon himself was sacrificed, tearing his clothes from his back, the hayres
from his head, and launcing with deep wounds the limbs of his body; releases
Tirpander from the plague wherewith he was possessed, and brings it upon
himself. Which the other perceiving how he was delivered from that danger,
pitied the woeful estate of this worthy Man, but help him he could not, for
that such was his invincible strength, now by the force of his fury much more
augmented, which force neither man nor beast, stock nor stone, nor any other
creature whatsoever was able to stand in his hand* so that in short time, what
with his unorderly tracing through unfrequented passages to find fuel for his
fire, and his swift paces that still ouer-went the other weary weary man, who
had tired himself before in his fury, Chinon was quite gone out of his sight,
whom we must now leave after the recouerye of his wits, traveling home again
into his own Country, to seek out some other means for the release of his
Sister, and follow Chinon, who raging and rauing like an angry Lion at last
ouer-takes Micander, who (poor man as quiet for the sorrow he had lost the use
of his tongue, as the other unruly in his rage, seeing him a far off, staid
still to expect the event of his sudden epproach; when the mad man coming to
him gins with unseemly behauior to abuse the other poor distressed Soul, and
with force pulling from him the Instrument which he was loath to loose, though
by it he had incurred such a displesure: yet at last Chinon (far stronger
than the other perforce pulls it away, and assaying with his fingers to strike
the strings, was at the first sound thereof stricken dumb, whereof as soon as
Chinon was possessed, Micander was straight way released. Which infirmity
when Chinon perceived in himself, redoubling the rigor of his hands for the
use he had lost of his tongue, gins furiously to fall upon Michande^ and beat
him, for being the Author of his ill: which the other perceiving, far unable
to sustain the strength of his streake makes means to escape his hands, which
by his swift flight he soon attained. So in short time ridding of himself
enough from the fear of this foe, he for his own safety, takes home the
nearest way he could find into his own Country.

In the mean time Chynon wandering wyldly thus about the World all careless
where he went, because how soever he turned, every where lay his way, at
last comes down unto the Sea side, where by chance he finds a Boat ready
furnished with all provision necessary for the Sea; who (after the manner of
such mad men) leaping there intoo, (though ignorant what to do or careless
whither to go, more than to satisfy his mad humor) launched from shore, and
making shift to set up his sail, was quickly conveyed far from the sight of
any Land into the midst of the merciles seas, sailing too and fro many days
not fearing to be drowned, because he perceived nothing: nor expecting any
place whether to go, for that he scarce knew, where he was either at sea or on
shore. But at the last (flying with his Bark before the Wind) he was suddenly
driven on shore upon an Island, where (leaping a land) he betook himself to
travail up into the country, to see what people it did afford: where he had
not long traveled, but a far off upon the side of a Hill he espied one sadly
sitting by himself, toward whom he made what have he possibly could.

This was the youngest Brother of those three, that before we told ye of was
stricken blind by looking into the enchanted Book; to whom when he came,
suddenly snatching the Book out his hand (after his fond furious fashion)
opens the claspes to see what was therein contained, when suddenly issued out
such another fogge, as that wherewith Theonas was stricken blind, and in like
manner bedazels his eyes: when presently Theonas was again restored unto his
sight, and wondering to see there so goodly a man possessed with so many
plagues at once, ginnes then with himself consider how it should come to
pass? who for that himself was unacquainted with what had happened to his
other Brethren, could guess at none but that which lately he was punished
wythall himself: one, for that the reasonlesse Man (for all these troubles
wherewith he was tormented) could not (by his means) be brought within the
compass of quiet behavior, thought it best to provide some means for his
own escape, and leave him there to the mercy of GOD, that would not be ruled
by the means of a man; so he betook himself to his Journey, where we must
also leave him (rid by this means of a mischief) retourning to seek his
Brethren, and take some other order for their enchanted Sister.

The Inchauntresse now (that all this while saw the issue of this matter)
greeuing that her cunning should be so crossed, and yet ioying that all these
punishments were light upon his head, whom she before feared more than all the
rest: set all her wits aworke, to devise a means how she might (now having
him at such a vantage) make him sure for ever escaping out of her hands again
foreseeing, that by his means all this scattered Kindred were likely to be
restored again to their former estate. And therefore (by her power) incloses
him within the clift of a Rock, against which she rouled up a mighty stone,
such as the force of many ordinary men was not able to remove: and so least
by any means he might be recovered out of this inchaunted Castle, she places
as Porter before the door thereof a mighty Giant, twice as great and grim as
the ordinary kind of such ouer-growen Creatures use to be. Where, when he
was enclosed (supposing him now safe enough from any resort that should bring
him relief) she was content all his plagues should cease, and he (the more to
aggreuate his grief) be restored again to his wits; which was effected as
speedily as determined.

No sooner was he closely shut up into that uncomfortable Cabin, but all his
Instruments (by whose means he came by those crosses) as his Water, his Harp,
and his Book vanished away, and he himself restored (as I before said) again
to the same estate of sense as he was before, his liberty only excepted:
where we must now awhile leave him in his melancholy Cell, and return again
into England. to see the sorrow of old Cador Duke of Cornwall, for the sudden
departure (without taking leave) of Chinon his Son.

CHAP. XII.
How Arthur of England sent three of his Knights to search for Chinon, and how
they found him.

CAdor Earl of Cornwall whilst that these things were thus by this devilish
Inchauntresse effecting, still spent his years in sorrow for the sudden loss
of his Son, and at last (wearied with too much grief) he intended to make
some friendly means to the King, for to have his royal favor and help for
his recovery. Therefore on this determining he repaired one day to the Court,
and there finding the King and all his Knights, as careful for his cross
misfortune as himself, gins in very humble manner (yet with honorable regard)
thus to entreat his Majesty.

Most royal Sovereign (for whom from my first able years may service has
been employed) vouchsafe me in my decayed years this Kingly comfort: Send
forth I beseech you) some of his worthy fellow Knights to seek Chinon my
Son; who albeit he has yet deserved little either of your Grace or of them,
yet his forward endeavor has always shown he would much more ere this have
merited, had not envious fortune crossed him in this sort.

To whom the King and all his Nobles present did most willingly condescend.
Then calling together all the Knightly company of his Round Table, declared to
them Duke Cadors request, and his own readiness to have it undertaken: who
all were not only to go in Quest of Chinon, but each man manifested his more
than common earnestnes, by taking offense if any one were named beside
himself. To end this controversy, the King thus provided, that every man
should draw his Lot, and on whom soever it fell, that Knight should forthwith
choose him two Fellows from the rest of the Company, and so they three should
take upon them this desired travail. The Lots accordingly were made, and
every one of the Knights drew, and the Lot fell upon Sir Calor, who was Son
unto Sir Lancelot du Lake and the beauteous Celestina Daughter to the King of
France, whose Parents Chinon before valiantly rescued, being betrayed and taken
in the hands of the treacherous Souldan.

But before their departure, it was thought convenient (for the better
furtherance of their Journey) to take some counsel of Merlin, who then lived
accounted as a Prophet in England, and by his skill I could tell of secret
things forepast, and hidden mysteries to come.

Merlin being sent for by the Kings commandment, came to the Court, and
shows them in a speculatiue Glass the manner of his departure out of England,
the many troubles he had endured in his Journey, and now at last opens at
large the whole manner of that great misery whereuntoo he is now brought by
the means of that subtle Inchauntresse: telling them further, that except
they made very exceeding great speed for to procure his release, he was
likely to dye there for want of relief, being there detained from all
necessaries fit to sustain a man; or at least having of those necessaries a
very short pittance allowed him.

Merlin hastening them forward on their journey, promised all the cunning he
could afford for their speedy conueyance, which he effectually performed, so
that in short time they were arrived in this perilous Island: where after long
search for the place wherein Merlin did promise they should find their friend,
at last they might epsy this monstrous man, iaylour to that unfortunate
Knight, stretching himself at the mouth of the Cave wherein in Chinon was
kept. To him they made all possible speed, and first of all Sir Calor
addressing himself to fight, gins before he offered violence with courteous
greetings to salute him gently, demanding what he was that lived so desolately
in that unfrequented Island? To whom the detested and currish Carle made this
unmannerly answer.

I am quoth he as thou see, one within whose claws thou and the rest of thy
saucy companions have compassed your selves: if therefore you will submit your
selves to my mercy, then will I thus dispose of you here within a hollow Cave
hewne out of this craggie Rock, wherein lies enclosed a knight such a one as
you are, who for the like offense that you now have offered, is condemned to
the eternal slavery of perpetual imprisonment, within shall you spend your
hateful lives, and when for hunger you are welnie starued, fall freshly then
to eat one another flesh, but if you stubbornely stand out against me, thus
will I dispoyle you in renting your cursed limbs piece meal a sunder, or else
fastening you several to the big bulks of some of these trees: where when the
imperial punishment of hastening hunger shall seize upon your selves, you shall
there be enforced to eat your own flesh that might here have fed upon
another, to whom Sir Calor thus answered.

Foul ugly fiend, we come not to kneel to thee, but to force thy subjection
to us and for the release of a Christian Knight they thou keep Captive
within thy power.

At which words the Giant seeing them address themselves to fight, presently
be stirs himself, and taking an Iron mace, (which to that end the Witch had
provided) lets drive at Sir Calor with all the might he could, from which he
nimbly leaping away eschued the force of the fall, when as the other Knights
coming in to rescue sir Calor, before the Giant could again get up his weapon
from the ground, they had so mangled his limbs, as he was now far unable to
fight, but falling prostrate down before them, humbly entreats for his life:
which they were willing to grant, as not seeking the loss of him, but the
life of their friend, to whom the Giant gins relate all the manner of the
imprisonment of Chinon, and at the last opens the door of the Cave, and calls
him out to his friends, who resaluting one another with such friendly greetings
as are usual at such aduenturos accidents, take their journey from thence up
into the Country, and for that the Giant had told^ them in his former discouse
of the manner of Chinons imprisonment, how that Perosus for whose love all this
had come about, had in Egypt taken Arms against the King, for that his treason
being discovered, he intended to recall old Bessarian from his banishment, and
that his power so daily increased, as that it was now far greater than the
Kings, they intended to shape their journey thetherwards and help the king in
his wars against this traitorous rebbell: where we must let them go forward
a while in their iourny, and return again to our three adventurers for their
sisters liberty.

CHAP. XIII.
How Bessarians sons met with their Father in the shape of a Bear.

AFter that these three young men were again restored to their former estate,
Terpander the first of them travailing homewards to seek again his sister,
meets by the way his transformed Father, who not a little glad to see his
son, though the other taking him for no less than he seemed, made some have
to fly from him, till looking back and perceauing the scroule about his neck
for the regaining of his hearts desire, strikes his poor father with such a
blow, as breaking his sword upon the scalpe of his head, he was forced to fly
for want of weapons, fearing least the Bear should have fallen freshly upon
him, being tired when as God knows the silly man astonished with the stroke,
was rather afraid of an unnatural deaths wound by his son, then willing to
prosecute any revenge for the same.

Not long after Terpander had thus hurt his Father, comes that way the second
brother, who in like case meeting with the Bear and hoping by his death to
obtain his desire, gins with a Borespeare he had in his hand eagerly to
assail him, in so much shall in short time he had grievously wounded him, but
the head of his weapon by chance breaking off, he was forced to fly as did
his brother: to be short the Witch that intended by the means of some of these
sons, to make away their father. After that the first two had failed, brought
thither the third, who eager to accomplish his desire, promised by the scroule
that hung about his fathers neck, begins a fresh fight, and so wounded his
silly sire, as that for want of blood which his weapon had lauishly lanched
out, he was forced to fall down, whom Theonas supposing to be dead, left
there to follow his desire.

In the mean time whilst these things were thus in doing had there been
sought a great battle in Egypt, betwixt Egbaton their King, and Perosus the
traitor, of whom before we told you: where by the means of the Englishmen
the King overcame, and Perosus was put to flight: who for his sauegard
forsaking his Country, betook himself to the Mountains: where after he had
long traueiled, he by chance met with Bessarian transformed, as before we have
t^^^ you, who having some what recovered himself after the wounds of his
sons, fearing least his foe should at his sight fiie a way, lays sudden
hold upon him.

At which Perosus being afraid seeing himself assailed, gins make all the
means he could for his escape: but the other loath to requite him evil for
his ill dealing, in steed of such rauinous behavior, as comnonly is found in
such like beasts, gently fawnes upon him, showing himself rather willing to
help him, than ready to hurt him.

When Perosus calling to mind his former offense in the bewitching of the old
man, and seeing by the writing about his neck, that this was he whom he
(...) so cruelly crossed, falls down before him, and with ^^^missiue tears
entreats his pardon: to whom the Bear though unable to speak, yet with dumb
demeans showing the effect of his mind, answers in dum tokens what he could
not tell in plausible words: to whom Perosus there promised, that would he but
follow him, he would forthwith conduct him to the place where his daughter
was imprisoned, and where he hoped also to meet with her, by whose means all
this was brought to pass.

In the mean time Chinon and his fellow knights following their foes from the
fight, by chance intercepted Eutropa the Witch as she was flying away, whom
presently they intending to kill, and she knowing very well their cruelty,
fell down before them, humbly asking pardon for her life, and in requital
thereof she would restore to liberty, her for whose sake Chinon had suffered
all this extremity, than which Chinon desiring nothing more graunts her
requests, whom she presently transportes to the place where Cassiopea lay
imprisoned: where when they came, they found her three brethren dilating unto
her their several ill luckes, whom as soon as they came, the Witch released
from the bondage of the Rock, and falling down on her knees asks hearty
pardon for her amiss, to whom the Lady glad of her release straight forgiues
that offense, and then Eutropa telling her the great perrill Chinon had
ouerpassed for her love: she with all courtesy falls down at his seeeke,
submitting her self for requital thereof to be disposed at his pleasure, whom
he taking up from the ground, offering himself likewise to her.

In the mean time whilst these folks were thus rejoicing, comes in Perosus
leading of the transformed old man, and humbly there asking pardon of them all
for his offense, telling them the manner^ he had found the old man, who was by
the meane^ the Witch presently restored to his former shape, and then returning
all back to the Court to certify the King of their several affairs.
Bessarian was then again restored to his dignity, and Perosus sauerely
punished for his offense, and Chinon and C^ss^p^^ by the consent of their
^cends, and mutual love of themselves, were matched together in marriage.

FINIS.
