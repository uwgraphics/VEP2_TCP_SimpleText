WHere, in all well-gouerned Kingdoms, Commonwealths, Cities, and Countries,
care has ever been duly had and taken, and commands strictly given in
public and in private, That Bread, Meats, and Drinks of all sorts, to be
sold, uttered, or put to sale, for the sustenance of mankind, should be
good, sweet, sound, and wholesome for man's body: And that just Assize, Weight,
and Measure, should be delivered to all persons, upon pains, penalties, and
punishments, to be inflicted upon the Offenders, according to the qualities
of their offenses.

Now therefore, the Right honorable Sir Thomas Middleton, Knight, Lord Mayor of
this the Kings Highness City of London, and his right Worshipful Brethren the
Aldermen of the same, considering the great Assembly of Lords Spiritual and
Temporal, and Commons at this time of the high Court of Parliament, and the
repair hither of so many others from many parts of this realm, who are to
have their provision for their diet in a great part from this City, and
purposing as much as in them shall lie, duly to provide that they be well
served of Victual, both in respect of the goodness of the same, and of just
assize, weight, and measure, do hereby straightly Charge and Command, That no
Baker, Wine-seller, Brewer, Butcher, Poulter, Fishmonger, Inholder, Cook,
Alehousekeeper, or any other Victualler, or other person or persons whatsoever,
do at any time hereafter, sell, utter, or put to sale, any Bread, Wine, Ale,
Beer, Flesh, Fish, or any other Victual whatsoever within the said City or
Liberties of the same, but such only as shall be good, sweet, sound, and
wholesome for man's body, upon pain of imprisonment, and such further
punnishment as the qualities of their several offenses shall deserve, which
shall with all severity be executed against them, and every of them.

And do further hereby straightly Charge and Command, That no Baker, or any
other person whatsoever, shall at any time hereafter, sell, utter, or put to
sale, any Bread usually called and sold for Wheaten bread, but that the penny
loaf contain the Assize of xi. Ounces Troy weight at the least, which is
th'assize now appointed for the same, and other loaves of that kind of Bread
after that Rate, Nor any bread usually called and sold for White bread, but
that the penny loaf contain th'Assize of seven ounces, and one quarter of an
ounce troy weight at the least, which is th'assiize now appointed for the same,
and other loaves of that kind of bread after that rate. And that no Inholder,
Cook, Tipler, Ale-house-keeper, or other person whatsoever, shall at any time
hereafter, sell, utter, or put to sale, any Beer or Ale otherwise then by
measures, sealed by the Officer thereunto duly appointed. And that none of
them sell any of the best sort of Ale or beer at any higher rate or price,
then a penie for a full Ale quart, nor any of the smaller sort of Ale or beer
at any higher rate or price, then a half penny for a full Ale quart.

And forasmuch as there has been very great spoil and waste of Wheat and
Barley, by reason of the great abuse in brewing strong and headie Beer and
Ale: and besides the abuse in drunkenness and drinking vnmeasurably, and in so
great excess, and in exceedingly wasting of Gods blessings, without care or
conscience, many poor families, men, weomen, and children, have been and
daily are utterly overthrown, and forced either to live by begging, or sterue
for want, by reason that the insatiable desire of many of the poorer sort of
householders, to those strong Drinks is such, and their custom in committing
that sin so grounded, as that al they can get by their labor, is hardly
sufficient to satisfy their own appetite therein, which they will (sometimes
beyond their ability) satisfy, though their Wines and Children want at home.

And where the utterance of those Drinks have been so great, as Inholders,
Cooks, and other Victuallers, have had in their sellers and other places of
Store, some one man a hundred, some two hundred, and some three hundred barrels
at one time, The said Lord Mayor and Aldermen therefore, do hereby straightly
Charge and Command, That no Inholder, Cook, Ale-house-keeper, or other
Victualler whatsoever, shall at any time after publication of this
Proclamation, receive any beer or Ale into his or her house, Seller, or other
place, until all the barrels of beer and Ale which he or she has, shall be
drawn out, spent, and reduced to the number of twenty: and that after that
time, he or she, shall not have, retain, or keep in his or her house, seller,
or other place, at any one time, above the number of twenty barrels: and that
neither they nor any of them, shall at any time afterward, receive, retain,
or keep any beer or Ale in any greater Vessels then barrels only.

And where within the said City and Liberties, many Freemen of the company of
Cooks, under pretense of selling beer and ale with their meats, by color of
their Charters and Ordinances, do keep common Alehouses, and sell Ale and
beer both within their houses, and deliver the same out also, without selling
any meat therewith, and are not thereunto licensed in due form of Law, The
said Lord Mayor and Aldermen, do hereby straightly Charge and Command, all
Freemen of the said Company of Cooks, That they do not at any time
hereafter, directly or indirectly, sell, utter, or put to sale, any beer or
Ale out of their houses, nor in their houses, otherwise then with their meat.

And where there have been, and daily are used great deceipts in sale of
horsemeat, as well Hay and Oats, as horse-breade within the said City and
Liberties thereof. For redress and reformation therein, the said Lord Mayor
and Aldermen, do hereby straightly Charge and Command, all Inholders,
keepers of Stables and Hoasteries, and all and every other person and persons
whatsoever, That neither they, nor any of them, do at any time after the
publication hereof, sell, utter, or put to sale, any Horse-bread, at any other
Rates and Prizes, then three Loaves Weighing one and twenty Ounces Troy weight
for a penme, nor any other then such as shall be well baked, and made of good
Beans, Branne, and woorking Meal well blended. Nor any Oats at any higher
Rate or price then four pence halfe-peny for a pecke: and after that Rate for
greater and lesser measures. Nor any Hay at any higher rate or price then a
bottell of Hay weighing two pounds and a half for a halfe-penie, and after
that Rate for greater and lesser quantity or weight. Nor shall not take any
more or greater price then six pence day and night for Horses, Mares, or
Geldings, set at Liuerie within this City, or the Liberties thereof, and so
after the same Rate.

And do also hereby Charge and Command, all Inholders, Ale-house-keepers,
and others, usually receiving lodgers, who shall receive any person or persons
to lodge in any of their houses, that they and every of them, do once every day
from time to time, deliver to the Alderman of the Ward, or his Deputy, or to
the Constable of the Precinct, where such Inholder, Ale-housekeeper, or other
person shall dwell, in writing, the Names, Surnames, and additions of dwelling
place and profession of such persons, as they or any of them, shall receive to
lodge, and likewise of the time of their departure, to the end, the said Lord
Mayor, and his brethren the Aldermen, may from time to time be truly informed
thereof, and persons dangerous to the King and State, may the more easily be
discovered.

And do hereby further Charge and command, That all Constables within the
said City and the Liberties thereof, hold their Watches from nine of the
Clock in the Evening, until five of the Clock in the Morning: and that they
suffer no person to pass thorough any of the Streets or lanes of this City,
betwixt the hours aforesaid, unless he or she can give good account of
lawful and honest occasion so to do. And such as cannot, they shall commit to
Prison, in one of the Compters of this City, or to some other prison (if need
require) and certifye the Lord Mayor, (or some other Justice of peace within
this City) thereof, the next morning. And that if the said Constables, or any
of them, upon any sudden occasion shall find cause, they shall make search in
any Inn, Victualling house, or other place, suspected to harbor lewd, loose,
idle, or suspected people: and if they shall find any such, they shall commit
them to prison, there to remain, and certify the said Lord Mayor, or some
other of the said Justices thereof, the next ^^rning, to the end, such order
may be taken for their punnishment, or delivery as shall be meet.

And, where the said Lord Mayor, with the advice of his said Brethren,
shortly after his entrance into the Office of Maioralty of the said City,
did for the Advancement of the honor of GOD, and for the Weal of the Kings
Majesty's Subjects, Inhabitants within the said City, and the Liberties of
the same, and of others repayring to the same from foreign parts, give
public notice and warning by Proclamation of his Lordshippes purpose, to
endeavor and speed the due execution of sundry Acts and Ordinances, and did
thereby also, give strait Charge and Command for due Observation thereof: as
also, touching Forestallers and Regrators, Ale-house-keepers, Victuallers, and
others. Now, forasmuch as there has not been that due regard had of the
observation of the said Ordinances and Statutes, concerning the offenses
aforesaid, nor of the said public warning, Charge and Command given as
aforesaid, which ought to have been, The said Lord Mayor and Aldermen, do
now therefore hereby, give special Charge and Commandment to all the Inquests
of Wardmote of this City, and the liberties thereof, and to all Constables,
Beadles, and other Officers, and to all Informers and other persons whatsoever,
to whom it shall, or may in any wise appertain, that they and every of them,
do make special, diligent, ^^^^irefull enquiries and presentiments of al such
Forestallers, Regrators, and others: as also of a^ and (...) the other offenses
wh^^h (...) been, or shall be committed against the true meaning of the said
Statutes, Acts, and Ordinances, or any of them, or against the true meaning of
any Charge or Command hereby given, to the end, the several Offenders may
be duly punished, and that the pains, penalties, and forfeytures may be
duly leauied: wherein such as shall be careful and painful to further and
speed due execution in this behalf, shall out of the penalties and
forfeytures, be (for their care and pains therein to be taken) sufficiently
recompensed and rewarded.
