An Epistle of saint Bernarde / called the golden epistle / which he sent to a
yo^g religyous man whom he much loved. And after the said epistle / follows
four revelations of Saint Birget.

The golden pystell.
An epistle of saint Bernard / which he sent to a young relygyous man whom
he much loved / that is called the golden Epistle.
THat the wilderness of thy religion may wax sweet and pleasant unto the /
and yt thou shalt not be found unkind in ye sight of him that was most
mekely crucified for the. I counsel ye that now thou have taken it upon the
thou cast it not lightly away / lest happily an other more acceptable to god
than thou / take it and occupye thy place / and that thou be cast out as a
stinking careyne. Consider therefore how much thou art bound to the very true
lamb / that is Christ / which was led to be offered in sacrifyce for the
upon the auter of the cross / and suffered many repreffes and most hard
scourgi^ges of them / of whom he had such compassyon that he wept tenderly
upon them. Therefore that thou may atteyne to like things / call unto thy
lord Jesu with devout prayer / beseching him that thou may as a true membre be
onyed through good virtuous works / to the very true heed / that is Christ.
But thou may not come to that point without his grace do help the^ / as well
before as after. For without grace al thy workyng shall be unprofitable and vayn
/ like as he watches in vayn that believes to keep a cite without our lord

Therefore if thou will find his grace and be truly solitary / two things be
necessary to the. The first is / that thou so withdraw thy self fro all
tra^sytory things / that y^ care no more for the^ than if there were none such
/ and that thou set thy self at so vile a price in thine own syzt / that thou
account thy self as naught / beleui^g al men to be better tha^ thou art / and
more to plese god. Also what soever thou here or se of religyous persons think
that they do it to a good intent though it seem not so / for man's suspytion
is often disceyued / and therefore judge ye nothing in certain / speak never any
thing that may sound to thin own preyse / but labor rather to keep thy virtue
secret than thy vices. In no wise speak no evil of no man how true and
manifest soever it be / and more gladly give hering wha^ a man is praised tha^
when he is dispraised Also when thou spekest ^et thy words be true / sobre /
apt / weighty / and of god. If a seculer man speak with the and ask of the
many questions / as soon as thou can break of the tale / and set the to those
things that be of god. what worldly thing of ever be happen to the or to any
other / how dete beloved soever he be unto the / care not for it / if it be
prosperous and lyking joy not in it / and if it be mistyking sorrow not for it
/ but think all as naught / and laud and praise almighty god. Seek
solytarines asmoche as thou can / so y^ thou may dilygently take heed of
thine own gostly health. Fly talking and vain iangelyng as much as thou may /
for it is more sure way to keep scyle^ce tha^ to speak. After complyn speak not
till mass be done on the day folowinge / but it be for a great cause. when thou
see any thing that dyspleseth the / consider wheder there be not like thing in
ye that displeseth other / and if there be cut it lightly away. And if thou se
or here any thing that pleseth the / consider wheder it be in the / and if it
be hold it warly / and if it be not take it to the / and so it shall be to the
as a glass to look upon. Grudge at nothing toward no man / but when thou
belenest it may profy^te his soul health / how grievous so ever it be to the /
never afterme nor deny any thing hedily / but let thy denyenges and affirminges
be always te^pred with discretion Absteyn thy self always fro al mocki^ges and
fro al dissolute laughi^ges / In all thy saye^ges behave ye so that thou have a
certaynte of al thy deeds and words that they be true / and those that be
doutful / let the^ go as things that be cuyll. The second y^ is necessary to
the is / that y^ shalt so fully offer thy self to god / that thou shall say
nothing nor do nothing / but that thou beleuest verily will please him / and
take heed of thy service with great deuotyon / so yt / that thou say with thy
mouth be also in thy heart. Have these three things always in thy mind / what
y^ have ben / what thou art and what thou shalt be. what thou have ben /
stinking corruption. what thou art / a vessel full of donge. what thou shall be
/ meat for worms. Also think on the pains of them that be in hell / and that
they shall never be ended. And y^ for a little delectatio^ in this world they
suffer tho pains. And like wise think on the glory of the kingdom of heaven
the which shall never have end / and that lightly and in short time it may be
won. And than remember how great sorrow and wailyng shall be to the^ that have
lost so great a glory for so little a thing Also when thou have any thing that
displeseth the or greueth the / think that if you shall come to hell thou shall
have always that dysplesur and al other also that y^ most dredest / when any
pri^cipall feast comes / think on that saint that than is worshypped in the
church of god / what things he suffered for Christ for they were but short /
and what he wanne thereby for they be everlasting. Think also that as well the
turmentes of good men as the ioies of evil men in this world be past and gone
/ and that nevertheless good men by their turme^tes have received eternal glory
/ and evil men by their short worldly joy eternal pain / and though thou
be never so slothful / yet take this little writing and remember and imagen
all these things dilygently that I have said / and at the lest bethi^ke ye on
the time that thou thus lesest / and that they that be in hell would give all ye
world for it. when thou have any trybulacyons / think that they that be in
heaven want the^ / and that they that be in hell have many mo. Every day at the
lest wha^ thou go to bed / cramyn dilyge^tly what thou haste thought the
day before / what y^ have done / and what thou have said / and how thou have
spent the precious time that was given the / to win therein the kingdom of
heaven. And if thou have past it well / thank god and laud him for it / and if
thou have spe^de it evil and neglyge^tly be sori for it and defer not ye next
day to be confessed / tha^ I put this in the end / to the^tent that you shall
dilyge^tly imagi^ as it were two cites before the / one full of all turme^tes as
hell is / the other full of al co^solacio^ as is the ki^gdom of heaven / and that
it behooves the of necessyte to e^tre and come in to the one of the^ behold
tha^ what mizt draw the against thy will to the evil cite / and what mizt let
the fro ye good city / and I trow that thou shall find nothing that might do
it (if thou would with all thine heet turn the to god / and put tyng away al
neglyge^ce / would mekely call to him for grace and merci) the which he yt is
most blessed above all vouchsaf to grant unto us. Amen.

That nothing pleseth god so much as that he be beloved above all thing / as
our lady shows to saint Byrget by example of a pagan woman / which optayned
great grace for the great love she had to her creator / as it appears in
the.vi. book of saint Birgettes revelations / the l. chapitre.
THe mother of god our lady saint Mary speaks to the spouse of her son saint
Birgit / saying thus. Nothing so much pleseth god / as that a man love him
above al thing / as I shall show to the by a symilytude of a pagan woman / which
knowing nothing of the faith thouzt to her self thus. I know said she / of what
matter I am come in to this world / and of what things I came in to my mothers
womb. And I believe that it had been impossyble that I should have had my body so
knyt together as it is / and my reason and understanding / but they had be given
unto me / and therefore I know well there is some creatoure and maker of me / that
has made me a reasonable creature / not deformed me like to worms or
serpe^tes. wherefore me thi^keth yt though I had many husbands and al they
called me / I would rather com at one calli^g of my creator / tha^ at the
calling of them all. I have also many sons and many daughters / and never the
less if I saw them have mete in their hands / and I knew my creator to want
meat / I would take ye meat fro my children and would gladly give it to my
creator / I have also many possessions which I order after mine own will / and
nevertheless if I knew the will of my creator / I would gladly leave mine own will
and dyspose the^ to his honor. But my daughter / se what god did with this pagan
woman. He sent unto her one of his elect servants yt enstructed her in the
faith / and god him self visyted her heart / as thou may well know and
understand herafter by the answer of the woman. For when that man showed unto
her that there was one god without beginyng and without ending / that is the
creator and maker of all things / she answered and said. It is well to be
believed that he that has created me / and al things / that he has no
treatour above him / and it is like that his life is everlasting that mizt gyne
me life. And wha^ the woman herd farther that the same creator took ma^hode of
a virgyn / and that he preched in this world and tauzt the people in his own
person / she answered. It is to believe god i^ every thing and tha^ she said
further. I pray the show me what be the words that my creator did speak and
command / for I will holly leave mine own will and fully obey to him / and to
every word that he has spoken. Than wha^ he declared unto her of ye passion
of our lord of his cross / his death / and of his resurrection / The woman with
great wepi^g answered and said. Blessed be my creator y^ so pacie^tly shows
his charity in the world / that be has to us in heaven. And therefore if I
loved hi^fyrste because he created me / I am now more bou^de^ to love hi^ /
because he has showed me the straight way to heaven and has redeemed me with
his precious blood / and I am bound therefore to serve him with all my strength
and all the parts of my body / and I am bounden also to remove al my desyer fro
me yt I had first to my possessyo^s and to my children and kinsmen / and only
to desire to se my creator in his glory that never shall have end Tha^ said
our blessed lady to saint Birget. Lo daughter. How great reward yt woman had
for her great love. So is daily given great reward to every man after the love
that he has to god while he lives i^ this world.

Our lord Jesu Christ gives to his spouse saint Birget a notable doctrine of
the lives Actyue and co^te^platyue / which he notably sygnifyed by Martha and
Mary magdaleyn / yt is to say how a man shall begin and profit in the life
spu^all and in grace and virtue that he may finally asce^de to ye high degree of
ye love of god and of his neighbor / which doctryn apperith in the.vi. book of
the reuerlacio^s of saint Byrget / the.lxv. chapter.
THe son of god speaks to his spouse saint Byrget / saying thus. There be
two lives which be lykened to Martha and Mary Magdaleyne / and who so ever will
follow tho two lives / must first make pure confession of all his sins /
taking very contricyon for them / having full will never after to offend. And
the first life / as I do witness my self in my gospel / Mary magdaleyn did choose
which ledeth a man to co^templacyon / that is to say to the beholdynge of
heavenly things / and that is the best part and is the very way of the life
everlasting. Therefore every man that coueyteth to follow the life of Mary / that
is to say / ye life co^templatiue / It suffiseth to hi^ to have only the
necessaris for the body / that is to say clothi^g without vanyte / mete and
drink in scarcite / and not in superfluite. Chastyte without any evil
delectacion / fasting and abstynence after the ordinance of the church / and
he that fasteth must take heed ye he be not ouermoch enfebled and made weke by
his unreasonable fasting / lest through that wekenesse he be enforsed to lose his
prayers and his counsel gyui^g / or other good deeds wherewith he might both
profit him self and his neighbor also. And he must also dylige^tly take heed
that he be not through his fasting the more slow to justice nor more slacker to
the works of mercy / for why / to punissh rebels and to bring infydeles under
the yoke of the faith is required great strength as well of body as of soul.
Therefore every syke person yt would rather to the honor of god fast tha^ ete /
shall have like reward for his good will as he y^ fasteth of charity. And i^
like wise he that for obedience eteth / desyryng rather to fast than to ete /
shall have like reward as he that fasteth. Second the co^templatiue man shall
not joy of the honor of the world nor of y^ prosperity thereof / ne sorrow
for his aduersite / but he shall joy specially in this / ye wicked men be become
denoute men / that lovers of the world be become lovers of god / and that good
men profit in goodness / and be through good labor and dilygence in the
service of god made daily more devout than other. Of this also the
co^templatyue man shall sorrow / that sinners be made daily worse and worse /
that almighty god is not beloved of his creatures as he ought to be / and that
the commandments of god be despised and set at naught. Thirdly the
co^templatiue man may not be ydell / ne no more may he that uses the actyue
life / but anon wha^ he has taken his necessary sleep / he shall rise and
thank almighty god with all his heart / for that he has created and made all
things / and that of his charity by taking out nature he has reformed and
renewed man kind / showing by his passion and death the love that he has to
man / which is so great that none can be gretter. Also the co^templatyue man
shall thank almighty god for all the^ that be saved / and for all the^ that be
in purgatory / and for them that yet be living in the world / prayenge
mekely for them unto our lord that he suffered them not to be tempted above
their power. The contemplatyue man also must be discrete in his prayers / and
be well ordered in his lauds and praysynges of god / for if he have suffycient
to live with / with out labor or business he must make the longer prayers.
And if he be weary and temptacyon rise in his prayers / he may labor with his
hands some honest and profitable work / either for him self / if he have
need or for other. And if he be in manner yrkesome with both / that is to say
with prayer and labor / that he may have some other honest occupacyon or here
some good holsom words or profitable counsayles / in all sobrenesse / all
scurrilytic and unclean words set a part till the body and soul be made more
apt / and more able to the service of god. And if the co^templatyue man have
not suffycyent to live withal but through his labor than may he make the
shorter prayers for his necessari labor / and that labor shall be the
perfection and encreasynge of his prayer / and if he can not labor nor may not
/ tha^ let him not be a shamed / ne think it not grievous to beg / but rather
that he be joyous for it / for tha^ he follows me the son of god / that made
my self poor to make man rich / and if the contemplatyue man be under
obedyeuce / than he must live after the obedyence of his prelate and his
reward shall be double / more tha^ if he were at liberty. Fourthly the
contemplatyue man may not be couetouse / no more may the actyue man / nor he
may not be prodygall / for as the actyue man distrybuteth temporal gods for
god so the co^templatyue man must dystribute his spiritual goods. Moreover if
the co^templatyue man will have almyghtye god inwardly in his heart / let him
be ware to say thus as many do. It suffyseth to me if I can save mine own
soul / for if I can do so / what have I to do with the deeds of other me^ / or
if I be good my self / what is it to me how other live. O my daughter / they
that say or think so / if they saw their friend dyshonested and troubled /
they should run with all their power to the death / that their friend might be
delivered out of his trouble / so shall the contemplatyue man do / he must
sorrow that almighty god is offended that his brother which is his neighbor
has occasion to offend. And if any fall in to sin / the co^templatyue man
shall endeavor him all that he can to help him out of his sin with all
dyscretyon. And if he have trouble or persecution for it / set him leave that
place and seek another place that is more quiet. For I my self that am very god
/ said to my discyples thus. If they persecute you i^ oue city fly ye in to
another: and so did Paul / the which because he should be more necessary
another time / was let go by a wall in a basket. Therefore y^ the conte^platiue
man may be lyberal and pitious / there be.v. things necessary to hi^. The first
is a house / in ye which his ghestes may sleep. The second is clothyng to
clothe ye naked. The third is meat to feed the hungrye. The fourth is fire
to warm the^ that be cold. The fyfth is medisyns for them that be sick /
that is to say good comfortable words with the charity of god. The house of
the co^templatyue man is his heart / whereof the cuyl ghestes be al tho things
that trouble his heart / that is to say / wrath / heaviness / couetyse / pride /
and many other like. Therefore all tho vices when the come / they shall in manner
lie as ghestes that be a sleep / and as they that be at rest. For as an host
receives evil ghestes and good with pacyence / so the contemplatyue man must
suffer all things for god through virtue of pacyence / and in no wise to
consent to vices / not to the^ that seem leest / ne to delight in them / but as
much as he may be little and little through the help of grace / to remove
them clearly out of the heart. And if he can not clearly remove them / he must
suffer them pacyently against his will as enemies / and never to assente to
them knowing certainly that they shall profit him to the greatter reward in
heaven and not to dampnacyon. Second the contemplatyue man must have clothes
to clothe his ghestes / that is to say meekness / both inward and outward /
and compassyon of mind for the afflyction of his neybour. And if the
co^templatyue man be despised of the world / let him think how I the god
almighty being contempned and despised suffered pacyently / and when I was
iuged I held my peace / and when I was scourged and crowned with thorns I
murmured not. The contemplatyue man also must take heed that he show not to
them that reprove hi^ or rebuke him any signs of anger or impacye^ce / but
that he bless them that persecute him / that they that se it may bless god
whom the contemplatyue man does follow / and almyghtye god shall give
blessings for the maledictyons. The contemplatyue man must be ware also that
he do not speak evil of them nor rebuke them that do grieve him / for it is
dampnable to bacbyte other and wylfully to here them that do bachyte or
through impacyence to reprove or rebuke his neighbor. Than y^ the
co^templatyue man may have perfytely the gift of meekness and pacyence / he
must study to admonysshe and warn them that do bachyte other / of the great
peril that they stand in / and that he exhort them in all charity with
words and with examples to perfyte meekness. Also the clothyng of the
contemplatyue man must be compassyon / for if he se his neighbor do any syn /
he must have compassyon of him / prayenge to almyghtye god to have mercy upon
him. And if he se him suffer any wrong or hurt or reprove / he must be sori
for him / and help hi^ with his prayers / and with his aid and dilyge^ce and
that if need be / before the great men of the world / for the true per fyte
contricio^ seeks not that is his / but that is his neighbors. And if the
contemplatyue man be such one that he is not herd with princes / and that it
profyteth not that he go out of his cell. Than be shall pray hertely for them
that be in trouble / and almightye god that is the beholder of man's heart /
for the charytic of him that prays / shall turn the hertes of the people to
peace and quietness of him that is in trouble / so that he shall either be
delivered out of his trouble / or he shall have patience sent him of god to
suffer it / and so his reward shall be doubled. Therefore such clothing / that
is to say meekness and compassyon must be in the heart of the co^templatyue
man for nothing so myghtely draws god in to the heart / as meekness and
compassyon of the neighbor does. Thirdly the conte^platyue man must have mete
and dri^ke for his ghestes / for sometime evil ghestes do lodge in the heart of
the co^templatyue man that is to say / when the heart is drawn fro be holdyng
of it self / and coueyteth things delectable / to se worldly things / to have
possessyon of temporal goods. And when the ears desire to here his own
honor / the flesh desires to delight in carnal things / the spyrite leyth
excuse of his fraylnesse / and that sin is but light / and when there comes a
painfulnesse and a hardness to do good bedes / and a forgetfulness of things
to come. And when he thinks his good deeds great / and forgets his evil
deeds. Against al such ghestes it is necessary for the contemplatyue man to
have good counsel / and not to dyssemble as though he were a sleep / but that
he armed strongely with true faith / answer to such ghestes / saying thus.
I woll have nothing of themporall goods / but barcly for the sustaynynge of
my bodily kind / and I will not spend no hour nor time / but to the honor of
god / nor I will not take heed what is fair or foul in ye world / ne what is
pleasant or dysplesaunt to the flesh / or sauoury or not sauoury to the mouth
/ but to the pleasure of god and health of my soul / for I would not live one
hour but to the honor of god. Such a will is meat and drike for the ghestes
that come / and that answer extincteth and puts away all inordinate delytes
and plesures of the world and of the flessh.

Fourthly the contemplatyue man must have fire to warm his ghestes and to give
them light / this fire is the hete of the holy ghost / it is impossyble any
man to leave his own will / or to forsake the carnal love of his friends or
the love of richesse but through the instynte and here of the holy ghost. Also
the coutemplatyue man / how holy and perfyte so ever he be / may not of him
self begin nor continue in good life with out help of grace in the holy
ghost. Therefore that the co^templatyue man may set a light before his ghestes /
First let him think thus: Almightye god has created me / that I should
honor him above all things / And in honourynge him / that I should love him
and dread him / and he was borne of a vyrgyn / to teach me the way to heaven /
and that I should follow that way in all meekness. And with his death he opened
the yates of heaven / that I should with great desire have me thither. Also the
contemplatyue man must examyn dylygently al his deeds / all his thoughts and
all his affectyons / that is to say how he has offended god / and how
pacyently god suffers man / and how many ways he calls man unto hi^ such
thoughts and such gh^stes of the contemplatyue man / be in manner but as they
were a sleep / but they be illumynate with the fire of the holy ghost: the
which fire than comes in to the heart / when the contemplatyue man thinks
how reasonable it is to serve god / and when he thinks that he had lever
suffer all pain / tha^ wyttyngly to provoke god to wrath / by whose goodness
his soul is create and made / and is also redeemed with his precious blood. Than
also the heart has here of this heavenly fire / that is the holy ghost / when
ye soul thi^keth and discerns to what intent every ghest / that is to say /
every thought comes. And whether it move the mind to coueyte joy perpetual
or transytory / and that he leave no thought undiscussed ne uncorrected with
dread of god. Therefore that this fire may be gotten / and wha^ it is gotten
that it may be safely kept. The contemplatyue man must ley to dry sticks /
that is to say he must dilygently take heed of the motyons of the flesh /
that it rebel not against the spirit. And he must put to all his dilygence
that the works of pytie and good prayers may be devoutly increased / wherewith
the holy ghost may have delight / but he must specially know and consider that
where a fire is made in a close vessel that has no auoydaunce / anon the fire
goth out and the vessel waxes cold. So it is with the contemplatyue man / if
he would not live to no thing else but that he might do honor to god / it
is expedyent that his mouth be opened / and that ye flame of his charity go
forth. Tha^ is the mouth opened when by his speki^g which proceeds of
fervent charity he gets spiritual children to god but the contemplatyue
man must take good head that he open his mouth to preche / where good men shall be
made more fervent / and where evil me^ may be a mended / where right wysenesse
may be increased / and evil customs may be put away: For the apostell Paul
sometime would have spoken but the holy ghost did prohibyte him / and so
sometime he held his peace / and when time conuenyente came / he speak / and
sometime he used soft words / and another time more sharper words / and always
he ordered his words to the honor and glory of god / and to the confortinge
and strengthuyng of the faith. And if the contemplatyue man may not preach /
but he has good will and conning to prech and lacks good herers / he must
do as the fore does / the which goth about many mountayns and sercheth with
his fete in many places / and where he fyndeth the softest place and most apt
for hi^ there he makes a den to rest him in. So the contemplatyue man must
assay with words / with examples / and with good prayers / the hertes of many
people / and where he fyndeth the hertes most apt to here the words of god /
there he must tarry in cou^saylyng and in enducyng the people to god all that he
can. The contemplatyue man also must labor all that he can / that conuenyent
auoydaunce may be had for his flame / for ye gretter that the flame is / the mo
be illumyned and made hot thereby. Than has the flame co^uenyent auoydaunce /
when the co^templatyue man neither dredeth rebukes / ne coueyteth not his own
praise / wha^ he neither dredeth aduersyties / ne delyteth him not in
prosperyties / and than it is more pleasure to god that he do his good deeds
openly tha^ preuely / that they that se them may glorifye god. And it is to
understand / that the contemplatyue man must put forth two flames / one
secretly / another openly / that is to say / he must have a double mekenes.
The first must be with i^ forth in the hertes the second must be with outforth
to the world. The first is / that ye conte^platyue man think him self
unworthy and unprofitable to al good works / and that he prefer not him self
in his own sight above no man / ne y^ he couete not to be lauded nor to be
scene in the world / that he slye pride / and desire god above al thing /
following his words and his techiges. And if ye conte^platyue man put forth
such a flame with good works / tha^ his heart shall be illumined with charytie / and
all the contraryous things that come to him shall lyghtely be suffered and
overcome. The second flame must be openly / for if perfyte makenesse be in
the heart / it must also appear in his apparel without forth and be herd in his
words / and be performed in his deeds. True meekness is in the apparel when
the contemplatyue man concyteth, more to have clothyng of small price / which
is profitable / than clothing of gretter value / wherhy he may fall in to
pride / and in to a desire to be seen in the world / for that apparel that is
little worth / and is called in the world vile and abiecte / is very fair and
precious before god / for it provoke meekness. And that apparel that is of
grette price and is called fair in the world / is very foul and vnsemly
before god / for it takes away the fayrenesse of angels / that is to say
meekness. But yet if the contemplatyue man for any reasonable cause be
constrained to have an habyt somewhat better than he would / let him not be
troubled therefore / for his reward shall thereby be increased. Also the
contemplatyue man must have meekness in his mouth / that is to say in
spekyng meke things / eschewynge all rybaldry and superfluytie of words / not
spekinge subtelly ne disceytfully / ne preferring his sentence before other.
And (...) the co^templatyue man here him self praised for any good deeds / let
him not be lift up in his heart therefore / but that he answer thus. All laud
and honor be to god that gives all things, what am I but dust in the wind /
or what goodness comes of me / that am naught else but as dry earth without
water? And if he be reproved in the world / let him not be moved there with /
but that he answer thus. I am worthy all this and much more / for I have so
often offended god / and have not made amends therefore again. Therefore pray ye
for me that by suffrynge of such temporal reproues / I may escape the shames
and reproues everlasting. And if the contemplatyue man be provoked to anger or
wrath / by the vnskylfulnes of his neybours / let him be well ware and take good
head that he answer not indiscreetly / for commonly pride follows anger and
wrath. Therefore it is good counsel that when anger or pride come / that he
hold his peace so long time / till the will may ask help of god to suffer /
and to take good auysement / how and what to answer / that he may first
overcome him self / and tha^ ^he wrath shall be abated in the heart / so that
he may answer wisely to them that be unwise. Thou shall know also that the
devil has great envy to a contemplatyue man / and if he can not hinder him by
breaking of the commandments of god / than he will stir hi^ to be either
lightly moved with wrath / or to be disposed to some vain and indiscreet
myrthe / or else to have some vain and unprofitable words. Therefore the
co^templatyue man must always ask help of god / that all his words and deeds
be governed by him / and be holly directed unto him. Also the co^templatiue man
must have meekness in all his works / that is to say / that he do no thing
for worldly praise / ne that he attempt no new thing of him self and yt he
be not a shamed of no work how vile so ever it be / so yt he may thereby
please god / that he fly singularyte / that he do good to all that he can / and
in every good deed that he does / think yt he myzt have do better Also he
must choose to sytte rayther with poor men than with rich / rather to obey
than to command / to keep scylence raither than to speak / to be solytary
than to be with mighty men or with his worldly fre^des. Also the co^templatyue
man must hate his own will / often remember his death / fly curiosyte / all
murmuri^ge and grudgynge / always remember the rightwysenesse of god / and take heed of his own affections. Also the co^templatyne man must often use confession
/ be slable and dylyge^t in his temptations (...) to desire to live / to none
other intent / but that the honor of god and health of souls may be increased.
Than if the co^templatiue man that has such affectyons and such de^y^es / as
is said before / be chosen in to the office of an sletyue man / and of
obedyence and charity to god / he takes upon him the rule of other he shall
have a double reward / as it may appear by this similytude

There was a mighty man that had a ship charged with precious marchaundises /
which said to his servants thus. Go ye with this ship to such a port / for
there I shall have right great increase / if the wi^de rise labor manfully and
yrke not at it / for your reward shall be great.

After as the servant sailed / a great wynd rose / the storms wered great and
the ship was tossed and broken grievously. Than the gouernoure of the ship
wered weary and slow / and all that were in the ship dispeyred of their lives
/ and agreed to go to some other port / whither as the wind would drive them
/ and not to that port that their lord had appointed the^ to. And that hering
/ one of the most faithful servants and most fervent / sorowyng through a
great zele and love yt he had to his lord / took upon him the governance of
the ship / and with strength brought the ship to the port that the lord
assygned the^ to go to. Is not that man that so manfully brought the ship to
the port / worthy to have gretter reward / than any of his fellows? yes
trewly. So it is of a good ruler that for the love of god and health of souls /
takes upon him the charge of governance of other / and cares not for the
honor / and trewly he shall have a double reward. First he shall be part taker
of the good deeds of al them that he bri^geth to the safe port Second his
glory shall be increased without end. And contrariwise it shall be of them
that come to honor and prelacy by their ambytion / for they shall be part
takers of all the pains and offenses of al them / that they took upon the^ to
rule. Second their co^fusyon shall never have end for prelates that coueyte
honors / he more like to strumpettes than to prelates / for they deceive their
subjects by their evil examples and their evil words / and be not worthy to
be called neither Co^templaryue men / nor Actyue men / but they amend and do
due peuaunce. Fyftly the contemplatyue man must give medicyns to his ghestes /
that is to say / he must confort them with good words / and to al things that
come lykyng or mislyking / plesaunt or displesaunt / he must say thus. I will
every thing that it pleases our lord that I should will / though I should go
to hell. And trewly such a will is a medicyn to all things that come to the
heart / and is a delight in all troubles that come / and a great temperaunce in
all prosperity. But because the co^templatiue man has many enemies / therefore
he must often make confession / for as long as he wylfully abides in sin /
having time and oportunyte to be confessed / and is neglygent or hebeth it not
/ he is rather to be called an Apostata before god / than a contemplatyue man.
The Actyue life. Also of ye deeds of a man that lives in the actyue life. Thou
shalt understand that though the part of the contemplatyue man be best /
that yet the part of the active man is not evil / but it is very laudable and
much plesau^t to god / therefore I shall show the now how the actyue man must
order him self. He must have as the co^templatyue man has / five things. The
first is true faith of holy church. The second is that he know the
commandments of god / and the counsayls of the Euangelycall truth / and
them he must perform / in will / word / and deed. Thirdly he must refrain
his tongue fro all evil words / that are against god and his neighbor / and
his hands fro all dishonest and vniaufull deeds. And his mind fro ouermoch
desire of worldly goods / and fro ouergret delight of worldly pleasures and
(...) to be content with that god has sent him and to desire no superfluous
things. Fourthly he shall do the deeds of mercy resonably in all meekness /
so yt for trust of the good deeds / he in nothing offend god. Fystly he must
love god above all things / and that more tha^ him self as Martha did / for
she gave her self gladly to me / folowyngeiny words and deeds / and
afterward she gave all her goods for my love / and lothed all temporal
things desyring only things everlasting / and therefore she sustained all
things pacyently as they came / and cared as well for the health of other as
of her self / thinking always of my charytie and on my passion / and she was
glad in troubles / merry in aduersyties / and loved all people as a mother her
child. She would also often follow me / when I was in the world desyringe
nothing but to here me. She also had compassion of them that were in trouble.
She comforted them that were in heaviness / releued them that were sick / she
cursed no man ne said evil to no man / but dissymuled the evil manners of her
neighbors all that she might / and prayed always for them. Therefore every man
that desires to live charitably in ye actyue life / must follow Martha /
loui^g his neybour / to the end that he may come to heaven / but not to favor
his sin or evil life / flyeng his own praise / and pride / and doubleness
of heart / and wrath and envy he may not follow. But thou shalt understand
/ that when Martha prayde for her brother Lazar that was deed she came first to
me / but her brother was not raised forthwith upon her coming / but afterward
Mary was called / and when she came / tha^ at the prayer of them both together
/ their brother was raised fro death. So it is spyrytually / for he that
desires perfytely to come to the life contemplatyue / must first exercise him
self well in the actyue life / laboring all that he may to the honor of god
in good bodily labors. And learn first to resyst all fleshly desires / and to
with stand myghtely the fendes temptations / and than he may afterward with
good delyberatyon ascend to the higher degree / that is to say / to the life
co^templatyue / for he that is not proved and well assayed with temptations /
and has not yet fully over come the evil motions of the flesh / may not
holly set him self to heavenly things. But who is the dedde brother of
thactyue man / and of the contemplatyue man / but their indiscreet deeds / for
many times a good deed is done with an indiscreet e^tente and of an inconstant
mind / and therefore it is but as it were deed wherefore that a good deed may be
acceptable to god / it is raised again and comes to life by the actyue m^ and
by the co^templatyue man / that is to say / wha^ the neibour is purely loved
for god and to god / and god is only desired for him self above al things.
And than every good deed of man or woman is plesau^t to god. Therefore I said
in my gospel / that Marye had chosen the better part. The life of the Actyue
man is good / wha^ he soroweth for the si^ues of his neybours / but his part
is better when he labors all that he may that his neighbors may do well
and persevere well unto the end / and that he do all that he does for the love
of god. But the part of the contemplatyue man is best / wha^ he only
beholds heavenly things and the health of souls. when the mind is fulfilled
with good affections / and wha^ he is well at rest fro the clamorous noyce of
worldly business / and thinks always god present unto him / and sets his
meditations fully in the love of god / and labors fruitfully therein both day
and night.

Christ says / that the devotion of thinfydeles in time to come / shall be
much more than the deuotyon of the christen men / and they shall all singe joy
be to the father / to the son / and to the holy ghost / and honor to all his
(...). Amen. The.vi. book of the revelations of saint Birgette the (...).
chapitre.
THe son of god speaks to his spouse saint Birget / saying. Thou shall know
yt yet there shall be so much deuoryon in the infydeles / that christen men
shall be as there spirytuall servants / and scripture shall be fullfylled that
says. The people (...) understa^dynge shall glorify me / and deserts shall
be builded again and they shall sing all / joy be to the father / and to the
son / and to the holy ghost / and honor to all his saints. Amen.

What things be necessary to him that desires to byset the lands of the
infydeles, The.vi. book of the revelations of saint Birget / the.xli. chapitre
in the end of the chapitre.
THe sone of god spekith to saint Birgette / and says. He that desires to
visyte the lands of the infydyles / ought to have.v. things. The first is /
that he discharge his consyence with true confession and contrityon / as
though he should forthwyth dye. Second that he put away all lyghtnesse of
manners and of apparel / not taking head to new customs and vanities / but to
such laudable customs as his auncesters have used before time. Thyrdly / that
he have no temporal thing but for necessyte and to the honor of god / and
if he know any thing vnrightwysely gotten / either by him self or by his
auncestres that he restore it / whether it be little or great. Fourthly that he
labor / to the intent that the unfaithful men may come to the true
catholycall faith / not desiring their goods ne catell / or any other thing
/ but to the only necessytie of the body. Fyftly that he have full will gladly
to dye for the honor of god / and so to dyspose him self in laudable
conversation / y^ he may descerue to com to a good and a blessed ending. Amen.

Here after follows the.lxv. chapter of the first book of Scala Perfectionis.
That it is a great maistrye to love men's persons / and wyselye hate their
sins. Cap. lxv.
IT is no maistry for to wake and fast till thine heed ache ne for to reune to
Rome / and to Iherusalem upon thy bare fete / ne for to sterte about and preche
/ as if thou would turn all me^ by thy prechyng. Ne it is no maistry for to
make churches / chapells / and hospitals. But it is a maistry a man to love his
euenchristen in charytie / and wisely hate the sin of him and love the man.
For though it be so that all these deeds before said ar good in them self /
nevertheless they are common to good men and to badde. For each man might do
them if that he would and had whereof. And for to do that each man may do / I
hold it no maistry. But for to love his even christian in charity and hate his
sin / may no man it do but only good me^ which have it of the gift of god
/ and not of their traueile: as saint Paul says. To. v. Caritas dei diffusa
est in cordibus vestris per spiritu^ sanctu^ qui datus est vobis. Love and
charity is shed and spread in your hertes by the holy ghost / which is given to
you. And therefore it is the more preciouse and the more deyntie for to come by.
All other good deeds withouten charity make not a man good ne worthithe bliss
of heaven / but this alone / and only this / makes a man good and all his good
deeds medefull. All other gifts of god and works of man are common to good
and to badde / to chosen and to reproved. But this gift of charytie is only
of god and of chosen souls.
