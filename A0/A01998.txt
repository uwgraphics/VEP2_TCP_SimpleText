CVM PRIVILEGIO.

EPIGRAMMA AVTORIS IN SVVM LIBRVM.
Torpor, hebes sensus, schola parua, labor minimusque
Causant, quo minus ipse minora canam.
Qua tum Engisti lingua canit insula Bruti,
Anglica Carmente metra iuuante loquar.
Ossibus ergo carens, quae conterit ossa loquelis,
Absit, et interpres stet procul, oro, malus.
To the reder.
IN time paste when this warke was prynted, I can not very well coniecte,
what was the cause thereof, the prologue before was clean altered. And by that
mean it would seem, that Gower did compyle it at the request of the noble
duke Henry of Lancastre. And all though the books that be written, be contrary,
yet I have followed therein the prynt copy, for as much as it may serve both
weyes, and because most copies of the same warke are in printe: but yet I
thought it good to warn the reder, that the written copies do not agree with the
prynted. Therefore sir I have prynted here those same lines, that I find in the
written copies. The which alteration ye shall perceive began at the.xxiij.
line in the prologue, and goth forth on, as ye se here following.

In our english I think make
A book for king Rychardes sake;
To whom belongs my ligeance,
with all mine hearts obeysaunce,
In all that ever a lyege man
Unto his king may done or can,
So farforth I me recommaunde
To him, which all me may command;
Preyende unto the high reign,
which causes eury king to reygne,
That his corone long stand.
I think and have it understand
As it befyll upon a tide,
As thing which should tho betyde,
Under the town of new Troy,
which took of Brute his first joy,
In Themse, when it was flowende,
As I by bote came rowende:
So as fortune her time set
My lyege lord perchance I met:
And so befelle as I came nygh,
Out of my bote, when be me sygh,
He bad me come into his barge.
And when I was with him at large,
Among other things seyde
He has this charge upon me leyde,
And bad me do my business
That to his high worthynesse
Some new thing I should book,
That he him self it might look
After the form of my writing.
And thus upon his commaundynge
Mine heart is well the more glad
To write so as he me bad:
And eke my fear is well the less,
That none envy shall compass
(without a reasonable wit)
To feyne and blame that I write.
A gentle heart his tongue stylleth
That it malice none distilleth
But preyseth that is to be preysed:
But he that has his word vnpeysed
And handles out kronge any thing,
I pray unto the heaven king
Fro such tongues he me shilde.
And netheles this world is wild
Of such jangling and what befall,
My kings heste shall not fall;
That I in hope to deserve
His thonke, ne shall his will observe:
And else were I naught excused.
For that thing may naught be refused
what that a king him self byt.
For thy the symplest of my wit
I think (if that it may avail)
In his seruyse to travail,
Though I syckenes have upon hand,
And long have had, yet woll I fond
So as I made my beheste,
To make a book after his heste;
And write in such a manner wise
which may be wisdom to the wise,
And play to hem that list to play.
But in proverb I have herd say,
That who that well his warke begins
The rather a good end be wynneth.
And thus the prologue of my book
After the world, that whylom took,
And eke somdele after the new,
I woll begin for to new.
And thus I say for these.lxx. lines, there be as many other printed, that be
clean contrary unto these both in sentence and in meaning. And farthermore
there were let out in diverse places of the warke lines and columns, ye and
sometime holle padges; which caused, that this most pleasunt and easy auctor
could not well be perceived: for that and chaungynge of words, and misord^ynge
of sentences, would have mased his mind in redynge, that had been very (...)
learned: and what can be a greatter (...) ^he unto a noble auctour? And (...)
p^^ise worthily unto you the great (...) of this auctour, I know my ^^^^ght
much unable; ye shall your ^^^we ^^eine, when ye shall se him (...) as I can)
set forth in his own ^^ppe and lykenes. And this the mean (...) I may be
bold to say, that if we (...) ^e^er have seen his counnynge (...) the which
even at the full do (...) ^^at a clerk he was, the wor^^ (...) ^^oste famous
and excellent (...) ^^^er, that he wrote in the (...) m^^te special warke,
that is (...) and Creseyde, do suffi^^^ (...) the same, where he says:

(...) G^wer, this book I direct (...) the philosophical Strode: (...) ^^^te,
there need is, to correct (...) your be^ignites and zeles good.

(...) ^he which noble warke, and many (...) the said Chausers, that never
(...) ^^fore imprinted, and those that very ^^we m^n knew, and fewer had
them, ^^^^we of late put forth to gether in a (...) ^^^ume. By the which
words of (...), we may also understand, that (...) Gower were both of one
self (...) ^^th excellently learned, both great friends to gether, and both a
like ende^oured them self and employed their time ^o well and so virtuously,
that they did not only pass forth their lyfes here ^yght honorably; but also
for their so doing, so long (of lykelyhode) as letters shall endure and
continue, this noble royalme shall be the better, over and beside their honest
fame and renown. And thus when they had gone their journey; the one of them,
that is to say, John^ Gower prepared for his bones a resting place in the
monastery of saint Marye Oueres, where somewhat after the old fasshion he lies
right sumptuously buried with a garlande on his heed, in token that he in his
life days flourysshed fresshely in literature and science. And the same
moniment, in remembrance of him erected, is on the North side of the fore
said church, in the chapel of saint John^, where he has of his own
foundation a mass daily song. And more over he has an obyte yearly done for
him within the same church / on friday after the feast of the blessed pope
saint Gregory.

Beside on the wall where as be lies there be peynted three virgins with
crowns on their beedes / one of the which is written Charity / and she
holdethe this divise in her hand.

En toy qui es fitz de dieu le pere
Sauue soit, que gist souz cest piere.
The second is written Mercy, which holds in her hand this divise: O bone
Jesus fait ta mercy
Al alme, don't le corpse gist icy.


The third of them is written Pite, which holds in her hand this divise
following.

Pur t^ Pite Jesus regard,
Et met cest alme in sauue guard.
And there by hongeth a table, wherein appears that who so ever praith for the
soul of John^ Gower, he shall so often as he so does, have a thousand and five
handred days of pardon.

The other lies huryed in the monasterye of saint Peter's at westmyster in an
i will on the south side of the church. On whose souls, and all christen, Jesus
have mercy. Amen.

Thus ends the table of this warke entitled Gower de Confessione Amantis.
To the most victorious / and our most gracious sovereign lord king Henry
the.viii. king of England and of France / Defender of the feyth / and lord
of Irelande. etc.
PLutarke writes / when Alexander had disco^fyte Darius the king of Perse /
among other jewels of the said kings there was found a curyous little
cheste of great value / which the noble king Alexander beholdynge / said:
This same shall serve for Homere. which is noted for the great love and favor
/ that Alexander had unto learning. But this I think verily / that his love
and favor thereto / was not so great as your gracis: which caused me / most
victorious / and most redoubted sovereign lord / after I had printed this
warke / to deuyse with my self / whether I might be so bold to present your
highness with one of them / and so in your gracis name put them forth. your
most high and most princely majesty abashed and clean discouraged me so to
do / both because the present (as concerning the value) was far to simple /
as me thought / and because it was none other wise my act / but as I took some
pain to prynte it more correctly than it was before. And though I should say
/ that it was not much greatter pain to that excellent clerk the moral
John^ Gower to compyle the same noble warke / than it was to me to prynt it /
no man will believe it / without conferring both the printis / the old and mine
to gether. And as I stood in this basshement / I remembered your incomparable
Clemency / the which / as I have my self sometime seen / most graciously
accepts the sklender gifts of small value / which your hyghnes perceived
were offered with great and loving affection / and that not only of the nobuls
and great estates / but also of your mean subjects: the which so much
boldeth me again / that though I / of all other / am your most humble
subject and servant / yet my heart gives me / that your hyghnes / as ye are
accustomed to do / woll of your most benign nature consider / that I would
with as good will / if it were as well in my power / give unto your grace the
most goodlyest and largest cite of all the world. And this more over I very
well know / that both the nobuls and commons of this your most noble royalme /
shall the sooner accept this book / the gladlyer read it / and be the more
diligent to mark and bear awey the moral doctrines of the same / when they
shall se hit come forth under your gracis name / whom they with all their very
hearts so truly love and dread / whom they know so excellently well learned /
whom they ever find so good / so just / and so gracious a prince. And who so
ever in redynge of this warke / does consider it well / shall find / that it
is plentifully stuffed and fournysshed with manyfolde eloquent reasons / sharp
and quick arguments / and examples of great auctorite / perswadynge unto
virtue / not only taken out of the poets / orators / historywryters / and
philosophers / but also out of the holy scripture. There is to my dome / no man
/ but that he may by reding of this warke get right great knowledge / as well for
the understanding of many and diverse autors / whose resons / sayenges / and
histories are translated in to this warke / as for the plenty of english
words and vulgars / beside the furtheraunce of the life to virtue. which old
english words and vulgars no wise man / because of their antiquite / will
throw aside. For the writers of later days / the which began to loath and
hate these old bulgars / when they them self would write in our english
tongue / were constrained to bring in / in their writings / new terms (as
some call them) which they borrowed out of latyne french / and other langages
/ which caused / that they that understood not those langages / from whens
these new vulgars are fette / could not perceive their wrytynges. And though
our most allowed old autors did otherwhyle use to borowe of other langages /
either because of their meter / or else for lack of a feet english word /
yet that ought not to be a president to us / to heap them in / where as needs
not / and where as we have all ready words approved and received / of the same
effect and strength. The which if any man want / let him resort to this
worthy old writer John^ Gower / that shall as a lantern give him light to
write counnyngly / and to garnysshe his sentencis in our vulgar tongue. The
which noble autour / I prostrate at your gracis feet / most lowly present /
and beseech your hyghnes / that it may go forth under your gracis favor. And
I shall ever pray: God that is almyghtye preserve your royal majesty in most
long continuance of all welthe / honor / glory / and grace infinite. Amen.

Prologus.
Hic in primis declarat Ioa^nes Gower quam ob causam presentem fibellu^
composuit and finaliter compfeuit, An. regni regis Ric. secundi 16.
Of them / that written us to fore
The books dwell: and we therefore
Ben taught of that was written tho /
For thy good is / that we also
In our time among us here
Do write of new some mattere
Ensampled of the old wise:
So that it might in such a wise
(when we be deed and else where)
Beleaue to the worlds ere
In time coming after this.
And for men seyne (and sothe it is)
"That who that all of wisdom write
"It dulleth often a man's wit
"To him that shall it all day read:
For thilke cause (if that ye read)
I wol go the myddell wey,
And write a book between the twey;
Somewhat of lust / and somewhat of lore:
That of the less / or of the more
Some man may like of that I write.
And for that few men endyte
In our englisshe / for to make
A book for Englondes sake
The year.xvi. of king Richard.
what shall bifalle here afterward
God wot / for now upon this tide
Men se the world on every side
In sundry wise so diuersed,
That it well nygh stant all reuersed.
Als for to speak of time ago.
The cause why it changes so
It needs naught to specifye;
The thing so open is at the eye
That every man it may behold.
And netheles by days old
when that the books weren lever,
"writing was beloved ever
"Of them that weren virtuous
For here in earth among us
If no man write how it stood;
The pris of them that were good
Should as who says a great party
Be lost: so for to magnifye
The worthy princes / that tho were,
The books shown here and there;
whereof the world ensampled is:
And tho that diden then amys
Through tyranny and cruelte,
Right as they stonden in degree
So was the wrytinge of the work.
Thus I which am a borell clerk
Purpose for to write a book
After the world that why lome took
Long time in old days passed:
But for men seyn it is now lassed
In wers plyght than it was tho
I think for to touch also
The world / which neweth every day,
So as I can / so as I may:
Though I sickness have upon hand
And long have had / yet wol I fond
To write / and do my business;
That in some party (so as I guess)
The wise man may be aduysed:
For this prologue is so assised
That it to wisdom all belongs.
That wise man that it vndertongeth,
He shall draw in to remembrance
"The fortune of the worlds chance;
"The which no man in his person
"May know but the god allone.
when the prologue is so dispended
The book shall afterward be ended
"Of love / which does many a wondre,
"And many a wise man has put under:
And in this wise I think to treat
Toward them / that now be great,
Between the virtue and the vice;
which longs unto this office.
But for my wits ben to small
To tell every man's tale;
This book upon amendment
To stand at his commandment
(with whom mine heart is of acorde)
I send unto mine own lord
which of Lancastre is Henry named:
The high god has him proclaimed
Full of knyghthode and al grace.
So would I now this work embrace
with holle trust and holle believe.
God grant I mote it well acheue.

Now sta^te the crope under the rote
The world is changed ouerall
And thereof most in special
That love is fall in to discord
And that I take in to record
Of every land for his party
The comen voice / which may not lie
Naught upon one but upon all
Is that men now clepe and call
And seyn / that reigns been divided
Instead of love is hate guyded
The werre wol no pees purchase
And law has take her double face
So that Justice out of the way
with ryghtwysenes is gone away
And thus to look on every halue
Men seen the sore without salve
which all the world has overtake
There is no reign of all out take
For every clymat has his dele
After the turnynge of the whele
which blind fortune overthrows
whereof the certain no man knows
The heaven wot what is to done
But we that dwell under the moon
Stand in this world upon a were
And namely but the power
Of them that been the worlds guides
with good counseylle on all sides
Ben kept upright in such a wise
That hate break naught thassise
Of love / which is all the chief
To keep a reign out of mischief
For all reason would this
That unto him / which the heed is
The members buxom shall bow
And he should eke their troth allow
with all his heart / and make them chere
For good counseyll is good to here
All though a man be wise him selue
yet is the wisdom more of twelve
And if they stand both in one
To hope it were then anon
That god his grace would send
To make of thylke werre an end
which every day now grows new
And that is greatly for to rewe
In special for Christ's sake
which would his own life forsake
Among the men to yeuen pees
But now men tellen netheles
That love is from the world departed
So stant the pees yneuen parted
with them that lyuen now a days
But for to look at all assayes
To him / that would reason seche
After the comen worlds speech
It is to wonder of thylke werre
In which none wot who has the were
For every land him self deceyueth
And of dysese his part receives
And yet take men no keep
But thylke lord / which all may keep
To whom no counseyll may be hyd
Upon the world / which is betide
Amend that / whereof men pleyne
with true hertes and with pleyne
And reconsele love again
As he / which is king sovereign
Of all the worlds governance
And of his high purueyance
Afferme piece between the lands /
And take their cause in to his bonds
So that the world may stand appesed
And his godheede also be plesed
Quas coluit Moses uetus, aut nouus ipse Ioa^nes,
Hesternas leges uix colit ista dies.
Sic prius Ecclesia bina uirtute polita

To think upon the days old
The life of clerks to behold
Men seyn how that they were tho
Ensample / and rewle of all tho
which of wisdom the virtue soughten
Unto the god first they besoughten
As to the substance of their schole
That they ne should not befole
Her wytre upon none erthly works
which were ayene the astate of clerks
And that they myghten flee the vice
which Simon has in his office
whereof he takes gold in bond
For thylke time (I understand)
The lumbarde made non eschaunge
The bisshopryches for to change
Ne yet a letter for to send
For dignyte / ne for prouende
Or cured / or without cure
The church kay in adventure
Of arms and of brigantaylle
Stood no thing then upon bataylle
To fight or for to make cheste
It thought them then not honest
But of symplycite and pacyence
They maden then no defense
The court of worldly regallie
To them was then no bayllie
The vain honor was naught desired
which has the proud heart fyred
The humylite was tho withholde
And pride was a vice hold
Of holy church the largess /
yafe then and did great alms
To pour men that had need
They were eke chaste in word and deed
whereof the people ensample took
Their lust was all upon the book
Or for to preche or for to pray
To wysse men the right way
Of such as stood of troth vnlered
Lo thus is Peter's bargestered
Of them that thylke time were
And thus came first to man's ere
The feyth of Christ and all good
Through them that then were good
And sobre / and chaste / and large and wise
And now (men seyn) is other wife
Simon the cause has undertake
The worlds sword in hond is take
And that is wounder netheles
when Christ him self has bode pees
And set it in his testement
How now that holy church is went
Of that their law posytife
Has set to make werre and strife
For wordli goods / which may not last
God wot the cause to the last
Of every right and wrong also
But while the law is ruled so
That clerks to the werre intend
^^o^ how that they shall amend
The woeful world in other things
To make peace bytwen kings
After the law of charity
which is the propre dewte
Belonged unto the preesthode
But (...) it thinks to manhood.
The heaven is for the world is nyghe
And vain glory is eke so slygh
which couetyse has now withholde
That they none other thing behold
But only that they myghten win
(...) thus the werres they begin
(...) the holy church is taxed
(...) ^he point as it is axed
(...) goth to the battle
(...) Christ might not avail
(...) them right by other way
(...) sword the church kaye
(...) and the holy bid
(...) ^^rge and every stead
(...) stand upon the feythe

(...) is naught of company
(...) w^rke as it is founded
(...) ^^de or else be confounded
(...) only for Christ's sake
(...) ^ure for to take
(...) for pride of thylke astate
(...) a name of a prelate
He shall by reason do profit
In holy Church upon the plyte
That he has set his conscience
But in the worlds reverence
Th^^ be of such many glad
wha^ they to thylke astate be made
Naught for the merit of the charge
But for they would hem self discharge
Of pouerte / and become great /
And thus for pomp and for beycte
The scribe and eke the pharisee
Of Moses upon the sea
In the chair on high ben set
whereof the feyth is often let
which is betake them to keep
In Christ's cause all day they sleep
But of the world is naught foryete
For well is him / that now may get
Office in court to be honored
The strong Coffre has all devoured
Under the keye of avarice
The tresour of the benefice
whereof the pour shulden clothe
And ete / and drink / and house both
The charity goth all ynknowe
For they no greyne of pite sow
And slouthe kepethe the librarye
which longs to the seintuarye
To study upon the worlds lore
Suffiseth naught without more
Delicacie his sweet tothe
Has suffered so that it fordothe
Of abstinence all that there is
And for to loken over this
If Ethna brenne in the clergy
Al openly to man's eye
At Auignon thexperyence
Thereof has youen an evidence
Of that men seen them so divided
And yet the cause is naught decided /
But it is said / and ever shall
Bitwene two stools is the fall
when that men wenen best to sytte
In holy church of such a slitte
Is for to rewe unto us all
God grant it mote well befalle
Toward him which has the troth
But often is seen / that much sloth
when men ben drunken of the cup
Does much harm / wha^ the fire is up
But if somwho the flame staunche
And so to speak upon this branch
which proud envy has made to spring
Of scisme causes for to bring
This new sect of lollardye
And also many an beresye
Among the clerks in them selue
It were better dyke and delue
And stand upon the right feyth
Than know all that the bible seyth
And err / as some clerks do
Upon an hand to wear a sho
And set upon the foot a glove
Acordeth not to the behoue
Of reasonable man's use
If men behelden the vertuse
That Christ in earth taught here
They should not in such manner
Among them / that be hold wise
The papacye so desguyse /
Upon diverse electyon
which stant after thaffecton
Of sundry lands all about
But when god woll / it shall wear out
For truth mote stand at last
But yet they argumenten fast
Upon the pope / and his astate
whereof they fallen in great debate
This clerk said ye / that other nay
And thus they drive forth the day
And each of them him self amendeth
Of worlds good: but none entendeth
To that / which commen profit were
They seyen / that god is mighty there
And shall ordeyne / what he will
There make they none other skyll
where is the peril of the feyth /
But every clerk his heart leyth
To keep his world in special
And of the cause general
which unto holy church longs
Is none of them that vnderfongeth
To shapen any resystence /
And thus the right has no defense
But there I love / there I hold
Lo thus to broke is Christ's fold
whereof the flock without guide
Deuourd is on every side
In lack of them / that be unware
Shepherdes / which their wits beware
Upon the world in other halue
The sharp prycke instead of salve
They vsen now / whereof the bele
They hurt of that they should hele
what sheep / that is full of wulle
Upon his back they tose and pulle
while there is any thing to pylle
And though there be none other skylle
But only for they would win
They leave naught / when they begin
Upon their act to proceed
which is no good shepeherdes deed
And upon this / also men seyn
That fro the lose / which is pleyne
In to the breres they forcatche
Here of for that they wolden lache

That shall upon the thorns leave
Of wolle / which the brere has tore
whereof the sheep ben all to tore
Of that the herdes make them lose
Lo how they feynen chalk for chese
For though they speak and teache w^^^
They done them self thereof no dele
For if the wolf come in the wey
Their gostly staff is then a weye
whereof they should their flock defend
But if the pour sheep offend
In any thing / though it be lyte
They ben all ready for to smite
And thus how ever that they tale
The strokes fall upon the small
And upon other that been great
Them lacks heart for to beat
So that under the clerks law
Men seen the merell all mysdrawe
I woll not say in general
For there be sum in special
In whom that all virtue dwells
And tho been / as the apostel tells
Qui vocantur a deo tanquam Aaron
That god of his election
Has cleped to perfection
In the manner as Aaron was
They be nothing in thylke cas
Of Simon / which the foldes gate

But they gone in the right weye
There been also sum (as men sey)

The myrrour of examplarye

Vulga^ is populus regali lege subactus

Now for to speak of the comune
It is to dread of that fortune
which has befalle in sundry lands
But often for defaute of bonds
Al sodeinly / er it be wist
A tun / when his lie aryst
To breketh / and ronneth all about
which else should naught gone out
And eke full often a little skar
Upon a bank / er men be ware
Let i^ the streme / which with great pain
If any man it shall restreyne
where law faylleth / error grows
He is not wise / who that ne troweth
For it has proved often er this
And thus the common clamor is
In every land / where people dwells
And each in his compleynte tells
How that the world is my swent
And thereupon his argument
yeueth every man in sundry wise
But what man would him self auyse
His conscience / and naught my suse
He may well at the first excuse
His god / which ever stant in one
In him there is defaute non
So must it stand upon us selue
Naught only upon ten ne twelve
But plenerly upon us all
For man is cause of that shall fall
Nota contra hoc / quod asiqui sortem Fortune / asiqui influentia^ planetaru^
ponu^t / per quod (vi dicitur) rerum euentue necessario contingit / sed potius
dicendum est / quod ea que nos prosye ra et aduersa in hoc mundo vocamus /
secundum merita et demerita hominum / digno dei iudicio proueniunt.
And netbeles yet sum men write
And sayn fortune is to wit /
And some men hold opinion
That it is constellacion /
which causes all that a man does
God wot of both which is sothe /
The world / as of his propre kind
was ever untrue / and as the blind
Improperly he demeth fame
He blames / that is naught to blame
And preyseth / that is naught to preyse
Thus when he shall the things peyse
There is deceyt in his balaunce
And all is that the varyaunce
Of us / that should us beter auyse
For after that we fall and rise
The world ariste / and falls with all
So that the man is over all
His own cause of well and woe
That we fortune clepe so
Out of the man him self it grows
And who that other wise troweth /
Behold the people of Israel
For ever / while they dydden well
Fortune was them debonayre
And when they dydden the contrayre
Fortune was contrary end
So that it proves well at end
why that the world is wonderful
And may no while stand full /
Though that it seem well bescyn /
For every worlds thing is vain
And ever goth the whele about /
And ever stant a man in doubt /
Fortune stant no while stylle
So bath there no man his will
Als far as any man may know
There lasts no thing but a throw
Boethius. O quam duscedo humane vite musta amaritudine aspersa eft.

The world stante ever upon debate
So may be syker none astate /
Now here / now there / now to / now fro
Now up / now down / the world goth so
And ever has done / and ever shall
whereof I find in specyal
A tale written in the bible
which must needs be credible
And that as in conclusyon /
Seyth / that upon diuisyon
Stant / why no worlds thing may last
Till it be drive to the last
And fro the first reygne of all
Unto this day how so befall
Of that the reygnes be meuable
The man him self has be culpable
which of his governance
Fortuneth all the worlds chance

In whose eterne remembrance
From first was every thing present
He has his prophecye sent
In such a wise / as thou shall here
To Daniel of this matere
How that this world shall torn and we^de
Till it be fall unto his end
whereof the tale tell I shall
In which is betokoned all
As Nabugodonosor slepte
A sweuen him took / the which he kept
Til on the morrow he was arise
For thereof he was sore agryse
Till Daniell his dreme he told
And prayed him fair / that he would
A read what it token may
And said / a bed where I lay
Me thought I seyghe upon a stage
where stood a wonder strange image
His beed with all the neck also
They were of fine gold both two
His breast his shulders / and his arms
were all of silver / but tharmes
The womb and all down to the kne
Of b^as they were upon to se
His legs they were made all of steel
So were his feet also somdele
And somedele part to them was take
Of ^^rthe which men pottes make
The ^^ble mengled was with the strong
So might it not stand long

And after that the ^ombe of bras
^oken of a wers world it was
The which steel he saw afterward
A world bet^keneth more hard
De tibeis ferreis
But yet the werste of every dele
Is last / that when of earth and steel
He saw the fete departed so
For that betokens much woe
De significatione pedum, que ex duabus materus discordantibus ad inusee^

when that the world divided is
It mot algate fare amys
For earth / which mengled is with stele
To gydre may not last well
But if that one that other waste
So mote it needs fall at the last
De sapide statuam confringente.
The stone / which from that bylly stage
He saw down fall on that image
And has it in to poudre broke
That sweuen has Daniel vnloke
And said / that it is gods might
which when men wene most upright
To stand / shall them over cast
And that is of this world the last
And than a new shall begin
From which a man shall never twinne
Or all to pain / or all to pees
That world shall last endless.
Hic seribit, quasiter huius seculi regna bariso mutationibus, preut in dicta

Lo thus expowned Daniel
The kings sweuen fair and well
In Babylone the cite
where that the wysest of Laldee
He couden wit what it mente
But be told all the hoole entente
As in party it is befalle
Of gold the first regne of all
De seculo aureo, quod in capite statue designatum est a tempore in suis
Nabugodonosoria regis Casdee vsque in regmi Cyri regis Persaril.
was in that kings time tho
And last many days so
There / whiles that the monarchye
Of all the world in that party
To Babylone was subgette
And held him still in such a plight
Till that the world began diverse
And that was / wha^ the king of Perse
which Lyrus hight / again the pees
Forth with his son Lambyses
Of Babylone all that Empire
Right as they would them self desire
Put under in subjection
And took it in possession
And slain was Baltasar the king
which lost his reign / and all his thing
De seculo argented / quod in pectore designatum est a tempore ipsius regis
Cyri vsque in regnum Alexandri regis Macedonie.
And thus when they had it won
The world of silver was begone
And that of gold was passed out
And in thus wise it goth about
In to the reign of Darius
And than it fell to Perse thus
There Alexander put them under
which wroght of arms many a wonder
So that the monarchy left
with greeks / and their astate up left
And Persiens gone under foot
So suffer they / that needs mote
De seculo eneo, quod in ve^fte designatum est a tempore ipsius Alexandri vsque
in regnu^ Iulu Romanorum imperatoris.
And tho the world began of bras
And that of silver ended was
But for the time thus it last
Till it befelle / that at last
This king / wha^ that his day was come
with strength of death was overcome
And netheles yet or he did
He shope his reign to deuyde
To knights / which him had served
And after that they have deserved
yafe the conquestes / that he wanne
whereof great werre tho began
Among them / that the reigns had
Through proud envy / which them lad
Till it befelle ayene them thus
The noble Lesar Julius
which tho was king of Rome land
with great battle / and strong hand
All Greece / Perse / and Chaldee
wan / and put under: so that he
Not all only of thorient
But all the march of thoccident
Governs under his Empire
As he that was holle lord and sire
And held through his chyualrye
Of all the world the monarchye
And was the first of that honor
which takes name of Emperor
De seculo ferreo, quod in tibiis designatu^ est a tempore Iulu Cesaris vsque
in regnum Caro si magni regis Francorum.
where Rome than would assail
There might no thing contreuayle
But every country must obey
Tho goth the reign of bras aweye
And comen is the world of steel
And stood above upon the whele
As steel is hardest in his kind
Above all other / that men find
Of metalles / such was Rome tho
The myghtyest / and last so
Long time among the Romans
Till they become so vylayns
That the emperor Leo
with Constaunce his son also
The patrimonye / and the richesse
which to Syluester in pure alms
The first Constantinus left
Fro holy church they berefte
But Adryan / which pope was
And saw the mischefe of this cas
Gothe in to France for to plain
And prays the great Charlemayne
For Christ's sake / and soul hele
That he would take the quarele
Of holy church in his defense
And Charles / for the reverence
Of god / the cause has undertake
And with his host the way has take
Over the mountes of Lumbardye
Of Rome / and all the tyranny
with blody sword he overcome
And the city with strenght nome
In such a wise / and there he wrought
That holy church ayene he brought
In to Fraunchyse / and does restore
The popes lust and yaf him more
And thus wha^ he his god has served /
He took as he has well deseruyd
The d^ademe and was corouned
Of Rome and thus was abandoned
Thempyre / which came never again
In to the hand of no Romayne
But a long time it stood stylle
Under the Frenss he kings will
Till that fortune her whele so lad
That afterward the Lu^bardes it had
^^t by the sword but by the suffrau^ce
(...) that tho was king of France
(...) Carle Caluus cleped was
(...) he resygned in this cas
(...) of Rome unto Lowys
(...) which a lumbarde is
(...) last in to the year
(...) and of Berenger
(...) ^m temporibus ad simi (...) ^^pso et diuiso, quod (...) cum imperi^

(...) upon discencion
(...) and in division
(...) them self that were great
(...) they lost the beyete
(...) hip and of worlds pees
(...) proverb netheles
(...) ^yne full seldom is that welthe
(...) his own astate in health
(...) that was in the lumbardes seen
(...) common strife was them bitwene
(...) couetyse / and thorugh envy
That every man drough his party
which might led any route
within bourgh and eke without
The common right has no fellow
So that the governance of law
was lost: and for necessyte
Of that they stood in such degree
All only through diuysyon
Them needs in conclusion
Of strange lands help beside
And thus for they them self diuyde
And standen out of rewle uneven
Of Almayne princes seven
They chosen in this condicyon
That upon their electyon
Thempyre of Rome should stand
And thus they left it out of hand
For lack of grace / and it forsook
That Almayns upon them took
And to confermen their astate
Of that they stoden in debate
They token the possession
After the composicion
Among them self / and there upon
They made an Emperor anon
whose name (the Cronycle tells)
was Oaths / and so forth it dwells
Fro thylke day yet unto this
Thempyre of Rome has be and is
To thalmayns / and in this wise
As to fore ye have herd deuyse
How Daniel the sweuen expouneth
Of that image / on whom he fou^deth
The world / which afterward should fall
Comen is the last token of all
Upon the fete of earth and stele
So stant the world now every dele
Departed which began right tho
when Rome was divided so
And that is for to rewe sore
For alwey sith more and more
The world empeyreth every day
whereof the soth show may
At Rome first if we begin
The wall and all the city within
Stante in ruin / and in decays
The field is where was the palace
The town is wast / and over that
If we behold thylke astate
which whylome was of the Romans
Of knyghthod / and of cytizens
To peyse now with that beforne
The chafe is take from the corn /
And so to speak of Romes might
Uneaths stante there ought vpryght
Of worship / or of worlds good
As it before time stood
And why the worship is away
If that a man the sothe shall say
The cause has been deuysyon
which mother of confusyon
Is / where she comes ouerall
Naught only of the temporal
But of the spiritual also
The deed proves it is so
And has do many a day er this
Through venim / which that meddled is
In holy church of erthely thing
For Christ him self makes knowlegig
That no man may to geder serve
God and the world / but if he swerue
Froward that one / and stand unstable
And Christ's word may not be fable
The thing so open is at the eye
It needs naught to specify
Or speak ought more in this matere
But in this wise a man may lere
How that the world is gone about
The which well nygh is wered our
After the form of that figure
which Daniel in his scripture
Expowned / as to fore is told
Of bras / of silver / and of gold
The world is passed / and agone
And now upon his old tone
It stant of brutel earth and stele
The which acorden never a dele
So mote it needs swerue aside
As thing / the which men seen diuyde
Hic dicit, secundum apostolum, quod nos sumus, in quos fines seculi deuenerunt.
The apostel writes unto us all
And says / that upon us is fall
Thend of the world / so may we know
This image is nyghe overthrow
By which this world was sygnified
That whylome was so magnified
And now is old / and feeble / and vile
Full of mischyefe / and of peril
And stante divided eke also
Like to the fete / that were so
As I told of the statue above
And thus men seyne for lack of love
where as the land divided is
It more algate fare amys.
And now to look on every side
A man may se the world divide
The werres been so general
Among the Christen ouerall
That every man now seeks wreche
And yet these clerks alday preche
And seyne / good deeds may none be
which stante naught upon charity
I not how charity should stand
where dedely werre is taken on hand
But all this woe is cause of man
The which that wit and rese^ can
And that in token and in witness
That ilke image bare likeness
Of man / and of none other beeste
For first unto the man's heste
was every creature ordained
But afterward it was restreyned
when that he fell / they fellen eke
when he wex seek / they wexen seek
For as the man has passion /
Of sekenes in comparison
So suffren other creatures
Lo first the heavenly fygures
Hic scribit, quod ex diuisionis passione singu^^ creati detrimentum
corruptibise pat^int^r.
The son and moan eclypsen both
And been with man's sin wroth
The purest air for sin alofte /
Has been and is corrupted full often
Right now the high wyndes blow
And anon after they ben low
Now cloudy / and now clear it is
So may it prouen well by this
A man's sin is for to hate
which makes the welken to debate
And for to se the properte
Of every thing in his degree
Benethe forth among us here
All stante a like in this matere
The sea now ebbeth / and now it flows
The lo^d now welkith / and now it grows
Now ben the trees with leaves grene
Now they be bare and no thing seen
Now be there lusty somer flowers
Now be there stormy winter shoures
Now be the days / now be the nyghtes
So ^^ant there no thing all vpryghtes
Now it is light now it is derke
And thus stant all the worlds work
After the disposicion
Of man and his condition
For thy Gregory in his moral
Sey^h that a man in special
The ^^^e world is properly
And that he proves redily
For man of soul reasonable
(...) ^ngell resemblable
(...) to best he has feeling
(...) to tres he has growing

(...) the sea the fyrmament

(...) ^ue c^m^se^ionis materia (...) m^ mortasis existat.
The which for his complexion
(...) made upon division
Of cold / hot / moist / and dry
He mo^e by verray kind dye
For the contrary of his estate
Stant evermore in such debate
Till that a part he overcome
There may no fynall peace be nome
But otherwise if a man were
Made all togeder of one matere
without interrupcion
There should no corrupcion
Engendre upon that unity
But for there is diversity
within him self / he may not last
But in a man yet over this
Full great division there is
Through which that he is ever in strife
while that him last any life
Quod homo ex corporis of anime condicione diuisus, sicut saluacionis, ita
damnacionis aptitudinem ingreditur.
The body / and the soul also
Among them ben divided so
That what thing that the body hates
The soul loves and debateth
But netheles full often is seen
Of werre / which is them between
The feeble has won the victory
And who so draws in to memory
Quasiter Adil a statu innoce^tie diuisus a paradiso voluptatis in terram
suboris peccator proiectus est.
what has befalle of old and new
He may that werre sore rewe
which first bigan in paradys
For there was proved / what it is
And what disese there it wrought
For thilke werre tho forth brought
The vice of all dedly sin
Through which division came in
Quasiter popusi per vniuersum orbem a cultura dei diuisi, Noe cum sua sequesa
dum taxat exceptis, dilunio interieru^t.
Among the men in earth here
And was the cause and the mattere
why god the great flodes send
Of all the world and made an end
But Noe / with his felauship
which only weren saufe by ship
And over that through sin it come
That Nembroth such price nome
Quasiter in edificatione Turris Babisonis, quam in dei contemptum Nembroth
erexit singna prius hebraica in varias singuas raefica vindicta diuidebatur.
when the toure Babylon on hight
Let make, as he that would fight
Ayene the high gods might
whereof divided anon right
was the language in such intent
There wyste none what other meant
So that they might naught proceed
And thus it stant of every deed
where sin takes the case on bond
It may upright not long stand
For sin of her condition
Is mother of division.
Quasiter mu^dus / quin in statu diuisionis quasi cetidianus presenti re^pore
vexatur fsagessis a lapide supu^mente / id est a diuina potencia vsque ad
resolucionem omnis carnis subito conteretur.
And token wha^ the world shall fail
For so says Christ without fail
That nygh upon the worlds end
Peace and accord away shall wend
And all charity shall cease
Among the men, and hate encreasse
And when these tokens ben befall
All suddenly the stone shall fall
As Daniell it has beknowe
which all this world shall overthrow
And every man shall than arise
To joy or else to iuise
where that he shall for ever dwell
Or straight to heaven / or straight to hell.
In heaven is peace and all accord
But hell is full of such discord
That there may be no love day
For thy good is while a man may
Echone to set peace with other
And louen as his own brother
So may be win worlds welthe
And afterward his soul health.
Hic narrat exemplum de concordia et vnitate inter homines prouocanda? Et dicit
qualu^, quidam Arton nuper citharista ex sui cantus cithare que consona
mesodiam tante virtutis extiterat, vt ipse no solum virum cum viro / sed etiam
feonem cum cerua / lupum cum hagno / canem cu^ sepore (ipsum audientes)
vnanimiter absque vlla discordia ad iniucem pacificauit.
But would god that now were one
An other such as Arione
which had an harp of such temprure
And thereto of so good measure
He song, that he the beasts wild
Made of his note tame and mylde
The hynde in peace with the lion
The wolf in peace with the motton
The hare in peace stood with the hou^de.
And every man upon this ground
which Arion that time herd
As well the lord as the shepeherde
He brought them all in good accord
So that the common with the lord
And lord with the common also
He set in love both two
And put aweye melancolye.
That was a lustye melodye
when every man with other lough
And if there were such one now
which could harp as he did.
He might avail in many a stead
To make peace, where now is hate
For when men thynken to debate
I not what other thing is good
But where that wisdom waxes wood
And reason tourneth in to rage
So that measure upon outrage
Has set this world, it is to dread
For that brings in the common deed
which stant at every man's door
But when the sharpnes of the spore
The horse side smyteth to sore
It greueth often. And now no more
As for to speak of this matter
which none, but only god may stere
So were it good at this ride
That every man upon his side
Besought / and prayed for the peace
which is the cause of all incresse
Of worship, and of worlds welthe
Of hertes rest / and souls health
without peace stand nothing good.
For the to Christ / which shed his blood
For peace byseketh all men
Amen Amen Amen, Amen.

which will no reason understand
For love is blind, and may not se
For thy may no certeynte
Besette upon his judgment
But as the whele about went
He yeueth his graces undeserved
And fro that man / which has him served
Full often he takes awey his fees
As he that plays at the dies
And thereupon what shall befall
He not, till that the chance fall
where he shall lose or he shall win
And thus full often men begin
That if they wysten what it meant
They would change all their intent.
Hic quasi in psona alioril / quos amor assigat / fingens se auctor esse,
amantem / varias little passiones varus huius sibri-distinctionibus per singula
scribere proponit.
And for to preue it is so
I am my self one of tho
which to this schole am vnderfonge
For it is sothe go not long
As for to speak of this matere
I may you tell / if you woll here
A wonder hap, which me befelle
That was to me both hard and fell
Touching of love and his fortune
The which me lyketh to commune
And pleynly for to tell it out
To them that lovers be about
Fro point to point I woll declare
And written of my woeful care
My woeful day my woeful chance
That men mow take remembrance
Of that they shall here after read
For in good feythe this would I read
That every man ensample take
Of wisdom / which is him betake
And that he wot of good appryse
To teache it forth / for such emprise
Is for to preyse: and therefore I
will write and show all openly
How love and I togedre met
whereof the world ensample fette
May after this / when I am go
Of thylke vnsely iolyfe woe
whose reule stant out of the wey
Now glad / and now gladness awey
And yet it may not be withstonde
For ought that men may understand
Non ego Sampsonis uires, non Herculis arma
Vinco, sum sed ut hij uictus amore pari,
Vt discant alij docet experiencia facti,
Rebus in ambiguis quae s^^t habenda uia,
Deuius ordo ducit temtata pericla sequentem,
Insiruit a tergo me simul ille cadat.
Me quibus ergo Venus casus laqueauit ama^te^,
Orbis in exemplum scribere tendo palam.
Hic declarat materia dicens qualiter Cupido quod dignito iaculo, sui cordis
memoriam graui vscere perforauit, quod Venus percipiens ipsum vt dicit, quasi
in mortis articuso spasmatum, ad confitendu se Genio sacerdoti super amoris cau
sa sic seminiuum speciasiter co^mendauit.
Upon the point that is befalle
Of love / in which that I am fall
I think tell my matere
Now harken who that woll it here
Of my fortune bow that it ferde
This endyrday / as I forth ferde
To walk / as I you tell may
And that was in the month of May
when every bryd has chose his make
And thinks his myrthes for to take
Of love / that he has acheued
But so was I nothing releued
For I was forther fro my love
Than earth is from the heaven above
And for to speak of any speed
So wyste I me none other read
But as it were a man forsake
Unto the wood my way began take
Not for to sing with the birds
For when I was the wood amyddes
I fond a soote grene plain
And there I began my woe complain
wysshynge and weeping all mine one
For other myrthes made I none
So hard me was that ylke throw
That often sythes overthrow
To ground I was without brethe
And ever I wysshed after death
when I out of my pain awoke
And cast up many a pytous look
Unto the heaven / and said thus
O thou Cupyde / O thou Venus
Thou god of love / and thou goddess
where is pity? where is meekness?
Now does me plainly live or dye
For certes such amalydye
As I now have / and long have had
It might make a wise man mad
If that it should long endure
O venus queen of loves cure
Thou life / thou lust / thou man's hele
Behold my cause / and my quarele
And give me some part of thy grace
So that I may find in this place
If thou be gracious or none
And with that word I saw anon
The king of love / and queen both
But he that king with eyes wroth
His chere a weywarde fro me cast
And forth he passed at the last
But netheles or he forth went
A fyry dart me thought he sent
And threw it through mine heart rote
In him fond I none other bote
For longer list him note to dwell
But she / which is the source and well
Of well and woe / that shall betyde
To them that louen at that tide
Abode, but for to tellen here,
She cast on me no goodly chere;
Thus netheles to me she said
what art thou son: and I abrayde
Right as a man does out of sleep
And thereof she took right good keep
And bad me nothing be adradde
But for all that I was not glad
For I ne saw no cause why
And often she asked what was I
I said a caytife that lies here
what would ye my lady dear?
Shall I be hoole / or else dye?
She said / tell me thy maladye
what is thy sore / of which thou pleinest
^e hyde it naught / for if thou feynest
I can do the no medicyne
Madame I am a man of thine
(...) in thy court have long served
^^d ask that I have deserved
(...) well after my long woe.
And she began to loure tho
And said there be many of you
^^tours: and so may be that thou
(...) right such one / and by feyntise
^^^ste that thou haste me do service
and netheles she wyste well
(...) word stood on an other whele
without any feyterye
But ^gate of my maladye
The had me tell and say her truth
Madame if ye would have routhe
^uod I, then would I tell you
(...) forth (quod she) and tell me how
Show me thy sekenes every dele
Madame that can I do well
Be so my life thereto wol last
with that her look on me she cast
And said in aunter if thou live
^y will is first / that thou be shryue
And netheles how that it is
I wot my self / but for all this
Unto my priest / which comes anon
I woll thou tell it one and one
Both of thy thought / and al thy work
O Genius mine own clerk
Come forth / and here this man's shryft
(Quod Venus tho) and I vplyfte
My head with that / and began behold
The self priest / which as she would
was ready there / and set him down
To here my confession
Confessus Genio si sit medicina salutis
Experiar morbis, quos tulit ipsa Venus.
Lesa quidem ferro medicantur membra saluti,
Raro tamen medicum vulnus amoris habet.
Hic dicit qualiter Genio pro co^fessore sedenti prouolutus amans ad
confitendum se flexis ge nibus incuruatur, supplica^s tamen / vt ad fui sensus
informationem confessor iffe in dicendis opponere sibi benignus dignaretur.
This worthy priest / this holy man
To me spekend thus began
And said: Benedicite
My son of the felycite
Of love / and eke of all the woe
Thou shall be shryue of both two
what thou er this for loves sake
Haste felt / let nothing be forsake
Tell pleynly / as it is befalle
And with that word I began down fall
On knees with good devotion
And with full great contrycion
I said than: Dominus
Mine holy fader Genius
So as thou haste experyence
Of love / for whose reverence
Thou shall me shryue at this time
I pray the let me not mystyme
My shryfte / for I am destourbed
In all mine heart / and so conturbed
That I ne may my wits get
So shall I much thing foryete.
But if thou wolte my sin oppose
Fro point to point / than I suppose
There shall nothing be left behind
But now my wits be so blind
That I ne can my self teache.
Tho he began anon to preche
And with his words debonayre
He said to me soft and fair
In this place I am set here
Thy shryfte to oppose and here
By Venus the Goddess above
whose priest I am touch end of love
Sermo Genii sacerdotis super confessione ad amantem.
But netheles for certain skyll
I mote algate / and needs will
Naught only make my spekynges
Of love / but of other things
That touchen to the cause of vice
For that belongs to thoffyce
Of prestes / whose order that I bear
So that I wol nothing forbere
That I the vices one and one
Ne shall the show euerychone
whereof thou might take euydence
To rewle with thy conscience
But of conclusion fynall
Conclude I would in special
For love / whose servant I am
And why the cause is that I am
So think I to do both two
First that mine order longs to
The vices for to tell on rewe
But next above all other show
Of love I wol the propretes
How that they stand by degrees
After the disposicion
Of Venus / whose condition
I must follow as I am hold
For I with love am all withholde
So that the less I am to wit
Though I now con but a lyte
Of other things / that been wise
I am not taught in such a wise
For it is naught my common use
To speak of vices / and vertuse
But all of love / and of his lore
For Venus books of no more
Me techen nether text ne gloss
But for as much as I suppose
It sit a priest to be well thewde
And shame it is / if he be lewd
Of my presthode after the form
I wol thy shryfte so inform
That at the last thou shalt here
The vices / and to thy matere
Of love I shall them so remeue
That thou shall know what they meue
For what a man shall axe or seyne
Touchend of shryfte / it mote be pleyne
It needs naught to make it queynt
For troth his words wol not peinte
That I wol axe of the for thy
My son it shall be so pleynly
That thou shall know and understand
The points of shrift how that they sto^d
Visus et auditus fragiles sunt ostia mentis,
Quae uitiosa manus claudere nulla potest.
Est ibi larga uia, graditur qua cordis ad ^ntru^,
Hostis et ingrediens fossa talenta rapit.
Haec mibi confessor Genius primordia profert,
Dum sit in extremis uita remorsa malis.
Nunc tamen ut Poterit faeminina loquela fateri,
Verba per os timide conscia mentis agam.
Hic confessio amantis, cui de duobus precipue quinque sensibus, hoc est de
visu et auditu confessor pre ceteris opponit.
Between the life and death I herd
This prestes tale er I answerde
And than I prayed him for to say
His will: and I it would obey
After the form of his apprise
Tho spoke he to me in such wise
And bad me that I should me shryue
As touchende of my wits five
And shape / that they were amended
Of that I had them my spended
For tho be properly the gates
Through which / as to the heart algates
Comes all thing unto the feyre
which may the man's soul empeyre
And now is this matter brought in
My son I think first begin
To wit / how that thyn eye has sto^de
The which is (as I understand)
The most princypall of all
Through whom that peril may befalle
And for to speak in loves kind
Full many such a man may find
which ever cast about their eye
To look / if that they might aspye
Full often thing / which them ne touches
But only that their hertes soucheth
In byndringe of a another wight
And thus full many a worthy knight
And many a lusty lady both
Has be full often sithe wroth
So that an eye is as a thief
To love and does full great meschiefe
And also for his own part
Full often thilke fiery dart
Of love which that ever brenneth
Through him in to the heart renneth
And thus a man's eye first
Him self greueth alder werst
And many a time that he knows
Unto his own harm it grows
My sone harken now for thy
A tale to be ware thereby
Thyn eye for to keep and ward
So that it pass naught his ward
(...) s^^t Confessor exemplum de visu ab (...), dice^s, qualiter Acteon Cad

^^^de tells in his book
^^^ample touchend of misloke
And says how whilome there was one
A worthy lord which Acteon
(...) ^hete and he was Cosyn nyghe
(...) him that Thebes first on high
By set which king Cadme hight
This Acteon / as he well might
A (...) all other cast his chere
And used it from year to year
with hounds and with great bornes
Among the wodes / and the thorns
To make his hunting / and his chase
where him best thought in every place
To find game in his way
There rode he for to hunte and play
So him befelle upon a ride
On his hunting as he can ride
In a foreste a lone he was
He saw upon the grene gras
The fair flowers fresshe spring
He herd among the leaves sing
The throstel / with the nyghtyngale
Thus (er he wyste) in to a dale
He came / where was a little pleyne
All round about / well beseyne
with busshes grene / and cedres bye
And there within he cast his eye
A mids the plain he saw a well
So fair there might no man tell
In which Diana naked stood
To bathe and play her in the flode
with many nymphs / which her serves
But he his eye awey ne swerueth
From her / which was naked all
And she was wonder wroth with all
And him / as she which was goddess
Fors hope anon / and the likeness
She made him taken of an heart
which was tofore his hou^des sterte
That rone besily about
with many an horn / and many a route
That maden much noise and cry
And at the last vnhappilye
This heart his own hounds slough
And him for vengeance all to drough
Lo now my sone what it is
A man to cast his eye amiss
which Acteon has dear abought
Beware for thy / and do it naught
For often / who that head took
Better is to wynke than to look
And for to prouen it is so
Ouide the Poet also
A tale (which to this matere
Acordeth) says / as thou shall here
Hic ponit aliud exe^pfu^ de eode^, vbi dicit, quod quid a^ princeps nomine
Forcus, tres progenuit filias Gorgones a vulgo nuncupatas, que vno partu
exorte, deformitate^ monstroru^ serpentina^ obtinuerunt, quibus cu^ in etatem
peruenerant, talis destinata fuerit natura, quod quicu^que in eas aspiceret, in
lapide^ fubito mutabatur, et sic qua^plures incaute respicientes, visis illis
perierunt, sed Perseus miles clipeo Palladis / gladioque Mercurij munitus, eas
extra monte^ Atla^tis cohabita^tes aio audaci absque sui periculo interfecit
In Methamor. it tells thus
How that a lord / which Forcus
was hot / had daughters three
But upon their natiuite
Such was the constellacion
That out of man's nation
Fro kind they be so myswent
That to the lykenes of a serpent
They were both / and that one
Of them was cleped Stellybone
That other suster Suryale
The third (as tells in the tale)
Medusa hight / and netheles
Of common name Gorgones
(In every country there about
As monstres / which that men doubt)
Men clepen them / and but one eye
Among them three in purpartie
They had / of which they might se
Now has it this / now has it she
After that cause and need it ladde
By throws each of them it had
A wonder thing yet more amys
There was / whereof I tell all this
what man on them his chere cast
And them beheld / he was als fast
Out of man in to a stone
Forshape / and thus full many one
Deceived were / of that they would
Misloke / where they ne should
But Perseus / that worthy knight
whom Pallas / of her great might
Halpe / and took him a shield thereto
And eke the god Mercury also
Lent him a sword: he as it fylle
Beyond Athlans the high hylle
These mo^stres sought / and there he fond
Diverse men of thylke land
Through sight of them mistorned were
Standinge as stones here and there
But he (which wisdom and prowess
Has of the god and the godesse)
The shield of Pallas began embrace
with which he covers saufe his face
And Mercurius sword out he drough
And so he bare him / that he slough
These dreadful monstres all three
Confessor.
Lo now my son auyse the
That thou thy sight not misuse
Cast not thin eye upon Meduse
That thou be turned in to stone
For so wise man was never none
But if he woll his eye keep
And take of foul delight no keep
That he with lust nis often nome
Through strength of love / and overcome
Of mislokynge how it has ferde
As I have told / now have thou herd
My good son take good head
And over this I the read
That thou beware of thine herynge
which to the heart the tydinge
Of many a vanite has brought
To tarry with a manes thought
And netheles good is to here
Such thing / whereof a man may lere
That to virtue is accordaunt
And toward all the remenaunt
Good is to torn his ere fro
For else but a man do so
Him may full often mysbefalle
I read ensample among all
whereof to keep well an ear
It ought put a man in fear
Hic confessor exemplu^ narrat / vt non ab auris exauditione fatua animus
deceptus inuol^atur. Et dicit qualiter ille serpens, qui aspis vocatur, quenda^
preciosissimu^ lapidem nomine ca^ bunculu^, in sue frontis medio geftans,
co^tra verba incantantis aurem vna^ terre affige^do prema, and alia^ sue caude
stimulo firmissime obturat.
A serpent / which that aspidis
Is cleped / of his kind has this
That he the stone noblest of all
The which that men Carbu^cle call
Bears in his heed above on high
For which when that a man by slight
(The stone to win / and him to daunte)
with his carecte him would enchaunte
Anon as he perceyueth that
He leyth down his one ear all plat
Unto the ground / and halt it fast
And eke that the other ear als fast
He stops with his taylle so sore
That he the words / less or more
Of his enchauntement ne hereth
And in this wise him self he skyereth
So that he has the words wayued
And thus his ear is naught deceived
Aliud exemplu^ super eode^ qualiter rex Vlix es cu^ a bello Troiano versus
Greciam nauigio remiaret, et prope issa monstra a maxima, Syrenes micu^ata,
angefica voce canorans ipsum ve^ ^^rum aduersitate nauigare oporteret, omnium
nautarum suorum aures obturari coegit.
In other thing who that records
Like unto this sample acordeth
which in the tale of Troy I find
Syrenes of a wonder kind
Ben monstres / as the books tellen
And in the great see they dwellen
Of body both and of vysage
Like unto women of young age
Up fro the nauyl on high they be
And down benethe (as men may se)
They bear of fysshes the figure
And over this of such nature
They be^ that with so sweet a steven
Like to the melodye of heaven
In women's voice they sing
with notes of so great lykinge
Of such measure / of such musyke
whereof the ships they beswyke
That passen by the costs there
For w^an the shipmen lay an ear
Unto the voice in there aduyce
They wene it be a paradise
which after is to them an hell
For reason may not with them dwell
when they the great lusts here
They can not their ships stere
So ^^syly upon the note
They harken and in such wise assote
That they their right course and weye
For^ete and to their ear obey
And saylen / till it so befalle
That they in to the peril fall
where as the ships ben to draw
And they be with the monstres slawe
But fro this peril netheles
with his wisdom king Vlyxes
Escapes and it over passes
For he to fore the hand compasses
That no man of his company
Has power unto that folly
His care for no lust to cast
For he then stopped als fast
That non of them may here them singe
So when they come forth saylinge
There was such governance on bond
That the monstres have withstonde
And slough of them a great party
Thus was he saufe with his nauye
This wise king through governance
Confessor.
Hereof my son in remembrance
Thou might ensample taken here
As I have told / and what thou here
Be well ware / and give no credence
But if thou se more euydence
For if thou would take keep
And wisely couthest ward and keep
Thine eye and ear / as I have spoke
Than had thou the gates stoke
Fro such folly / as comes to win
Thyn hertes wit / which is within
whereof that now thy love excedeth
Measure / and many a pain bredeth
But if thou couthest set in rewle
Tho two / the three were ethe to rewle
For thy as of thy wits five
I woll as now no more shryue
But only of these ylke two
Tell me therefore if it be so
Have thou thine eye ought mystbrowe
Amans.
My fader ye / I am beknowe
I have them cast upon Meduse
Thereof I may me naught excuse
Mine heart is grown in to stone
So that my lady there upon
Has such a printe of love grave
That I can naught my self save
Opponit Confessor
what saiste thou son / as of thin ere
My fader I am gylty there
For when I my lady here
My wit with that has lost his stere
I do naught as Vlyxes deed
But fall anon upon the stead
where as I se my lady stand
And there I do you understand
I am to pulled in my thought
So that of reason leueth naught
whereof that I may me defend.
Confessor.
My good son god the amend
For as me thinks by thy speech
Thy wits be right far to seche
As of thyn ear / and of thyn eye
I woll no more specifye
But I woll asken over this
Of other thing how that it is
Celsior est aquilaque leone forcior ille,
Quem tumor elati cordis ad alta mouer.
Sunt species quinque, quibus est superbia ductrix
Clamat et in multis mundus adheret eis.
Laruando faciem ficto pallore subornat.
Fraudibus hypocrisis mellea uerba suis.
Sicque pios animos quam saepe ruit muliebres
Ex humili uerbo sublatitante dolo.

My son / as I shall the inform
There ben yet of a another form
Of dedly vices seven applied
whereof the heart is often plied
To thing / which after shall him grieve
The first of them thou shall believe
Is pry^^ (...) ^^che is principal
And ha^^ with him in special
Mynistres five full diverse
Of which as I the shall reherce
The first is said hypocrisye
If thou art of his company
Tell forth my son / and shryne the clean
Amans
I wot not fadre what ye mean /
But this I would you beseech
That ye me by somwey teache
what is to ben an hypocrite
And than if I be for to wit
I woll beknowen / as it is
Confessor
My son / an hypocrite is this
A man which feyneth conscience
As though it were all innocence
without / and is not so within
And does / so for he would win
Of his desire the vein astate
And when he comes anon there at
He shows than / what he was
The corn is turned in to grass
That was a Rose / is than a thorn
And he that was a lamb beforne
Is than a wolf: and thus malice
Under the color of justice
Is had / and as the people tells
These ordres wyten where he dwells
As he that of her counseyll is
And thylke word / which they er this
Forsoken / he draws in ayene
He clotheth riches (as men seyne)
Under the symplest of pouerte
And does to seem of great deserte
Thing / which is little worth within
He seyth in open / phy / to sin
And in secret there is no vice
Of which that he nys a noryce
And ever his chere is sobre and soft
And where he goth he blesses often
whereof the blind world he dretcheth
But yet all only he ne stretches
His rewle upon relygion
But next to that condition
In such as clepe them holy church
It shows eke how he can worche
Among the wide furred hodes
To get them the worlds goods
And them self ben thylke same
That setten most the world in blame
But yet in contrary of their lore
There is nothyn^ they louen more
So that femynge of light they work
The deeds / which are inward derke
And thus this double hypocrisye
with is devout apparancye
A vyser set upon his face.
whereof toward the worlds grace
He seems to be right well thewed
And yet his heart is all besbrewed
But netheles he stant believed
And has his purpos often acheued
Of worship / and of worlds welthe
And takes it / as who says by stelthe
Through couerture of his fallas
And right so in semblable cas
This vice has eke his officers
Among these other seculers
Of great men / for of the small
As for to account he set no tale
But they that passen the common
with such him lyketh to common
And where he says / he woll socoure
The people / there he woll devour
For now a day is many one
which speaks of Peter and of John^
And thinks Judas in his heart
There shall no worlds good astert
His hand: and yet he gives alms
And fasteth often / and hereth mess
with mea culpa which he seyth
Upon his breast full often he leyth
His hand and cast upward his eye
As though Christ's face he seie
So that it seems at sight
As he alone all other might
Rescue with his holy deed
But yet his heart in other stead
Among his beads most devout
Goth in the worlds cause about
How that he might his waryson
E^^rese and in comparison /
(...) ^^at confessor cu^ ama^te super iffa hypo (...) amoris facie

There ben lovers of such a sort
That feynen them an humble port
And all is but hypocrisye
which with deceyte and flaterye
Has many a worthy wife begyled
For when he has his tongue a fyled
with soft speech / and with lesynge
Forthwith his false pitous lokynge
He would make a woman wene
To gone upon the feyre grene
when that she fauleth in the mire
For if he may have his desire
How so falls of the remenaunt
He holte no word of covenant
But or the time that he speed
There is no sleygthe at thylke need
which any loves faytour may
That he ne put it in assay
As him belongs for to done
The color of the reyny Moan
with medicyne upon his face
He set / and than he asks grace
As he / which has sykenes feyned
when his visage is so desteyned
with eye up cast on her he syketh
And many a contynaunce he piketh
To bryngen her in to believe
Of thing / which that he would acheue
whereof he bears the pale hew
And for he would seem true
He makes him sick / when he is heyle
But when he bears lowest seyle
Than is he swyfteste to begyle
The woman / which that ylke while
Set upon him feyth or credence
My son if thou thy conscience
Entamed haste in such a wise
In shryfte thou the might auyse
And tell it me / if it be so
Amans
Mine holy fadre certes no
As for to feyne such sickness
It needs naught: for this witness
I take of god / that my courage
Has been more sick than my visage
And eke this may I well auowe
So low couthe I never bow
To feyne humilyte without
That me ne list better loute
with all the thoughts of mine heart
For that thing shall me never asterte
I speak as to my lady dear
To make her any feyned chere
God wot well there I lie naught
My chere has be^ such as my thought
For in good feithe this leueth well
My will was better a thousand dele
Than any chere that I couthe
But sire if I have in my yougthe
Done other wise in other place
I put me thereof in your grace
For this excusen I ne shall
That I have else over all
To love and to his company
Be pleyne without hypocrisy
But there is one / the which I serve
All though I may no thank deserve
To whom yet never unto this day
I said only ye or nay
But if it so were in my thought
As touchend other say I naught
That I nam somdele for to wit
Of that ye clepe an hypocryte
Confessor.
My son it sit well every wight
To keep his word in troth upright
Toward love in all wise
For who that would him well advise
what has befalle in this mattere
He should naught with feyned chere
Deceive love in no degree
To love is every heart fre
But in deceyte if that thou feyneste
And thereupon thy lust atteyneste
That thou haste won with thy wyle
Though it the like for a while
Thou shall it afterward repent
And for to prouen mine entente
I find ensample in a Cronyque
Of them that love so biswyke
Quod hypocrisia sit in amore periculosa narrat exemplum, qualiter sub regno
Tiberij imperatoris quidam miles nomine Mundus, qui Romanorum dux militie tunc
prefuit, dominam Paulinam pulcher rimam castitatis que famosissunam mediantibus
duobus falsis presbiteris in Templo Ifys domini sui se esse fingens sub ficte
sanctitatis hipocrisi nocturno tempore vitiauit, vn^idem dux in exisiu^,
presbiteri in morte^ ob sui criminis enormitatem damnati extitera^t.
It befelle by old days thus
whylome the emperor Tiberius
The monarche of Rome ladde
There was a worthy Romayn had
A wife, and she Paulina hight
which was to every mannis sight
Of all the city the fayreste
And as men sayden eke the best
It is and has been ever yet
That so strong is no man's wit
which through beauty ne may be draw
To love, and stand under the law
Of thylke bore freile kind
which makes the hertes eyes blind
where no reason may be communed
And in this wise stood fortuned
This tale, of which I woll mean
This wife / which in her lusts grene
was fair and fresshe and tender of age
She may not let the courage
Of him, that wol on her assote
There was a duke, and he was hot
Mundus, which had in his bayllye
To lead the chaualrye
Of Rome: and was a worthy knight
But yet he was naught of such might
The strength of love to withstonde
That he ne was so brought to hand
That maulgre whether he wol or no
This young wife he loves so
That he has put all his assay
To win thing / which he ne may
Get of her grant in no manner
By yefte of gold / ne by prayer
And when he saw, that by no mede
Toward her love he might speed
By sleyght feyned than he wrought
And thereupon he him bethought
How that there was in the city
A temple of such authority
To which, with great devotion
The noble women of the town
Most commonly a pilgremage
Gone for to pray thylke image
which the goddess of chyldynge is
And cleped was by name Isys
And in her temple than were
(To rewle and to mynistre there
After the law / which was tho)
Abouen all other prestes two
This duke, which thought his love get
Upon a day them two to mete
Has bid: and they come at his heste
where they had a rich feste
And after mete in preuy place
This lord, which would his thank purchase
To each of the^ yafe tha^ a gift
And spoke so by way of shryfte
He drough them in to his couyne
To help and shape how Paulyne
After his lust deceive might
And they their trouthes both plyght
That they by night her should win
Into the temple, and be therinne
Shall have of her all his intent
And thus accorded forth they went
Now list through which hipocrysie
Ordained was the trecherye
whereof this lady was deceived
These prestes hadden well conceived
That she was of great holiness
And with a counterfeyt symplesse
which hyd was in a falls courage
Feyned an heavenly message
They come, and said unto her thus
Paulyne, the God Anubus
Has sent us both present here
And says, he wol to the appear
By nyghtes time him self alone
For love he has to thy person
And thereupon he has us bid
That we in Isys Temple a stead
Honestly for the purueye
where thou by night as we the seye
Of him shall take a visyon
For upon thy condicyon
The which is chaste and full of feythe
Such price (as he us told) he leyth
That he woll stand of thin accord
And for to bear hereof record
He send us hyder both two
Glad was her innocence tho
Of such words / as she herd
with humble chere, and thus answerde
And said, that the gods will
She was all ready to fulfill
That by her housbondes leave
She would in Isys Temple at eve
Upon her gods grace abide
To seruen him the nyghtes tide
The prestes tho gone home again
And she goth to her sovereign
Of gods will / and as it was
She told him all the plain cas
whereof he was deceived cke
And badde, that she her should meke
All hole unto the gods heste
And thus she / which was all honest
To godwarde, after her intent
At night unto the temple went
where that the false prestes were
And they receyuen her there
with such a token of holiness
As though they seen a goddess
And all within in preuy place
A soft bed of large space
They had made, and encorteyned
where she was afterward engyned
But she, which all honor supposes
The false prestes than opposes
And axeth by what obseruaunce
She might most / to the plesaunce
Of god / that nyghtes reule keep
And they her bydden for to sleep
Lyggend upon the bed a lofte
For so they sayden / still and soft
God Anubus her would awake
The counseyll in this wise take
The prestes fro this lady gone
And she that wyste of gyle none
In the manner as it was said
To sleep upon the bed, is leyde
In hope that she should acheue
Thing, which stood than upon believe
Fulfilled of all holiness
But she has failed as I guess
For in a closet fast by
The duke was hyd so privily
That she him might not perceive
And he that thought to deceive
Has such array upon nome
That when he would unto her come
It should semen at her eye
As though she verily se^e
God Anubus / and in such wise
This hypocryte / of his queyntyse
Awayteth ever till she slept
And than out of his place he crept
So still, that she nothing herd
And to the bed stalkynge he ferde
And suddenly, er she it wyste
Beclypt in arms he her kyste
whereof in womannyss he dread
She woke, and nyste what to read
But he / with soft words mylde
Comfort her / and says / with child
He would her make in such a kind
That all the world shall have in mind
The worship of that ylke son
For he shall with the gods wone
And ben him self a god also
with such words, and with mo
The which he fayneth in his speech
This ladies wit was all to seche
As she, which all troth weneth
But he, that all untruth meneth
with blind tales so her ladde
That all his will of her he had
And when him thought it was enough
Again the day he him withdrough
So pryuely, that she ne wyste
where he become, but as him list
Out of the temple he goth his way
And she began to bydde and pray
Upon the bare ground knelende
And after that made her offrende
And to the prestes yeftes great
She yafe, and homeward by the street
The duke her met, and said thus
The mighty god, which Anubus
Is hot, he save the Paulyne
For thou art of his disciplyne
So holy, that no man's might
May do, that he has do to night
Of thing, which thou have ever eschued
But I his grace have so pursued
That I was made his leutenaunt
For thy by way of covenant
From this day forth I am all thyn
And if the like to be mine
That stand upon thyn one will
She herd this tale, and bare it stylle
And home she went as it befyll
Into her chamber, and there she fill
Upon her bed to weep and cry
And said, O derke hypocrisy
Through whose dissimulation
Of false imagynation
I am thus wyckedly deceived
But that I have it apperceyued
I thank unto the gods all
For though it ones be befalle
I shall never efte while that I live
And thylke auowe to god I give
And thus wepende she complayneth
Her fair face and all distyneth
with woeful tears her eye
So that upon this agonye
Her husbonde is in come
And saw how she was overcome
with sorrow / and axeth her what her eileth
And she with that her self beweileth
well more than she did before
And said, alas wyfehode is lore
In me / which whylom was honest
I am none other than a beast
Now I defouled am of two
And as she might speak tho
Ashamed with a pytous onde
She told unto her husbonde
The sothe of all the hole tale
And in her speech, dead and pale
She swouneth well nygh to the last
And he her in his arms fast
Vphelde, and often swore his oath
That he with her is nothing wroth
For well he wot she may there naught
But netheles within his thought
His heart stood in a sorry plyte
And said, he would of that despyte
Be avenged, how so ever it fall
And sent unto his friends all
And when they were comen in fere
He told them upon this matere
And asks them, what was to done
And they auysed were soon
And said: It thought them for the best
To set first his wife in rest
And after plain to the king
Upon the matter of this thing
Tho was his woeful wife comforted
By all ways, and disported
Till that she was somedele amended
And thus they a day or two dispended
The third day she goth to plain
with many a worthy citezeine
And he with many a citezeine
when the emperor it herd seyne
And knew the falseheed of the vice
He said he would do Justice
And first he let the prestes take
And for they should it not forsake
He put them in to question
But they of the suggestion
Ne could not a word refuse
But for they would them self excuse
The blame upon the duke they laid
But there ayene the counsel said
That they be naught excused so
For he is one and they be two
And two have more wit than one
So thylke excusement was none
And over that was said them eke
That when men would virtue seek
Men should it in the prestes find
Their order is of so high a kind
That they be diuisers of the wey
Yet thy if any man forswey
Through them, they be not excusable
And thus by law reasonable
Among the wise judges there
And ^^^^tes both damned were
So that the preuy treachery
(...) under false hypocrisy
(...) all openly showed
(...) a man the^ has beshrewed
(...) the prestes weren deed
(...) of thylke horrible deed
(...) ^^^ghten purge, and thylke image
(...) was the pylgremage
(...) out, and also fast
(...) the Tyber they it cast

(...) point such was the divise
(...) duke was otherwise
(...) with love was bestad
(...) was naught so hard ladde

(...) ^ought se the right wey
And o^ this cause he was respited
(...) that the death him was acquitted
(...) ^ll that he was exyled
Y^^ he his love had so begyled
that he shall never come ayene
y^^ h^ that is to troth vnpleyne
He may not faylen of vengeance
And eke to take remembrance
Of that hypocrisy has wrought
On other halue men shulden naught
To lightly leave all that they here
But than should a wyseman stere
The ship, when such wyndes blow
For first though they begin low
At end they be naught meuable
But all to broke mast and cable
So that the ship with sudden blast
(when men lest wene) to ouercast
As now full often a man may se
And of old time how it has be
I find a great experyence
whereof to take an euydence
Good is, and to beware also
Of the peril or him be woo
Hic vsterius ponit exemplum de issa etiam hipocrisia / que inter virum et
virum deciptens periculo sissima consistit / Si narrat qualiter G^eci in
obsidione ciuitatis Troie, cum ipsam vi apprehendere nullatenus potuerut,
fallaci animo cum Troianis pacem vt dicunt pro perpetuo statuebant: et super
hoc quendam equm mire grassionis de ere fabricatum ad sacrifica^dum in tempso
Minerue confingentes.
Of them that been so derke within
At Troy also if we begin
Hypocrisy it has betrayde
For when the greeks had all assayed
And fond that by no battle
Ne by no syege it might avail
The town to win through prowess
This vice feigned of symplesse
Through sleyght of Cale as and of Cryse
It wanne by such a manner wise
An horse of brass they let do forge
Of such entayle, and of such a forge
That in this world was never man
That such an other work began
The crafty werkeman Epius.
It made, and for to tell thus
The greeks that thoughten to begyle
The king of Troy in thylke while
with Antenor, and with Ence
That were both of the city
And of the counsel the wysest
The rychest / and the myghtiest
In prive place so they treat
with fair behestes and yeftes great
Of gold / that they than have engined
To gether / and when they be couined
They feynen for to make peace
And under that never the less
They shopen the destruction
Both of the king, and of the town
And thus the false peace was take
Of them of Greece and undertake
And thereupon they fond awey
where strength might not awey
That sleyght should help than
And of an ynche a large spanne
By color of the peace they made
And tolden how they were glad
Of that they stonden in accord
And for it shall ben of record
Unto the king the greeks sayden
By way of love, and thus they prayden
As they that would his thank deserve
A sacrifyce unto Mynerue
(The peace to keep in good intent)
They must offer, or that they went.
The king counsayled in the case
By Antenor and Eneas
Thereto has youen his assent
So was the plain truth blent
Through counterfete hypocrisy
Of that they shulden sacrifye
The greeks under the holiness
Anon with all business
Their horse of brass let fair dight
which was to seen a wonder sight
For it was trapped of him selue
And had of small wheles twelve
Upon the which men enough
with craft toward the town it drougb
And goth glystrende against the son
Tho was there joy enough begone
For Troy in great devotion
Came also with procession
Against this noble sacrifyce
with great honor, and in this wise
Unto the gates they it brought
But of their enter when they sought
The gates weren all to small
And thereupon was many a tale
But for the worship of Mynerue
To whom they comen for to serve
They of the town which understood
That all this thing was done for good
For peace, whereof that they be glad
The gates that Neptunus made.
A thousand winter there to fore
They have anon to broke and tore
The strong walls down they bet
So that in to the large street
This horse with great solemnite
was brought within the city
And offered with great reverence
which was to Troy an evidence
Of love and peace for euermo.
The greeks token leave tho
with all the hole felaushyppe
And forth they wenten in to ship
And crossen sail, and made hem yare
Anon as though they wolden fare
But when the black winter night
(without moan or sterre light)
Bederked has the water stronde
All privily they gone to land
Full armed out of the nauye
Simon, which was made their epsy
within Troy, as was conspired
when time was a token fyred
And has with that their way holden
And comen right as they wolden
There as the gate was to broke
The purpose was full take and spoke
Er any man may take keep
while that the city was a sleep
They slowen all that was within
And token what they myghten win
Of such good as was suffisaunt
And brenden up the remenaunt
And thus come out the treachery
which under false hypocrisy
was hid, and they that wened peace
Tho myghten find no release
Of thilke sword, which al deuoureth
Full often and thus the sweet soureth
when it is know to the taste
He spylleth many a word in waste
That shall with such a people trete
For when he weneth most beyete
Than is he shape most to lose
And right so if a woman chese
Upon the words, that she hereth
Some man when he most true appears
Than is be forthest fro the troth
But yet full often, and that is routh
They speden, that be most untrue
And louen every day a new
whereof the life is after loathe
And love has cause to be wroth
But what man his lust desires
Of love, and thereupon conspireth
with words feyned to deceive
He shall not fail to receive
His pain, as it is often seen.
Confessor.
For thy my son, as I the mean
It fytte the well to take heed
That thou eschew of thy manhede
H^pocrisie, and his semblaunt
That thou ne naught be deceyuaunt
To make a woman to believe
Thing, which is not in thy believe
(...) such feynt hypocrisy
O^ (...) is all the trecherye
Through which Love is deceived often

Confessor.
Now son keep, that thou have swore

Touchande of pride yet there is
The point second I the behote
which Inobedience is hot.

This vice of inobedience
(Again the reule of conscience)
All that is humble he disaloweth
That he toward his god ne boweth
After the laws of his heste
Not as a man, but as a beast
which gothe upon his lusts wild
So goth this proud vice vnmylde
That he disdayneth all law
He not what is to be felawe
And serve may be not for pride
So is he led on every side
And is that selue / of whom men speak
which woll not bow, or that he break
I not if love might him plye
For else for to iustifye
His heart, I not what might avail
For thy my son of such entayle
If that thyn heart be disposed
Tell out and let it naught be glosed
For if that thou vnbuxome be
To love, I not in what degree
Thou shalt thy good word acheue
My father ye shall well believe
The young whelpe, which is affayted
Has not his master better awayted
To couche / when he says go low
That I anon / as I may know
My lady will me bow more
But other while I grutche sore
Of some things / that she does
whereof that I woll tell soth
For of two points I am bethought
That though I would I might naught
O beye unto my ladies best
But I dare make this behest
Saufe only of that ylke two
I am vnburome of no mo.
Confessor
what ben tho two, tell on quod he
My father this is one, that she
Commands me my mouth to close
And that I should her naught appose
In love, of which I often preche
And plenarly of such a speech
Forbere, and suffer her in peace
But that ne might I netheles
For all this world obey I wys
For when I am there, as she is
Though she my tales might allow
Ayene her will yet mote I bow
To seche, if that I might have grace
But that thing may I not embrace
For ought that I can speak or do
And yet full often I speak so
That she is wroth, and says be stylle
If I that be shall fulfylle
And thereto ben obedyent
Than is my cause fully shent
For specheles may no man speed
So wot I not what is to read
But certes I may naught obey
That I ne mote algates say
Some what, of that I would mean
For ever it is a lyche grene
The great love, which I have
whereof I can not both save
My speech, and this obedience
And thus full often my silence
I break: and is the first point
whereof that I am out of point
In this, and yet it is no pride
Now then upon that other side
To tell my disobeysaunce
Full sore it stant to my greuaunce
And may not synke in to my wit
Full often time she me bytte
To leven her, and chese a new
And says, if I the sothe knew
How far I stand from her grace
I should love in an other place
But thereof woll I disobeye
For also well she might seye
So take the moon, there it sytte
As bring that into my wit
For there was never roted tree
That stood so fast in his degree
That I ne stand more fast
Upon her love / and may not cast
Mine heart awey, all though I would
For god wot though I never should
Seen her with eye after this day
yet stout it so, that I ne may
Her love out of my breast remue
This is a wonder retenue
That maulgre where she woll or none
Mine heart is euermo in one
So that I can none other chese
But whether that I win or lose
I mote her louen till I deye
And thus I break as by that wey
Her bestes, and her commaundynges
But truly in none other things
For thy my father what is more
Touchande unto this ylke lore
I you beseech, after the form
That ye plainly me would inform
So that I may mine heart reule
In loves cause after the rule.
Murmur in aduersis ita concipit ille superbus,
Pena quod ex bina sort purget cum.
O bina fortunae cum spes in amore resistu,
Non sine mentali murmr plangit amans.
Hic loquitur de murmr et planctu / qui super omnes afios inobedientie
secretiores / vt ministri issi beseruiant.
Toward this vice / of which we trete
There ben yet tweye of thilke estrete
Her name is murmr and complaynt,
There can no man her chere peynt.
To set a glad semblaunt therein
For though fortune make them win
yet grutchen they / and if they lose
There is no way for to chese
whereof they might stand appesed
So ben they commonly disesed
There may no wealth ne pouerte
Attempren them to the deserte
Of buxomnes by no wise
For often time they despise
The good fortune as the badde
As they no man's reasone had
Through pride / whereof they ben blind
And right of such a manner kind
There be lovers, that though they have
Of love all that they would crave
yet woll they grutchen by some weye
That they would not to love obey
Upon the troth, as they do should
And if them lacks, that they would
Anon they fall in such a pain
That ever vnbuxomly they pleyne
Upon fortune, and curse and cry
That they woll not her hertes plye
To suffer, till it better fall
For thy if thou among all
Have used this condition
My son, in thy confession
Now tell me plainly, what thou art
Amans.
My father I beknowe a part
So as ye tolden here above
Of murmr / and complaynt of love
That for I se no speed commend
Against fortune complaynende /
I am as who says euermo
And eke full often time also
when so as that I se and here
Of heavy word / or heavy chere
Of my lady, I grutche anon
But words dare I speak none
whereof she might be displesed
But in mine heart I am disesed
with many a murmour / god it wot
Thus drink I in mine own swote
And though I make no semblaunt
Mine heart is all disobeisaunt
And in this wise I me confess
Of that ye clepe vnbuxomnes
Now tell what your counsel is
Confessor.
My son as I the read this
what so befall of other weye
That thou to loves hest obey
As far as thou it might suffice
For often sith in such a wise
Obedience in love avails
where all a man's strength fails
whereof if thou list to wit
In a cronicle as it is writ
A great ensample thou may find
which now comes to my mind
Hic contra amori inobedientes ad co^mendatienem obediencie confessor super
codem exemplu^ ponit, vbi dicit / quod cum quidam regis Secilie silia in sue
inuentucis floribus pulcherrime ex ^uis Nouerce incantationibus in vetulam
turpissimam transformata extitit / Florencius tunc im peratoris Claubii / nepos
/ miles in army s^rennuissimus amorosisque legibus intendens / ex sun
obedientia in pulchritudine^ priftina^ reformami.
There was whylom by days old
A worthy knight, as men told
He was neueu to the emperor
And of his court a courteour
wyfeles he was, Florent he hight
He was a man / that mochel might
Of arms he was desirous
Chyualrous and amorous
And for the fame of worlds speech
Strange auentures would he seche
He rode the marches all about
And fell a time / as he was out
Fortune, which may every threde
To break and knytte of man's speed
Shope, as this knight rode in a pase
That he by strength taken was
And to a castle they him ladde
where that he few friends had
For so it fell that ylke stounde
That he has with a deadly wound
(Fyghtende) his own hand slain
Branchus, which to the Captain
was son and heir, whereof ben wroth
The father and the mother both
That knight Bra^chus was of his bo^de
The worthyest of all his land
And feign they would do vengeance
Upon Florent, but remembrance
That they took of his worthynes
Of knyghthode, and of gentilnes
And how he stood of colynage
To the emperor, made them assuage
And durst not slain him for fear
In great desputeson they were
Among them self, that was the best
There was a lady (the slyest
Of all that men knew tho)
So old) she might uneaths go
And was graundame unto the deed
And she with that began to read
And she said, she would bring him in
That she shall him to death win All only of his own grant
Through strength of very covenant
without blame of any wight
Anon she sent for this knight
And of her son she aleyde
The death / and thus to him she said.
Florent how so thou be to wit
Of Branchus death, men shall respite
As now to take auengement
Be so thou stand in judgment
Upon certain condition
That thou unto a question
which I shall ask, shall answer
And over this thou shall eke swear
That if thou of the sothe fail
There shall none other thing avail
That thou ne shall thy death receive
And for men shall the not deceive
That thou thereof myghtest be^ aduysed
Thou shall have day and time assysed
And leave, safely for to wend
Be so that at thy days end
Thou come again with thyn auyse
This knight, which worthi was and wise
This lady prays, that he may wit
And have it under seals writ
what questyon it should be
For which be shall in that degree
Stand of his life in ieopardye
with that she feynethe company
And says Florent, on love it hongeth
All that to mine asking longs
what all women most desire
This woll I ask, and in thempyre
where thou haste most knowlegynge
Take counseyle of this asking.
Florent this thing has undertake
The time was set, and day take
Under his seal he wrote his oath
In such a wise, and forth be gothe
Home to his emes court again
To whom his adventure plain
He told, of that is him befalle
And upon that they were all
The wysest of the land assent
But netheles of one assent
They might not accord plat
One said this, an other that
After the disposition
Of natural complexion
To some woman it is plesaunce
That to another is greuaunce
But such a thing in special
which to them all in general
Is most plesaunte, and most desired
Above all other / and most conspired
Such one can they not find
By constellation, ne by kind
And thus Florent with out cure
Must stand upon his adventure
And is all shape unto the lyere
And as in defaulte of his answer
This knight has leauer for to dye
Than break his troth and for to lie
In place where he was swore
And shapeth him gone ayene therefore.
when time come he took his leave
That longer would he not believe
And prays his eme he be not wroth
For that is a point of his oath
He says, that no man shall him wreke
Though afterward men here speak
That he perauenture dye
And thus he went forth his weye
Alone / as a knight auenturous
And in his thought was curyous
To wit, what was best to do
And as he rode alone so
And came nygh there he would be
In a forest there under a tree
He saw where satte a creature
A lothly womanniss he figure
That for to speak of flesh and bone
So foul yet saw he never none
This knight beheld her redily
And as he would have passed by
She cleped him, and bad him abide
And he his bors hedde aside
Tho turned, and to her he rode
And there he houed, and abode
To wit what she would mean
And she began him to bemene
And said: Florent by thy name
Thou haste on hand such a game
That if thou be not better auysed
Thy death shapen is, and devised
That all the world ne may the save
But if that thou my counseyll have
Florent when he this tale herd
Unto this old wight answerde
And of her counsel he her prayde
And she ayene to him thus said
Florent if I for the so shape
That thou through me thy death escape
And take worship of thy deed
what shall I have to my mede?
what thing (quod he) that thou would axe
I bid never a better tax
Quod she, but first or thou be spedde
Thou shall me leave such a wedde
That I woll have thy troth on hand
That thou shall be mine husbonde
Nay (said Florent) that may not be
Ride than forth thy wey, quod she
And if thou go forth without read
Thou shall be sykerly dead
Florent behyght her good enough
Of land, of rent, of park, of plough
But all that counts she at naught
Tho fell this knight in much thought
Now goth he forth, now comes ayene
He wot not what is best to seyne
And thought as he rode to and fro
That chose he mote one of the two
Or for to take her to his wife
Or else for to lose his life
And than he cast his advantage
That she was of so great an age
That she may live but a while
And thought to put her in an I Will
where that no man her should know
Till she with death were overthrow
And thus this young lusty knight
Unto this old lothely wight
Tho said: If that none other chance
May make my delyueraunce
But only thylke same speech
which as thou seist thou shall me teache
Have here min ho^de, I shall the wedde
And thus his troth he leyth to wedde
with that she frounceth up the browe
This covenant woll I allow
She says, if any other thing
But that thou haste of my teaching
Fro death thy body may respyte
I woll the of thy, troth acquit
And else by none other weye
Now harken me what I shall seye
when thou art come into the place
where now they maken great manace
And upon thy coming abide
They woll anon the same tide
Oppose the of thine answer
I wot thou wolt no thing forbere
Of that thou weneste be thy best
And if thou myghteste so find rest
well is, for than is there no more
And else this shall be my lore
That thou shall say upon this molde
That all women leuest would
Be sovereign of man's love
For what woman is so above
She has as who says, all her will
And else may she naught fulfylle
what thing were her leuest have
with this answer thou shall save
Thy self, and other wise naught
And when thou have thy end wrought
Come here ayene thou shall me find
And let nothing out of thy mind.
He goth him forth with heavy chere
As he that not in what manner
He may this worlds joy atteyne
For if he dye, he has a pain
And if he live, he mote him bind
To such one, which of all kind.
Of women is the vnsemlyeste
Thus wot be not, what is the best
But be him lyefe, or be him loath
Unto the castle forth he goth
His full answer for to give
Or for to dye, or for to live
Forth with his counsel came the lord
The things stoden of record
He sent up for the lady soon
And forth she came that old moan
In presence of the remenaunt
The strength of all the covenant
Tho was rehearsed openly
And to Florent she bad for thy
That he shall tellen his auyse
As he that wot, what is the price
Florent says all that ever he couth
But such word came there none to mouth
That he for yefte, or for beheste
Might any wise his death areste
And thus he taryeth long and late
Till this lady bad algate
That he shall for the dome fynall
give his answer in special
Of that she had him first opposed
And than he has truly supposed
That he him may of nothing yelpe
But if so be tho words help
which as the woman has him taught
whereof he has an hope caught
That he shall be excused so
And told out plain his will tho
And when that this matron herd
The manner how this knight answerde
She said, ha treson woe the be
That haste thus told the priuyte
which all woman most desire
I would that thou were a fire
But netheles in such a plyte
Florent of his answer is quyte
And tho bygan his sorrow new
For he mote gone / or be untrue
To her, which his truth had
But he, which all shame dradde
Goth forth instead of his penance
And takes the fortune of his chance
As he, that was with troth affayted.
This old wight him has awayted
In place, where as he her left
Florent his woeful heed up lift,
And saw this vecke where that she sit
which was the lothest wyghte
That ever man cast on his eye
Her nose baas, her brows hye
Her eyes small, and deep set
Her chekes ben with teres wette
And ryuelyn, as an empty skyn
Hanging down unto the chyn
Her lyppes shronken ben for age
There was no grace in her vysage
Her front was narowe, her locks hoar
She looks forth, as does a more
Her neck is short, her shulders courbe
That might a man's lust distourbe
Her body great, and no thing small
And shortly to descryue her all
She has no lyth without a lack
But like unto the woll sack
She profereth her unto this knight
And bad him, as he has behyght
(So as she has been his warrant)
That he her held covenant
And by the brydell she him seseth
But god wot how that she him pleseth
Of such words, as she speaks
Him thinks well ny his heart breketh
For sorrow, that he may not fle
But if he would untrue be.
Look how a sick man, for his hele
Takes baldemoyn with the cancle
And with the myrre takes the sugre
Right upon such a manner lucre
Stant Florent, as in this dyete
He drynketh the bitter with the sweet
He medleth sorrow with lykenge
And lives so, as who says, deynge
His youth shall be cast awey
Upon such one, which as the wey
Is old, and lothely ouerall
But need he mot, that need shall
He would algate his troth hold
As every knight thereto is hold
what hap so ever him is be fall
Though she be the fouleste of all
yet to honor of womanhed
Him thought he should taken heed
So that for pure gentylnesse
As he her couth best adresse
In rags, as she was to tore
He set her on his horse tofore
And forth he takes his wey soft
No wonder though he sygheth often
But as an oule flees by night
Out of all other birds sight
Right so this knight on days broad
In close him held, and shope his rode
On nyghtes time, till the tide
That he come there, he would abide
And pryuely, without noise
He brings this foul great coyse
To his castle, in such a wise
That no man might her shape auyse
Till she in to the chamer came
where he his preuy counseylle name
Of such men as he most trust
And told them, that he needs must
This beeste wedde to his wife
For else hadd he lost his life
The pryue women were assent
That shulden ben of his assent
Her rags they anon of draw
And as it was that time law
She had bathe, she had rest
And was arrayed to the best
But with no craft of combs broad
They might her hoar locks shode
And she ne would not be shore
For no counsayll, and they therefore
with such attire, as tho was used
Ordeynen, that it was excused
And had so craftily about
That no man might seen them out
But when she was fully arrayed
And her attire was all assayed
Tho was she fouler unto se
But yet it may none other be
They were wedded in the night
So woe begone was never knight
As he was than of marriage
And she bygan to play and rage
Is who says, I am well enough
But he thereof nothing ne lough
For she took than chere on hand
And clepeth him her husbonde
And says: My lord go we to bed
For I to that intent the wedde
That thou shall be my worlds bless
And profereth him with that to kiss
As she a lusty lady were
His body might well be there
But as of thought, and of memory
His heart was in purgatory
But yet for strength of matrimonye
He might make non essonye
That he ne mote algates plye
To go to bed of company
And when they were a bed naked
with out sleep he was awaked
He torneth on that other side
For that he would his eyes hyde
Fro lokynge of that foull wight
The chamber was all full of light
The courteyns were of sendall thyn
This new bryde, which lay within
Though it be naught with his acorde
In arms she beclept her lord
And prayed as he was turned fro
He would him torn ayenward tho
For now she says we be both one
But he lay stylle as any stone
And ever in one she spoke and prayede
And bad him think / on that he said
when that he took her by the hand.
He herd, and understood the bond
How he was set to his penance
And as it were a man in trance
He torneth him all suddenly
And saw a lady lay him by
Of eyghtene winter age
which was the fayreste of vysage
That ever in all this world he syghe
And as he would have take her nygh
She put her hand, and by his leave
Besought him, that he would leave
And says, for to win or lose
He mot one of two things chese
where he woll have her such on night
Or else upon days light
For he shall not have both two
And he bygan to sorrow tho
In many a wise, and cast his thought
But for all that yet could he naught
Deuyse him self, which was the best
And she that would his heart rest
Prays, that he should chese algate
Till at the last long and late
He said: O ye my lives hele
Say what ye list in my quarrel
I not what answer I shall give
But ever whyll that I may live
I woll, that ye be my maystresse
For I can not my self guess
which is the best unto my choice
Thus grant I you mine holl voice
Chese for us both / I you pray
And what as ever that ye say
Right as ye woll / so woll I.
My lord, she said, grant mercy
For of this word, that ye now said
That ye have made me sovereign
My destny is ouerpassed
That never here after shall be lassed
My beauty, which that I now have
Till I be take in to my grave
Both night and day, as I am now
I shall all wey be such to you
The kings daughter of Cecyle
I am, and fell but sith a while
As I was with my father late
That my stepmother for an hate
which toward me she has begone
Forshope me, till I had won
The love, and the soueraynte
Of what knight, that in his degree
All other passes of good name
And as men said ye ben the same
The deed proves it is so
Thus am I yours for euermo
Tho was plesaunce and joy enough
Echone with other played and lough
They live long, and well they ferde
And clerks, that this chance herd
They written it in evidence
To teache how that obedience
May well fortune a man to love
And set him in his lust above.
As it befelle unto this knight
Confessor
For thy my son, if thou do right
Thou shall unto thy love obey
And follow her will by all wey
Mine holy father so I will
For ye have told me such a skylle
Of this ensample now tofore
That I shall euermo therefore
Here afterward mine obseruaunce
To love, and to his obeysaunce
The better keep, and over this
Of pride if there ought else is
whereof that I me shryue shall
what thing it is in special
My father asks I you pray.
Confessor.
Now list my son, and I shall say
For yet there is surquedrye
which stante with pride of company
whereof that thou shall here anon
To know if thou have gylt or none
Upon the form as thou shall here
Now understand well the matere.
Omnia scire putat, sed se presumpcio nescit,
Nec sibi cousimile quem putat esse parem.
Qui magis astutus reputat se vincere bellum,
In laqueos Veneris forcius ipse cadit.
Sepe (cupido virum, ^ibi qui presumit, amante^
Fallit, er in vacuas spes redit ipsa vias.
Hic loquitur de tercia specie superbie, que presumpcio dicitur, cuius naturam
primo secundum vitium confessor simpliciter declarat.
Surquedrye is thylke vice
Of pride, which the third office
Has in his court, and will not know
The troth, till it overthrow
Upon his fortune and his grace
Comes Had I wyste full often a place
For he does all his thing by guess
And voydeth all sykernesse
None other counsel good him seems
But such as him self demeth
For in such wise as he compasses
His wit alone all other passes
And is with pride so through sought
That he all other set at naught
And weneth of him seluen so
That such as he is there be no mo
And thus he would bear a price
So fair, so semely, nor so wise
Abouen all other, and naught for thy
He says not ones grant mercy
To god, which all grace sends
So that his wits he despendeth
Upon him self, as though there were
No god, which might avail there
But all upon his own wit
He stant / till he fall in the pytte
So far, that he may not arise.
Hic tractat confessor cum amante super illa saltem presumptione, ex cuius
superbie quem plures fatui amantes, cum maioris certitudinis in amore spem sibi
promittunt inexpediti citius destituuntur.
And right thus in the same wise
The vice upon the cause of love
So proudely set the heart above
And does him pleynly for to wene
That he to louen any queen
Has worthynes, and suffisaunce
And so without purueiaunce
Full often he heweth up so hye
That chyppes fallen in his eye
And eke full often he weneth this
There as he naught beloved is
To be beloved all there best
Now son tells what so the lest
Of this, that I have told the here
Amans.
Ha father be naught in a were
I trow there be no man less
Of any manner worthiness
That halt him less worthy than I
To be beloved, and not for thy
I say in excusing of me
To all men, that love is fre
And certes that may no man werne
For love is of him self so derne
It luteth in a man's heart
But that ne shall not me asterte
To wene for to be worthy
To love, but in her mercy
But fire of that ye would mean
That I should other wise wene
To be beloved, than I was
I am beknowe, as in this case
Confessor.
My good son tell me how
Amans.
Now list, and I woll tell you
My good father how it is
Full often it has befalle or this
Through hope, that was not certain
My wenynge has be set in vain
To trust in thing, that help me naught
But only of mine own thought
For as it seems, that a bell
Like to the words that men tell
Answerith: right so no more ne less
To you my father I confess
Such will my wit has over set
That what so hope me behete
Full many a time I wene it soth
But finally no speed it does
Thus may I tellen, as I can
wenynge begyleth many a man
So has it me, right well I wot
For if a man would in a boat
(which is without botome) row
He must needs overthrow
Right so wenyng has farde by me
For when I wend next have be
(As I by my wenyng cast)
Than was I fortheste at last
And as a fool my bow vnbende
when all was failed, that I wend
For thy my fader, as of this
That my wenynge has gone amys
Touchend to Surquedrye
Give me my penance or I dye
But if ye would in any form
Of this matter a tale inform
which were ayene this vice set
I should fare well the bet
Hic ponit confessor exemplum contra illos / qui suis viribus presumentes
debisiores efficiu^tur, Et narrat qualiter ille Campaneus miles in armis
probatissimus de sua presumens audacia inuocatione^ ad superos tempore
necessitatis ex vecordia tm^ et non aliter primitus prouenisse asseruit, vnde
in obsidione ciuitatis Thebarum / cum ipse quodam die coram suis hostibus ad
debellandum se obtulit / ignis de ceso subito super veniens ipsu^ armatil
totaliter in cineres co^bussit.
My son in all manner wise
Surquedrye is to despise
whereof I find write thus
The proud knight Ca^paneus
He was of such Surquedrye
That he through his chyualrye
Upon him self so mochel trust
That to the gods him ne lust
In no quarrel to beseech
But said, it was an ydell speech
which cause was of pure dread
For lack of heart, and for no need
And upon such presumption
He held this proud opinion
Till at the last upon a day
About Thebes, where be lay
when it of syege was beleyne
This knight, as the Cronyke seyne
In all man's sight there
when he was proudest in his gere
And thought nothing might him dear
Full armed with his shield and spear
As be the city would assail
God took him self the battle
Against his pride, and fro the sky
A fyry thonder suddenly
He send, and him to poudre smote
And thus the pride, which was hot
when he most in his strength wend
was brent, and lost withouten end
So that it proves well therefore
The strength of man is sone lore
But if that he it well govern
And over this a man may learn
That eke full often time it greueth
what that a man him self believes
As though it should him well beseme
That he all other men can deem
And has foryete his own vice
A tale of them that be so nyce
And feynen them self to be so wise
I shall the tell in such a wise
whereof thou shalt ensample take
That thou no such thing undertake.
Hic loquitur confessor contra illos, qui de sua scientia presumentes aliorum
co^diciones diuidicantes indiscrete redarguunt / Et narrat exemplum de quodam
principe regis Hungary germano / qui cum fratrem suum pauperibus in publico
vidit humiliatum / ipsum redarguendo in contrarium edocere presumabat / sed rex
omni sapiencia prepollens / ipsum sic incante presumentem ad humilitatis
memoriam teribili prouidentia mitius castigauit.
I find upon Surquedry
Now that whylom of Hungarye
By old days was a king
wise, and honest in all thing
And so befelle upon a day
And that was in the month of May
As thylke time it was vsaunce
This king, with noble purueyaunce
Has for him self his chare arrayed
wherein he would ride amayed
Out of the city for to play
with lords, and with great noblay
Of lusty folk that were young
where sum playde, and some song
And some gone, and some ride
And some prycke her horse aside
And brydlen them now in now out
The king his eye cast about
Till he was at last ware
And saw coming again his chare
Two pylgremes of so great age
That like unto a dry image
That weren pale and fade hewed
And as a busshe, which is besnewed
Their berdes weren hoar and white
There was of kind but a lyte
That they ne semen fully dead
They come to the king, and bid
Some of his good pur charity
And he with great humilyte
Out of his chare to ground lepte
And them in both his arms kept
And kyst them both foot and hand
Before the lords of his land
And yafe them of his good thereto
And when he has this deed do
He goth into his chare again
Tho was murmour, tho was disdeyne
Tho was complaynt on every side
They sayden of their own pride
Echone till other, what is this?
Our king has do this thing amysse
So to abesse his royalty
That every man it might se
And humbled him in such a wise
To them that were of none empryse
Thus was it spoken to and fro
Of them, that were with him tho
All privily behind his back
But to him self no man spoke
The kings brother in presence
was thylke time, and great offense
He took thereof, and was the same
Above all other, which most blame
Upon his lyege lord has leyde
And has unto the lords seyde
Anon, as be may time find
There shall nothing be left behind
That he woll speak unto the king
Now list what fell upon this thing
They were merry, and fair enough
Echone with other playde and lough
And fellen in to tales new
Now that the fresshe flowers grew
And how the grene leaves spronge
And how that love among the young
Began the hertes than wake
And every bird has chose his make
And thus the Mays day to the end
They led, and home ayene they wend
The king was not so sone come
That when he had his chamber nome
His brother ne was redye there
And brought a tale unto his ear
Of that he did such ashame
In hyndrynge of his own name
when he him self so would dretche
That to so vile a power wretch
Him deyneth show such symplesse
Against the state of his noblesse
And says, he shall it no more use
And that he mote him self excuse
Toward his lords euerychone
The king stood still as any stone
And to his tale an ear he laid
And thought more than he said
But netheles to that he herd
well curtoysly the king aunswerde
And told, it should ben amended
And thus when that their tale is ended
All ready was the board and clothe
The king unto his souper goth
Among the lords, to the halle
And when they hadden souped all
They token leave, and forth they go
The king bethought him self tho
How he his brother may chastie
That he through his surquedrye
Took upon hand and to dispreyse
Humilite, which is to preyse
And thereupon yafe such counseyle
Toward his king / which was vnheyle
whereof to be the better lered
He thinks to maken him afered
It fell so, that in thylke dawe
There was ordained by the law
A Trompe, with a stern breath
which was cleped the trompe of death
And in the Court, where the king was
A certain man, this trompe of brass
Has in keeping, and thereof serves
That when a lord his death deserves
He shall this dredefull trompe blow
Tofore his gate, and make it know
How that the judgment is give
Of death, which shall not be foryeue
The king when it was night anon
This man assent, and bad him gone
To trompen at his brothers gate
And he, which mote done algate
Goth forth, and does the kings best
This lord, which herd of this tempest
That he tofore his gate blewe
Tho wist he by the law and knew
That he was sekerly dead
And as of help he wist no read
But send for his friends all
And told them how it is befalle
And they him ask cause why
But he the sothe not for thy
Ne wist, and there was sorrow tho
For it stood thylke time so
This trompe was of such sentence
That there ayene no resystence
They could ordeyne by no weye
That he ne mote algate deye
But if so that he may purchase
To get his lyege lords grace
Their wits thereupon they cast
And ben appointed at last.
This lord a worthy lady had
Unto his wife, which also drad
Her lords death, and children five
Between hem two they had alive
That weren young, and tender of age
And of stature, and of visage
Right fair and lusty on to se
Tho casten they, that he and she
Forth with their children on the morrow
As they that were full of sorrow
All naked but of smock and sherte
To tender with the kings heart
His grace should go to seche
And pardon of the death beseech
Thus passen they that woeful night
And erly when they saw it light
They gone them forth in such a wise
As thou tofore have herd diuyse
All naked, but their shertes one
They wept, and made much moan
Their here hanged about their ears
with sobbing, and with sorry tears
This lord goth then an humble pas
That whilom proud and noble was
whereof the city sore a flight
Of them that sawen thylke sight
And nethelesse all openly
with such weeping, and with such cry
Forth with his children / and his wife
He goth to pray for his life
Unto the court when they be come
And men therein have hyed nome
There was no wight, if he them sye
From water might keep his eye
For sorrow, which they maden tho.
The king supposes of this woe
And feyneth, as he naught ne wist
But netheles at his vpryste
Men told him, how it ferde
And when that he this wonder herd
In have he goth in to the halle
And all at ones down they fall
If any pite may be found
The king, which sees the^ go to ground
Has asked them what is the fere
why they be so dispoyled there
His brother said, A lord mercy
I wot none other cause why
But only that this night full late
The trompe of death was at my gate
In token that I should dye
Thus we be come for to preye
That ye my worlds death respyte.
Ha fool how thou art for to wit
The king unto his brother said
That thou art of so little frayde
That only for a trompes sown
Has gone dispoiled through the town
Thou, and thy wife in such manner
Forth with thy children that been here
In sight of all men about
For that thou say, thou art in doubt
Of death, which stant under the law
Of man, and man may it withdraw
So that it may perchance fail
Now shall thou not for thy marvel
That I down from my chare alyght
when I beheld to fore my sight
In them that were of so great age
Mine own death through their image
which god has set by law of kind
whereof I may no bote find
For well I wot, such as they be
Right such am I in my degree
Of flesh, and blood, and so shall dey
And thus though I that law obey
Of which that kings be put under
It ought be well the less wonder
Than thou, which art without need
For law of land in such a dread
which for to account is but a iape
As thing, which thou might ouerscape
For thy my brother after this
I read that sethen, that so is
That thou can dread a man so sore
Dread god with all thyn heart more
For all shall dye, and all shall pass
As well a lion as an ass
As well a beggar as a lord
Toward death in one accord
They shall stand, and in this wise
The king with his words wise
His brother taught, and all foryeue
Confessor.
For thy my son if thou wolt live
In virtue, thou must vice eschew
And with low heart humblesse sewe
So that thou be not surquedous
Amans.
My father I am amorous
whereof I would you beseech
That ye me by some way teach
which might in loves cause stand
Confessor.
My son thou shalt understand
In love, and other things all
If that surquedry fall
It may to him not well betyde
which uses thylke vice of pride
which tourneth wisdom to wenyng
And sothfastnes into lesynge
Through foul imagination
And for thyn enformation
That thou this vice as I the read
Eschew shalt a tale I read
which fell whylom by days old
So as the clerk Ouide told.
Hic in speciali tractat Confessor cum Amante contra illos / qui de propria

There was whylom a lords son
which of his pride a vice won
Has caught that worthy to his lyche
As sechen all the worlds rich
There was no woman for to love
So high he set him self above
Of stature, and of beauty both
That him thought all women loathe
(...) was there no comparyson
As toward his condition
This young lord Narcissus hight
No strength of love bow might
His heart, which is vnafyled
(...) at last he was begyled
(...) of the gods purueyaunce
(...) tell him on a day perchance
That he in all his proud fare
Unto the forest began to fare
Among other, that there were
To hunt, and disporte him there
And when he came in to the place
where that he would make his chase
The hounds were within a throw
Uncoupled, and the bornes blow
The great heart anon was found
with swyfte feet set on the ground
And be with spore in horse side
Him hastes fast for to ride
Till all men be left bebynde
And as he rode under a lynde
Beside a roche, as I the tell
He saw where spronge a lusty well
The day was wondre hot withal
And such a thirst was on him fall
That he must other dye or drink
And down he light, and by the brinke
He tide his bors unto a branch
And laid him low for to staunche
His thurst: And as he cast his look
Into the well and head took
He saw the like of his visage
And wend there were an image
Of such a nymphe, as tho was fay
whereof that love his heart assay
Began, as it was after seen
Of his sotye, and made him wene
It were a woman, that he syghe
The more that he came the well nygh
The nere came she to him again
So wist he never what to seyne
For when he wept, he saw her weep
And when he cried, he took good keep
The same word she cried also
And thus began the new woe
That whylom was to him so strange
Tho made him love an hard eschange
To set his heart, and to begin
Thing, which he might never win
And ever among he began to loute
And prays, that she to him come out
And other while he goth a far
And other while he draws nerre
And ever he fond her in o place
He wepeth, he cries, he asks grace
There as he might get none
So that ayene a roche of stone
As he that knew none other read
He smote him self till he was dead
whereof the Nymphs of the wells
And other that there weren else
Unto the wodes belongende
The body / which was dead lyggende
For pure pity, that they have
Under grave they begraue
And than out of his sepulture
There spronge anon perauenture
Of flowers such a wonder sight
That men ensample take might
Upon the deeds, which he deed
And tho was seen in other stead
For in the winter fresshe and fair
The flowers been, which is contraire
To kind, and so was the folly
which fell of his surquedrye
Thus he, which love had in disdain
werst of all other was beseyne
And as he set his price most hie
He was lest worthy in loves eye
And most be iaped in his wit
whereof the remembrance is yet
So that thou might ensample take
And eke all other for h^^ sake.
Amans
My father as touchende of me
This vice I think for to flee
which of his wenynge ever troweth
And namelich of thing, which grows
In loves cause, or well or woe
yet pryded in me never so
But would god that grace send
That toward me my lady wend
As I toward her wene
My love should so besene
There should go no pride a place
But I am far fro thylke grace
And for to speak of time now
So mote I suffer, I pray you
That ye woll ask on other side
If there be any point of pride
whereof it needs me to be shryne
Confessor.
My son god it the foryeue
if thou have any thing mysdo
Touchend of this: but euermo
There is another yet of pride
which never could his words hyde
That he ne would him self auaunt
There may nothing his tongue daunt
That he ne clappeth as a belle
whereof if thou wolt that I tell
It is behouely for to here
So that thou might thy tongue stere
Toward the world / and stand in grace
which lacks often in many a place
To him that can not sytte stylle
which else should have all his will
Magniloque propriam minuit iactantie lingue,
Famam quam stabilem firmat honor silens,
Ipse sui laudem meriti non percipit, unde
Se sua per uerba iactat in orb palam,
Est que uiri culpa iactantia, que rubifactas
In muliere reas causat habere genas.
Hic loquitur de quarta specie superbie, que iactantia dicitur / ex cuius
natura causatur, vt homo de se ipso testimoniu^ perhibens / suaru^ virtutum
merita de laud in culpam transfert et suam famam cu^ extollere vellet, illa^
proprio ore subuertit. Sed et Venus in amorie causa de isto vicio maculatos a
sua curia super omnes alios abhorrens expellit / et eorum multiloquium
verecundia detestatur / vnde Confessor Amanti opponens materiam before
declarat.
The vice cleped auauntance
with pride has take his acqueintance.
So that his own price he lasseth
when he such mesure ouerpasseth
That he his own heraulde is
That first was well, is than amysse
That was thank worthy, is tha^ blame
And thus the worship of his name
Through pride of his auauntry
He tourneth into vylonye
I read, how that this proud vice
Has thylke hunt in his office
Through which the blastes that he blows
The ma^s same he overthrows
Of virtue which should else spring
Unto the worlds knowlegynge
But he fordothe it all to sore
And right of such manner lore
There ben lovers / for thy if thou
Art one of hem, tell and say how
when thou have taken any thing
Of loves yeste or ouche or ring
Or took upon the for the cold
Some goodly word that the was told
Of friendly chere, or token, or lettter
whereof thyn heart was the better
Of that she sent the gretynge
Have thou for pride of thy liking
Made thyn auaunt, where as the list?
Amans
I would father that ye wist
My conscience lies not here
yet had I never such mattere
whereof mine heart might amend
Not of so much as she send
By mouth, and said / Great him well
And thus for that there is no dele
whereof to make mine auaunt
It is to reason accordaunt
That I may never, but I lie
Of love make auauntrye
I wot not what I should have do
If that I had encheson so
As ye have said here many one
But I fond cause never none
But danger, which me welny slough
Thereof I couth tell enough
And of none other auantaunce
Thus needs me no repentance
Now axeth forther of my life
For hereof am I not giltyfe
My son I am well paid with all
For wite it well in special

Above all other ayene this vice

Of the^, that we lumbardes now call
Albinus was the first of all
which bare crown of Lumbardy
And was of great chivalry
In war against diverse kings
So fell among other things
That he that time a war had
with Gurmund, which the Geptes lad
And was a mighty king also
But netheles it fell him so
Albinus slough him in the field
There halpe him another spear ne shield
That he ne smote his heed of than
whereof he took awey the pan
Of which he said he would make
A cup, for Gurmundes sake
To keep and draw in to memory
Of his battle the victory
And thus when he the field had won
The land anon was ouerronne
And sesed in his own hand
where he Gurmundes daughter fond
which maid Rosamunde hight
And was in every man's sight
A fair fresshe a lusty one
His heart fill to her anon
And such a love on her he cast
That he her wedded at the last
And after that long time in rest
with her he dwells, and to the best
They love each other wonder well
But she, which keeps the blind whele
Venus, when they be most above
In all the hottest of her love
Her whele she torneth, and they fell
In the manner, as I shall tell
This king, which stod in all his wealth
Of pees, of worship, and of health
And felt him on no side grieved
As he that has his world acheued
Tho thought he would a fest make
And that was for his wives sake
That she the lords of the feste
(That were obeysaunt to his heste)
May know: and so forth there upon
He let ordain, and sent anon
By letters, and by messengers
And warned all his officers
That every thing be well araide
The great stedes were assayde
For iustynge, and for tornement
And many a perled garnement
Embrouded was again the day
The lords in their best array
Be comen at the time set
One iusteth well, an other bet
And other while they torney
And thus they cast care awey
And token lusts upon hand
And after thou shall understand
To mete into the kings halle
They comen, as they be hydden all
And when they were set and served
Than after, as it was deserved
To them, that worthy knights were
So as they setten here and there
The price was youen, and spoken out
Among the heraudes all about
And thus benethe, and eke above
All was of arms and of love
whereof about at bourdes
Men had many sundry words
That of the myrthe, which they made
The king him self bygan to glade
within his heart, and took a pride
And saw the cup stand a side
which made was of Gurmundes head
As ye have hard, when he was deed
And was with gold and rich stones
Beset and bound for the nones
And stood upon a foot on hyghte
Of borned gold, and with great slight
Of werkmenshyp it was by grave
Of such work, as it should have
And polysshed was eke so clean
That no sign of the sculle was seen
But as it were a grypes eye
The king badde bear his cup awey
which stood before him on the board
And set thylke, upon his word
The sculle is fette, and wine therein
whereof he badde his wife begin
Drink with thy father, dame he said
And she to his bidding obeyde
And took the sculle, and what her list
She drynketh, as she, which nothing wist
what cup it was: and than all out
The king in audyence about
Has told, it was her fathers sculle
So that the lords know shull
Of his battle a soth witness
And made auant through what prowes
He has his wives love won
which of the sculle has so begone
Tho was there mochel pride alofte
They speaken all, and she was soft
Thynkende on thylke unkind pride
Of that her lord, so nygh her side
Auanteth him, that he has slain
And pyked out her fathers brain
And of the sculle has made a cup
She suffered all till they were up
And tho she has sickness feyned
And goth to chamber, and has co^pleined
Unto a maid, which she trust
So that none other wyghte it wist
This maid Glodesyde is hot
To whom this lady has by hot
Of ladyshyp all that she can
To auengen her upon this man
which did her drink in such a plite
Among them all for despyte
Of her, and of her father both
whereof her thoughts ben so wroth
She says, that she shall not be glad
Tylle that she se him so be bestad
That he no more make auaunt
And thus they fell in covenant
That they acorden at the last
with such wyles, as they cast
That they woll get of their accord
Some orped knight to sle this lord
And with this sleyght they begin
How they Helmege might win
which was the kings botyler
A proud and a lusty bachyler
And Glodesyde he loves hot
And she to make him more assote
Her love grants, and by night
They shape how they to geder might
A bed mete: and done it was
The same night, and in this cas
The queen her self, the night second
went in her stead, and there she fond
A chaumber derke without light
And goth to bed to this knight
And be to keep his obseruaunce
To love, does his obeysaunce
And weneth it be Glodesyde
And she than after lay a side
And axeth him, what he has do
And who she was, she told him tho
And said Helmege, I am the queen
Now shall thy love well besene
Of that thou haste thy will wrought
Or it shall sore ben abought
Or thou shall worche, as I the say
And if thou wolt by such a way
Do my plesaunce, and hold it stylle
For ever I shall ben at thy will
Both I, and all mine heritage
Anon the wild loves rage
In which no man him can govern
Made him, that he can not werne
But fell all holle to her assent
And thus the whele is all myswent
The which fortune has upon hand
For how that ever it after stand
They shope among them such a wyle
The king was deed within a while
So styly came it not about
That they ne ben discovered out
So that it thought them for the best
To fle, for there was no rest
And thus the tresour of the king
They trusse, and much other thing
And with a certain felauship
They fled, and went awey by ship
And held their night course from then
Till that they comen to Rauenne
where they the dukes help sought
And he, so as they him besought
A place grants for to dwell
But after, when he hard tell
Of the manner, how they have do
The duke let shape for them so
That of a poison, which they drunk
They hadden that they han beswunke
And all this made auaunt of pride
Good is therefore a man to hyde
His own price. for if he speak
He may lyghtelyche his thank break
In arms lies none auantance
To him, which thinks his name aua^ce
And be renomed of his deed
And also who that thinks to speed
Of love, he may not him auaunte
For what man thylke vice baunte
His purpose shall full often faylle
In arms be that woll trauaylle
Or else loves grace atteyne
His lose tongue he mote restreyne
which beryth of his honor the keye
For thy my son in all weye
Take right good head of this mattere
I thank you my father dear
This schole is of a gentyl lore
And if there be ought else more
Of pride, which I shall eschew
Now axeth forth, and I woll show
what thing, that ye me woll inform
Confessor.
My son yet in other form
There is a vice of prydes lore
which like an hawke, wha^ he will sore
Flees up on high in his delyces
After the liking of his vices
And woll no man's reason know
Till he down fall, and overthrow
This vice vaynglorye is hot
whereof my son I the by hot
To trete and speak in such a wise
That thou the might better auyse.
Gloria perpetuos pregnat mundana dolores,
Qui tamen est vanus gaudia vana cupit.
Eius amiciciam, quem gloria tollit inanis,
Non sine blandicijs planus habebit homo.
Verbis compositis qui scit strigila re fauellum,
Scandere fallata iura valebit eques.
Sic in amore magis qui blanda subornat in ore
Verba, per hoc brauiu^ quod nequit, alter habet.
Et tamen ornatos cantus, varios que paratus,
Leta que corda suis legibus optat amor.
Hic loquitur de quinta specie superbie / que Inanis gloria vocatur. Et eiusdem
victi natural primo describene super eodem in amorie causa Confessor amanti
consequenter opponit.
The proud vice of vaynglorye
Remembers naught of purgatory
His worlds joys ben so great
Him thinks of beuen no beyete
This lives pomp is all his pes
yet shall he deye netheles
And thereof thinks he but a lyte
For all his lust is to delight
In new things, proud and vain
As farforth as he may attain
I trow, if that he might make
His body new, he would take
A new form, and leave his old
For what thing, that he may behold
The which to common use is strange
Anon his old guyse change
He woll, and fall thereupon
Like unto the Camelyon
which upon every sundry hew
That he beholt, he mote new
His color, and thus unadvised
Full often time he stant disguysed
More ioylife than the bird in may
He makes him ever fresshe and gaye
And does all his array disguyse
So that of him the new guyse
Of lusty folk all other take
And eke he can carolles make
Roundel, balade, and verelay
And with all this, if that he may
Of love get him advantage
Anon he waxt of his courage
So over glad, that of his end
He thinks there is no death commend
For he has than at all tide
Of love such manner pride
Him thinks his joy is endeles.
Confessor.
Now shryue the son in gods pees
And of thy love tell me plain
if that thy glory has be so vain
Amans.
My father as touchend of all
I may not well, ne noughten shall
Of vain glory excuse me
That I ne have for love be
The better adressyd and arayde
And also I have often assayde
Roundel, balades, and vyrelay
For her, on whom mine heart lay
To make, and also for to peynte
Carollys with my words queynte
To set my purpose alofte
And thus I sange themforth full often
In halle, and eke in chamber about
And made merry among the route
But yet ne ferde I not the bet
Thus was my glory in vain beset
Of all the joy that I made
For when I would with her glade
And of her love songs make
She said, it was not for her sake
And list not my songs here
Ne wyten, what the words were
So for to speak of mine arraye
yet could I never be so gaye
Ne so well make a song of love
whereof I might ben above
And have encheson to be glad
But rather I am often adradde
For sorrow, that she says me nay
And netheles I woll not say
That I nam glad on other side
For fame, that can nothing hyde
All day woll bring unto mine ere
Of that men speken here and there
How that my lady beryth the price
How she is fair, how she is wise
How she is womanlyche of chere
Of all this thing when I may here
what wonder is though I be feign
And eke when I may here said
Tidings of my ladys hele
All though I may not with her dele
yet am I wonder glad of that
For when I wot her good estate
As for that time I dare well swear
None other sorrow may me dear
Thus am I gladed in this wise
But father of your lores wise
Of which ye be fully taught
Now tell me if ye think ought
That I thereof am to wit
Of that there is, I the acquit
My son, he said, and for thy good
I woll that thou understood
For I think upon this mattere
To tell a tale, as thou shall here
How that again this proud vice
The high god, of his justice
Is wroth, and great vengeance does
Now harken a tale, which is soth
Though it be naught of loves kind
A great ensample thou shall find
This vain glory for to fle
which is so full of vanyte.

There was a king, that much might
which Nabugodonosor hight
Of whom that I spoke here to fore
Yet in the bible this name is bore
For all the world in thoryent
was hole at his commandment
As than of kings to his lyche
was none so mighty, ne so rich
To his empire, and to his laws
As who says, all in thylke dawes
were obeysaunt, and trybute bear
As though he god of earth were
with strength he put kings under
And wrought of pride many a wonder
He was so full of vaynglorye
That he ne had no memory
That there was any god but he
For pride of his prosperyte
Till that the high king of kings
which sees and knows all things
whose eye may nothing asterte
The pryuytes of man's heart
They speken and sown in his ere
As though they loud wyndes were
He took vengeance of his pride
But for he would a while abide
To look, if he would him amend
To him before token he send
And that was in his sleep by night
This proud king a wonder sight
Had in his sweuen, there be lay
Him thought upon a merry day
As he beheld the world about
A tree full grow be saw there out
which stood in the world amiddes even
whose heyght straught up to the heaven
The leaves weren fair and large
Of fruit it bear so ripe a charge
That all men it might feed
He saw also the bows sprede
Above all earth, in which were
The kind of all birds there
And eke him thought he saw also
The kind of all bestes go
Under the tree about round
And fedden them upon the ground
As he this understood and syghe
Him thought he herd a voys on high
Cryende, and said abouen all
Hew down this tree, and let it fall
The leaves let defoule in have
And do the fruit destroy and wast
And let of shreden every branch
But at rote he let it staunche
when all his pride is cast to ground
The rote shall be fast bound
And shall no man's heart bear
But every lust he shall forbere
Of man, and like an ox his mete
Of grass he shall purchase and ete
Till at the water of the heaven
Has wasshen him by times seven
So that he thorough know aryght
what is the heuenlyche might
And be made humble to the will
Of him, which may all save and spylle
This king out of his sweuen abraide
And he upon the morrow it said
Unto the clerks, which he had
But none of them the foth aradde
was none his sweuen couth undo
And it stood thylke time so
This king had in subjection
Jude, and of affectyon
Abouen al other one Danyel
He loves, for be couth well
Dyuyne, that none other couthe
To him were all things couthe
As he it had of gods grace
He was before the kings face
Assent and boden, that he should
Upon the point the king of told
The fortune of his sweuen expound
As it should afterward be found
when Danyel this sweuene herd
He stood long time, or be answerde
And made a wonder heavy chere
The king took head of his manner
And had him tell that he wyste
As he, to whom he mochel tryste
And said, he would not be wroth
But Danyel was wonder loath
And said upon thy fo men all
Sir king thy sweuene mote fall
And netheles touchend of this
I woll the tellen, how it is
And what dysese is to the shape
God wot if thou it shall escape
The high tree, which thou have seen
with less and fruit so well besene
The which stood in the world amiddes
So that the bestes and the birds
Governed were of him alone
Sir king betokens thy person
which stand above all erthely things
Thus reignen under the the kings
And all the people unto the louteth
And all the world thy person douteth
So that with vain honor deceived
Thou haste the reverence weyued
From him, which is thy king above
That thou for dread ne for love
wolt nothing known of thy god
which now for the has made a rod
Thy vain glory, and thy folly
with great peynes to chastye
And of the voice thou herdest speak
which badde the bows for to break
And hew and fell down the tree
That word belongs unto the
Thy reign shall be over throw
And thou dispoyled for a throw
But that the rote should stand
By that thou shall well understand
There shall abide of thy regne
A time again when thou shall regne
And eke of that thou herdest say
To take a man's heart aweye
And set there a bestiall
So that he like an ox shall
Pasture, and that he be byreyned
By times seven, and sore peyned
Till that be know his goddis mightes
Than shall he stond again vpryghtes
All this betokens thine estate
which now with god is in debate
Thy man's form shall be lassed
Till seven year ben over passed
And in the lykenes of a best
Of gras shall be thy royal feste
The wether shall upon the rain
And understand, that all this pain
which thou shall suffer thylke tide
Is shape all only for thy pride
Of vain glory, and of the sin
which thou have long stonden inn.
So upon this condicyon,
Thy sweuene has exposicyon
But er this thing befalle in deed
Amend the, this would I read
give and depart thyn alms
Do mercy forth with ryghtwysnes
Beseech and pray the high grace
For so thou might thy pees purchase
with god, and stonden in good accord
But pride is loath to lose his lord
And woll not suffer humylyte
with him to stand in no degree
And when a ship has lost his stere
Is none so wise, that may him stere
Again the wawes in a rage
This proud king in his courage
Humylite has so forlore
That for no sweuen (he saw to fore)
Ne yet for all that Danyell
Him has counseyled every dele
He let it pass out of his mind
Through vaynglory, and as the blind
He sees no weye, er him be woe
And fell within a time so
As he in Babyloyne went
The vanyte of pride him hente
His heart aros of vain glory
So that he drough in to memory
His lordship and his regalye
with words of surquedrye
And wha^ that he him most auau^teth
That lord, which vainglorye daunteth
All suddenly, as who says treys
where that he stood in his paleys
He took him from the men's sight
was none of them so ware, that might
Set eye, where he bycome
And thus was be from his kingdom
In to the wild foreste draw
where that the mighty gods law
Through his power did him tra^sforme
Fro man in to a bestes form
And like an ox under the foot
He graseth as he needs mote
To getten him his lives fode
Tho thought him cold gras good
That whilome ete the hot spices
Thus was he turned from delyces
The wine, which he was wont drink
He took then of the wells brynke
Or of the pyt, or of the slough
It thought him then good enough
Instede of chambres well arrayed
He was than of a busshe well apayed
The hard ground he lay upon
For other pylowes had he non
The storms, and the raynes fall
The wyndes blow upon him all
He was tormented day and night
Such was the high gods might
Till seven year an end took
Upon him self tho began be look
Instead of mete, gras and streys
Instead of hands, long cleys
Instead of man, a best like
He saw, and than he began to syke
For cloth of gold and of perrye
which him was wont to magnyfye
when he beheld his cote of here is
He wept, and with full woeful teres
Up to the heaven he cast his chere
wepend, and thought in this manner
Though he no words might win
Thus said his heart, and spoke withyn
O mighty god, that all have wrought
And all might bring again to naught
Now know I, but all of the
This world has no prosperity
In thyn aspecte ben all alyche
The pour man and eke the rich
without the there may no wight
And thou above all other might
O mighty lord toward my vice
Thy mercy meddle with justice
And I woll make a covenant
That of my life the remenaunt
I shall it by the grace amend
And in thy law so dispende
That vayn glory I shall eschew
And bow unto thyn heste, and sewe
Humylite, and that I vow
And so thynkend he began down bow
And though him lack voice of speech
He began up with his fete areche
And waylend in his bestly steven
He made his playnt unto the heaven
He kneleth in his wise, and brayeth
To seche mercy, and assayeth
His god, which made him nothing strange
when that he saw his pride change
Anon as he was humble and tame
He fond toward his god the same
And in a twynkelynge of a look
His man's form again he took
And was reformed to the reygne
In which that he was wont to reign
So that the pride of vain glory
Ever afterward out of memory
He let it pass, and thus is showed
what is to ben of pride vnthewed
Again the high gods law
To whom no man may be felawe
For thy my son take good head
So for to lead thy manhede
That thou ne be not like a best
But if thy life shall ben honest
Thou must humblesse take on hand
For than might thou syker stand
And for to speak it other wise
A proud man can no love assise
For though a woman would him plese
His pride can not ben at ease
There may no man to mochel blame
A vice, which is for to blame
For thy men shulden nothing hyde
That might fall in blame of pride
which is the worst vice of all
whereof, so as it was befalle
The tale I think of a cronyke
To tell, if that it may the like
So that thou might humblesse sewe
And eke the vice of pride eschew
whereof the glory is false and vain
which god him self has in disdain
That though it mount for a throw
It shall down fall and overthrow.
Est uirtus humilis, per quam deus altus ad ima
Se tulit, et nosire inscera carnis habet.
Sic humilis supereft, et amor sibi subditur ois,
Cuius habet nulla sort superbus opem,
Odit cum terra, celum deiecit et ipsum,
Sedibus inferni stat que receptus ibi.
Hic narrat confessor exemplum contra super^^am, Et dicit / que nuper quidam
rex famous prudencie cuidam misiti suo super fribus questionibus, vt inde
certitudinis responsionem daret sub pena capitasis sententie terminum presixit.
Primo quid minoris indigentie ab inhabita^tibus orbem auxisium mains obtinuit.
Secundo quid maioris meriti continens minoris expense reprisas exiguit. Tercio
quid omnia bona diminuens ex sin proprietate nihil penitus vasuit. Quaru^ vero
questionum quedam virgo dicti militis sifia nomine patris sofutione^ aggrediens
tafiter regi respondit. Ad primam dixit / quod terra nullius indiget / quam in
adiuuare cotidianis laboribus omnes intendunt. Ad secundam dixit / que
humilitas omnibus virtutibus preuafet / que tamen nullius prodigalitatis
expensis mensuram excedit. Ad terciam dixit / que superbia omnia tam corporis
quam anime bona deuastans maiorum expensarum excessus inducit.
A King was whylom young and wise
The which of his wit set great price
Of deep imaginations
And strange interpretations
Problemes and demaundes eke
His wisdom was to find and seek
whereof he would in sundry wise
Opposen them, that weren wise
But none of them it might bear
Upon his word to give answer
Out taken one, which was a knight
To him was every thing so light
That also sone as he them herd
The kings words he answerde
what thing the king him axe would
There anon the troth he told
The king somdele had an envy
And thought he would his wits plye
To set some conclusion
which should be confusion
Unto this knight, so that the name
And of wisdom the high fame
Toward him self he would win
And thus of all his wit within
This king began to study and muse
what strange matter he might use
The knights wits to confound
And at last he has it found
And for the knight anon he sent
That he shall tell / what he meant
Upon the points of the mattere
Of questions as thou shalt here
The first point of all three
was this: what thing in his degree
Of all this world has need lest
And yet men help it all their mest.
The second is: what most is worth
And of costage is lest put forth
The third is: which is of most cost
And lest is worth, and gothe to lost.
The king these three demau^des axeth
To the knight this law he taxes
That he shall gone and come again
The third weke and tell him pleyne
To every point, what it amounts
And if so be, that he miscounteth
To make in his answer a fail
There shall none other thing avail
The king says, but he shall be dead
And lose his goods, and his heed.
This knight was sorry of this thing
And would excuse him to the king
But he ne would him not forbere
And thus the knight of his answer
Goth home to take auysement
But after his entendement
The more he cast his wit about
The more he stant thereof in doubt
Tho wist he well the kings heart
That he the death ne should asterte
And such a sorrow has to him take
That gladshyppe he has all forsake
He thought first upon his life
And after that upon his wife
Upon his children eke also
Of which he had daughters two
(...) ^^gest of them had of age
(...) year, and of vysage
(...) was right fair, and of stature
(...) to an heavenly figure
(...) of manner, and of goodly speech
Though men would all lands seche
They should not have found her like
(...) her father sorrow and syke
And w^st not the cause why
(...) she to him privily
(...) was, where he made his moan
(...) gardeyne all him one
(...) knees she began down fall
(...) humble heart, and to him call
(...) said: O good father dear
(...) make ye thus heavy chere
(...) I wot nothing, how it is
And well ye know father this
what adventure that you fell
ye might it saufly to me tell
yor I have often herd you said
That ye such trust have on me laid
That to my sister ne to my brother
In all this world ne to none other
ye durst tell a pryuete
So well my father as to me
For thy my father I you pray
Ne casts naught that heart away
For I am she, that would keep
your honor: and with that to weep
Her eye may not be forbore
She wyssheth for to ben vnbore
Er that her father so mystryst
To tellen her, of that he wist
And ever among mercy she cried
That he ne should his counscile hyde
From her, that so would him good
And was so nygh flesh and blood
So that with weeping at last
His chere upon his child he cast
And sorowfully, to that she prayde
He told his tale, and thus he said
The sorrow daughter, which I make
Is not all only for my sake
But for the both, and for you all
For such a chance is me befalle
That I shall er this third day
Lose all that ever I lose may
My life, and all my good thereto
Therefore it is, I sorrow so
what is the cause alas, quod she?
My father, that ye shulden be
Dead, and distroyed in such a wise
And he began the points deuyse
which as the king told him by mouth
And said her plainly, that he couthe
Answer to no point of this
And she, that hereth how it is
Her counsel yafe, and said tho
My father, syn it is so
That ye can se none other weye
But that ye must needs deye
I would pray you of o thing
Let me go with you to the king
And ye shall make him understand
How ye my wits for to fond
Have laid your answer upon me
And tells him in such degree
Upon my word ye wol abide
To life or death what so betyde
For yet perchance I may purchase
with some good word the kings grace
your life and eke your good to save
For often shall a woman have
Thing, which a man may not areche
The fader herd his daughters speech
And thought there was no reason in
And saw, his own life to win
He couthe done him self no cure
So better he thought in adventure
To put his life, and all his good
That in the manner as it stood
His life incerteyne for to lose
And thus thynkende he began to chese
To do the counseyle of this maid
And took the purpose, which she said
The day was come, and forth they gone
Unto the court they come anon
where as the king in his judgment
was set, and has this knight assent
Arrayed in her best wise
This maiden with her words wise
Her father led by the hand
In to the place, where he fond
The king, with other which he would
And to the king knelende he told
As he enfourmed was tofore
And prays the king, that he therefore
His daughters words would take
And says, that he woll undertake
Upon her words for to stende.
Tho was there great marvel on ho^de
That he, which was so wise a knight
His life upon so young a wight
Besette would in ieopardye
And many it helden for folly
But at last nevertheless
The king commands ben in peace
And to this maid he cast his chere
And said, he would her tale here
And badde her speak: and she began.
My lyege lord so as I can
Quod she, the points, which I herd
They shall of reason ben answerde.
The first I understand is this
what thing of all the world it is
which men most help, and has lest need
My lyege lord this would I read
The earth it is, which euermo
with man's labor is bego
As well in winter as in May
The man's hand does what he may
To help it forth, and make it rich
And for thy men it delue and dyche
And eren it with strength of plough
where it has of him self enough
So that his need is at least
For every man, bird, and beast
Of flower, and grass, and rote, and rynde
And every thing by wey of kind
Shall sterue, and earth it shall become
As it was out of earth nome
It shall to earth turn again
And thus I may by reason seyne
That therthe is most nedeles
And most men help it netheles
So that my lord touchande of this
I have answerde how that it is.
That other point I understood
which most is worth, and most is good
And costeth leest a man to keep
My lord if ye woll take keep
I say it is Humilite
Through which the high Trinite
As for deserte of pure love
Unto Marye from above
Of that he knew her humble intent
His own son adowne he sent
Above all other, and her he chese
For that virtue, which that bodeth pes
So that I may by reason call
Humilite most worth of all
And lest it costeth to maynteyne
In all the world, as it is seyne.
For who that has hu^blesse on hand
He brings no werres in to land
For he desires for the best
To serten every man in rest.
Thus with your high reverence
Me thinks that this euydence
As to this point, is suffisaunt
And touchende of the remenaunt
which is the third of your askynges
what lest is worth of all things
And costeth most, I tell it Pride
which may not in the heaven abide
For Lucifer, with them that fell
Bare Pride with him in to hell
There was pride of to great cost
when he for pride has heaven lost
And after that in Paradyse
Adam for pride lost his price
In myddell earth. And eke also
Pride is the cause of all woe
That all the world ne may suffice
To stanche of pride the reprise
Pride is the heed of all sin
which wastes all, and may not win
Pride is of every mysse the prycke
Pride is the worste of all wycke
And costeth most, and lest is worth
In place where he has his forth
Thus have I said that I woll say
Of mine answer, and to you pray
My lyege lord of your office
That ye such grace, and such justice
Ordeyne for my father here
That after this, when men it here
The world thereof may speak good.
The king, which reason understood
And has all herd how she has said
was inly glad, and so well paid
That all his wrath is over go
And he began to look tho
Upon this maiden in the face
In which he fond so mochell grace
That all his price on her he leyde
In audience and thus he said
My fair maiden well ye be
Of thyn answer, and eke of the
Me lyketh well, and as thou will
For^eue be thy father gylte
And if thou were of such lygnage
That thou to me were of parage
And that thy father were a pere
As he is now a bachylere
So syker as I have a life
Thou should than be my wife
But this I say netheles
That I woll shape thyn increase
what worlds good that thou wolte crave
Axe of mi yeft, and thou shall have
And she the king with words wise
Knelynge thanketh in this wise
My lyege lord god mote you quite
My father here has but a lyte
Of waryson, and that he wend
Had all be lost, but now amend
He may well through your noble grace
with that the king right in his place
Anon forth in that fresshe hete
An Erledome, which than of eschete
was late fall in to his hand
Unto this knight, with rent and land
Has you, and with his chartre sesed
And thus was all the noise appesed.
This maiden, which sat on her knees
Tofore the kings charitees
Common death, and says evermore
My lyege lord right now tofore
ye said, and it is of record
That if my father were a lord
And pere unto these other great
ye wolden for naught else let
That I ne should be your wife
And thus wot every worthy life
A kings word mote need be hold
For thy my lord, if that ye would
So great a charity fulfylle
God wot it were well my will
For he, which was a bachylere
My father is now made a pere
So whense as ever that I came
An earls daughter now I am.
This young king, which peised all
Her beauty, and her wit withal
As he, which was with love hente
Anon thereto yafe his assente
He might not the place asterte
That she nys lady of his heart
So that he took her to his wife
To hold, while that he has life
And thus the king toward his knight
Accords him, as it is right.
And over this good is to wit
In the cronyke as it is write
This noble king, of whom I told
Of spain by tho days old
The kyngedome had in governance
And as the book makes remembrance
Alphons was his propre name.
The knight also, if I shall name
Dom Petro hight, and as men tell
His daughter wise Petronelle
was cleped, which was full of grace
And that was seen in thylke place
where she her father out of tene
Has brought, and made her self a queen
Of that she has so well disclosed
The points, whereof she was opposed
Confessor.
Lo now my son as thou might here
Of all this thing to my mattere
But one I take, and that is pride
To whom no grace may betyde
In heaven he fell out of his stead
And Paradyse him was forbede
The good men in earth him hate
So that to belle he mote algate
where every virtue shall be weyued
And every vice be resceyued
But Humblesse is all other wise
which most is worth, and no reprise
It takes ageyn, but soft and fair
If any thing stant in contraire
with humble speech it is redressed
Thus was this young maid blessed
The which I spoke of now tofore
Her fathers life she gatte therefore
And wanne withal the kings love
For thy my son if thou wolt love
It sytte the well to leave pride
And take Humblesse on thy side
The more of grace thou shall get
Amans.
My father I woll not foryete
Of this that ye have told me here
And if that any such manner
Of humble port may love appaye
Here afterward I think aslay
But now forth over I beseech
That ye more of my shryfte seche
Confessor.
My good son it shall be do
Now harken and lay an ear to
For as touchende of prydes fare
Als ferforth as I can declare
In cause of vice, in cause of love
That have thou plainly herd above
So that there is no more to say
Touchende of that, but other wey
Touchende envy I think tell
which has the propre kind of hell
without cause to mysdo
Toward him self, and other also
Here afterward as understand
Thou shalt the spices, as they stand.
Explicit liber primus.
Hic in secundo libro tractat de inuidia / et eius speciebus / quarum dolor
alterius gaudii prima nuncupatur / cuius conditionem / secundum vitiu^
Confessor primitus describens amanti, quatenus amore^ concernit, super eode^
co^sequenter opponit.

Incipit liber Secundus.
Inuidiae culpa magis est attrita dolor.
Nam sua men's nullo tempore laeta manet.
Quo gaudent alii, dolet ille, nec vnus amicus
Est, cui de puro commoda velle facit.
Proximitatis honor sua corda veretur, et omnis
Est sibi laetitia sic aliena dolor,
Hoc etenim uitium quam sepe repugnat ama^ti,
Non sibi, sed reliquis, dum fauet ipsa Venus.
Est amor ex propria motu fantasticus, and quae
Gaudia fert alijs credit obesse sibi.
Now after pride the second
There is, which many a woeful stounde
Toward other bearethe about
within him self, and not without
For in his thought he brenneth ever
when that he wot an other lever
Or more vertuos than he
which passes him in his degree
Thereof he takes his maladye
That vice is cleped hot envy
For thy my son if it be so
Thou art, or have ben one of tho
As for to speak in loves cas
If ever yet thyn heart was
Sick of an other man's bele?
So god auaunce my quarele
My father ye a thousand sith
when I have seen another blythe
Of love, and had a goodly chere
Ethna, which brenneth year by year
was than naught so hot as I
Of thylke sore: for which privily
Mine hertes thought within brenneth
The ship, which on the wawes renneth
And is forstormed and forblowe
Is not more payned for a throw
Than I am than, when I se
Another, which that passes me
In that fortune of loves yefte
But father this I tell in shryfte
That no where but in a place
For who that lose or find grace
In other stead, it may naught grieve
But thus ye may right well believe
Toward my lady, that I serve
Though that I weste for to sterue
Mine heart is full of such folly
That I my self may not chasty
when I the court se of Cupide
Approach unto my lady side
Of hem, that lusty ben and fresshe
Though it avail them not a resshe
But only that they ben of speech
My sorrow is than not to seche
But when they rownen in her ere
Than grows all my most fere
And namely when they talen long
My sorrow than be so strong
Of that I se them well at ease
I can not tell my disease
But sire as of my lady selue
Though she have wowers.x. or twelve
For ne mystruste I have of her
(...) greueth naught: for certes sir
I (...) in all this world to seche
(...) woman, that in deed and speech
(...) cetter auyse her, what she does
Ne better, for to say a sothe
(...) her honor at all tide
(...) yet get her a thank beside
(...) ^^^theles I am beknowe
Thy when I se at any throw
(...) if I may it here
That she make any man good chere
Though I thereof have not to done
My thought woll entermete him sone
For though I be my seluen strange
Envy makes mine heart change
That I am sorowfully be stade
Of that I se another glade
with her, but of other all
Of love what so may befall
Or that he fail, or that he speed
Thereof take I but little head
Now have I said my father all
As of this point in special
As ferforthly as I have wyste
Now axeth forder what you list
My son er I ask any more
I think somdele for thy lore
Tell an example of this mattere
Touchende envy, as thou shall here
write in Ciuyle this I find
Though it be not the hounds kind
To eat chafe, yet woll he werne
An ox, which comes to the berne
Thereof to taken any fode
And thus who that it understood
It stant of love in many a place
who that is out of loves grace
And may him self not avail
He would an other should fail
And if he may put any let
He does all that he may to let
whereof I find, as thou shall wit
To this purpose a tale writ.
Hic ponit confessor exemplum contra isto^ saltem / qui in amoris causa altorum
gandiis inuide^tes ne quaquam per hoc fibi ipsis proficiu^t. Et narrat qualiter
quida^ inuines miles nomine Acis / que^ Galathea Nimpha puscherrima toto cord
peramauit / cum ipsi sub quada^ rupe iuxta fitus maris colloquium aduinicem
habuerunt / Polyphemus gigas concussa rupe magnam inde partem super caput Acis
ab alto proiiciens, ipsu^ per inuidiam interfecit. Et cum ipse super hoc dictam
Galatheam rapere voluisset, Neptunus gigante obsistens / ipsa^ inuiolata^ salua

There ben of such mo than twelve
That be not able as of them selue
To get love, and for envy
Upon all other they aspye
And for them lacks, that they would
They keep that none other should
Touchend of love his cause speed
whereof a great ensample I read
which unto this matter accords
As Ovid in his book records
How Polyphemus, whylom wrought
when that he Galathe besought
Of love, which he may not latche
That made him for to wait and watch
By all weyes how it ferde
Till at the last he knew and herd
How that an other had leave
To love there, as he mote leave
As for to speak of any speed
So that he knew none other read
But for to wayten upon all
Till he may se the chance fall
That he her love might grieve
which he him self may not acheue
This Galathe, says the poet
Above all other was unmeet
Of beauty, that men than knew
And had a lusty love and true
A bachyler in his degree
Right such an other as was she
On whom she has her heart set
So that it might naught be let
For yeft ne for no byheste
That she ne was all at his best
This young knight Acis was hot
which her ageynwarde also hot
All only loves, and no mo
Hereof was Polyphemus woe
Through pure envy, and ever aspyde
And wayteth upon every side
when he to geder might se
This young Acis with Galathe
So long he wayteth to and fro
Till at the last he found hem two
In pryue place, where they stood
To speak and have her words good
The place, where as he them syghe
It was under a bank, nyghe
The greatse, and he above
Stood and beheld the lusty love
which each of them till other made
with goodly chere and words glade
That all his heart has set a fire
Of pure envy, and as a vyre
which flies out of a mighty bow
Awey he fled for a throw
As he that was for love wode
when that he saw how it stood
This Polypheme a geaunt was
And when he saw the soth cas
How Galathe him has forsake
And Acis to her love take
His heart may it not forbere
That he ne roreth as a bear
And as it were a wild beast
In whom no reason might areste
He ran Ethna the hylle about
where never yet the fire was out
Fulfilled of sorrow and great disease
That he saw Acis well at ease
Till at the last he him bethoughte
As he, which all envy sought
And tourneth to the bank again
where he with Galathe has seyne
That Acis, whom he thought grieve
Though he him self may not releue
This geaunt with his rude might
Part of the bake he shofe down right
The which even upon Acis fylle
So that with falling of this hylle
This Polyphemus Acis slough
whereof she made sorrow enough
And as she fled from the land
Neptunus took her by the hand
And kept her in so fast a place
Fro Polypheme and his manace
That he with his false envy
He might atteyne her company
This Galathe, of whom I speak
That of her self may not be wreke
without any semblaunt feyned
She has her loves death compleyned
And with her sorrow, and with her woe
She has the gods moved so
That they of pity and of grace
Have Acis in the same place
There he lay dead, into a well
Transformed, as the books tell
with fresshe stremes, and with clear
As he whylom with lusty chere
was fresshe, his love for to queme
And with this rude Polypheme
For his envy and for his hate
They were wroth, and thus algate
My son thou might understand
That if thou wolte in grace stand
with love, thou must leave envy
And as thou will for thy party
Toward thy love stand fre
So must thou suffer a another be
what so byfalle upon thy chance
For it is a unwise vengeance
which to none other man is lefe
And is unto him self grefe.
Amans.
My fader this ensample is good
But how so ever that it stood
with Polyphemus love as tho
It shall not stand with me so
To worchen any felonye
In love, for no such envy
For thy if there ought else be
Now axeth forth, in what degree
It is, and I me shall confess
with shryfte unto your holiness.
Vita sibi solito mentalia gaudia liuor

My good son yet there is
A vice r^uers unto this
which envious takes his gladness
Of that he sees the heaviness
Of other men. For his welfare
(...) when he wot another care
(...) that an other has a fall
He thinks him self aryst with all
Such is the gladshyppe of envy
In worlds thing, and in party
Full often times eke also
In loves cause it stan^ right so
If thou my son haste joy had
when thou an other saw vngladde
Shryue the thereof. My fader yis
I am byknowen unto you this
Of these lovers that louen streyte
And for that point, which they coueyte
Be^ pursuauntes from year to year
In loves court, when I may here
How that they clymbe upon the whele
And when they wene all shall be well
They ben down throw at last
Than am I fed of that fast
And laugh, of that I se them loure
And thus of that they brewe sour
I drink sweet, and am well eased
Of that I wot they ben diseased
But this which I you tell here
Is only for my lady dear
That for none other, that I know
Me recheth not who overthrow
Ne who that stand in love vpryght
But be he squire, be he knight
which to my lady ward pursues
The more he leseth of that he seweth
The more me thinks that I win
And am the more glad within
Of that I wot him sorrow endure
For ever upon such adventure
It is a comfort as men seyne
To him, the which is woe beseyne
To seen an other in his pain
So that they both may complain
where I my self may not avail
To seen an other man's travail
I am right glad if he be let
And though I fare not the bet
His sorrow is to mine heart a game
when that I know it is the same
which to my lady stant inclyned
And has his love not termyned
I am right joyful in my thought
If such envy greueth ought
As I beknowe me culpable
ye that be wise and reasonable
My fader tells your advise
Confessor.
My son envy in to no pryse
Of such a form I understand
Ne might by no reason stand
For this envy has such a kind
That he woll set him self behind
To hinder with a another wight
And gladly lose his own right
To make another lose his
And for to know how it so is
A tale lyche to his matter
I think tell, if thou will here
To show properly the vice
Of this envy, and the malice
Hic ponit Confessor exemplum contra illum / qui sponte sui ipsius detrimentum
in alterius penam maiorem patitur / Et narrat / quod cum Jupiter angelum suum
in forma hominis / vt hominum condiciones exploraret ab excelso in terram misit
/ contigit / quod ipse angelus duos homines / quorum vnus cupidus et alter
inuidus erat, itinet ando spacio quasi vnius diei co^mitabatur. Et cum sero
factum esset Angelus eorum noticie se ipsum tunc manifestans dixit / quod quid
quid alter eoru^ ab ipso donari sibi peci erit, illud statim obtinebit / quod
et socio suo secum comitanti affirmat duplicandum. Super quo cupidus impeditus
auaricia, sperans sibi diuicias carpete duplicatas primo petere recusauit. Quod
cum inuidus animi aduerteret naturam sui vicii concernens ita vt socius suus
vtroque sumine priuare tur, se ipsum monoculum fieri constantur primus ab
Angelo postulabat. Et sic vnius inuidia alterius auariciam maculanit.
Of Iubiter thus I find ywrite
How whylom that he would wit
Upon the pleyntes, which he hard
Among the men, how that it ferde
As of her wrong condycion
To do iustifycacyon
And for that cause down he sent
An Angel, which about went
That he the soth know may
So it befelle upon a day
This angel, which him should inform
was clothed in a man's form
And ouertoke, I understand
Two men, that wenten over land
Through which he thought to aspye
His cause, and goth in company
This Angel with his words wise
Opposes hem in sundry wise
Now loud words and now soft
That made hem to desputen often
And each of hem his reason had
And thus with tales be hem ladde
with good examynacyon
Till he knew the condition
what men they were both two
And saw well at last tho
That one of hem was coueytous
And his felawe was enuyous
And thus, when he has knowlechyng
Anon he feyned departing
And said he mote algate wend
But harken now what fell at end
For than he made hem understand
That he was there of gods sonde
And said them for the kyndship
That they have done him felauship
He would do some grace again
And bad that one of hem should said
what thing is him leuest to crave
And he it shall of yefte have
And over that eke forth with all
He says that other have shall
The double of that his felawe axeth
And thus to them his grace he taxes
The coueytous was wonder glad
And to that other man he badde
And seyth, that he first axe should
For he supposes, that he would
Make his axinge of worlds good
For than he knew well, how it stood
If that him self by double weight
Shall after take, and thus by sleyght
By cause that he would win
He badde his felawe first begin
This enuyous, though it be late
when that he saw be mote algate
Make his axinge first, he thought
If he worship or profit sought
It shall be double to his fere
That would he chese in no manner
But than he shows what he was
Toward envy, and in this cas
Unto this angel thus he said
And for his yefte this be preyde
To make him blind on his own eye
So that his felawe no thing sye
This word was not so so ne spoke
That his one eye anon was look
And his felawe forth with also
was blind on both his eyes two
Tho was that other glad enough
That one wept, and that other lough
He set his one eye at no cost
whereof that other two has lost
Of thylke ensample, which fell tho
Men tell now full often so
The world empeyreth commonly
And yet wot none the cause why
For it accords naught to kind
Mine own harm to seche and find
Of that I shall my brother grieve
I might never well acheue
what seyst thou son of this folly?
My fader, but I should lie
Upon the point, which ye have said
yet was mine heart never laid
But in this wise, as I you told
But evermore if that ye would
Ought else to my shryft say
Touch and envy, I would pray
My son that shall well be do
Now harken and lay thyn care to.

For as the nettle, which up renneth

And makes him fade, and pale of hew
Right so this false enuyous hew
In every place, where he dwells
with falls words, which he tells
He torneth preysynge in to blame
And worship in to worlds shame
Of such lesynge, as he compasses
Is non so good, that he ne passes
Between his tethe: and is backbyted
And through his false tongue endyted
Like to the Sharnebudes kind
Of whose nature this I find
That in the hotest of the day
when comen is the merry may
He spret his wynge, and up he flees
And under all about he sees
The fair lusty flowers spring
But thereof has he no liking
where he seethe of any best
The fylthe, there he makes his feste
And there upon he woll alyghte
There lyketh him none other syghte
Right so this iangler enuyous
Though he a man se virtuous
And full of good condycion
Thereof makes he no mencyon
But else be it not so lyte
whereof that he may set a wit
There renneth he with open mouth
Behind a man, and makes it couth
But all the virtue, which he can
That woll he bide of every man
And openly the vice tell
As he, which of the schole of hell
Is taught, and fostred up with envy
Of household, and of company
where that he has his propre office
To set on every man a vice
How so his mouth be comely
His word sytte evermore a wry
And says the worste that he may
And in this wise now a day
In loves court a man may here
Full often pleyne of this matter
That many enuyous tale is stered
where that it may not be answered
But yet full often it is believed
And many a worthy love is grieved
Through backbytynge of false envy
If thou have made such ianglary
In loves court my son er this
Shryue the thereof. My father yis
But wit ye how: not openly
But otherwhyle privily
when I my dear lady mete
And think how that I am not mete
Unto her high worthynesse
And eke I se the business
Of all this young lusty route
which all day preesen her about
And each of them his time a wayteth
And each of them his tale affayteth
All to deceive an innocent
which woll not be of her assent
And for men said unknow vnkiste
Her thome she holt in her fyfte
So close within her own hand
That there wynneth no man land
She loves not all that she hereth
And thus full often her self she skiereth
And is all ware of HAD I WIST
But for all that mine heart a ryste
when I these common lovers see
That would not hold hem to three
But well ny louen over al
Mine heart is enuyous with all
And ever I am adradde of gyle
In aunter if with any wyle
They might her innocence enchaunte
For thy my words often I haunte
Be hynden hem so as I dare
whereof my lady may beware
I say what ever comes to mouth
And wers I would, if that I couth
^or when I come unto her speech
And that I may enquere and seche
Of such deceyte, I tell it all
And ay the worst in special
So feign I would that she wist
How little they ben for to tryst
And what they would, and what they me^t
So as they be of double intent
Thus toward hem, that wycke mean
My wicked word was ever grene
And netheles the soth to tell
In certain if it so befelle
That alder trewest man ybore
To chose among a thosand score
which were all fully for to tryst
My lady loved, and I it wist
yet rather than he should speed
I would such tales sprede
To my lady, if that I might
That I should all his love unright
And thereto would I do my pain
For certes though I should feyne
And tell, that was never thought
For all this world I might naught
To suffer an other fully win
There as I am yet to begin
For be they good, or be they badde
I would none my lady badde
And that me makes full often aspye
And vsen words of envy
And for to make them bear a blame
And that is but of thylke same
The which unto my lady draw
For ever on them I rounge and gnawe
And hinder hem all that ever I may
And that is sothly for to say
But only to my lady selue
I tell it naught to.x. ne twelve
Thereof I woll me well auyse
To speak or iangle in any wise
That touches to my lady name
The which in ernest and in game
I would sauen to my death
For me had lever to lack breath
Than speak of her name amys
Now have ye herd touchend of this
My father in Confession
And therefore of detraction
In love, that I have my spoke
Tell how ye will it shall be wroke
I am all ready for to bear
My pain, and also to forbere
what thing that ye woll allow
For who is bounden, he must bow
So woll I bow unto your best
For I dare make this byhest
That I to you have nothing hyd
But told right as it is betyde
And otherwise of no myspeche
My conscience for to seche
I can not of envy find
That I my spoke have, ought behind
whereof love ought be myspayde
Now have ye herd, and I have said
what woll ye fader, that I do?
My son do no more so
But ever keep thy tongue still
Thou might the more have thy will
For as thou seyst thy seluen here
My lady is of such manner
So wise, so ware in all thing
It needs of no bakbitynge
That thou thy lady mys inform
For when she knows all the form
How that thy self art enuyous
Thou shall not be so gracyous
As thou parauenture should be else

A worthy knight in Christ's law
Of great Rome, (as is the saw)
The ceptre had for to right
Tybery Constantyn he hight
whose wife was cleped Italye.
But they to geder of progenye
No children had but a maid.
And she the god so well apayde,
That all the wide worlds fame
Spoke worship of her good name.
Constance, as the Cronyke says
She hight: and was so full of faith,
That the greatest of Barbarye
Of hem, which use marchandye
She has converted, as they come
To her upon a time in Rome
To shown such thing, as they brought.
which worthily of hem she bought.
And over that in such a wise
She has hem with her words wise
Of Christ's feyth so full informed.
That they thereto ben all conformed
So that baptysme they receyuen
And all her falls gods weyuen.
when they ben of the feyth certain
They gone to Barbarye ayene
And there the Soudan for hem sent
And axeth hem to what intent
They have her first feyth forsake.
And they, which had undertake
The right feyth to keep and hold
The matter of her tale told
with all the hole circumstaunce
And when the Soudan of Constaunce
Upon the point that they answerde
The beauty and the grace herd
As he, which than was to wedde
In all have his cause spedde
To send for the marriage
And ferthermore with good courage
He says, be so he may her have
That Christ, that came this world to save
He woll believe, and thus recorded
They ben on either side accorded
And there upon to make an end
The Sowdan his hostage send
To Rome, of princes sons twelve
whereof the fader in him selue
was glad, and with the Pope auysed
Two Cardinals he has assised
with other lords many mo
That with his daughter they should go
To se the soudan be converted
Qualiter adueniente Constantia in Barbaria^ matter soldani huiusmodi nuptias
perturbare volens, filium suum vna cum dicta Constantia / cardinalibus que et

quada^ nani absque gubernaculo positam per altum mare ventoru^ flatibus
agitandam in exisium dirigi solum constituit.
But that which never was well herted
Envy tho began to travail
In disturbaunce of this spousayle
So privily that none was ware
The mother, which the souldan bare
was than alive, and thought this
Unto her self: If it so is
My son him wedde in this manner
Than have I lost my joys here
For mine estate shall so be lassed
Thynkend thus she has compassed
By sleyght how that she may begyle
Her son, and fylle within a while
Between hem two wha^ that they were
She feyned words in his ear
And in this wise began to say
My son, I am by double way
with all mine heart glad and blythe
For that my self have often sithe
Desired thou wolte (as men says)
Receive and take a new feyth
which shall be forthrynge of thy life
And eke so worshypfull a wife
The daughter of an emperor
To wedde it shall be great honor
For thy my son I you beseech
That I such grace might areche
when that my daughter come shall
That I may than in especyall
So as me thinks honest
Be thylke, which the first feste
Shall make unto her welcommynge
The Souldan grants her asking
And she thereof was glad enough
For under that anon she drough
with false words that she spoke
Couyn of death behind his back
And thereupon her ordinance
She made so, that when Constance
was comen forth with the Romans
Of clerks and of citezeins
A rich feast she hem made
And most when they weren glade
with false couyn, which she had
Her close envy tho she sprad
And all tho, that hadden be
Or in apperte or in prive
Of counseyle to the marriage
She slough them in a sodeyne rage
Endelonge the board as they ben set
So that it might not be let
Her own son was not quyte
But dyed upon the same plyte
But what the high god woll spare
It may not for the peril mysfare
This worthy maiden, which was there
Stood than, as who says, deed for fere
To se the feast, how that it stood
which all was turned in to blood
The dyss he forth with the cup and all
Be bled they weren over all
She saw hem dye on every side
No wonder though she wept and cryde
Making many a woeful moan
when all was slain but she al onne
This old fend, this Sarazyn
Let take anon this constantyn
with all the good she theder brought
And has ordained as she thought
A naked ship witout stere
In which the good, and her in fere
Vytaled full for years five
where that the wind it would dayue
She put upon the wawes wild
Qualiter nauis cu^ Constancia in parts Anglie, que tu^c pagana fuit prope
Humber sub quo dam Castello regis, qui tunc Allee vocabatur post triennium
applicuit, quam quidam miles no mine Elda dicti castelli tunc custos et naui

But he, which all things may shilde
Three year, till that she comes to land
Her ship to stere has take on hand
And in Northumberlonde arryueth
And happeth than, that she dryueth
Under a castle with the floode
which upon Humber bank stood
And was the kings own also
The which Allee was cleped tho
A Saxon, and a worthy knight
But he believes not aryght
Of this castle was castelleyne
Elda the kings chamberlayne
A knyghtly man after his law
And when he saw upon the wawe
The ship driuend alone so
He had anon men shulden go
^^se, what it be token may
^his was upon a summer day
^he ship was looked and she found
E^da within a little stounde
I^ wist and with his wife anon
^^warde this young lady gone
where that they fond great riches
B^^ she her would not confess
w^^n they her asken, what she was
(...) netheles upon the cas
(...) of the ship with great worship
They took her in to felaushyp
As they that weren of her glade
B^^ she no manner joy made
But soroweth sore, of that she fond
No christendom in thylke land
But else she has all her will
And thus with them she dwells still
Dame Hermegyld, which was the wife
Of Elda, lyche her own life
Constance loves, and it fell so
Spekende all day between hem two
Through grace of gods purueyance
This maiden taught the creaunce
Unto this wife so perfectly
Upon a day that fast by
In presence of her husband
where they go walkende on the stronde
A blind man, which came there ladde
Unto this wife cryende he badde
with both his hondes up, and prayde
To her, and in this wise he said
O Hermegylde, which Christ's feith
Informed, as Constance seyth
Received have: give me my sight
Upon this word her heart aflyght
Thynkende what was best to done
But netheles she she herd his bone
And said, in trust of Christ's law
which done was on the cross and slawe
Thou blind man behold and se
with that to god upon his kne
Thankende he took his sight anon
whereof they marueyle every chone
But Elda wondreth most of all
This open thing which is befalle
Concludes him by such awey
That he the feyth most needs obey.
Qualiter quidam inuenis miles in amorem Constantie exardeseens, pro eo quod
ipsa sibi consentire nolint, eam de morte Hermegylde, quam ipse noctanter
interfecit, verbis detractorne accufaint / sed angelus domini ipsu sic
detrahentem in mayilla subito percutiens / non solum pro mendaci comprobauit,
sed ^etu mortali post ipsine confessionem penitus interfecit.
Now list what fell upon this thing
This Elda forth unto the king
A morrow took his wey and rode
And Hermegylde at home abode
Forth with Constance well at ease
Elda, which thought his king to plese
As he, that than unwedded was
Of Constance all the pleyne cas
As goodly as he couth, told
The king was glad, and said he would
Come thither in such a wise
That he him might of her auyse
The time appointed forth withal
This Elda trust in special
Upon a knight whom from childhode
He had up draw in to manhood
To him he told all that he thought
whereof that after him forthought
And netheles at thylke tide
Unto his wife he had him ride
To make ready all thing
Against the coming of the king
And says that he him self tofore
Thinks for to come, and bod therefore
That he him keep, and told him wha^
This knight rode forth his wey than
And soth was, that of time passed
He had in all his wit compassed
How be Constance might win
But he saw tho no speed therein
whereof his lust began to bate
And that was love, is than hate
Of her honor he had envy
So that upon his trecherye
A lesynge in his heart he cast
Till he come home, he hygheth fast
And does his lady to understand
The message of her husbonde
And thereupon the long day
They setten things in arraye
That all was as it should be
Of every thing in his degree
And when it came into the night
This wise her has to bed dyght
where that this maiden with her lay
This false knight upon delay
Has tarried till they were aslepe
As he that woll time keep
His deadly works to fulfylle
And to the bed he stalketh stylle
where that he wist was the wife
And in his hand a rasour knyfe
He bare, with which her throat he cut
And privily the knyfe he put
Under that diere beds lyde
where that Constance lay beside
Elda come home the same night
And stylle with a preuy light
As he that would not awake
His wife, he has his weye take
In to the chamber: and there lyggende
He fond his dead wife bledende
where that Constance fast by
was fall aslepe: and suddenly
He cried aloude, and she awoke
And forth withal cast a look
And saw this lady blede there
whereof swouned dead for fear
She was: and stylle as any stone
She lay, and Elda thereupon
In to the Castle clepeth out
And up sterte every man about
In to the chamber forth they went.
But he which all untruth meant
This false knight among them all
Upon the thing, which is befall
Seith: that Consta^ce has do this deed
And to the bed with that he yede
After the falseheed of his speech
And made him there for to seche
And fond the knyfe, where he it laid
And than he cried, and thus he said
Lo se the knyfe all blody here
what needs more in this matere
To ask? and thus her innocence
He sclaundreth there in audience
with false words, which he feyneth
But yet for all that ever he pleyneth
Elda no full credence took
And happed that there lay a book
Upon the which, when he it syghe
This knight has swore: and said on high
That all men might it wit
Now by this book, which is here write
Constance is gyltyfe well I wot
with that the ho^de of heaven him smote
In token of that he has forswore
There he was both his eyes lore
Out of his heed the same stounde
They stert, and so they were found
A voice was herd, when that they fell
which said: O damned man to hell
Lo thus has god thy sclaunder wroke
That thou ageyn Constance has spoke
Be know the sothe er that thou dye
And he told out his felonye
And starte forth with his tale anon
In to the ground, where al gone
This dead lady was begraue
Elda which thought his honor save
All that he may, restreyneth sorrow.
Qualiter rex Allee ad fidem Christi conuersus baptismum recepit: et

fuisset, ipse ad debellandu^ cum feotis iter arripuit, et ibide^ super guerras

For he the second day at morrow
The king came, as they were accorded
And when it was to him recorded
what god has wrought upon this chance
He took it in to remembrance
And thought more than he said
For all his hole heart he laid
Upon Constance: and said he should
For love of her, if that she would
Baptysme take, and Christ's feyth
Believe: and over that he says
He would her wedde: and upon this
Assured each to other is
And for to make short tales
There came a bishop out of wales
Fro Bangor: and Lucye he hight
which through the grace of god almight
The king, with many other mo
He christened: and between hem two
He has fulfilled the marriage
But for no lust, ne for no rage
She told him never what she was.
And netheles upon this cas
^he king was glad, how so it stood

The time set of kind is come
This lady has her chamber nome
And of a son borne fulle
whereof that she was joyful
She was delivered saufe and sone
The bishop, as it was to done
yafe him baptism, and Moris calls
And thereupon as it befalls
with letters written of record
They sent unto her lyege lord
That kepers weren of the queen
And he, that should go between
The messanger to Knaresburgh
which town he should pass through
Rydende came the first day
The kings mother there lay
whose right name was Domylde
which after all the cause spylde
For he, which thank deserve would
Unto this lady gothe and told
Of his message, how it ferde
And she with feyned joy it herd
And yafe him yeftes largely
But in the night al privily
She took the letters, which he had
Fro point to point and over rad
As she, that was through out untrue
And let do write other new
Instead of hem: and thus they speak.
Prima fitsera in commendacionem Constancy ab episcopo Regi missa per Domisdam
in contrarium fassata.
That thou with us be not wroth
Though we such thing, as is the loath
Upon our troth certifye
Thy wife, which is of fairie
Of such a child delivered is
Fro kind, which stant all amys
But for it should not be say
we have it kept out of the way
For dread of pure worlds shame
A poor child, and in the name
Of thylke, which is so mysbore
we took, and thereto we be swore
That none, but only thou and we
Shall know of this priuete
Morys it hatte, and thus men wene
That it was borne of the queen
And of thine own body get
But this thing may not be foryete
That thou ne send us word anon
what is thy will thereupon.
This letter, as thou have herd devise
was counterfete in such a wise
That no man should it apperceyue
And she, which thought to deceive
It leyth, where she that other took
This messanger, when he awoke
And wist nothing how it was
Arose and rode the great pas
And took his letters to the king
And when he saw this wondre thing
He makes the messanger no chere
But netheles in wise manner
He wrote again, and yafe him charge
That they ne suffer not at large
His wife to go but keep her still
Till they have herd more of his will
This messanger was yeftles
But with his letter netheles
Or be him lefe or be him loathe
In all haste again he gothe
By Knaresburgh, and as he went
Unto the mother his intent
Of that he fond toward the king
He told, and she upon this thing
Seyth, that he should abide all night
And made him feast and chere aright
Feined as though she could him thoke
But he with strong wine which he dronke
Forth with the travail of the day
was drunk: aslepe and while he lay
She has his letters ouersaye
And formed in an otherway
Therewas a new letter write.
Secunda fetiera per regem episcopo remissa a Domisda iterum fassata.
which he says: I do you for to wite
That through the counsel of you two
I stand in point to be undo
As he, which is a king deposed
For every man it has supposed
How that my wife Constance is fay
And if that I feyne any delay
To put her out of company
The worship of my regalye
Is lore: and over this they tell
Her child shall not among hem dwell
To claymen any heritage
So can I se none advantage
But all is lost, if she abide
For thy to look on every side
Toward the myschefe as it is
I charge you, and bid this
That ye the same ship vittayle
In which, that she took arryuayle
Therein and puts both two
Her self forth with her child also
And so forth brought in to the deep
Betaketh her the sea to keep
Of four days time I set
That ye this thing no longer let
So that your life be not forfete.
And thus this letter counterfete
The messanger, which was unware
Upon the kings halue bare
And where he should it has betake
But when that they have head take
And rad, that written is within
So great a sorrow they begin
As they her own mother ^eyen
Brenne in a fire before their eyes
There was weeping and there was woe
But finally the thing is do
Upon the sea they have her brought
But she the cause wist naught
And thus upon the floode they won
This lady with her young son
And than her hands to the heaven
She straught: and with a mylde steven
Knelende upon her bare kne
She said: O high majesty
which see the point of every troth
Take of thy woeful woman routh
And of this child, which I shall keep
And with that word she began to weep
Swouned as dead, and there she lay
But he, which all things may
Comfort her, and at last
She looks, and her eyes cast
Upon her child, and said this
Of me no manner charge it is
what sorrow I suffer, but of the
Me thinks it is great pity
For if I sterue thou must deye
So mote I needs by that weye
For motherheed, and for tenderness
with all mine hole besynes
Ordeyne me for thylke office
As she, which shall be thy noryce
Thus was she strengthed for to stand
And tho she took her child in hand
And yafe it souke, and ever among
She wept, and otherwhyle song
Lo rock with her child aslepe
And thus her own child to keep
She has under the gods cure.

Unknow, what her shall betyde
And tell to that by nyghtes tide
This knight without felaushyp
Has take a boot, and came to ship
And thought of her his lust to take
And swore, if she him danger make
That certainly she should deye
She saw there was none other wey
And said he should her well comfort
That he first look out at port
That no man were nygh the stead
which might know, what they deed
And than he may do what he would
He was right glad, that she so told
And to the port anon be ferde.
She prays god, and he her herd
And sodeinly he was out throw
And dreynt, and tho began to blow

And thus the mighty gods hand
Her has conveyed, and defended

Her ship was drive upon a day
where that a great nauye lay
Of ships, all the world at ones
And as god would for the nones
Her ship goth in among hem all
And stynt not, er it be by fall
And has that vessel under get
which master was of all the flete
But there it rests and abode
This great ship on anchor rode
The lord come forth, and when he sygh
That other ligge on board so nyghe
He wondreth, what it might be
And badde men to go in and se
This lady tho was crope a side
As she that would her seluen hyde
For she newyst, what they were
They sought about, and fond her there
And broughten up her child and her
And thereupon this lord to sper
Began, fro whens that she came
And what she was: Quod she, I am
A woman woefully bestadde
I had a lord, and thus he badde
That I sorth with my little son
Upon the wawes should won
But why the cause wot I naught
But he which all things wrought
yet ay I thank him of his might
My child and me so kept vpryght
That we be saufe both two
This lord her asks euermo
How she believes, and she seyth
I leave and trust in Christ's feyth
which dyed upon the roode tree
what is thy name tho quod he?
My name is Coust she him said
But furthermore for naught he prayde
Of her astate to know plain
She would him nothing else said
But of her name, which she feigned
All other things she restrained
That o word more she ne told
This lord than asks if she would
with him abide in company
And said, he came from Barbarye
To Rome ward, and home he went
Tho she supposes what it meant
And says she would with him wend
And dwell unto her lives end
Be so it be to his pleasaunce
And thus upon her acquaintance
He told her plainly as it stood
Of Rome how that the gentill blood
In Barbarye was betrayed
And thereupon he has assayed
By war, and take such vengeance
That none of thylke allyaunce
By whom the treson was compassed
Is from the sword alive passed
But of Constaunce how it was
That couthe he know by no cas
where she bycame, so as be said
Her ere unto his word she leyde
But forther made she no chere
And netheles in this mattere
It happed that ylke time so
This lord, with whom she should go
Of Rome was the senator
And of her father the emperor
His brother daughter has to wife
which has her father eke on live
And was Salustes cleped tho
His wife Eleyne hight also
To whom Constaunce was cosyne.
Thus to the seek a medicine
Has god ordained of his grace
That forth in the same place
This senator his troth plyght
For ever, while he live might
To keep her in worship, and in wealth
Be so that god woll give her health
This lady, which fortune him send
And thus by ship forth say lend
Her and her child to Rome be brought
And to his wife tho he besought
To take her in to company
And she, which couth of curtosye
All that a good wife should conne
was inly glad, that she has won
The fellowship of so good one
This emperors daughter Custe
Forth with the daughter of Saluste
was kept, but no man redely
Knew, what she was: and not for thy

In her estate of high degree
And every life her loves well

And they him said, that no where
In all the world, though men it sought

For she it had well deserved

That he shall never more be glad

And thus his young unlusty life

Till it besel upon a day
when he his werres had acheuede
And thought he would be releuede
Of soul hele upon the feyth
which he has take, than he seyth
That he to Rome in pylgremage
would go, where Pope was Pel^ge
To take his absolucyon
And upon this condition
He made Edwyn his leutenaunt
which beyre was apparaunt
That he the land in his absence
Shall rewle, and thus by prouydence
Of all things well by gonne
He took his leave, and forth is gone
Elda, which tho was with hem there
Er they fullyche at Rome were
was sent tofore to purucye
And he his guide upon the weye
In help to ben his herbegeour
Has axed, who was Senator
That he his name might kenne
Of Lapodoce, he said, Arcenne
He byght: and was a worthy knight
To hem goth Elda tho forth right
And told him of his lord tydinge
And prayed, that for his coming
He would assygne him herbergage
And be so did of good courage.
when all is do, that was to done
The king him self came after sone
This Senator when that be come
To Lust, and to his wife at home
Has told, bow such a king Alle^
Of great array to the Lyte
was come, and Lust upon his tale
with heart close, and color pale
A swoune fell, and he meruaylleth
So suddenly what thing her eyleth
And caught her vpand when she woke
She fygheth with a pytous look
And feyneth sickness of the sea
But it was for the king Allee
For joy, which was in her thought
That god him has to town brought
This king has spoke with the pope
And told all that he couthe grope
what greueth in his conscience
And than he thought in reverence
Of his estate, er that he went
To make a feast, and thus he sent
Unto the Senator, to come
Upon the morrow, and other some
To sytte with him at mete
This tale has Lust not foryete
But to Morys, her son told
That be upon the morrow should
In all that ever he couth and might
Be present in the kings sight
So that the king him often sye
Morys tofore the kings eye
Upon the morrow, where he sat
Full often stood, and upon that
The king his chere upon him cast
And in his face him thought als fast
He saw his own wife Lonstance
For nature, as in resemblaunce
Of face, him lyketh so to clothe
That they were of a suyte both
The king was moved in his thought
Of that be sees, and knows it naught
This child be loves kyndely
And yet he wot no cause why
But well he sygh and understood
That be toward Arcenne stood
And axeth him anon right there
if that this child his son were
He said ye, so I him call
And would it were so by fall
But it is all in other wise
And tho began be to deuyse
How he the chyldes mother fond
Upon the sea from every land
within a ship was sterles
And how this lady helpeles
Forth with her child he has forth draw
The king has understand his saw
The childs name and axeth tho
And what the mother hight also
That he him would tell he prayde
Morys this child is hot he said
His mother hat Lust, and this
I not what manner name it is
But Allee wist well enough
whereof somdele smylend he lough
For Lust in Saxon is to said
Coustance upon the word Romayn
But who that couthe specyfye
what tho fell in his fantasye
And how his wit about renneth
Upon the love, in which he brenneth
It ware a wonder for to here
For he was neither there ne here
But clean out of him self awey

So feign he would it were she

That contenaunce for a throw

The man, which lies in purgatory
Desires not the heaven more
That he ne longs also sore
To wit, what him shall betyde
And when the bordes were aside
And every man was rise about
The king has weyued all the route
And with the Senator alone
He spoke, and prayed him of a bone
To se this Custe where she dwells
At home with him, so as he tells
The Senator was well apayde
This thing no longer was delayed
To see this Lust goth the king
And she was warned of the thing
And with Eleyne forth she came

Good head, and when he sigh his wife

where as it thought him for the best
Has sundry places for to rest
And as fortune would tho
He was dwellend at one of tho
The king Allee forth with thassent
Of Custe his wife has thither sent
Morice his son, as he was taught
To The Emperor, and he goth straught
And in his father halue he sought
As he which his lordship sought
That of his high worthynes
He would do so great mekenes
His own town to come and se
And y^ue a time in the cite
So that his fader might him get
That he would ones with him ete
This lord has granted his request
And when the day was of the feste
In worship of the Emperor
The king, and eke the Senator
Forth with her wynes both two
with many a lord and lady mo
On horse ryden him again
Till it befell upon a plain
They sygh, where he was comend

Spoke to her lord, that he abide
So that I may tofore ride
To ben upon his bien venu
The first, which shall him salu
And thus after her lords grant
Upon a mule white amblaunt
Forth with a few rode this queen
They wondered, what she would mean
And ryden after a soft pas
But when this lady comen was
To the emperor, in his presence
She said aloude in audience
My lord my father well you be
And of this time that I se
your honor, and your good bele
which is the help of my quarele
I thank unto the gods might
For joy his heart was aflyght
Of that she told in remembrance
And when he wyste, it was Constaunce
was never father half so blythe
wepend be kyste her often sithe
So was his heart all overcome
For though his mother were come
Fro death to life out of the grave
He might no more wonder have
Than he has, when that he her syghe
with that her own lord come nyghe
And is to the emperor obeyed
And when the fortune is bewreyed
How that Constaunce is come about
So hard an heart was none out
That he for pity tho ne wept
Arcenius, which her fond and kept
was than glad of that is fall
So that with joy among hem all
They ryden in at Rome gate
This Emperor thought all to late
Till that the pope were come
And of tho lords send some
To pray him, that he woll haste
And he came forth in all haste
And when that be this tale herd
How wonderly this chance ferde
He thanked god of his miracle
To whose might may be none abstable
The king a noble feste hem made
And thus they were all glad
A perlement or that they went
They setten unto this intent
To put Rome in full espeyre
That Moris was apparent heir
And should abide with hem stylle
For such was all the lands will

Of sorrow and queynt was all the smoke
Tho took his leave All the kynye
And with full many a rich thing
which thmperour him badde give
He has a glad life for to live
For be constance has in his hand
which was the comfort of his land
For when that he come home again
There is no tongue that might seyne
what joy was that ylke stounde
Of that he has his queen found
which first was sent of gods sonde
when she was driven upon the stronde
By whom the mysbileue of sin
was left, and Christ's feyth came inn
To hem that whilome were blind

And for no gold may be forbought
The death comend er he besought
Took with this king such acqueynta^ce
That he with all his retenaunce
Ne myhht not defend his life
And thus he parts from his wife
which than made sorrow enough
And thereupon her heart droughe
To leave England for ever
And go where she had lever
To Rome, whens that she came
And thus of all the land she nam
Her leave, and goth to Rome again
And after that the books seyne
She was not there but a throw
when death of kind has overthrow
Her worthy father, which men said
That between her arms deyde
And afterward the year suende
The god of her has made an end
And fro this worlds fayrye
Has take her in to company
Morys her son was coroned
which so ferforth was abandoned
To Christ's feyth, that men him call
Morys the chrystnest of all
And thus the whele menynge of love
was at last set above
And so, as thou haste herd tofore
The false tunges were lore
which upon love would lie

In a Cronyke, as thou shall wit
A great ensample I find writ
which I shall tell upon this thing
Philyp of Macedony the king
Two sons had by his wife
whose fame yet in Greece is ryfe
Demetrius the first brother
was hot, and Perseus that other
Demetrius men sayden tho
The better knight was of the two
To whom the land was attendant
As he which heir was apparaunt
To regne after his fathers day
But that thing, which no water may
Quench in this world, but ever brenneth
In to his broders heart it renneth
The proud envy of that he syghe
His brother should clyme on high
And he to him mote than obey
That may he suffer by no weye
with strength durst he no thing fond
So took he lesynge upon hand
when he sygh time, and spoke thereto
For it befelle that time so
His father great wars had
with Rome, which he streyte ladde
Through mighty hand of his ma^hod
As he which has enough knyghthod
And often hem had sore grieved
But er the werre were acheued
As he was upon ordinance
At home in Greece, it fell par chance
Demetrius, which often about
Rydend was, stood that time out
So that this Perse in his absence
which bare the tongue of pestylence
with falls words, which he feyneth
Upon his own brother pleyneth
In priuete behind his bake
And to his father thus he spoke
My dear father I am hold
By wey of kind, as reason would
That I fro you shall nothing hyde
which might torn in any side
Of your estate into greuaunce
For thy mine hertes obeysaunce
Toward you I think keep
For it is good ye take keep
Upon a thing, which is me told
My brother has us all sold
To hem of Rome: and you also
For than they be hot him so
That he with them shall regne in pes
Thus has he cast for his encres
That your estate shall go to naught
And thus to prove shall be brought
So ferforth, that I undertake
It shall not well mow be forsake
The king upon his tale answerde
And said: If this thing, which he herd
Be soth, and may be brought to prove:
It shall not be to his behoue
which so has shapen us the werste
For he him self shall be the ferste
That shall be deed, if that I may
Thus afterward upon a day
when that Demetrius was come
Anon his father has him nome
And badde to his brother Perse
That he his tale shall rehearse
Of thylke treason, which he told
And he which all untruth would
Counseyleth, that so high a need
Be treted, where as it may speed
In common place of judgment
The king thereto yafe his assent
Demetrius was put in hold
whereof that Perseus was bold
Thus stood the troth under the charge
And the falseheed goth at large
which through behest has overcome
The greattest of the lords some
That priuelyche of his accord
They stand, as witness of record
The judge was made favorable
Thus was the law deceyuable
So ferforth that the troth fond
Rescous none: and thus the land
Forth with the king deceived were
The gylteles was dampened there
And deyde upon accusement
But such a false conspirement
Though it be prive for a throw
God would not it were unknow
And this was afterward well proved
In him, which has the death co^troued
Of that his brother was so slain
This Perseus was wondre feign
As he, that was heir apparaunt
Upon the reygne expectaunt
whereof he wax so proud and vein
That he his father in disdeyne
Has take: and set at none account
As he, which thought him to surmou^t
That where he was first debonayre
He was tho rebelle and contrayre
And not as heir, but as a king
He took upon him in all thing
Of malice and of tyrrannye
In contempt of Regalye
Lyuende his father: and so wrought
That when the father him bethought
And syghe to whether side it drough
Anon he wyste well enough
How Perse after his false tongue
Has so thenuyous belles ronge
That he has slain his own brother
whereof as than he knew none other
But suddenly the judge he nome
which corrupt satte upon the dome
In such a wise, and has him pressed
That he the soth him has confessed
Of all that has be spoke and do
More sorry, than the king was tho
was never man upon this molde
And thought in certain, that he would
Vengeance take upon this wrong
But the other party was so strong
That for the law of no statute
There may no right be execute
And upon this division
The land was turned up so down
whereof his heart is so distraught
That he for pure sorrow has caughte
The maladye, of which nature
Is queynt in every creature
And wha^ this king was passed thus
This false tonged Perseus
The regyment has vnderfonge
But there may nothing stand long
which is not upon troth grounded
For god, which al thing has bou^ded
And syghe the falseheed of his gyle
Has set him but a little while
That he shall reign upon depose
For suddenly right as the rose
So suddenly down he fell.
In thylke time so it befelle
This new king, of new pride
with strength shope him for to ride
And said he would to Rome fast
whereof he made a besye haste
And has assembled him an hooste
In all that ever he might most
what man that might wepen bear
Of all he would none forbere
So that it might not be nombred
The folk which after were encombred
Through him, that god would overthrow
Anon it was at Rome know
The pomp, which that Perse lad
And the Romans that time had
A consul, which was cleped thus
By name, Paulus Emilius
A noble, a worthy knight withal
And he, which chief was of hem all
This werre on hand has undertake
And when he should his leave take
Of a young daughter, which was his
She wept: and he what cause it is
Her asks: and she him answerde
That Perseus is dead: and he it herd
And wondreth what she mean would
And she upon childehode him told
That Perse her little hounde is dead.
with that he pulls up his heed
And made right a glad vysage
And said, how that was a presage
Touchende to that other Perse
Of that fortune him should adverse
He says for such a prenostyke
Most of an hounde was to him like
For as it is an bounds kind
To berke upon a man behind
Right so behind his brothers back
(with false words, which he spoke)
He has do slain, and that is routh
But he, which hates all untruth
The high god it shall redress
^or so my daughter prophetess
Y^^^h with her little hounds does
^^^keneth: and thus forth he geth
Comforted of this euydence
with the Romans in his defense
Again the Greeks that been comende
This Perseus as naught seende
This myschefe which that him abode
with all his multitude rode
And prided him upon this thing
Of that he was become a king
And how he had his reygne get
That he has all the right foryete
which longs unto governance
whereof through gods ordinance
It fell upon the winter tide
That with his host he should ride
Over Danubye thylke floode
which all be frossen than stood
So hard, that he wend well
To pass, but the blind whele
which tourneth often, er men be ware
Thilke ice, which that the horsemen bare
To brake, so that a great party
was dreynt of the chivalry
The rerewarde it took aweye
Came none of hem to land drey
Paulus this worthy knight romayn
By his aspye it herd said
And hastes him all that he may
So that upon that other day
He came, where he this host beheld
And that was in a large field
where the baners ben displayed
He has anon his men arrayde
And when that he was enbatayled
He goth, and has the field assailed
And slough, and took all that he fond
whereof the Macedonye land
which through king Alisander honored
Long time stood: was tho devoured
To Perse and all that infortune
They wit, so that the comune
Of all the land his heir exile
And he dispeyred for the while
Disguysed in a poor wede
To Rome goth: and there for need
The craft, which thylke time was
To worken in latou^, and in bras
He lerneth for his sustenaunce
Such was the sons purueyaunce
And of his father it is said
In strong prison that he was leyde
In Albe, where that he was dead
For honger and defaulte of bread
The hounde was token and prophecy
That lyche an hounde he should dye
which lyche was of condition
when he with his detraction
Bark on his brother so behind

Of falls Semblaunt if I shall tell
Above all other it is the well
Out of the which deceyt flows
There is no man so wise, that knows
Of thylke flode, which is the tide
He how he should him selfen guide
To take saufe passage there
And yet the wind to man's ere
Is soft, and as it seems out
It makes clear weder all about
But thought it seem, it is not so
For falls S^mblaunt has ever mo
Of his counsayll in company
The derke untrue hipocrysye
whose word discordeth to his thought
For thy they ben to gyder brought
Of one couyne, of one house hold
As it shall after this be told
Of falls Semblaunt it needs naught
To tell of old ensamples ought
For all day in experyence
A man may see thylke euydence
Of fair words, which he hereth
But yet the barge envy stereth
And halt it ever fro the land
which falls Semblau^t with ore in hond
It roweth, and woll not arryue
But let it on the wawes drive
In great tempest, and great debate
whereof that love and his estate
Empeyreth: And therefore I read
My son that thou fle and dread
This vice: and what that other seyn
Let thy semblaunt be true and pleyn
For falls Semblaunt is thylke vice
which never was without office
where that envy thinks to gyle
He shall be for that ylke while
Of pryue counsayll messagere
For when his semblaunt is most clear
Than is he most derke in his thought
Thought men him se they know him naught
But as it shows in the glass
Thing which therein never was
So shows it in his vysage
That never was in his courage
Thus does he all his thing by sleyghte
Now lay thy conseyence in weight
My good son, and shryue the here
If thou were ever customere
To falls Semblaunt in any wise.
For ought I can me yet auyse
My good father certes no
If I for love have don so
Now asks, I would pray you
For else I wot never how
Of falls semblaunt that I have gylt
My son and sethin that thou wylt
That I shall ask, gab naught
But tell, if ever was thy thought
with falls Semblaunt and Couerture
To wit of any creature
How that he was with love ladde
So were he sorry, were he glad
when that thou wystyst how it were
All that he rouneth in thyn ere
Thou toldest forth in other place
To setten him fro loves grace
Of what woman that the best list
There as no man his counseyll wist
But thou, by whom he was deceived
Of love, and from his purpose weyued
And thoughtest that his disturbaunce
Thyn own cause should auaunce
As who says, I am so selce
There may no man's priuete
Ben heled halue so well as mine
Art thou my son of such engyn
Tell on? My good father nay
As for the more part I say
But of somedele I am beknowe
That I may stand in thylke row
Among hem, that slaundres use
I woll not me thereof excuse
That I with such color ne steyne
when I my best semblant feyne
To my fellow till that I wot
All his counseylle both cold and hot
For by that cause I make him chere
^^ll I his love know, and here
And if so be mine heart soucheth
(...) ought unto my lady touches
(...) that he woll me tell
(...) I run unto the well
(...) water in the fire
(...) his carre amyd the mire
(...) I have his counsel know
(...) sith I overthrow
(...) he weneth best to stand
(...) this I do you understand
(...) man love else where
(...) my lady be naught there
(...) tell, I will it hyde
(...) no word escape aside
(...) disceyte of no semblaunt
(...) b^cke I no covenant
(...) ^^keth ^at in other place
(...) no man of his grace
(...) to be inquisitife
(...) ^^^we an other man's life
where that he love, or love naught
That touches nothing to my thought
(...) it passes through mine care
(...) as a thing that never were
(...) foryete, and laid beside
(...) if it touch on any side
My lady, as I have er spoken
My ne^^es ben naught than loken
For certes when that betyt
My will mine heart, and all my wit
Ben fully set to harken and spear
that any man woll speak of her
Thus have I feyned company
Full often, for I would aspye
what thing it is, that any man
Tell of my worthy lady can
And for two causes I do this
The first cause whereof is
If that I might harken and seek
That any man of her mysspeke
I woll excuse her so fully
That when she wist it inderly
Mine hope should be the more
To have her thank for evermore
That other cause, I you assure
Is, why that I by couerture
Have feyned semblaunt often time
To them that passen all day byme
And ben lovers as well as I
For this I wene truly
That there is of hem all none
That they ne louen every chone
My lady. For sothelyche I leave
And durst setten it in preue
Is none so wise that should asterte
But he were lustles in his heart
For why, and he my lady sye
Her vysage, and her goodly eye
But he her loved, er he went
And for that such is mine intent
That is the cause of mine aspye
why that I feyne company
And make fellow over all
For gladly would I known all
And hold me couerte always
That I fulle often ye or nay
Ne list answer in any wise
But feynynge semblaunt as the wise
And harken tales till I know
My ladies lovers all arowe
And when I here, how they wrought
I fare as though I herd naught
And as I no word understood
But that is nothing for her good
For leueth well, and soth is this
That when I know all how it is
I woll but forthren hem alyte
But all the werste I can endyte
I tell it unto my lady plat
For fortherynge of mine own estate
And hyndre them all that ever I may
But for all that yet dare I say
I find unto my self no bote
All though mine heart needs mote
Through strength of love all that I here
Discover unto my lady dear
For in good feyth I have no might
To hele fro that sweet wight
If that it touches her any thing
But this wot well the heaven king
That sythen first the world began
Unto none other strange man
Ne feyned I semblaunt ne chere
To wit or ask of his matere
Though that he loves.x. or twelve
when it was naught my ladies selue
But if he would ask any read
Alonlyche of his own head
How he with other loves ferde
His tales with mine ears I herd
But to mine heart came it naught
Ne sanke no depper in my thought
But held counsel, as I was bid
And told it never in other stead
But let it passen, as it come
Now father say, what is thy dome
And how thou wolt, that I be peyned
For such semblaunt as I have feyned.
My son if reason be well peysed
There may no virtue be vnpreysed
Ne vice none be set in pryse
For thy my son, if thou be wise
Do no viser upon thy face
which as woll not thyn heart embrace
For if thou do, within a throw
To other men it shall be know
So might thou lightly fall in blame
And lose a great part of thy name
And netheles in this degree
Full often time thou might se
Of such men, as now a day
This vice setten in assaye
I speak it for no man's blame
But for to warn the, the same
My son as I may here talk
In every place where I walk
I not, if it be so or none
But it is many days gone
That I first herd tell this
How false Semblaunt has be, and is
Most commonly from year to year
with them that dwell among us here
Of such as we Lumbardes call
For they ben the slyest of all
So as men said in town about
To feyne and show thing without
which is reuers to that within
whereof that they full often win
when they by reason should lose
They ben the last, and yet they chese
And we the first, and yet behind
we gone, there as we shulden find
The profit of our own land
Thus gone they free without bond
To done her profit all at large
And other men bear all the charge
Of Lumbardes unto this couyne
(which all lands conne engyne)
May false Semblaunt in especial
Be lykened: for they over all
where that they think for to dwell
Among them self, so as they tell
First ben informed for to lere
A craft, which cleped is Facrere
For if Facrere come about
Than afterward hem stant no doubt
To void with a subtle hand
The best goods of the land
And bring chafe, and take corn
where as Facrere goth beforne
In all his weye he fynt no let
That door can none vssher shette
In which he list to take enter
And thus the counsel most secre
Of every thing Facrere knows
which in to strange place he blows
where as he wot it may most grieve
And thus Facrere makes believe
So that full often he has deceived
Er that he may ben apperceyued
Thus is this vice for to dread
Fr who these old books read
Of such ensamples as we are
Him ought be the more ware
Of all tho that feyne chere
whereof thou shalt a tale here
Hic p^nit Confessor exemplum contra iftos, ^ui suo^ diffimulate beniuosentie
specuso alios in amore defrandant, Et narrat quafiter Hercules cum ipse quoddam
flunium enius vada non nonit cu^ D^^^nyra transmeaie proposuit / supueniens

Of falls semblant, which is believed
Full many a worthy wight is grieved
And was long time or we was bore
To the my son I will therefore
A tale tell, of falls Semblaunt
which falseth many a covenant
And many a fraud of falls counsaylle
There be hongend upon his seyle
And that aboughten gylteles
Both De^anyre, and Hercules
(...) which in great disese fell
Through falls Semblau^t, as I shall tell
when Hercules within a throw
(...) has his heart throw
Upon this fair De^anyre
It tell him on a day desire
Upon a river as be stood
That pass he would over the floode
without bote, and with him led
His love, but he was in dread
(...) tendresse of that sweet wight
(...) he knew not the forde aryght
There was a geaunt than nygh
which Nessus hight: and when he sygh
This Hercules and De^anire
within his heart he began conspire
As he which through his treachery
Has Hercules in great envy
^^iche he bare in his heart look
And than he thought it shall be wroke
But he ne durst netheles
^^^ne this worthy Hercules
^all^ in debate, as for to feyght
But f^yned Semblaunt all by sleyght
Of friendship, and of all good
And comes, where as they both stood
And makes hem all the chere be can
And says, that as her own man
He is all ready for to do
what thing be may: and it fell so
That they upon his Semblaunte tryste
And asken him, if that he wyste
what thing hem were best to done
So that they myghten saufe and sone
The water pass, he and she.
And when Nessus the priuete
Knew of her heart, what it meant
As he, that was of double intent
He made hem right a glad visage
And when he herd of the passage
Of him and her, he thought gyle
And feyneth Semblant for a while
To done hem plesaunce and seruyse
But he thought all an other wise
This Nessus with his words slye
yafe such counseyle tofore her eye
which seemed outward profitable
And was within deceyuable
He had hem of the stremes deep
That they beware, and take keep
So as they know not the pass
But for to help in such a cas
He says him self, that for her ease
He would, if that it might hem please
The passage of the water take
And for this lady undertake
To bear her to that other stronde
And saufe to set her up a land
And Hercules may than also
The weye know, how he shall go
And thereto they accorden all
But what as after shall befall
well paid was Hercules of this
And this Geaunt also glad is
And took this lady up alofte
And set her on his shulder soft
And in the flode began to wade
As he, which no grutchynge made
And bare her over saufe and sound
But when be stood on dry ground
And Hercules was far behind
He set his troth all out of mind
who so thereof be lefe or loath
with Deianyre forth he goth
As he that thought to disseuer
The company of hem for ever
when Hercules thereof took head
As fast as ever he might him speed
He hyeth after in a throw
And happens that he had a bow
The which in all have he bend
As he that would an arowe send
which he tofore had enuenymed
He has so well his shot tymed
That he him through the body smette
And thus the false wight he let
But list now, such a felony
when Nessus wist he should dye
He took to Deianyre his sherte
which with the blood was of his heart
Through out disteyned over all
And told how she it keep shall
And privily to this intent
That if her lord his heart went
To love in any other place
This shert be says has such a grace
That if she may so mochel make
That he the sherte upon him take
He shall all other let in vein
And turn unto her love again
who was tho glad but Deianyre?
Her thought her heart was on a fire
Till it was in her cofer look
So that no word thereof was spoke.
The days gone the years pass
The hertes waxen less and less
Of hem, that be to love untrue
This Hercules with heart new
His love has set on Eolen
And thereof spoken all men
This Eolen, this fair maid
was (as men thylke time said)
The kings daughter of Euryce
And she made Hercules so nyce
Upon her love, and so assote
That he him clotheth in her cote
And she in his was cladde full often
And thus feblesse is set alofte
And strength was put under foot
There can no man thereof do bote
when Deianyre has herd this speech
There was no sorrow for to seche
Of other help wot she none
But goth unto her coufer anon
with wepend eye, and woeful heart
She took out thylke unhappy sherte
As she that wend well to do
And brought her work about so
That Hercules this shert on deed
To such intent, and as she was bid
Of Nessus, so as I said er
But thereof was she naught the ner
As no fortune may be weyued
with false Semblant she was deceived
Than wha^ she wend best have won
She lost all that she has begone
For thylke sherte unto the bone
His body set a fire anon
And cleueth so, it may not twynne
For the venym, that was therein
And he than as a wild man
Unto the high wodde he ran
And as the clerk Ouyde tells
The great trees to ground he felleth
with strength of his own might
And made an hughe fire vpryght
And lepte him self therein at ones
And bre^t him self both flesh and bones
which thing came through false se^blant
That falls Nessus the Geant
Made unto him, and to his wife
whereof that he has lost his life
And she sorry for euermo.
For thy my son er the be woe
I read, be well ware therefore
For when so great a man was lore
It ought to give a great conceyte
To warn all other of such deceyte
Grant mercy father, I am ware
So fer, that I no more dare
Of falls Semblaunt take acqueintaunce
But rather I wol do penance
That I have feyned chereer this
Now asks forth, what so there is
Of that belongs to my shryfte
My son yet there is the fyfte
which is conceived of envy
And clepend is Supplantarye
Through whose compassement and gile
Full many has lost his while
In love, as well as other wise
Here after as I shall deuyse
Inuidus alterius est supplantator honoris
Et tua quo vertat culmina subtus arat.
Est opus occultu^, q^si quae latet anguis in herba,
Quod fac^t, et subita sort nociuus adest.
Sic tubtilis amans alium supplantat amantem.
Et capit occulte, quod nequit ipse palam
Sepeque supplantans in plantam plantat amoris,
Quod putat in propriis alter habere bonis.
Hic fractat Conffessor de quinta specie Inuidie, que surplantacio dicitur,
cuius cultor priusonam ve^cipiatur aliene dignitatis et officii mult^^^ne
intrusor existens.
The vice of Supplantacyon
with many a falls collacyon
which he conspireth all unknow
Full often time has overthrow
The worship of another man
So well no life awayte can
Ayene his sleyght for to cast
That he his purpose at the last
He has, er that it be withset
But me^te of all his heart is set
In court, upon these great offices
Or dignytes and benifyces
Th^s goth he with his sleyghte about
To hinder, and shoue another out
A ^^tenden with his slyghe compass
Instede there another was
And so to set him self ynne
He recheth not be so he win
Of that another man shall lose
And thus full often chalk for chese
He changes with full little cost
whereof another has the lost
And be the profit shall receive
For his fortune is to deceive
And for to change upon the whele
His woe with other men's well
Of that another man aualeth
His own astate thus he up haleth
And takes the bird to his beyete
where other men the bussbes beat
My son and in the same wise
There be lovers of such empryse
That shapen hem to be relyeued
where it is wrong, to be acheued
For it is other man's right
which he has take day and night
To keep for his own store
Toward him self for evermore
And is his proper by the law
which thing that asks no felawe
If love hold his conuenaunt
But they that worchen by supplant
yet wolden such a man supplant
And take a part of thylke plant
which he has for him self set
And so full often is all vnknet
That some man weneth be right fast
For Supplaunt with his sly cast
Full often happens for to mow
Thing, which another man has sow
And makes common of propyrte
with sleyght, and with subtylte
As men may sen from year to year
Thus cleymeth he the boat to stere
Of which another master is
For thy my son if thou er this
Haste ben of such profession
Dyscouer thy Confession
Have thou supplanted any man?
For ought that I you tell can
Mine holy father as of deed
I am withouten any dread
And gilteles: but of my thought
My conscience excuse I naught
For were it wrong or were it right
Me lyketh no thing but might
That I ne would long er this
Of other man's love Iwys
By wey of supplantatyon
Have mad appropryacyon
And hold that I never naught
Though it another man forthought
And all this speak I but of one
For whom I let all other gone
But her I may not ouerpasse
That I ne mote alwey compass
We rought not by what queyntyse
So that I might in any wise
Fro such, that my lady serve
Her heart make for to swerue
without any part of love
For by the gods all above
I would it might so befalle
That I alone should hem all
Supplant, and welde her at my will
And that thing may I naught fulfylle
But if I should strength make
And that dare I naught undertake
Though I were as was Alysander
For thereof might rise a sklander
And certes that shall I do never
For in good feyth yet had I lever
In my symplesse for to dye
Than worche such supplantarye
Of other wise I woll not say
That if I fond a syker way
I would as for conclusyon
worche after supplantation
So high a love for to win
Now father, if that this be sin
I am ready to redress
The gylt, of which I me confess.
My good son as of supplant
The dare not dread tant ne quant
As for no thing that I have herd
But only that thou haste misferde
Thynkend: and that me lyketh naught
For god beholt a man's thought
And if thou understood in soth
In loves cause what it does
A man to ben a supplantour
Thou would for thyn own honor
By double way take keep
First for thyn own estate to keke
To be thy self so well be thought
That thou supplanted were naught
And eke for worship of thy name
Toward other do the same
And suffer every man have his
But netheles it was and is
That in awayte at all assayes
Supplant of love in our ways
The leef full often for the lever
Forsakes, and so it has done ever
Ensample I find thereupon
Qualiter Agamemnon de amore Breffeide Achillem, et Diomedes de amore Criseide
Troilum supplantauit.
At Troy how that Agamemnon
Supplanted the worthy knight
Achilles, for that sweet wyghte
which named was Brisseida
And also of Cryseyda
whom Troylus to love ches
Supplanted has Diomedes
Qualiter Amphitrium socium suum Getam qui Alemenam peramauit, seipsum loco
alterius cautelo sa supplantacione substituit.
Of Geta and Amphitryone
That whilom were both as one
Of friendship and of company
I read how that Supplantarye
In love, as it betyd tho
Begyled has one of hem two
For this Geta, that I of mean
To whom the lusty fair Alemene
Assured was by wey of love
when he best wend have been above
And sykerest of that he had
Cupido so the cause ladde
That while he was out of the weye
Amphitrion her love aweye
Has take, and in this form he wrought
By night unto the chamber he sought
where that she lay: and with a wyle
He counterfeteth for the while
The voys of Geet, in such a wyle
That made her of her bed arise
wenende, that it were he
And let him in: and when they be
To gyder a bed in arms fast
This Geta came than at last
Unto the door, and said undo
And she answered, and badde him go
And said, how that a bed all warm
Her lyefe lay naked in her arm
She wend, that it were soth
Lo what supplant of love does
This Geta forth beiaped went
And yet ne wist he, what it meant
Amphitrion him has supplanted
with sleyght of love, and her enchau^ted
And thus put every man out other
The ship of love has lost his rother
So that he can no resone stere
And for to speak of this mattere
Touchende love, and his supplaunt
A tale, which is accordaunt
Unto thyn care I think inform
Now harken, for this is the form.

That he the werres might seche

And would grant him no leave
But he which would naught believe
A knight of his, to whom he tryst
Right even as he thought and list
He took and told him his courage
That he purposes a vyage
If that fortune with him stand
He said, that he would fond
The great see to pass unknow
And there abide for a throw
Upon the werres to travail
And to this point without fail
This knight when he has herd his lord
Is swore, and stant of his accord
And they that both young were
So that in preuy counsel there
They ben assented for to wend
And thereupon to make an end
Treasure enough with hem they token
And when the time is best they loken
That sodenlyche in a galeye
Fro Rome land they went their wey
And londed upon that other side
The world selle so that ylke tide
which ever his happes has diverse
The great Sultan than of Perse
Ayene the Calyphe of Egypt
A werre, which that him beclypte
Has in a march costeaunt
And he which was a pursyuaunt
worship of arms to atteyne
This Romayne an one let ordeyne
That he was redye every dele
And when he was arrayed well
Of every thing, which him belongs
Straught unto Rayre his weye he tongeth
where he the soudan than land
And asks, that within his land
He might him for the werre serve
As he which woll his thank deserve
The sultan was right glad withal
And well the more in special
when that he wist he was Romayne
But what he was else incertayne
That might he wit by no way
And thus the knight of whom I say
Toward the Souldan is belefte
And in the marches now and efte
where that the dedely werres were
He wrought such knyghthode there
That every man spoke of him good
And thylke time so it stood
This mighty Sultan by his wife
A daughter has, that in this life
Men said there was none so feyre
She should ben her fathers beyre
And was of years ripe enough
Her beauty many an heart drough
To bow to that ylke law
Fro which no life may be withdraw
And that is love, whose nature
Set life and death in a venture
Of hem, that knyghthode undertake
This lusty pain has overtake
The heart of this Romayn so sore
That to knyghthode more and more
Prowess auaunteth his courage
Lyche to the lion in his rage
Fro whom that all bestes flee
Such was this knight in his degree
where he was armed in the field
There durst none abide his shield
Great price upon the werres he had
But she, which all the chance ladde
Fortune shope the marches so
That by thassent of both two
The Sultan and the Calyphe eke
Battle upon a day they seek
which was in such a wise set
That longer should it not be let
They made hem strong on every side
Tnd when it drough toward the tide
That the battle should be
The Sultan in great pryuete
A gold ring of his daughter took
And made her swear upon a book
And eke upon the gods all
That if fortune so befall
In the bataylle that he deye
That she shall thylke man obey
And take him to her housbonde
which thylke same ring to hand
Her should bring after his death
This has she swore, and forth he geth
with all the power of his land
Unto the march, where he fond
His enemy fulle enbatayled
The Sultan has the field assailed
They that been hardy sone assemblen
whereof the dreadful hertes tremblen
That one slecth, and that other sterueth
But abouen all his price deserves
This knightly Romayn, where he rode
His dedely sword no man abode
Ayene the which was no defense
Egypt fled in his presence
And they of Perse upon the chase
Pursuen, but I not what grace
Befell, an arowe out of a bow
All suddenly within a throw
The Sultan smote, and there he lay
The chas is left for thylke day
And he was bore in to a tent
The Sultan sighe how that it went
And that he should algates dye
And to this knyht of Romanye
As unto him whom he most tryste
His daughters ringe that none it wyste
He took, and told him all the cas
Upon her oath what token it was
Of that she should ben his wife
when this was said, the hertes life
Of this Sultan departs sone
And thereupon, as was to done
The deed body well and fair
They carry till they come at Kayre
There he was worthelyche begraue
The lords, which as wolden save
The regne, which was desolate
To bring it in to good astate
A parliament they set anon
Now harken what fell thereupon
This young lord this worthy knight
Of Rome, upon the same night
That they a morrow trete should
Unto his bachyler he told
His counsel, and the ringe with all
He shows, through which he shall
He seyth, the kings daughter wedde
For so the ring was leyde to wedde
He told, in to her fathers hand
That with what man that she it fond
She should him take unto her lord
And thus, he seyth, stant of record
But no man wot who has this ring
This bachylere upon this thing
His ere and his intent leyde
And thought more, than he said
And feyneth with a falls vysage
That he was glad: but his courage
was all set in a another wise
These old phylosophres wise
They written upon thylke while
That he may best a man begyle
In whom the man has most credence
And this befell in evidence
Toward this young lord of Rome
His bachiler, which had tome
when that his lord by night slepte
This ringe, the which his master kept
Out of his purs aweye be deed
And put another in the stead
A morrow when the court is set
The young lady was forth fet
To whom the lords done homage
And after that of marriage
They treten, and asken of her will
But she which thought to fulfylle
(...) ^aders best in this matter
(...) openly, that men may here
The charge which her fader badde
Tho was this lord of Rome glad
And drough toward his purs anon
But all for naught, it was a gone
His bachilor it has forth draw
And ^^keth thereupon the law
(...) him hold covenant
The taken was so suffysaunt
^^at it ne might be forsake
And netheles his lord has take
Quarelle ayene his own man
But for no thing that ever he can
He might as than naught be herd
So that his claim his vnanswerde
And he has of his purpos failed
This bachiler was tho counsayled
And wedded, and of thylke empire
He was crouned lord and fire
And all the land him has received
whereof his lord, which was deceived
Ascknes, ^r the third morrow
Conceived has of dedely sorrow
And as he lay upon his death
There while him lasts speech and breath
He send for the worthyest
Of all the land, and eke the best
And told hem all the soth tho
That he was son and heir also
Of the emperor of great Rome
And how that they to gyder come
This knight, and he right as it was
He told hem all the plain cas
And for that he his counseyll told
That other has all that he would
And he has failed of his mede
As for the good he takes none head
He says, but only of the love
Of which he wend have be above
And thereupon by letter write
He does his fader for to wit
Of all the matter bow it stood
And than with an bertely mode
Unto the lords he besought
To tell his lady how he bought
Her love, of which another gladdeth
And with that word his hew fades
And said, a dieu my lady sweet
The life has lost his kyndely beat
And he lay still as any stone
whereof was sorry many one
But none of all so as she
This false knight in his degree
Arested was, and put in hold
For openly when it was told
Of the treason, which is befalle
Throughout the land they saiden all
If it be soth, that men suppose
His own untruth him shall depose
And for to seche an euydence
with honor, and great reverence
whereof they myghten know an end
To the emperor anon they send
The letter, which his son wrote
And when that he the soth wot
To tell his sorrow is endeles
But yet in haste netheles
Upon the tale, which he berde
His steward in to Perse ferde
with many a worthy Romayne eke
His lyege traitor for to seek
And when they thither come were
This knight him has confessid there
How falsely that he has him bore
whereof his worthy lord was lore
Tho sayden some, be should deye
But yet they founden such a weye
That he shall not be deed in Perse
And thus the skylles ben diverse
By cause that he was coroned
Of that the land was habandoned
To him, all though it were unright
There is no pain for him dyght
But to this point and to this end
They grau^ten well, that he shall wend
with the Romans to Rome again
And thus acorded full and pleyne
They quycke body with the deed
with leave take, forth they led
where that Supplaunt has his Iuyse
whereof that thou the might auyse
Upon this informacion
Touchend of supplantacion
That thou my son do not so
And for to take heed also
what supplaunt does in other halue
There is no man can find a salve
Pleynly to belen such a sore
It has and shall ben evermore
when pride is with envy Joint
He suffers no man in good point
where that he may his honor let
And thereupon if I shall set
Ensample in holy church I find
How that supplaunt is not behind
God wot if that it now be so
For in Cronycke of time a go
I find a tale concordable
Of Supplaunt, which that is no fable
In the manner as I shall tell
So as whylom the things fell
Hic ponit Confessor exemplum contra istos in causa dignitatis adquirende
supplantatores. Et narrat qualiter papa Bonifacins predecessorem suum
Cefestinum a papatu contractata circumuencione fraudufenter supplantauit / Sed
qui potentes a feed deponit hunismo di supplanta cionis fraudem non sustinens,
ipsum sic in sublime exaltatum postea in profundi carcerie mise ilam proici /
fame que siti cruciari, nec non et ab h^me bite gaduiis deforosa morte
supplantari permifit.
At Rome as it has often salle
The vyker general of all
Of hem that leven Cristes feyth
His last day, which none with seyth
Has shette, as to the worlds eye
whose name, if I shall specyfye
He hight Pope Nycholas
And thus when that he passed was
The Cardynals, that wolden save
The form of law in the conclaue
Gone for to chese a new pope
And after that they couthe grope
Has each of hem said his intent
Till at last they assent
Upon an holy clerk recluse
which full was of gostely vertuse
His pacyence, and his symplesse
Has set him in to high noblesse
Thus was he pope canonysed
with great honor, and intronysed
And upon chance, as it is fall
His name Celestyn men call
which notifyed was by bulle
To holy church: and to the full
In all lands magnyfyed
But every worship is enuyed
And that was thylke time seen
For when this pope, of whom I mean
was chose, and other set be side
A Cardinal was thylke tide
which the papate has long desired
And thereupon gretely conspired
But when be sygh fortune is failed
For which long time he has travailed
That ylke fire, which Ethna brenneth
Through out his woeful heart renneth
which is resembled to envy
whereof Supplaunt and trecherye
Engendered is. And netheles
He feyneth love, he feyneth pes
Outward he does the reverence
But all within his conscience
Through falls ymaginacyon
He thought Supplantacion
And thereupon a wonder wyle
He wrought. For at thylke while
It fell so, that of his lynage
He had a Clergon young of age
whom he has in his chamber affaited
This Cardynal his time has waited
And with his words sly and queynt
The which he couth wisely peynt
He shope this clerk, of which I tell
Toward the Pope for to dwell
So that within his chamber a night
He lay: and was a preuy wight
Toward the Pope on nyghtes tide
May no man fle, that shall be tide
This Cardynall, which thought gyle
Upon a day, when he has while
This young clerk unto him took
And made him swear upon aboke
And told him what his will was
And forth with all a Trompe of bras
He has him take, and bad him this
Thou shall he said, when time is
Away to, and take right good keep
when that the Pope is fast a sleep
(...) that none other man be nigh
And than that thou be so fly
^^^^gh out the Trompe in to his ere
(...) as though a voys it were
(...) ^wne of such p^olacyon
(...) he his meditacion
(...) may make, and understand
A though it were of gods soude
(...) this wise thou shall seye
(...) do thylke estate aweye
(...) of which he stant honored
(...) had his soul be socoured
(...) th^lke worship at the last
(...), which shall ever last
^^is clerk, when he has herd the form
(...) he the pope should enform
(...) of the Cardinal his leave
(...) ^oth him home, till it was eve
(...) p^yuely the trompe he hedde
(...) that the pope was a bed
And at the mydnight, when he knew
The Pope slepte, than he blewe
within his Trompe through the wall
And told, in what manner he shall
His papacye leave, and take
His first estate. And thus awake
This holy Pope he made thryes
whereof diverse fantasyes
Upon his great holiness
within his heart he began impresse
The pope full of Innocence
Conceyueth in his conscience
That it is gods will, he cese
But in what wise he may relese
His hye estate, that wot he naught
And thus within him self he thought
He bare it stylle in his memory
Till he came to the Consystorye
And there in presence of hem all
He axeth: if it so befalle
That any Pope cesse would
How that the law it suffer should
They setten all stylle, and herd
was none, which to the point answerde
For to what purpos that it meant
There was no man knew his intent
But only he, which shop the gyle
This Cardynal the same while
All openly with words plain
Seyth: if the Pope woll ordeyne
That there be such a law wrought
Than might he cesse, and else naught
And as he said, done it was
The pope anon upon the cas
Of his papal auctorite
Has made and yone the decre
And when the law was confermed
In due form, and all affermed
This innocent, which was deceived
His papacye anon has weyued
Renounced and resygned eke
That other was no thing to seek
But vndreneth such a iape
He has so for himself shape
That how as ever it him beseme
The myter, with the dyademe
He has through supplentacyon
And in his confyrmacion
Upon the fortune of his grace
His name was cleped Boniface
Under the vyser of envy
Lo thus was hyd the trecherye
which has begyled many one
But such cou^sayll there may be none
which treason, when it is conspyred
That it his like the spark fyred
Up in the roof, which for a throw
Lies hyd, till when the winds blow
It blaseth out on every side
This Boniface, which can naught hyde
The treachery of his supplaunt
Has openly made his auaunt
How he the papacye has won
But thing which is with wrong bego^ne
May never stand well at end
where pride shall the bow bend
He sheteth full often out of the weye
And thus the pope, of whom I seye
when that he stood on high the whele
He can not suffer him self be well
Envy, which is loueles
And pride, which is laweles
with such tempests made him err
That charity goth out of herre
So that upon mysgouernaunce
Against Lewys the king of France
He took quarrel of his oultrage
And said, he should done homage
Unto the church bodily
But he that wist no thing why
He should do so great service
After the world in such a wise
withstood the wrong of that demand
For naught the Pope may command
The king woll not the pope obey
This pope tho by all weye
That he may worche of vyolence
Has sent the bulle of his sentence
with cursynge, and enterdyte
The king upon this wrongful plyte
To keep his reign from seruage
Counsayled was of his baronage
That might with might shall be with sto^d
Thus was the cause tak on ho^d
And sayden, that the papacye
They would honor and magnyfye
In all that ever is spyrituall
But the ilke pride temporal
Of Boniface in his person
Ayene that ylke wrong alone
They wolden stand in debate
And thus the man, and naught the state
The frenss he shopen by her might
To grieve: And fell there was a knight
Sire Guillam de Langaret
which was upon this cause set
And thereupon he took a route
Of men of arms, and rode out
So long, and in a w^yte he lay
That he aspyed upon a day
The pope was at Auygnon
And should ride out of the town
Unto Poursorge, the which is
A castle in Prouynce of his
Upon the weye and as he rode
This knight, which houed and abod
Embuisshed upon horsbake
All sodenlyche upon him brake
And has him by the brydell sesed
And said: O thou, which have dysesed
The court of France by thy wrong
Thou shall sing a new song
Thyn enterdyte, and thy sentence
Again thyn own conscience
Here after thou shall feel and grope
we plain naught again the pope
For thylke name is honorable
But thou, which haste be deceyuable
And treacherous in all thy work
Thou Boniface, thou proud clerk
My sleder of the papacye
Thy falls body shall abye
And suffer, that it has deserved
Lo thus this supplantor was served
For they him ladde in to France
And setten him to his penance
withyn a toure in hard bonds
where he for honger both his hondes
Eat of: And dyed, god wot how
Of whom the writing is yet now
Regystred as a man may here
which speaks and says in this manner
Thy enter like a fox was slygh
Thy reign also with pride on high
was lyche the lion in his rage
But at the last of thy passage
Thy death was to the hounds like
Such is the letter of his Cronyke
Proclaimed in the court of Rome
whereof the wise ensample nome
And yet as ferforth as I dare
I read all other men beware
And that they look well algate
That none his own estate translate
Of holy church in no degree
By fraud ne subtylyte
For thilke honor which Aaron took
Shall none receive, as seyth the book
But he beeleped, as he was
what shall I thynken in this cas
Of that I here now a day?
I not: but he which can and may
By reason both and by nature
The help of every man's cure
He keep Simon fro the fold.
Nota de prophecia Ioachim abbatis.
For Ioachim, thylke abbot told
How such days shulden fall
That comonlyche in places all
(...) ^hapmen of such mercery
^^to fraud, and with supplantary
So many shulden by and selle
(...) he ne may for shame tell
(...) ^oule a sin in man's ere
B^t god forbede, that it were

(...) if the clerk be ware his faith

^^^^^menaunt mote needs empeyre
(...) that to the world belongs
(...) when that holy church wrongeth
(...) what other thing shall right
(...) ^etheles at manes sight
(...) for to be preferred
(...) conseyence so dyfferred
That no man looks to the vice
which is the mother of malice
And that is thylke falls envy
^hiche causes many a trecherye
(...) where he may another se
That is more gracious than he
It shall not stonden in his might
But if he hinder such a wight
And that is well nyghe over all
This vice is now so general
Qualiter Ioab priceps milicie David inuidie (...) Abner subdole interfecit. Et
qualiter etia^ Achi^^fell ob hoc, quod Cusi in Co^silio Absolon (...) catu^,
acce^sus inuidia laqueo se suspe^dit.
Envy thylke un hap in drough
when Ioab by deceypt slough
Abner, for dread he should be
with king David such as was he
And through envy also it fell
Of thylke falls Achitofelle
For his counseylle was not acheued
But that he saw Cusy believed
with Absolon, and him forsake
He hynge him self upon a stake
Senecke witnesses openly
How that envy properly
Is of the court the common wenche
And halt tavern for to schence
That drink, which makes the heart bre^ne
And does the wit about re^ne
By every wey to compass
How that he might all other pass
As he which through vnkyndshyp
Enuyeth every felauship
So that thou might well know and se
There is no vice such as he
First toward god abominable
And to mankind unprofitable
And that by words but a few
I shall by reason prove and show.
Inuidie stimulus sine causa ledit abortus,
Nam sine temptante crimine crimen habet.
Non est huius opus temptare Cupidims archu^,
Dumque facies Veneris Ethnica fla^ma vo^a^,
Absque rubore gene pallor quas fuscus obu^b^at,
Frigida naturae cetera membra docent.
Hic deseribit Confessor naturam inuidie iam in amore qua^ aliter secundum
proprietate^ vicu^.
Gnuye if that I shall descryue
He is not shapely for to wyue
In earth among the women here
For there is in him no mattere
whereof he might do plesaunce
First for his heavy contenaunce
Of that he seems ever vngladde
He is not able to be badde
And eke he brenneth so withyn
That kind may no profit win
whereof he should his love please
For thylke blod, which should have case
To regne among the moist veins
Is dry of thylke unkindly peynes
Through which envy is fyred ay
And this by reason prove I may
That toward love Envy eis naught
And other wise if it besought
Upon what side as ever it fall
It is the werst vice of all
which of him self has most malice
For understand that every vice
Some cause has, whereof it grows
But of envy no man knows
Fro whens he came, but out of hell
For thus the wise clerks tell
That no spryte but of malice
By wey of kind upon a vice
Is tempted, and by such a way
Envy has kind put a way
And of malice has his sturrynge
whereof he makes his bakbytinge
And is him self thereof dyseased
So may there be no kind pleased
For ay the more that he enuyeth
The more ayene him self he plyeth
Thus stant Envy in good espeyre
To ben him self the dyuels heir
As he which is the next lyche
And forthest from the heaven rich
For there may he never won
For thy my good dear son
If thou wolt find a syker weye
To love: put envy aweye
Mine holy fader reason would
That I this vice eschew should
But yet to strength my courage
If that ye would in advantage
Thereof set a recouere
It were to me a great desire
That I this vice might flee
Now understand my son, and see
There is physyke for the seek
And virtues for the vices eke
who that the vices would eschew
He mot by reason than sewe
The virtues. For by thylke weye
He may the vices done aweye
For they to geder may not dwell
For as the water of the well
Of fire abateth the malice
Right so virtue fordoth the vice
Ayene Envy is Charity
which is the mother of pity
That makes a man's heart tender
That it may no malice engender
In him, that is inclined thereto
For his courage is tempred so
That though he might him self releue
yet would he not another grieve
But rather for to do plesaunce
He bears him self the greuaunce
So feign he would another ease
whereof my son for thyn ease
Now harken a tale, which I read
And understand it well I read.
Hic ponit Confessor exemplu^ de vertute Chatitatis contra Inuidiam / Et narrat
de Constantino Esene filio, qui cum Imperu Romani dignitaiem obtenue rat, a
morb o lepre infectus medici pro sanitate recuperanda ipsum in sanguine
puerororum masculo rum balneare proposuer^t, sed cum innumera multitudo matrum
cum fu^^e huiusmodi medicina causa in circuitu palac^i affuisset / Imperator
que eorum gemitus and elamores percepisset, charitate motus ingemiscens sic a^
O vere eft ipse dominus, qui se facit seruum pietatis. Et his dictis statum
suum cunctipote^^s medele committens, sui ipsius mordum ^acius quam infancium
mortem benignius elegit, vnde ipse qui antea paganus et leprosus extiterat, ex
vnda baptismatis tenatus utrinusque materie tant corporis quam anime diuino
miraculo consecutus est salutem.
Among the books of latin
I find it wryt of Constantyne
The worthy emperor of Rome
Such infortunes to him come
when he was in his lusty age
The leper caught in his vysage
And so forth over all about
That he ne might ryden out
So left he both shield and spear
As he that might him not bestere
And held him in his chamber close
Through all the world the fame arose
The great clerks were assent
And com at his commandment
To tret upon this lords hele
So long they to geder dele
That they upon this medicine
Appoynten hem, and determyne
That in the manner as it stood
They would him bath in childs blod
within seven winter age
For as they sayen, that should assuage
The lepre, and all the violence
which that they know of accidence
And not by wey of kind is fall
And thereto they acorden all
As for fynall conclusyon
And tolden her opinion
To the emperor: And he an one
His counsayll took, and thereupon
with letters, and with seals out
They send in every land about
The young children for to seche
whose blood, they said, should be leche
For themperours maladye
There was enough to weep and cry
Among the moders, when they herd
How woefully this cause ferd
But netheles they mot how
And thus women there come ynowe
with children soukend on the tete
Th^^ were many teres let
But were hem lyefe, or were hem loath
The women and the thyldren both
Into the paleys forth he brought
with many a sorry hertes thought
(...) hem which of her body bore
The children had: and so forlore
(...) a while should se
(...) moders weep in her degree
And many of hem a swoune fall
The young babyes cryeden all
This noise arose, this lord it herd
And looked out, and how it ferde
He saw: and as who said abrayde
O^^e of his sleep, and thus he said.
O thou dyuyne purueaunce
which every man in the balaunce
Of kind have formed to be lyche
The pore is bore as is the rich
And dies in the same wise
Upon the fool upon the wise
Sickness and bele enter comune
May none eschew that fortune
which kind has in her law set
Her strength and beauty ben besette
To every man a lyche free
That she prefers no degree
As in the disposition
Of bodily complexion
And eke of soul reasonable
The poor child is bore as able
To virtue, as the kings son
For every man his own won
After the lusts of his assaye
The vice or virtue chese may
Thus stand all men fraunchysed
But in estate they ben devised
To sum worship and richesse
To some pouerte and distress
One lordeth, an other serves
But yet as every man deserves
The world yeueth not his yeftes here
But certes he has great matere
To be of good condition
which has in his subjection
The men, that been of his semblaunce
And eke he took his remembrance
How he that made law of kind
would every man to law bind
And badde a man, such as he would
Toward him self, right such he should
Toward an other done also
And thus this worthy lord as tho
Set in balaunce his own estate
And with him self stood in debate
And thought how it was not good
To se so mochell man's bloudde
Be spylte, by cause of him alone
He saw also the great moan
Of that the mother were vngladde
And of the woe the children made
whereof that his heart tendreth
And such pity within engenders
That him was lever for to chese
His own body for to lose
Than se so great a mourdre wrought
Upon the blood, which gilteth naught
This for the pity, which he took
All other leches he forsook
And put him out of adventure
Allonly to gods cure
And says, who that woll master be
He mote be servant to pite
So ferforth he was overcome
with charity, that he has nome
His counsel, and his officers
And badde unto his treasourers
That they his treasour all about
Depart among the poor route
Of women, and of children both
whereof they might hem feed and cloth
And saufely tournen home again
without loss of any greyne
Through charity thus he dispendeth
His good, whereof he amendeth
The poor people, and countreuayleth
The harm, that he hem so trauayleth
And thus the woeful nyghtes sorrow
To joy is turned on the morrow
All was thanking, all was blyssynge
which erst was weeping and cursynge
These women gone home glad enough
Echone for joy on other lough
And prayde for this lords hele
which has released the quarele
And has his own will forsake
In charity for gods sake
But now hereafter thou shalt here
what god has wrought in this matere
As he that does all equity
To him that wrought charity
He was ayenewarde charitous
And to pite he was pytous
For it was never know yet
That charity gothe vnaquyt
The night when he was laid to sleep
The high god, which would him keep
Saint Peter and saint Poule him send
By whom he would his lepre amend
They two to him slepende appear
Fro god, and said in this manner:
O Constantyn for thou have served
Pity, thou have pite deserved
For thy thou shalt such pite have
That god through pite woll the save
Thou shalt so double hele find
First for thy bodelyche kind
And for thy woeful soul also
Thou shall be hole of both two
And for thou shalt not the despeyre
Thy lepre shall no more empeyre
Till thou will send thereupon
Unto the mount of Celyon
where Syluester and his clergy
To gyder dwellen in company
For dread of the, which many a day
Have ben a so to Christ's lay
And have destroyed, to mochel shame
The prechours of his holy name
But now thou have somdele appesed
Thy god, and with good deed plesed
That thou thy pity have bywaryd
Upon the blod, which thou have spared
For thy to thy salvation
Thou shall have Informacyon
Such as Syluester shall the teache
The needs of none other leche
This Emperor, which all this herd
Grant mercy lord he answerde
I woll do so as ye me say
But of one thing I would pray
what shall I tell unto Syluester
Of your name or of your ester?
And they him told what they hight
And forth with all out of his sight
They passen up in to the heaven
And be awoke out of his sweuen
And clepeth, and men come anon
And told his dreme: and thereupon
In such a wise as he hem tells
The mount, where Syluester dwells
They have in all haste sought
And founde^ he was, and with he^ brought
To the emperor, which to him told
His sweuen, and else what he would
And wha^ Siluester has herd the king
He was right joyful of this thing
And him began with all his wit
To techen upon holy writ
First how mankind was forlore
And how the high god therefore
His son send from above
which borne was for man's love
And after of his own choys
He took his death upon the croys
And how in grave he was beloke
And how that he has hell broke
And took hem out, that were him leave
And for to make us full believe
That he was very gods son
Ayene the kind of man's won
Frodeth he rose the third day
And when he would, as he well may
He styghe up to his father even
with flesh and bloudin to the heaven
And right so in the same form
In flesh and blood he shall reform
when time comes, the quycke and deed
At thylke woeful day of dread
where every man shall take his dome
As well the master as the grome
The mighty kings retenue
That day may stand of no value
with worldly strength to defend
For every man mote than entende
To stand upon his own deeds
And ^^ue all other men's needs
That day may no counsel avail
The pi^dour and the plee shall fail
(...) ^entence of that ylke day
(...) none appele set in delay
^^ere may no gold the judge plye
^^at been shall the soth try
(...) setten every man vpryght
As well the plowe man as the knight
The l^nde man, the great clerk
Shall stand upon his own work
(...) such as he is found tho
S^che shall he be for euermo
There may no pain be released
There may no joy ben increased
(...) endeles as they have do
He shall receive one of two
Thus Syluestre with his saw
The ground of all the new law
with great devotion he preaches
F^^ point to point and plainly techeth
Unto this heathen emperor
And says: the high creator
Has vndersonge his charity
Of that he wrought such pite
when he the children had on hand
Thus when this lord has understood
Of all this thing how that it ferde
Unto Syluestre he than answerde
with all his holle heart, and seyth
That he is ready to the feyth
And so the vessel, which for blood
was made, Syluestre, there it stood
with clean water of the well
In all haste he let do fell
And set Constantyne therinne
All naked up to the chynne
And in the while it was begone
A light, as though it were a son
Fro heaven in to the place come
where that he took his christendom
And ever among the holy tales
Like as they weren fysshes scales
They fellen from him now and efte
Till that there was nothing belefte
Of all this great maladye
For he that would him purifye
The high god has made him clean
So that there left nothing seen
He has him cleansed both two
The body and the soul also
Tho knew this emperor in deed
That Christ's feyth was for to dread
And send anon his letters out
And let do cryen all about
Upon pain of death, that no man weyue
That he baptysme ne receive
After his mother queen Eleyne
He send, and so between hem tweyne
They treaten, that the city all
was christened, and she forth with all
This emperor, which hele has found
within Rome anon let found
Two churches, which he did make
For Peter and for Poules sake
Of whom he had a vysion
And yafe thereto possessyon
Of lordeshyppe, and of worlds good
But how so that his will was good
Toward the Pope and his fraunchyse
yet has it proved otherwise
To se the worchynge of the deed
For in cronyke thus I read
Anon as he has made the yefte
A voycee was herd on high the left
Of which all Rome was adradde
And said, this day venym is shadde
In holy church of temporal
which medleth with the spiritual
And how it stant of that degree
yet may a man the sothe se
God may amend it, when he will
I can thereto none other skylle
But for to go there I began
How charity may help a man
To both worlds, I have said
And if thou have an ear laid
My son thou might understand
If charity be take on hand
There follows after mochel grace
For thy if that thou wylt purchase
How that thou might envy flee
Acqueynt the with charity
which is the virtue sovereign
My father I shall do my pain
For this ensample which ye told
with all mine heart I have witholde
So that I shall for evermore
Eschew envy well the more
And that I have or this mysdo
give me my penance or I go
And over that to my matere
Of shryfte, while ye sytten here
In priuete between us tweye
Now ask, what there is I prey
Confessor.
My good son, and for thy lore
I woll the tell, what is more
So that thou shalt the vices know
For when they be to the full know
Thou might hem well the better eschew
And for this cause I think few
The form both and the matere
As now sewende thou shalt here
which vice stant next after this
And when thou wost, how that it is
As thou shall bear my deuyse
Thou might thy self better auyse.
Explicit liber secundus.
Hic in tercio libro tractat super quinque speciebus ire, quarum prima
melancolia dicitur / cuinvitium Confessor primo describens amati / super codem
consequenter opponit.

Incipit liber tertius.
Ira suis paribus est par furijs Acherontis,
Quo furor ad tempus nil pietatis haber,
Ira melancolicos animos perturbat, ut equo
Iure sui pondus nulla s^atera tenet.
Omnibus in causis grauat ira inter amantes
Illa magis facili sort grauamen agit.
Est vbi uir discors leuiterque repugnat amori,
Saepe loco ludi fletus ad ora uenit.
IF thou the vices list to know
My son it has not be unknow
Fro first that men their swerdes ground
That there nis none upon this ground
A vice forreyne fro the law
whereof that many a good felawe
Has be distraught by sodeyne chance
And yet to kind no pleasaunce
It does: but where he most acheueth
His purpose most to kind he greueth
As he, which out of conscience
Is ennemy unto pacyence
And is by name one of the seven
which often has set the world uneven
And cleped is the cruel ire
whose heart is evermore on fire
To speak amysse, and to do both
For his servants ben ever wroth
My good father tell me this
what thing is ire? Son it is
That in our english wrath is hot
which has his words ay so hot
That all a man's pacyence
Is fyred of the vyolence
For he with him has ever five
Servants, that helpen him to strive
The first of hem melancoly
Is cleped, which in company
An honderde times in an hour
woll as an angry beast sour
And no man wot the cause why
My son shryue the now for thy
Have thou be melancholyen?
My father ye by saint Iulyen
But I untrue words use
I may me not thereof excuse
And all makes love well I wot
Of which mine heart is ever hot
So that I brenne as does a glede
For wrath, that I may not speed
And thus full often a day for naught
(Saufe onlyche of mine own thought)
I am so with my seluen wroth
That how so that the game goth
with other men I am not glad
But I am well the more vngladde
For that is other men's game
It tourneth me to pure grame
Thus am I with my self oppressed
Of thought, which I have impressed
That all waking I dreme and mete
That I alone with her mete
And pray her of some good answer
But for she would not gladly swear
She says me nay withouten oath
And thus wax I within wroth
That outward I am all affrayed
And so distempered, and so esmayed
A thousand times on a day
There sowneth in mine ears nay
The which she said me tofore
Thus be my wits all forlore
(...) ^^^nely when I begin
^^^cken with my self withinne
How many years ben agone
(...) I have truly loved one
And never took of her other head
And ever a lyche for to speed
(...) the more I with her deal
(...) that my hap, and all my heal
(...) thinks is ay the longer the far
(...) ^^^ngeth my gladship out of err
(...) of my wits ben empeyred
And I, as who says, all dispcired
For ^^^tly when that I muse
And think, how she woll me refuse
I am with anger so bestadde
(...) this world might I be glad
(...) for the while that it lasts
(...) so down my joy it casts
And by the forther that I be
(when I ne may my lady se)
The more I am ready to wrath
That for the touching of a lath
Or for the tournynge of a stre
I wode as does the wild see
And ^m so melancolyous
That there nys servant in mine house
Ne none of tho, that be about
That each of hem ne stant in doubt
And wenen, that I should rave
For anger, that they se me have
And so they wondre more and less
That they seen it ouerpasse
But father, if it so betyde
That I approach at any tide
The place, where my lady is
And than her lyketh ywys
To speak a goodly word unto me
For all the gold that is in Rome
Ne couth I after that be wroth
But all mine anger over gothe
So glad I am of the presence
Of her, that I all offense
Foryete, as though it were naught
So over glad is my thought
And netheles, the sothe to tell
Ayenewarde if it so befelle
That I at thylke time sye
On me, that she my seaste her eye
Or that she list not look
And I thereof good head took
Anon into my first estate
I turn, and am with that also mate
That ever it is a lyche wycke
And thus mine hand ayene the prycke
I hurt, and have done many a day
And go so forth as I go may
Full often bytynge on my lyppe
And make unto my self a whyppe
with which in many a chele and hete
My woeful heart is so to beat
That all my wits ben vnsofte
And I am wroth, I not how often
And all it is melancolye
which grows on the fantasye
Of love, that me woll not loute
So bear I forth an angry snoute
Fulle many times in a year
But father now ye sytten here
In Loves stead, I you beseech
That some ensample ye me teache
whereof I may my self appease
Confessor,
My son for thyn hertes ease
I shall fulfill thy prayere
So that thou might the better lere
what mischief that this vice stereth
which in his anger naught forbeareth
whereof that after him forthynketh
when he is sobre, and that he thinks
Upon the folly of his deed
And of this point a tale I read.
Hic ponit Confessor exemplum contra istos / qui cum vires amoris non sunt
realiter experti contra alios amantes melancolica seueritate ad it acnndia^
vindicte prouocantur, Et narrat qualiter rex ^olus filium nomine Machareum et
filiam nomine Canacem habuit / qui cum ab infantia vsque pubertaiem inuicem
fuerant educati, Cupido tande^ cum ignito iaculo amborum cordis desideria
amorose penetrauit / ita quod natura Canacis cooperante a fratre suo inpregnata
par turit, super quo pater intollerabilem inuentutis concupiscentiam ignorans /
nimiaque furoris melancolia preuentus / dictam filiam cum partu delorisissimo
casu interfeci diuidicauit.
There was a king, which Eolus
was hot: and it befell him thus
That he two children had fair
The son cleped was Machayre
The daughter eke Canace hight
By day both and eke by night
while they be young of common won
In chamber they to gether won
And as they shulden pleyd hem often
Till they be grown up alofte
In the yongthe of lusty age
when kind assaileth the courage
with love, and does him for to bow
That he no reason can allow
But halte the laws of nature
For whom that love has under cure
As he is blind him self, right so
He makes his clyent blind also
In such manner, as I you tell
As they all day to gether dwell
This brother might it not asterte
That he with all his hole heart
His love upon his sister cast
And so it fell hem at the last
That this Machayre with Canace
when they were in a preuy place
Cupyde ba^ hem first to kiss
And after she, which is maystrysse
In kind, and teaches every life
without law positife
Of which she takes no manner charge
But keeps her laws all at large
Nature took hem in to lore
And taught hem so, that ouermore
She has hem in such a wise daunted
That they were, as who says, encha^ted
And as the blind an other ledeth
And till they fall nothing dredeth
Right so they had none in sight
But as a bird, which woll a light
And sees the meat, and not the net
which in deceyt of him is set
These young folk no peril sye
But all was liking in her eye
In that they fell upon the chance
where wit has lore his remembrance
So long they to gether assemble
The womb arose, and she began to tremble
And held her in her chamber close
For dread it should be disclose
And come unto her fathers care
whereof the son had also fere
And feyneth cause for to ride
For long durst he not abide
In aunter if men woll seyne
That he his sister has forleyne
For yet she had it not be know
whose was the child at thylke throw
Machayre goth, Canace abyt
The which was not delivered yet
But right sone after that, she was
Now list and harken a woeful cas
The soth, which may not ben hyd
was at last know and kydde
Unto the king, how that it stood
And when that he it understood
Anon into Melancolye
As though it were a frenesye
He fell, as he which nothing couthe
How maysterfull Love is in youth
And for he was to love strange
He would not his heart change
To be benign and favorable
To Love, but vnmerciable
Between the wawe of wode and wroth
In to his daughters chamber he gothe
And sye the child was late bore
whereof he has his oath swore
That she it shall full sore abye
And she began mercy to cry
Upon her bare knees, and prayde
And to her father thus she said
Have mercy father, think I am
Thy child, and of thy blood I came
That I mysdede, youth it made
And in the flouddes bad me wade
where that I saw no peril tho
But now it is befalle so
Mercy my father, do no wreche
And with that word she lost speech
And fell down swouned at his foot
As she for sorrow needs mote
But his horrible cruelty
That might attempt no pity
Out of her chamber forth he went
All full of wrath in his entente
And took the counsel in his heart
That she shall not the death asterte
And he, which is melancolyen
Of pacyence has not lain
whereof he may his wrath restreyne
And in this wild wode pain
when all his reason was vntame
A kn^ght he cleped by his name
And took him, as by wey of sonde
A naked sword, to bear on hand
And said him, that he should go
And tell unto his daughter so
In the manner as he him bade
How she that sharp swerdes blade
Receive should, and do withal
So that she wot where to she shall
Forth in message goth this knight
Unto this woeful young wight
This sharp sword to her he took
whereof that all her body quoke
For well she wist what it meant
And that it was to thylke intent
That she her seluen should slay
And to the knight she said ye
Now that I wot my fathers will
That I shall in this wise spyll
I will obey me thereto
And as he woll it shall be do
But now this thing may be none other
I woll a letter unto my brother
So as my feeble hand may write
with all my woeful heart endyte
She took a pen on hand tho
Fro point to point and all the woe
As ferforth as her self it wot
Unto her deadly friend she wrote
And told how that her fathers grace
She might for nothing purchase
And over that as thou shall here
She wrote and said in this manner
O thou my sorrow, and my gladness
O thou my hele, and my syckenes
O thou my wanhope, and my trust
O thou my disese, and all my lust
O thou my well, O thou my woe
O thou my friend, O thou my fo
O thou my love, O thou my hate
For the mote I be dead algate
Thylke end may I not asterte
And yet with all mine holle heart
while that there lasts me any breath
I woll the love unto my death
But of o thing I shall the preye
If that my little son deye
Let him be buried in my grave
Beside me, so shalt thou have
Upon us both remembrance
For thus it stondeth of my greuaunce
Now at this time, as thou shall wite
with tears, and with ink write
This letter I have in cares cold
In my right hand my pen I hold
And in my left my sword I keep
And in my barme there lies to weep
Thy child and mine, which sobbeth fast
Now am I come unto my last
Fare well: for I shall sone dye
And think how I thy love abye
The pomell of the sword to ground
She set: and with the point a wound
Through out her heart anon she made
And forth with all pale and fade
She fell down deed fro there she stood
The child lay bathende in her blood
Out rolled from the mother barme
And for the blood was bote and warm
He basketh him about therein
There was no bote for to win
For which he can no pity know
The king came in the same throw
And saw how that his daughter died
And how this baby all blody cried
But all that might him not suffyse
That he ne badde to do Iuyse
Upon the child, and bear him out
And seche in the forest about
Some wild place that it were
To cast him out of hand there
So that some best him may devour
where as no man him shall socure
All that he badde was done in deed
A who hard ever sing or read
Of such a thing, as tho was do
But he, which ladde his wrath so
Has know of love but a lyte
But for all that he was to wit
Through his sodeyne melancolye
To do so great a felonye.
For thy my son, how so it stand
By this cas thou might understand
That if thou ever in cause of love
Shall deem, and thou be so above
That thou might lead it at thy will
Let never through thy wrath spylle
which every kind should save
For it sit every man to have
Reward to love and to his might
Against whose strength may no wight
And since an heart is so streined
The reddour ought to be restreined
To him that may bet aweye
when he mote to nature obey
For it is said thus ouerall
That needs mote, that needs shall
Of that a life does after kind
whereof he may no bote find
what thing nature has set in law
There may no man's might withdraw
And who that worcheth there ayene
Full often time it has be seyne
There has befalle great vengeance
whereof I find a remembrance.
Hic narrat qualiter Tiresias in quodam mo^te duos serppentes inuenit pariter
commiscentes quos cum virga percussit, Irati dil ob hoc, and naturam impediuit,
ipsum contra naturam a forma virili immuliebrem transmutarunt.
Ouide after the time tho
Told an ensample, and said so
How that whylom Tiresyas
As he walkend goth par cas
Upon an high mounteyne, he sygh
Two serpents in his wey^ nyghe
And they so, as nature hem taught
Assembled were, and he tho cought
A yerde, which he bare on hand
And thought, that he would fond
To let hem, and smote hem both
whereof the gods weren wroth
And for he has destourbed kind
And was so to nature unkind
Vnkyndelyche he was transformed
That he, which erst a man was formed
In to a woman was forshape
That was to him an angry iape
But for that he with anger wrought
His anger angerlyche he bought
Confessor.
Lo thus my son Ouide has write
whereof thou might by reason wit
More is a man than such a best
So might it never ben honest
A man to wrathen him to sore
Of that another does the lore
Of kind, in which is no malice
But only that it is a vice
And though a man be reasonable
yet after kind he is meuable
To love, where he woll or none
Think thou my son thereupon
And do melancolye aweye
For love has ever his lust to pleye
As he which would no life grieve.
Amans.
My fader that I may well leave
All that ye tell, it is skylle
Let every man love, as he will
Be so it be not my lady
For I shall not be wroth there by
But that I wrath and fare amys
Alone upon my self it is
That I with both love and kind
I am so bestad, that I can find
No wey, how I it may asterte
which stant upon mine own heart
And touches to none or her life
Sauf only to that sweet wife
For whom, but if it be amended
My glad days ben dispended
That I my self shall not forbere
The wrath, which I now bear
For thereof is none other lyche
Now asks forth I you beseech
Of wrath, if there ought else is
whereof to shryue. Son yis
(...) litem, que linguae frena resoluens,
(...) infames currit vbique vias.
(...) mitrix quos educat ista loquaces,
(...) a latere linquit habere vagos
(...) agens tacit^ no qui celet ore,
(...) ^^ptan carpit amoris iter.

OF wrath the second is chest
which has the wyndes of tempest
To keep, and mani a sodeine blast
He blows, whereof ben aghast
(...) that desyren pes and rest
H^ is that ylke ungoodly este
(...) many a lusty love has twynned
(...) hereth ever his mouth vnpinned
(...) that his lyppes ben vnloke
And his courage is all to broke
That every thing, which he can tell
It springs up as does a well
w^^che may no man of his stremes hide
B^^ renneth out on every side
S^ boylen up the foul sawes
That cheste wot of his felawes
For as a syue keeps Ale
R^ght so can cheste keep a tale
All that he wot, he woll dysclose
And speak er any man oppose
As a cite without wall
where men may gone out oueralle
withouten any resystence
So with his crooked eloquence
He speaks all, that he wot with ynne
whereof men lose more than win
For often time of his chydinge
He brings to house such tydynge
That makes werre at beds bid
He is the leueyn of the bread
which soureth all the past about
Men ought well such one to doubt
For ever his bow is ready bent
And whom he hit, I tell him shent
If he may perce him with his tongue
And eke so loud his belle is ronge
That of the noise, and of the soune
Men feren him in all the town
well more than they done of thonder
For that is cause of more wonder
For with the winds which he blows
Full often sith he over throws
The Cytees, and the polycye
That I have herd the people cry
And echone said in his degree
Ha wycke tongue woe thou be
For men sayn, that the hard bone
All though him self have none
A tongue breaks it all to pyeces
He has so many sundry spices
Of vice, that I may not well
Descriue hem by a thousand dele
But when that he to cheste falls
Full many a wonder thing befalls
For he ne can no thing forbere
Now tell my son thyn answer
If it has ever so betyde
That thou at any time have chyd
Toward thy love. Fader nay
Such cheste yet unto this day
Ne made I never, god forbede
For er I sing such a creed
I had lever to be lewed
For than were I all beshrewed
And worthy to be put a back
with all the sorrow upon my back
That any man ordeyne couthe
But I spoke never yet by mouth
That unto chest might touch
And that I durst right well vouche
Upon her self, as for wytnes
For I wot of her gentilnes
That she me would well excuse
That I no such things use
And if it should so betyde
That I algates must chyde
It might not be to my love
For so yet never was I above
For all this wide world to win
That I durst any word begin
By which she might have be amoued
And I of cheste also reproved
But rather if it might her like
The best words would I pyke
which I couthe in mine heart chese
And serve hem forth instead of chese
For that is helpelyche to defye
And I would so my words plye
That myghten wrath and cheste auale
with telling of my soft tale
Thus dar I make a forward
That never unto my lady ward
yet spoke I word in such a wise
whereof that chest should arise
Thus say I not, that I full often
Ne have, when I spoke most soft
Parcas said more than enough
But so well halt no man the plough
That he ne balketh other while
Ne so well can no man affyle
His tongue, that sometime in rape
Him may some light word ouerscape
And yet ne meneth he no cheste
But that I have ayene her best
Full often spoke, I am beknowe
And how my will is that ye know
For when my time comes about
That I dar speak, and say all out
My long love, of which she wot
That ever in one alyche hot
Me greueth: than all my dysese
I tell: and though it her dysplese
I speak it forth, and naught ne leave
And though it be beside her leave
I hope and trow netheles
That I do not ayene the pes
For though I tell her all my thought
She wot well, that I chyde naught
Men may the high god beseech
And he wol here a man's speech
And he not wroth of that he seyth
So yeueth it me the more feyth
And makes me hardy soth to sey
That I dar well the better prey
My lady, which a woman is
For though I tell her that er is
Of love, which me greueth sore
Her ought not be wroth the more
For I without noise or cry
My playnt make all buxomly
To putten all wrath away
Thus dar I say unto this day
Of cheste, in ernest or in game
My lady shall me no thing blame
But often time it bath betyde
That with my seluen I have chid
That no man couthe better chyde
And that has been at every tide
when I came to my selue allone
For than I made a preuy moan
And every tale by and by
which as I spoke to my lady
I think and peyse in my balaunce
And draw in to my remembrance
And than, if that I find a lack
Of any word, that I my spoke
which was to much in any wise
Anon my wits I despise
And make a chyding in mine heart
That any word me should asterte
which as I should have holden ynne
And soforth after I begin
And look if there was else ought
To speak, and I ne spoke it naught
And than if I may seche and find
That any word be left behind
which as I should more have spoke
I would upon my self be wroke
And chyde with my selfen so
That all my wit is over go
For no man may his time lore
Recover: and thus I am therfoe
So over wroth in all my thought
That I my self chyde all to naught
That for to much, or for to lyte
Full often I am my self to wit
But all that may me not avail
with cheste though I me travail
But oule on stoke, and stoke on oule
The more that a man defoule
Men wot well which has the werse
And so to me nis worth a kerse
But torneth unto mine own head
Though I tell, that I were deed
would ever chyde in such a wise
Of love, as I to you deuyse
But fader now ye have all herd
In this manner how I have ferd
Of cheste, and of dyssencyon
give me your absolucyon
Confessor.
My son if that thou wystest all
what cheste does in special
To love, and to his welwyllinge
Thou would fleen his knowlegeynge
For who that most can speak fair
And learn to be debonayre
Is most acordende unto love
Fair speech has often brought above
Full many a man, as it is know
which else should have been right low
And failed mochel of his will
For thy hold thy tongue stylle
And let thy wit thy will rest
So that thou fall not in cheste
which is the sours of great dystaunce
And take in to remembrance
If thou might get Pacyence
which is the leche of all offense
As tellen us the old wise
Paciencia est vindicta omnium iniuriarum.
For when naught else may suffyse
By strength, ne by man's wit
Than Pacyence it over sit
And over comes at last
But he may never long last
which woll not bow er that he break
Take heed son of that I speak
Amans.
My fader of your goodly speech
And of the wit, which ye me teache
I thank you with all mine heart
For that word shall me never astert
That I ne shall your words hold
Of Pacyence, as ye me told
Als ferforth as mine heart thinks
And of my wrath it me forthynketh
But father if ye forth with all
Some good ensample, in special
Me wolden teache of some Cronyke
It should well mine heart like
Of Pacyence for to here
So that I might in my matter
The more unto my love obey
And putten my disese aweye
Hic ponit Confessor Exemplum de paciencia in amore contra lites habenda, Et
narrat qualiter Vxor Socratis ipsum quodam die mustie sermonibus litigauit, Sed
cum ipse absque vlla responsione omnia probra pacienter sustulit / indignata
Vxor quandam ydriam plenam aque / quam in manu tenebat, super caput viri sui
subito effudit, dicens: Euigila et loquere / qui respo^dens tunc ait. O vere
iam scio / et expertus sum, quod post ventorum rabiem sequuntur imbres. Et isto
modo litis contumeliam sua paciencia deuicit.
Confessor.
My son a man to bye hympes
Behooves suffer as Socrates
Ensample left, which is write
And for thou shall the soth wit
Of this ensample, what I mean
All though it be now little seen
Among the men thylke euydence
Yet he was upon pacyence
So set, that he him self assay
In thing, which might him most mispay
Desires, and a wikked wife
He weddeth, which in sorrow and strife
Against his ease was contrayre
But he spoke ever soft and fair
Till it befelle, as it is told
In winter, when the day is cold
This wife was fro the well come
where that a pot with water nome
She has, and brought it in to house
And saw how that her sely spouse
was set, and looked on a book
Nygh to the fire, as he which took
His ease, as for a man of age
And she began the wood rage
And axeth him, what devil he thought
And bare on hond, that him ne rought
what labor that she took on hand
And says, that such an husbonde
was to a wife not worth a stre
He said another nay ne ye
But held him stille, and let her chyde
And she, which may her self not hyde
Began within for to swelle
And that she brought in fro the well
The water pot she hent a lofte
And badde him speak, and he all soft
Sat stylle, and naught a word answered
And she was wroth, that he so ferd
And axeth him, if he be deed
And all the water on his head
She poured out, and bad him a wake
But he, which woll not forsake
His patience, than spoke
And said, how that he fond no lake
In no thing which she had do
For it was winter time tho
And winter, as by wey of kind
which stormy is, as men it find
First makes the winds for to blow
And after that within a throw
He reyneth, and the water gates
Vndoth, and thus my wife algates
which is with reason well beseyn
Has made me both wind and reyn
After the season of the year
And than he set him ner the fire
And as he might his clothes dried
That he no more o word ne said
whereof he gat him somdele rest
For that him thought was for the best
I not if thylke ensample yet
Acordeth with a man's wit
To suffer, as Sosacrates deed
And if it fall in any stead
A man to lose so his galle
Him ought among the women all
In Loves court, by Judgment
The name bear of pacient
To give ensample to the good
Of patience how that it stood
That other men it might know
Amans.
And son if thou at any throw
Be tempted against pacyence
Take heed upon this evidence
It shall par case the less grieve
Amans.
My fader so as I believe
Of that shall be no manner need
For I woll take so good head
That er I fall in such assay
I think eschew, if that I may
But if there be ought else more
whereof I might take lore
I pray you, so as I dare
Now tells, that I may beware
Some other tale of this matter
Confessor.
Son it is ever good to lere
whereof thou might thy word restreyne
Er that thou fall in any pain
For who that can no counseyl hyde
He may not fail of woe beside
which shall befalle, er he it wit
As I find in the books write
Hic ponit Confessor exemplum quod de alterius lite intromittere cauendum est.
Et narrat qualiter Jupiter cum Iunone super quadam que sitione litigabant /
videlicet vtrum vir an mulier in amoris concupiscentia feruencius ardebat:
super quo Tiresiam eorum Iudicem constituebant Et qui ille contra Iunonem in
dicte litis causa sentenciam diffiniuit, irata de ipse deum amborum oculorum
lumme claritatis absque remissione priuauit.
Confessor.
Yet came there never good of strife
To seche in all a man's life
Though it begin on pure game
Full often it torneth in to grame
And does greuaunce on some side
whereof the great clerk Ouide
After the law, which was tho
Of Jupiter and of Juno
Makes in his books mention
How they fell at dissencyon
In manner as it were a board
As they began for to word
Among hem self in pryuete
And that was upon this degree
which of the two more amorous is
Or man or wife, And upon this
They might not acorde in one
And took a Judge thereupon
which cleped is Tyresyas
And bad him demen in this cas
And he without auysement
Avene Juno gafe Judgment
This gods, upon his answer
was wroth, and would not forbere
But took awey for euermo
The light from both his eyes two
when Jupiter this hurt has seen
Another benefyte there ayene
He yafe, and such a grace him does
That for he wyste be said soth
A ^oth sayer he was for ever
But yet that other were lever
^^ue had the lokynge of his eye
Than of his word the prophecye
But how so that the loath went
(...) was the cause, of that he hent
So great a pain bodyly
(...) son be thou ware there by
And hold thy tongue stylle close
For who that has his word dysclose
(...) he wit what he mean
(...) full often nyghe his tene
(...) leseth full many time grace
(...) that he would his thank purchase
And over this my son dear
(...) other men, if thou might here
(...) priuyte, what they have wrought
(...) counseyl, and dyscouer it naught
For cheste can no cou^seyl hele
Or be it woe or be it well
And take a tale in to thy mind
The which of old ensample I find.
(...) Confessor exemplum contra illos, (...) causa allterius consilium

Phoebus, which makes the dais light
A love he had, which tho byght
Coronis, whom abouen all.
He pleseth. But what shall befalle
Of love, there is no man knows
But as fortune her happes throws
So it befell upon a chance
A young knight took her acqueintaunce
And had of her all that he would
But a falls byrd, which she has hold
And kept in chamber of pure youth
Dyscouerith all that ever he couthe
The birds name was as tho
Coruus, the which was than also
well more white than any swan
And he the shrewe all that he can
Of his lady to Phoebus said
And he for wrath his swerd out braide
with which Coromde anon he slough
But after, him was woe enough
And took full great repentance
whereof in token and remembrance
Of hem, which vsen wycke speech
Upon this bird he took his wreche
That there he was snow white tofore
Ever afterward cole blake therefore
He was transformed, as it shows
And many a man yet him beshreweth
And clepen him in to this day
A Raven, by whom yet men may
Take euydence, when he cries
That some my shap it sygnifyeth
Beware therefore, and say the best
If thou wolt be thy self in rest
My good son, as I the read
Hic soquitur super eodem, Et narrat qualiter Lara Nimpha eo quod Jupiter
Iuturnam abulterauit / Iunoni Ionis vxori secretum reuelauit. Qua propter
Jupiter ira commotus singua Laris prins abscisa / ipsam postea in profundum
Acherontis exulem pro perpetuo mancipauit.
Lo in another place I read
Of thilk Nymphe, which Lara hight
For she the priuete by night
(How Jupiter lay by Iuturne)
Has told: god made her ouertorne
Her tongue he cut, and in to hell
For ever he sent her for to dwell
As she that was not worthy here
To ben of love a chambrere
For she no counsel couth bele
And such a days be now feel
In loves court, as it is said
That let her tongues gone vnteyde
My son be thou none of tho
To iangle, and tell tales so
And namely that thou ne chyde
For cheste can no counsel hyde
For wrath said never well
My father sothe is every dele
That ye me teache: and I woll hold
The rule, which I am hold
To flee the cheste, as ye me bydde
For well is him, that never chydde
Now tell me forth if there be more
As touching unto wrathes lore.
Daemonis est odium, quasi scriba cui dabit ira
Materiam scripti cordis ad antra sui.
Non laxabit amor, odii quem frena restringunt
Nec secreta sui iuris adire sciuit.
Hic tractat Confessor de tercia specie ire, que odiu^ dicitur: cuius natura
omnes ire inimicitias ad mentem reducens issas vsque ad tempus vindic te, vefut
scriba demonis in cordis papiro commemorandas inserit.
Of wrath yet there is an other
which is to cheste his own brother
And is by name cleped hate
That suffers not within his gate
That there come other love or peace
For he woll make no release
Of no debate which is befalle
Now speak if thou art one of all
That with this vice has he witholde
As yet for ought that ye me told
My father I not what it is
In good faith son I trow yis
My father nay but ye me lere
Now list my son and thou shall here
Hate is a wrath, not shewende
But of long time gatherende
And dwells in the heart loken
Till he see time to be wroken
And than he shows his tempest
More sodeyne than the wild beast
which wot nothing, what mercy is
My son art thou known of this?
My good father, as I wene
Now wot I somedele what ye mean
But I dare saufely make an oath
My lady was me never loathe
I woll not swear netheles
That I of bate am gylteles
For when I to my lady plye
Fro day to day, and mercy cry
And she no mercy on me leyth
But short words to me seyth
Though I my lady love algate
Tho words mote I needs hate
And would they were all dispent
Or so far out of land went
That I never after should hem here
And yet love I my lady dear
Thus is there hate, as ye may se
Between my ladies word, and me
The word I hate, and her I love
what so shall me betyde of love
But furthermore I woll me shryue
That I have hated all my live
These ianglers, which of her envy
Ben ever ready for to lie
For with her false compassement
Full often they have made me shent
And hyndred me full often time
when they no cause wyste byme
But onlyche of her own thought
And thus full often have I bought
The lie, and drunk not of the wine
I would her hap were such as mine
For how so that I be now shriue
To hem may I naught foryeue
Tylle I se hem at debate
with love, and with mine estate
They myghten by her own deem
And look how well it should hem queme
To hyndre a man, that loves sore
And thus I hate hem evermore
Till love on hem would done his wreche
For that shall I always beseech
Unto the mighty Cupydo
That he so mochel would do
(So as he is of love a god)
To smite hem with the same rod
with which I am of love smyten
So that they might know and wyten
How byndrynge is a woeful pain
To him, that love would atteyne
Thus ever on hem I wait and hope
Till I may seen hem lepe a lope
And halten on the same sore
which I do now for evermore
I would than do my might
So for to stonden in her light
That they ne shulden have awey
To that, they wolden put awey
I would hem put out of the stead
Fro love, right as they me deed
with that they speak of me by mouth
So would I do, if that I couth
Of hem, and thus so god me save
Is all the hate, that I have
Toward the ianglers every dele
I would all other ferde well
Thus have I father, said my will
Say forth now for I am stylle
My son of that thou have me said
I hold me naught fully paid
That thou wolte haten any man
To that accorden I ne can
Though he have hyndred the tofore
But this I tell the therefore
Thou might upon my benyson
well haten the condition
Of the ianglers, as thou me toldest
But furthermore, of that thou would
Hem byndre in any other wise
Such hate is ever to despise
For thy my son I would the read
That thou draw in by frendely head
That thou ne might not do by hate
So might thou get love algate
And set the my son in rest
For thou shalt find it for the best
And over this so as I dare
I read, that thou be right ware
Of other men's hate about
which every wise man should dout
For hate is ever upon awayte
And as the fyssher on his bayte
Sleeth, when he sees the fysshes fast
So when he sees time at last
That he may worche an other woe
Shall no man turn him therfro
That hate nyll his felony
Fulfill and feyne company
yet netheles for false semblaunt
Is toward him of covenant
witholde, so that under both
The preuy wrath can him cloth
That he shall seem a great believe
But ware the well, that thou ne leave
All that thou see before thyn eye
Soas the Gregoys whylom sye
The book of Troy who so read
There may he find ensample in deed
Hic ponit Confessor exemplum contra illos / qui cu^ ire sue odium aperte
vindicare non possint, ficta dissimulatione vindictam subdole assequentur. Et
narrat, quod cum Palamides princeps Grecorum in obsidione Troie a quibusdam
suis emulis proditorie interfectus fuisset / paterque suus rex Nauplus in
patria sua tunc existens / huiusmodi euentus certitudinem sciuisset: grecos in
sui cordis odium super omnia recollegit, vnde contigit, quod cum greci deuicta
Troia per altum mare versus Greciam nauigio remeantes obscurrissimo noctis
tempore nimia ventoru^ tempestate iactabantur, rex Nauplus in terra sua contra
litus maris / vbi maiora saxorum eminebant pericula super cacumina moncium,
grandissimos noctanter fecit ignes / quos greci aspicientes saluum portum
ibidem inuenire certissime putabant / Et teri am aproxima^tes diruptis nauibus
magna pars grecorum periclitabatur.
Son after the destruction
when Troy was all beat down
And slain was priamus the king
The gregoys, which of all this thing
Ben cause, tornen home again
There may no man his hap withseyne
It has been seen, and felt full often
The hard time after the soft
By see as they forth homewarde went
A rage of great tempest hem hent
Juno let bend her party bow
The sky wax derke, the wind began blow
The fyry welken began to thonder
As though the world should al a sonder
From heaven out of the water gates
The reyny storm fell down algates
And all her tacle made vnwelde
That no man might him self bewelde
There may men her shypmen cry
That stood in aunter for to dye
He that behind sat to stere
May not the for stern here
The ship arose again the wawes
The lodesman has lost his laws
The sea on beat on every side
They nysten what fortune abide
But set hem well in gods will
where he hem would save or spyll
And it fell thylke time thus
There was a king, which Nauplus
was hot: and be a son had
At Troy, which the gregoys ladde
As he that was made prince of all
Till that fortune let him fall
His name was Palamydes
But through an hate netheles
Of some of hem, his death was cast
And he by treason ouercaste
His father, when he herd it tell
He swore, if ever his time fell
He would him venge if that he might
And thereto his auowe he hight
And thus this king through prive hate
Abode upon a wait algate
For he was not of such empryse
To auengen him in open wise
The fame, which goth wide where
Makes know, how that the greeks were
Homward with all the felauship
Fro Troy upon the sea by ship
Nauplus when he this understood
And knew the tides of the flode
And saw the wind blow to the land
A great deceyte anon he fond
Of preuy bate, as thou shalt here
whereof I tell all this matere
This king the wether began behold
And wist well, they moten hold
Her course endelonge the march right
And made upon the derke night
Of great shydes and of blocks
Great ^^^e ageyn the great rocks
To show upon the hills high
So that the flete of greece it sygh
And so fell right as he thought
This flete, which an haven sought
The bright fyres saw a far
And they ben drawn ner and ner
And wend well, and understood
How all that fire was made for good
To show where men should aryue
And thytherwarde they hasten blyue
In semblaunt (as men said) is gyle
And that was proved thylke while
The ship, which we^d his help accroch
Drofe all to pieces on the roche
And so there deden ten or twelve
There might no man help him selue
For there they wenden death escape
withouten help her death was shape
Thus they that comen first tofore
Upon the rocks ben forlore
But through noise, and their cry
The other were ware thereby
And when the day began to row
Tho myghten they the soth know
That where they wend friends find
They fond friendship all behind
The land than was sone weyued
where that they hadden be deceived
And took hem to the high see
Thereto they sayden all ye
Fro that day forth, and where they were
Of that they have assayed there
Confessor.
My son whereof thou might auise
How fraud stant in many wise
Among hem, that gyle think
There is no scriuener with his ink
which half the fraud write can
That stant in such a manner man
For thy the wise men ne demen
The things after that they semen
But after that they know and find
The myrrour shows in his kind
As he had all the world within
And is in sothe nothing therein
And so fares hate for a throw
Till he a man has overthrow
Shall no man know by his chere
which is auaunt, and which is arere
For thy my son think on this
My father so I woll iwys
And if there more of wrath be
Now ask forth pur charity
As ye by your books know
And I the sothe shall beknowe.
Qui cohibere manum nequit, et sic spem eius
Naribus hic populo sepe timendas erit
Saepius in luctum Venus et sua gaudia transfert
Cumque suis thalamis talis ami cus adest.
Est amor amplexu non ictibus alliciendus
Frangit amicitias impetuosa manus.
Hic tractat Confessor super quarta et quinta specie ire / que impetuositas and
homicidium dicuntur: sed primo de impetuositate specialiter tractare intendit,
cuius natura spm^ in naribus gefia^do ad omnes ^re mociones in vindicta parata
pacientiam nullatenus obseruat.
My son thou shalt understand
That yet toward wrath stand
Of deadly vices other two
And for to tell her names so
It is Contecke and Homicide
That be to gether on every side
Contecke, as the books said
Foolehast has to his chamberlayne
By whose counsel all unadvised
Is Pacyence most despised
Till Homicide with hem mete
Fro Mercy they be all unmeet
And thus ben they the worst of all
Of hem, which unto wrath fall
In deed both, and eke in thought
For they accomten their wrath naught
But if there be shedynge of blood
And thus lyche to a beast wode
They known not the god of life
Be so they have other sword or knyfe
Her deadly wrath for to wreke
Of pity list hem not to speak
None other reason they ne fonge
But that they ben of might strong
But ware him well in other place
where every man behooves grace
But there I trow it shall him fail
To whom no mercy might avail
But wroughten upon tyranny
That no pite n^e might hem plye
Now tell me son. My father what?
If thou have be culpable of that
My father nay, Christ me forbede
I speak onlyche of the deed
Of which I was never culpable
without cause reasonable
But this is not to my matere
Of shryfte why we sytten here
For we be set to shryue of love
As we begone first above
And netheles I am beknowe
That as touchende of loves throw
when I my wits ouerwende
Mine hertes contecke has none end
But ever stant upon debate
To great disease of mine estate
As for the time that it lasts
For when my fortune ouercasteth
Her whele, and is to me so strange
And that I se she woll not change
Than cast I all the world about
And think how I at home in dout
Have all my time in vein spended
And se not how to be amended
But rather for to be empeyred
As he that is well nygh despeired
For I ne may nothing deserve
And ever I love, and ever I serve
And ever I am a lyche nere
Thus, for I stand in such a were
I am, as who says, out of herre
And thus upon my self I werre
I bring, and put out all pees
That I full often in such a rees
Am weary of mine own life
So that of contecke, and of strife
I am beknowe and have answerde
As ye my father now have herd
Mine heart is wonderly begone
with counsel, whereof wit is one
which has reason in company
Again the which stant party
will, which has Hope of his accord
And thus they bryngen up discord
wit and reason counsaylen often
That I mine heart should soft
And that I should V V Y L remue
And put him ont of retenue
Or else hold him under foot
For as they seyne, if that he mote
His own reule have upon hand
There shall no wit ben understand
Of hope, also to tellen this
That over all where that he is
He set the heart in ieopardy
with wysshynge and with fantasy
And is not true of that he says
So that in him there is no feyth
Thus with reason and wit auysed
Is will and hope all day despised
Reason says, that I should leave
To love, where there is no leave
To speed: and will says there again
That such an heart is to vyleyne
which dare not love, till that he speed
Let Hope serve at such a need
He seyth eke, where an heart sytte
All holle governed upon wit
He has this lives lust forlore
And thus mine heart is all to tore
Of such a contecke, as they make
But yet I may not VV Y L forsake
That he nys master of my thought
Or that I speed, or speed naught
Thou do my son against the right
But love is of so great a might
His law may no man refuse
So might thou the better excuse
And netheles thou shall be learned
That VV Y L should be governed
Of reason more than of kind
whereof a tale write I find.
Hic ponit Confessor exemplum quod omnis impetuosa voluntas sit discretionis
moderamine gubernanda. Et narrat qualiter Diogenes / qui motus animi sui
rationi subiugauerat, regem Alexandrum sub isto facto sibi opponente plemus
informanit.
A philosopher of which men told
There was whylom by days old
And Dyogenes than he hight
So old he was, that he ne might
The world travail, and for the best
He shope him for to take his rest
And dwell at home in such a wise
That nygh his house he let deuyse
Endelonge upon an axell tree
To set a tonne in such degree
That he it might turn about
whereof one heed was taken out
For he therein sytte should
And turn him self as he would
And take the air, and se the heaven
And deem of the planettes seven
As he, which couthe mochell what
And thus full often there he sat
To muse in his philosophye
Sole without company
So that upon a morrow tide
A thing, which should tho betyde
when he was set, there as him list
To look upon the son aryst
whereof the property he syghe
It fell, there came riding nygh
King Alysaunder, with a rout
And as he cast his eye about
He sygh this tonne: and what it meant
He would wit, and thither sent
A knight, by whom he might it know
And he him self that ilke throw
Abode, and houeth there stylle
This knight, after the kings will
with spore made his horse to gone
And to the tonne he came anon
where that he fond a man of age
And he him told the message
Such as the king him had bid
And asks why in thylke stead
The tonne stood: and what he was
And he, which understood the cas
Sat still, and spoke no word again
The knight bad speak: and says, Vyleyn
Thou shall me tell, er that I go
It is thy king, which asks so
My king, quod he, that were unright
what is he than, says the knight?
Is he thy man? that say I naught
Quod he, but this I am bethought
My man's man how that he is
Thou lie falls chorle iwys
The knight him said and was right wroth
And to the king ayene he goth
And told him, how this man answerde
The king when he this tale herd
Bad that they should all abide
For he him self would thither ride
And when he came tofore the Tonne
He has his tale thus begone
Al heyl he seyth, what man art thou
Quod he? Such one, as thou see now
The king, which had words wise
His age would naught despise
But says: My father I the pray
That thou me wolt the cause say
How that I am thy man's man
Sire king, quod he, that I can
if thou wylt. yes, seyth the king
Quod he, this is the soth thing
Sith I first reason understood
And knew what thing was evil and good
The will, which of my body moves
whose works that the god reproves
I have restreyned ever more
Of him, that stant under the lore
Of reason, whose subject he is
So that he may not done amys
And thus by weye of covenant
WILL is my man, and my servant
And ever has be, and ever shall
And thy will is thy pryncipal
And has the lordship of thy wit
So that thou couthest never yet
Take a day rest of thy labor
But for to be a Conqueror
Of worlds good, which may not last
Thou highest ever a lyche fast
where thou no reason have to win
Thus thy will is cause of sin
And is thy lord to whom thou seruest
whereof thou little thonke deseruest
The king, of that he thus answered
was nothing wroth: but when he herd
The high wisdom which he said
with goodly words thus be prayde
That be him would tell his name
I am, quod he that ylke same
which men Dyogenes call
Tho was the king right glad with all
For he had herd often to fore
what man he was, so that therefore
He said: O wise Diogene
Now shall thy great wit be seen
For thou shall of my yefte have
what worlds thing thou woltecraue
Quod he, tha^ houe out of my son
And let it shine in to my Tonne
For thou bynemest me thylke yifte
which lies not in thy might to shyfte
None other good of the me needs
The king / who^ every country dredeth
Lo thus he was informed there
whereof my sone thou might lere
How that thy will shall naught believed
where it is naught of wit releued
And thou have said thy self er this
How that thy will thy master is
Through which thyn hertes thought within
Is ever of conteke to begin
So that it is gretely to dread
That it no bomycyde bread
For love is of a wondre kind
And has his wits often blind
That they fro man's reason fall
But when that it is so befalle
That will shall the courage led
In loves cause it is to dread
whereof I find ensample write
which is behouefull that thou wit.
Hic in a moris causa ponit Confessor exemplum contra issos / qui in sua dampna
nimis accelerantes ex impetuositate se ipsos muftociens offendunt. Et narrat
qualiter Piramus cum ipse Tisbe amicam suam in foco inter eosdem deputa to
tempore aduentus sui promptam non inuenit, animo impetuoso se ipsum pre dolor
extracto gladio mortaliter transfodit. que postea infra breue beniens cum ipsum
sic mortaum inuenisset / eciam et illa in sue ipsius mortem impetuose festmans
eiusdem gsadii cuspide sui cordis intima per medium penetrauit.
I read a tale, and tells this
The city which Semiramis
Enclosed has with wall about
Of worthy folk with many a rout
was inhabyted here and there
Among the which two there were
Abouen all other noble and great
Dwellend tho within a street
So nyghe to gether as it was seen
There was nothing hem between
But wowe to wowe, and wall to wall
This o lord has in specyalle
A son, a lustye bachylere
In all the town was none his pere
That other had a daughter eke
In all the land for to seek
Men wisten no^e so fair as she
And fell for as it should be
This fair daughter nigh this son
As they to geder than won
Cupyde has so things shape
That they ne might his hands escape
That he his fire on hem ne cast
whereof her hearts he ouercaste
To follow thylke lore and jew
which never man yet might eschew
And that was love, as it is happed
which has her bertes so betrapped
That they by all weyes seche
How that they might win a speech
Her woeful pain for to lysse
who loves well, it may not mysse
And namely when thereben two
Of one accord, how so it go
But if that they some weye find
For love is ever of such a kind
And has his folk so well affayted
That how so that it be awayted
There may no man the purpos let
And thus between hem two they set
An hoole upon a wall to make
Through which they have her cou^seil take
At all times, when they might
This fair Maid It Is be hight
And he, whom she loved hot
was Piramus by name hot
So long her lesson they recorden
Till at the last they acorden
By nyghtes time for to wend
Alone out fro the Towns end
where was a well under a tree
And who came first or she or he
He should stille there abide
So it befelle the nyghtes tide
This maid, which desguysed was
All pryuely the soft paas
Goth through the larg town unknow
Till that she came within athrowe
where that she lyked for to dwell
At thylke unhappy fresshe well
which was also the forest nyghe
where she comend a lion syghe
In to the field to take his pray
In haste: and she tho fled away
(So as fortune should fall)
For fere, and let her wympell fall
Nyghe to the well upon therbage
This wild lion in his rage
A best, which he found there out
Has slain, and with his blody snowte
(when he has eten, what he would)
To drink of thylke stremes cold
Come unto the well, where he sonde
The wympill, which out of her hand
was fall, and he it has to draw,
Be bledde about, and all forgnawe
And than he straught him for to drink
Upon the fress he wells brynke
And after that out of the plain
He torneth to the wode again
And Tisbe durst not remewe
But as a bird, which were en mewe
within a buss he she kept her close
So still, that she not arose
Unto her self and playneth ay
And fell, while that she there lay
This Piramus came after sone
Unto the well, and by the moon
He fond her wympyl blody there
Came never yet to man's ere
Tydynge, ne to man's sight
Meruaylle, which so sore a flight
A man's heart, as it tho deed
To him, which in the same stead
with many a woeful complaining
Bygan his hands for to wrynge
As he, which demeth sykerly
That she be deed: and suddenly
His sword all naked out he breyde
In his fool have, and thus he said
I am cause of this felonye
So it is reason, that I dye
And she is deed by cause of me
And with that word upon his k^e
He fell, and to the gods all
Unto the heaven he began to call
And prayed, syn it was so
That he may not his love as tho
Have in this world, that of her grace
He might her have in other place
For here would he not abide
He says: but as it shall betyde
The pomel of his swerd to ground
He set, and through his heart a wound
He made up to the bare hylte
And in this wise him self spylte
with his foolhaste, and death he nam
For she within a while came
where he lay deed upon his knyfe
So woeful yet was never life
As Tysbe was, when she him sygh
She might not one word on high
Speak, for her heart shette
That of her life no prys she set
But deed swonynge down she fell
Till afterward it so befell
That she out of her trauns awoke
with many a woeful pytous look
Her eye alwey among she cast
Upon her love, and at the last
She caught breath, and said thus:
O thou which art cleped venus
Goddess of love: and thou Cupyde
which loves cause haste for to guide
I wot now well, that ye be blind
O^ thylke unhap, which I now find
Only between my love and me
This Piramus which here I se
^^^^end, what has he deserved?
Yo^ he thyn hest has kept and served
And was young, and I both also
All is why do ye with us so?
Ye set our hertes both a fire
And made us such thing desire
whereof that we no skyl couthe
But thus our fresshe lusty youth
without joy is all despended
which thing may never be amended
For as for me this woll I seye
That me is lever for to deye
Than live after this sorrowful day
And with this word where as he lay
Her love in arms she embraseth
Her own death and so purchases
That now she wept, and now she kyste
Till at the last, or she it wyste
So great a sorrow is to her fall
which ouergoth her wits all
And she, which might not asterte
The swerdes point ayenste her heart
She set, and fell down thereupon
whereof that she was deed anon
And thus both on a swerd bledend
They were found deed lyggend.
Now thou my son have herd this tale
Beware that of thyn own bale
Thou be not cause in thy foolhaste
And keep that thou thy wit ne waste
Upon thy thought in adventure
whereof thy lives forfeture
May fall: and if thou have so thought
Er this, tell on, and hyde it naught
My fader upon loves side
My conscience I wol not hyde
How that for love of pure woe
I have been often be moved so
That with my wysshes, if I might
A thousand times, I you plyght
I had storuen in a day
And thereof I me shryue may
Though love fully me ne slow
My will to deye was ynowe
So am I of my will culpable
And yet she is not mercyable
which may me give life and bele
But that her list not with me dele
I wot by whose counsayl it is
And him would I long time er this
(And yet I would and ever shall)
Sleen and destroy in especyall
The gold of nine kings lands
Ne should him save fro mine bonds
In my power if that he were
But yet him stant of me no fere
For naught that ever I can manace
He is the hinderer of my grace
Till he be deed I may not speed
So mote I needs taken bid
And shape how, that he were awey
If I thereto may find a weye
My son tell me now for thy
which is that mortal enemy
That thou manacest to be deed.
My fader it is such a quede
That where I come, he is tofore
And does so, that my cause is lore
what is his name? Hit is Danger
which is my ladis counseyler
For I was never yet so slygh
To come in any place nygh
where as she was by night or day
That Danger ne was ready ay
with whom for speech ne for mede
yet might I never of love speed
For ever this find I soth
All that my lady says or does
To me, Danger shall make an end
And that makes al mi world miswe^de
And ever I ask his help: but he
May be well cleped Sauns pity
For ay the more I to him bow
The less be woll my tale allow
He has my lady so englewed
She woll not, that he be remewed
For ever he hongeth on her seyl
And is so preuy of counseyll
That ever when I have ought bid
I find Danger in her stead
And mine answer of him I have
But for no mercy, that I crave
Of mercy never a point I had
I find his answer ay badde
That worse might it never be
And thus between Danger and me
Is ever werre till he dye
But might I ben of such maystrye
That I Danger had overcome
with that were all my joy come
Thus would I wonde for no sin
Ne yet for all this world to win
If that I might find a sleyght
To lay all my state in weight
I would him fro the Court deseuer
So that he come ayenewarde never
Therefore I wysshe, and would fayn
That he were in some wise slain
For while he stant in thylke place
Ne get I not my ladys grace
Thus hate I dedely thylke vice
And would he stood in none office
In place, where my lady is
For if be do, I wot well this
That outher he shall dye or I
within a while, and not for thy
On my lady full often I muse
How that she may herself excuse
For if that I dye in such a plyte
Me thynkethe she might not be quyte
That she ne were an bomycyde
And if it should so betyde
(As god forbede it should be)
By double wey it is pity
For I, which all my will and wit
Have give, and served ever yet
And than I should in such a wise
In rewardynge of my service
Be deed: Me thinks it were routh
And ferthermore I tell troth
She that has ever be well named
were worthy than to be blamed
And of reasone to be appeled
when with o word she might have he^
A man: and suffers him to deye
A who saw ever such a wey?
A who saw ever such distress?
without pity gentylnesse
without mercy womanhede
That woll so quyte a man his mede
which ever has be to love true.
My good fader if ye rewe
Upon my tale, tell me now
And I wol stynte and harken you
My son attempre thy courage
Fro wrath, and let thyn heart assuage
For who so wol him vnderfonge
He may his grace abide long
Or he of love be receyned
And eke also but if it be weyued
There might mochel thing befalle
That should make a man to fall
Fro love: that never afterward
Ne durst he look thyderwarde
In hard weyes men gone soft
And er they clymbe auyse them often
And men seen all day, that rape reweth
And who so wicked ale breweth
Full often he mote the werse drink
Better it is to flete than to synke
Better it is upon the brydell chewe
Than if he fell, and ouerthrewe
The horse, and stykked in the mire
To cast water in the fire
Better is, than brenne up all the howes
The man which is malycious
And foolhasty: full often he falls
And seldom is, when love him calls
For thy better is suffer a throw
Than to be wild, and over throw
Suffraunce has ever be the best
To wysen him that secheth rest
And thus if thou wylt love speed
My son suffer, as I the read
what may the mous again the cat?
And for thylke cause I ask that
who may to love make a werre
That he ne has him self the werre
Love asks pees, and euershall
And who that fyghteth most withal
Shall best conquer of his empryse
For this they tellen that been wise
which is to strive, and have the werse
To hasten, is naught worth a kerse
Thing, that a man may not acheue
That may not well be done at eve
It mot abide till the morrow
N^ have not thine own sorrow
My son, and take this in thy wit
He has not lost that well abitte
Ensample, that it falls thus
Thou might well take of Pyramus
when he in haste his swerd out drough
And on the point him self slough
For love of Tisbe, pitously
For he her wymple fond blody
And wend a best had her slain
where as him ought be right fayn
For she was saffe right beside
But for he would not abide
This meschyefe fell. For thy beware
My son, as I the warn dare
Do thou no thing in such a rees
For suffraunce is the well of pees
Though thou to loves court pursewe
yet sit it well, that thou eschew
That thou the court not ouerhast
For so thou might thy time wast
But if thyn hap thereto be shape
It may not help for to rape
Therefore attemper thy courage
Foolhast does none advantage
But often it set a man behind
In cause of love, and I find
By old ensamples as thou shall here
Touchend of love in this matter.
Hic ponit Confessor Exemplum contra illos qui in amoris causa nimia
festinatione concupiscentes tardius expediunt, Et narrat qualiter pro eo quod
Phoebus qua^dam virginem pulcher rimam nomine Daphnem nimia amoris acceleratione
insequebatur / Iratus Cupido cor Phebi sagitta aurea ignita ardencius
vulnerauit, Et econtra cor Daphne quadam sagitta plumbea / que frigidissima
fuit / sobrius perforauit / Et sic quanto magis Phoebus ardencior in amore
Daphnem persecutus est, tanto magis ipsa frigidior Phebi concupiscenciam toto
cord fugitina dedignabatur.
A maiden whylom there was one
which Daphnes hight: and such was none
Of beauty than, as it was said
Phoebus his love has on her laid
And thereupon to her he sought
In his foolhast, and so besought
That she with him no rest had
For ever upon her love he grad
And she said ever unto him nay
So it beselle upon a day
Cupyde, which has every chance
Of love, under his governance
Sygh Phoebus hasten him so sore
And for he should him haste the more
And yet not speden, at last
A dart throughout his heart he cast
which was of gold, and all a fire
That made him many fold desire
Of love more than he deed
To Daphne eke in the same stead
A dart of leed he cast and smote
which was all cold and no thing hot
And thus Phoebus in love brenneth
And in have about renneth
To look, if that he might win
Thus was he ever to begin
For ever awey fro him she fled
So that he never his love sped
And for to make him full believe
That no foolhast might acheue
To get love in such degree
This Daphne in to a laurel tree
was turned, which is ever grene
In token, as yet it may be seen
That she shall dwell a maiden stylle
And Phoebus faylen of his will
By such ensamples as they stand
My son thou might understand
To hasten love is thing in veyn
when that fortune is there again
To take where a man has leave
Good is: and else he mote leave
For when a man's happes faylen
There is no have may auaylen
My fader grant mercy of this
But while I se my lady is
No tree: but hold her own form
There may me no man so inform
To whedyr part fortune wend
That I unto my lives end
Ne would her serve euermo
Confessor
My son sith it is so
I say no more, but in this cas
Beware, how it with Phoebus was
Naught only upon loves chance
But upon every governance
which falls unto man's deed
Foolhast is ever for to dread
And that a man good counseyl take
Er he his purpose undertake
For counseyl put foolhast a wey.
Now good fader I you prey
That for to wysse me the more
Some good ensample upon this lore
ye would me tell, of that is writ
That I the better might wit
How I foolhast should eschew
And the wisdom of counseyl sewe
My son that thou might inform
Thy patience upon the form
Of old ensamples as they fell
Now understand, what I shall tell.
Hic ponit Confessor exemplum contra illos qui nimio furori accensi vindictam
Ire sue vlira quam decet co^sequi affectant. Et narrat qualiter Athemas et
Demephon Reges, cum ipsi a bello Troiano ad propria remeassent, et asuis ibidem
pacifice recepti non fuissent, congregato aliunde pugnatorum exercitu regiones
suas non solum incendio vastare sed et omnes in eisdem habitantes a minimo
vsque admaiorem in perpetnam vindicte memoriam gladio interficere feruore
iracun die proposuerunt: Sed rex Nestor, qui senex et sapiens fuit / tractatus
inter ipsos re^ges et eorum regna ^^ta pace huiusmodi impetuositatem initius
pacificauit.
when noble Troy was byleyn
And overcome, and home again
The gregoys turned from the siege
The kings fond her own lyege
In many place, as men said
That hem forsook and dysobeyde
Among the which fell this case
To Demephon and Athemas
That were kings both two
And both were served so
Her lieges would not hem receive
So that they mote algates weiue
To seche land in other place
For there fond they no grace
whereof they token hem to read
And soughten friends at need
And each of hem assures other
To help as to his own brother
To vengen hem of thylke oultrage
And win ayene her heritage
And thus they ride about fast
To getten hem help: and at last
They hadden power suffysaunt
And maden than a couenaunte
That they ne should no life save
Ne pressed, ne clerk, ne lord, ne knave
Ne wife, ne child of that they find
which bears vysage of man's kind
So that no life shall be socoured
But with the dedely sword devoured
In such foolhast her ordinance
They shapen for to do vengeance
when this purpose was wist and know
Among there host, tho was their blow
Of words many a speech about
Of young men the lusty route
were of this tale glad enough
There was no care for the plough
As they that were foolhastyfe
They ben acorded to the strife
And seyn, it may not be to great
To vengen hem of such forfet
Thus says the wild unwise tongue
Of hem, that there weren young
But Nestor, which was old and bore
The salve saw tofore the sore
As he that was of counseyle wise
So that anon by his advise
There was a preuy counsel nome
The lords ben to gether come
This Demephon and Anthemas
Her purpose tolden, as it was
They setten all still and herd
was non but Nestor hem answerde
He badde hem, if they would win
They shulden se, er they begin
Her end: and set her first intent
That they hem after ne repent
And asks hem this question
To what fynall conclusyon
They wolden Regne kings there
If that no people in land were?
And seyth, it were a wonder wyerd
To ^een a king bycomen an hyerd
where no life is but only best
under the lygeaunce of his heste
For who that is of man no king
The remenaunt is as no thing
He forth eke, if they purpose bold
To (...) the people, as they two would
when they it might not restore
A^ ^^^ce it should abidge sore
(...) the wild beasts won
where whylom dwelt man's son
An^ for that cause he bad hem treat
A d stynt of tho manaces great
Better is to win by fair speech
He seyth, than such vengeance seche
For when a man is most above
Him needs most to get him love.
when Nestor has this tale said
Ayene him was no word withsayde
It thought hem all he said well
And thus fortune her deadly whele
Fro werre tourneth in to pees
But forth they went en netheles
And when the countries hard seyne
How that her kings be beseyne
Of such a power as they lad
was none so bold, that hem ne drad
And for to seche peace and gryth
They send and prayde anon forthwith
So that the kings ben appeased
And every man's heart is eased
All was foryete, and not recorded
And thus they ben to geder acorded
The kings were ayene received
And pees was take, and wrath weyued
And all through counseyl, which was good
Of him that reason understood
By this ensample son attempre
Thyn heart, and let no will dystempre
Thy wit: and do no thing by might
which may be do by love and right
Foolhast is cause of mochel woe
For thy my son do not so
And as touchend of Homycyde
which touches unto loves side
Full often it falls unadvised
Through WILL which is not well assised
when wit and reason ben awey
And that foolhast is in the wey
whereof has fall great vengeance
For thy take in to remebraunce
To love in such a manner wise
That thou deserve no iuyse
For well I wot, thou might not let
That thou ne shall thin heart set
To love, where thou wolt or none
But if thy wit be ouergone
So that it torn unto malice
There wot no man of thylke vice
what peril that there may befalle
whereof a tale among all
which is great pity for to here
I think for to tellen here
That thou such murdre micht withsto^d
when thou the tale have understand.
Hic ponit Confessor exemplum contra illos qui ob sue concupiscencie desiderium
Homicide efficiuntur. Et narrat qualiter Clyte^nestra vxor Regis Agamemnonis
cum ipse a bello Troiano domi rediffet consilio Egisti / quem adultera
peramauit, sponsum suum in cubili dormientem sub noctis silencio trucidabat.
cuius mortem fisius eius Horestes tunc iunioris etatis postea diis admonitus
crudelissima seueritate vindicauit.
Of Troy at thylke noble town
whose same stant yet of renown
And ever shall to man's ere
The syege last long there
Er that the greeks it might win
while Priamus was king therein
But of the greeks, that lain about
Agamemnon ladde all the route
This thing is known ouerall
But yet I think in special
To my matter thereupon
Tell in what wise Agamemnon
Through chance, that may not be weiued
Of love untrue was deceived
An old saw is: who that is slygh
In place were he may be nyghe
He makes the far leef, loath
Of love and thus full often it goth
There while Agamemnon bataylleth
To win Troy, and it assaylleth
From home and was long time there
Egystus drough his queen nere
And with the leyser, which he had
This lady at his will he ladde
Clyte^nestre was her right name
She was thereof greatly to blame
To love there it may not last
But fell to mischief at last
For when this noble worthy knight
Fro Troy came the first night
That he at home a bed lay
Egistus long er it was day
As this Clytenestre him had assent
And weren both of one assent
By treason slough him in his bed
But mourder, which may not be^ head
Spronge out to every man's ear
whereof the land was full of fear
Agamemnon has by this queen
A son, and that was after seen
But yet as than he was of youth
A babe, which no reason couth
And as god would, it fell him thus
A worthy knight Taltibius
This young child has in keeping
And when he herd of this tydynge
Of this treason of this mysdede
He began within him self to dread
In aunter if this false Egiste
Upon him come, er he it wyste
To take and mourther, of his malice
This child, which he has to noryce
And for that cause in all haste
Out of the land he began him haste
And to the king of Crete he straught
And him this young lord betaught
And prayde him for his fathers sake
That he this child would undertake
And keep him till he be of age
So as he was of his lygnage
And told him over all the cas
How that his father mourthred was
And how Egistus, as men said
was king, to whom the land obeyde.
And when Idomeneus the king
Has understanding of this thing
which that this knight him has told
He made sorrow many fold
And took the child unto his ward
And said, he would him keep and ward
Till that he were of such a might
To handle a sword, and be a knight
To vengen him at his own will
And thus Horestes dwells stylle
Such was the childs right name
which after wrought mochel shame
In vengeance of his fathers death
The time of years ouergeth
That he was man of bread and length
Of wit, of manhood, and of strength
A fair person among all
And he began to clepe and call
As he, which come was to man,
Unto the king of Crete than
Prayende that he would him make
A knight, and power with him take
For longer would he not believe
He says, but prayth the king of leave
To gone and cleyme his heritage
And venge him of thylke oultrage
which was unto his father do
The king assenteth well thereto
with great honor, and knight him makes
And great power to him betaketh
And began his journey for to cast
So that Horestes at last
His leave took, and forth he goth
As he that was in his heart wroth
His first playnt to be mean
Unto the city of Athene
He goth him forth, and was received
So there was be naught deceived
The duke, and tho that weren wise
They proferen hem to his service
And he hem thonketh of their proffer
And said him self he would gone offer
Unto the gods for his speed
And all men give him read
So goth he unto the temple forth
Of yeftes, that be mochell worth
His sacrifyce, and his offrynge
He made: and after his asking
He was answerde, if that he would
His estate recover, than he should
Upon his mother do vengeance
So cruel, that the remembrance
Thereof might evermore abide
A^^ he that was an homicide
^^d of her own lord mourdrice
H^^ ^stes, which of thylke office
(...) nothing glad, and than he prayde
V^^o the gods there, and said
(...) they the judgment deuyse
^^we he shall take the iuyse
And thereupon he had answer
T^^t he her pappes should of tere
(...) of her breast, his own hondes
A^^ for e^sample of all lands
(...) ^o^s she should be to draw
(...) hounds had her bones gnawe
^^^^out any sepulture
(...) was a woeful adventure
And when Horestes has all herd
(...) that the gods have answerde
^^rth with the strength, which he lad
The duke and his power he had
And to a city forth they gone
The which was cleped Cropheone
where as Phoicus was lord and fire
which profereth him withouten hyre
His help, and all that he may do
As he that was right glad thereto
^o grieve his mortal ennemy
And told him certain cause why
How that Egyste in marriage
His daughter whylom of full age
Forlay, and afterward forsook
when he Horestes mother took
Men said old sin new shame
Thus more and more arose the blame
Ayene Egyste on every side
Horestes with his host to ride
Began, and Phoicus with him went
I trow Egyst shall him repent
They ryden forth unto Mycene
There lay Clytemnestre thilke queen
The which Horestes mother is
And when she herd tell of this
The gates were fast shette
And they were of her enter let
Anon this city was without
Beleyne, and seged all about
And ever among they it assail
Fro day to night, and so travail
Till at last they it won
Tho was there sorrow enough begone
Horestes did his mother call
Anon tofore the lords all
And eke tofore the people also
To her and told his tale tho
And said: O cruel beast unkind
How might thou in thyn heart find
For any lust of loves draught
That thou accordest to the slaught
Of him, which was thyn own lord
Thy treason stant of such record
Thou might thy works not forsake
So mote I for my father sake
Vengeance upon thy body do
As I commanded am thereto
Unkindly for thou have wrought
Vnkyndelyche it shall be bought
The son shall the mother slay
For that whylom thou saydest ye
To that thou should nay have said
And he with that his hondes has laid
Upon his mother breast anon
And rent out from the bare bone
Her pappes both, and cast away
Amyddes in the cart way
And after took the dead cors
And let it be draw awey with horse
Unto the hounde, unto the Raven
She was none other wise graven
Egystus which was else where
Tidings comen to his ear
How that Mycenes was beleyne
But what was more, herd be not said
with great manace and mochel boste
He drough power, and made an host
And came in the rescous of the town
But all the sleyght of this treasone
Horestes wist it by a spy
And of his men a great party
He made ambusshement abide
To wait on him in such a tide
That he ne might her hand escape
And in this wise, as he has shape
The thing befell, so that Egyst
was take, er he him self it wist
And was brought forth his ho^des bo^de
As when men have a traitor fond
And tho that were with him take
which of treason were overtake
To gether in one sentence fall
But false Egyste above hem all
was demed to diverse pain
The werst that men couthe ordeyne
And so after by the law
He was unto the gybet draw
where he above all other hongeth
As to a traitor it belongs
The fame with her swyfte wings
About flees, and bare tidings
And made it couth in all lands
How that Horestes, with his hondes
Clytemnestre his own mother slough
Some seyne, he did well enough
And some seyne, he did amys
Diverse opinions there is
That she is deed they speken all
But pleynly how it is befalle
The matter in so little throw
In sothe there might no man know
But they that weren at the deed
And commonlyche in every need
The werst speech is rathest herd
And leued, till it be answerde
The kings, and the lords great
Begone Horestes for to threat
To putten him out of his reign
He is not worthy for to reign
The child, which slough his mother so
They said, and thereupon also
The lords of common assent
The time set of parliament
And to Athenys king and lord
To gether come of one accord
To know how that the soth was
So that Horestes in this cas
They senden after, and he come
King Menelay the words nome
And asks him of this matere
And he, that all it might here
Answerde, and told his tale at large
And how the gods in his charge
Commanded him in such a wise
His own hand to do iuyse
with this tale a duke arose
which was a worthy knight of lose
His name was Menestheus
And said unto the lords thus
The wreche, which Horestes deed
It was thing of the gods bid
And nothing of his cruelty
And if there were of my degree
In all this place such a knight
That woll seyne, it was no right
I woll it with my body prove
And thereupon he cast his glove
And eke this noble duke a leyde
Full many an other skyll and seyde
She had well deserved wreche
First for the cause of spouse breche
And after wrought in such a wise
That all the world it ought agryse
when that she for so foul a vice
was of her own lord mourdrice
They sytten all stylle and herd
But thereto was no man answerde
It tought hem all, he said skylle
There is no man with say it will
when they upon the reason musen
Horestes all they excusen
So that with great solempnite
He was unto his dignite
Received, and coroned king
And tho befell a wondre thing
Egyona when she it wyste
which was the daughter of Egyste
And sister on the mother side
To this Horest, at thylke tide
when she herd, how her brother sped
For pure sorrow, which herled
That he ne had been exyled
She has her own life begyled
Anon, and henge her self tho
It has and shall be euermo
To mourtherwho that woll assente
He may not fail to repent
This false Egyona was one
which to mourther Agamemnon
yaue her accord, and her assent
So that by gods judgment
Though none other man it would
She took her iuyse, as she should
And as she to an other wrought
Vengeance upon her self she thought
And has of her unhappy wit
A mourther with a mourther quyt
Such is of mourther the vengeance.
For thy my son in remembrance
^f this ^nsample take good head
For who that thinks his love speed
with mourther, be shall with worlds shame
Him self and eke his love shame
My father of this adventure
which ye have told, I you assure
My heart is sorry for to here
But only for I would lere
what is to done, and what to leave
And over this by your leave
That ye me would tell I prey
If there be leful any weye
without sin a man may slay
My sone in sundry wise ye
what man that is of Traytorye
Of mordre, or else Robberye
At teynt, the Judge shall not let
But he shall fleen of pure det
And does great sin if that he wo^de
For who that law has upon hand
And spares for to do justice
For mercy: does not his office
That he his mercy so bewareth
wha^ for one shrewe, which he spares
A thousand good men be greueth
with such mercy who that bileueth
To please god: he is deceived
Or else mote reason be weyued
The law stood or we were bore
How that a kings sword is bore
In sign, that he shall defend
His true people: and make an end
Of such, as wolden hem devour
Lo thus my son to souccour
The law, and common right to win
A man may slay without sin
And do thereof a great alms
So for to keep ryghtwysenes
And over this for his country
In time of werre, a man is free
Himself, his house, and eke his land
Defend with his own hand
And sleen, if be may no bet
After the law, which is set.
Now father than I you beseech
Of hem, that deedly werres seche
In worlds cause, and sheden blood
If such an homicide is good?
Confessor.
My son upon thy questyon
The troth of mine opinyon
(Als ferforth as my wit arecheth
And as the plain law teaches)
I would the tell in euydence
To rule with thy conscience
Quod ^reat ipse deus, necat hoc homicida creatu^
Vltor et humano sanguine spargit humum
Vt pecoris sic est hoi^s cruor heu modo fusus
Victa iacet pietas, et furor vrget opus
Angelus in terra pax dixit, et vltima Christi
Verba sonent pacem qua^ modo guerra fugat.
. Hic sequitur contra motoresguerre, que non solum homicidii sed vniuersi mundi
desolationis matter existit.
The high god of his justice
The ilke foul horrible vice
Of homicide he has forbede
By Moses, as it was bid
when gods son was also bore
He sent his angel down therefore
whom the shepeherdes herden sing
Pees to the men of welwyllynge
In earth among us here
So for to speak in this matere
After the law of charity
There shall no deadly werre be
And eke nature it has defended
And in her law pees commended
which is the chief of man's wealth
Of man's life, of man's health
But deadly werre has his couyne
Of pestilence, and of famyne
Of pouerte, and of all woe
whereof this world we blamen so
which now the werre has underfoot
Till god him self thereof do bote
For all thing, which god has wrought
In earth, werre it brings to naught
The church is brent, the pressed is slain
The wife, the maid is eke forlayne
The law is lore, and god unserved
I not what mede he has deserned
That such werres ledeth inn
If that he do it for to win
First to account his great cost
Forth with the folk that he has lost
As to the worlds reckenynge
There shall he find no winning
And if be do it to purchase
The heaven, mede of such a grace
I can naught speak netheles
Christ has commanded love and pees
And who that worcheth the reuers
I trow his mede is full diverse
And sythen than that we find
That werres in her own kind
Ben toward god of no deserte
And eke they bryngen in pouerte
Of worlds good, it is marueyle
Among the men what it may eyle
That they a pees ne connen set
I trow sin be the let
And every mede of sin is death
So wot I never how it geth
But we, that be of o believe
Among our self this would I leave
That better it were pees to chese
Than so by double weye lose
I not if that it now so stand
But this a man may understand
who that these old books redeth
That couetyse is one, which ledeth
And brought the first werres inn
At Greece if that I shall begin
There was it proved how it stood
To Perse, which was full of good
They maden werre in special
And so they dydden over all
where great richesse was in land
So that they left nothing stand
Vnwerred, but only Archade.
Nota quod greci omnem terram fertilem debellabant, sed tantum Archadiam pro eo
quod pauper et sterilis fuit, pacifice dimiserunt.
For there they no werres made
Because it was bareyne and pour
whereof they might naught recover
And thus pouerte was forbore
He that naught had naught has lore
But yet it is a wonder thing
when that a rich worthy king
Or lord, what so he be
woll ask and claim property
In thing, to which he has no right
But only of his great might
For this may every man well wit
That both kind and law write
Expressly stonden there again
But he mote needs somewhat seyne
All though there be no reason inn
which secheth cause for to win
For wit, that is with will oppressed
when couetyse him has adressed
And all reasone put away
He can well find such a wey
To werre, where as ever him lyketh
whereof that he the word entriketh
That many a man of him compleyneth
But yet always some cause he feyneth
And of his wrongefull heart he demeth
That all is well, what ever him seems
Be so that he may win enough
For as the true man to the plough
Only to the gaynynge entendeth
Right so the werriour dispendeth
His time, and has no conscience
And in this point for evidence
Of hem that such werres make
Thou might a great ensample take
How they her tirrannye excusen
Of that they wrongeful werres vsen
And how they stand of one accord
The soudiour forth with the lord
The poor man forth with the rich
As of courage they ben lyche
To make werres and to pylle
For lucre: and for none other skylle
whereof a propre tale I read
As it whylom befelle in deed
Hic declar at per exemplum contra istos prin^^es seu altes quoscilque illicite
guerre motores / Et narrat de quodam pirata in partibus mari^is speliatore
notissimo / qui cum captus fuisset, et in iudicium coram rege Alexandro
productus et de latricino accusatus dixit / O Alexander vere ^uia cu^ paucis
socus spoliorum causa naues tantum e^pforo / ego latruncusus vocor. in aute^

beffatori complacnit.
Of him whom all this earth drad
when he the world so ouerladde
Through werre, as it fortuned is
King Alysaunder I read this
How in a march, where he lay
It fell perchance upon a day
A Rouer of the sea was nome
which many a man bad overcome
And slain, and take her good away
This pyller, as the books say
A famous man in sundry stead
was of the works, which he deed
This prisoner before the king
was brought: and thereupon this thing
In audience he was accused
And he his deed has naught excused
And praide the king to done him right
And said. Sire if I were of might
I have an heart lyche unto thyn
For if thy power were mine
My will is most in especial
To ryfle, and get over all
The large worlds good about
But for I lead a pour route
And am, as who says, at mischief
The name of pyllour and of these
I bear, and thou which routes great
Might lead, and take thy beyete
And doste right, as I would do
Thy name is nothing cleped so
But thou art named emperor
Our deeds ben of one color
And in effect of one deserte
But thy richesse and my pouerte
They be not taken even lyche
And netheles he that is rich
This day, to morrow he may be poorer
And in contrary also recover
A poor man to great riches
Men seyn for thy let ryghtewysenes
Be peysed even in the balaunce
The king his hardy contenaunce
Beheld: and his words wise
And said unto him in this wise
Thine answer I have understand
whereof my will is, that thou stand
In my service, and stylle abide
And forth with all the same tide
He has him term of life withholde
The more and for he should ben hold
He made him knight, and yafe him land
which afterward was of his hand
An orped knight in many a stead
And great prowess of arms deed
As the Cronykes it recorden
And in this wise they acorden
The which of condition
Be set upon destruction
Such Captain such retinue
But for to see what issue
The king befalls at the last
It is great wonder that men cast
Her heart upon such wrong to win
where no beyete may ben inn
And does dysese on every side
But when reason is put a side
And will governs the courage
The faucon which flees ramage
And suffers no thing in the weye
whereof that he may take his preye
Is not more set upon rauyne
Than thilke man, which his couyne
Has set in such a manner wise
For all the world may naught suffyse
To will, which is not reasonable
Hic secundum gefta Alexandri de guerris illicitis ponit Confessor exemplum /
dicens: quod quamuis Alexander sua potentia totius mundi victor, subingarat
imperium, ipse tandem mortis victoria subiugatus / cunctipotentis sententiam
euadere non potuit.
whereof ensampele concordable
Lyche to this point, of which I mean
was upon Alysander seen
which had set all his intent
So as fortune with him went
That reason might him not govern
But of his will he was so stern
That all the world he ouerran
And what him list he took and wan
In Inde the superyour
when that he was full conqueror
And had his wylfull purpose wo^ne
Of all this earth under the son
This king homwarde to Macedoyne
when that he came to Babyloyne
And wend most in his empire
(As he which was holle lord and sire)
In honor for to be received
Most sodenlyche he was deceyned
And with strong poison enuenymed
And as he has the world mystimed
Not as he should with his wit
Not as he would, it was acquyt
Thus was he slain, that whilo^ slough
And he, which rich was enough
This day, to morrow had naught
And in such wise as he has wrought
In disturbaunce of worlds pees
His werre he fond than endeles
In which for ever discomfyte
He was. Lo now for what proufyte
Of werre it helps for to ride
For couetyse and worlds pride
To slay the worlds men about
As bestes, which gone there out
For every life, which reason can
Ought well to know, that a man
Ne should through no tyranny
Lyche to this other bestes dye
Till kind would for him send
I not how he it might amend
which takes a weye for evermore
The life, that he may not restore
For thy my son in all weye
Be well auysed I the preye
Bf slaught, er that thou be culpable
without cause reasonable
My fader understand it is
That ye have said: but over this
I pray you tell me nay or ye
To pass over the great see
To war and sle the Sarasyn
Is that the law? Son mine
To preche, and suffer for the feyth
That have I herd, the gospel seyth
But for to sle, that here I naught
Christ with his own death has bought
All other men, and made hem fre
In token of perfyte charity
And after that he taught him selue
when he was deed these other twelve
Of his aposteles went about
The holy feyth to preche out
whereof the death in sundry place
They suffer, and so god of his grace
The feyth of Christ has made arise
But if they would in other wise
By werre have brought in the creaunce
It had yet stand in balaunce
And that may prouen in the deed
For what man the Cronyckes read
Fro first that holy church has weiued
To preche, and has the sword received
whereof the werres ben bego^ne
A great party of that was won
To Christ's feyth, stant now myswent
God do thereof amendment
So as he wot, what is the best
But son if thou wylt live in rest
Of conscience well assysed
Er that thou slay, be well auysed
For man, as tellen us the clerks
Has god above all erthely works
Ordained to be pryncypall
And eke of soul in special
He is made lyche to the godhede
So sit it well to taken head
And for to look on every side
Er that thou fall in homycyde
which sin is now so general
That it well nigh stant ouerall
In holy church, as else where
But all the while it is so there
The world mot need fare amiss
For when the well of pity is
Through couetyse of worlds good
Defoulled with shedinge of blood
The remenaunte of tolke about
Vnne the stonden in any dout
To werre each other, and to slay
So is it all not worth a stre
The charity, whereof we prechen
For we do no thing as we techen
And this the blind conscience
Of pes has lost thylke evidence
which Christ upon this earth taught
Now may men se morder and manslaught
L^che as it was by days old
when men the sins bought and sold
(...) ^^^tas venie occasione^ prebet delinque^di.
In Greece before Christ's feythe
I read as the Cronycke seyth
Touchend of this matter thus
In thylke time how Peleus
His own brother Phocus slough
But for he had gold enough
^o y^ue, his sin was dispensed
with gold, whereof it was compensed
Acastus which with Venus was
Her priest, assoylled in that cas
Al were there no repentance
And as the book makes remembrance
It tellyth of Medee also
Of that she slough her sons two
Egeus in the same plyte
Has made her of her sin quyte
The son eke of Ampbyoras
whose right name Almeus was
His mother slough Eryphele
But Achiloo the pressed and he
So as the books it recorden
For certain some of gold acorden
That thylke horable sinful deed
Assoyled was: and thus for mede
Of worlds good it falls often
That homycyde is set alofte
Here in this world, but after this
There shall be know, how that it is
Of hem that such things wyrche
And how also that holy church
Let such sins pass quyte
And how they would hem self acquyte
Of dedely werres, that they make
For who that would ensample take
The law, which is naturell
By weye of kind shows well
That homycyde in no degree
(which werreth ayene charity)
Among the men should not dwell
For after that the books tell
To seche in all the world rich
Men shall not find upon his lych
A best for to take his preye
And sythen kind has such aweye
Than is it wonder of a man
which kind has, and reason can
That he woll either more or less
His kind and reason ouerpasse
And slay that is to him semblable
So is the man not reasonable
Ne kind, and that is not honest
when he is worse than a best
Nota secundum Solinum contra homicidias de natura a cuiusdam auis faciem ad
similitudinem humanam habentis / que cum de vreda sua homine^ iuxta fluuiu^
occiderit videritque in aqua simile^ sibi occisum statim pre dolor moritur.
Among the books, which I find
Solynus speaks of a wonder kind
And says of fowls there is one
which has a face of blood and bone
Like to a man in resemblaunce
And if it fall so parchaunce
As he, which is a foul of pray
That he a man find in his way
He woll him slay, if that he may
But afterward the same day
when he has eten all his fell
And that shall be beside a well
In which he woll drink take
Of his visage and the make
That he has slain, anon he thinks
Of his misdede, and it forthynketh
So greatly, that for pure sorrow
He lives not till on the morrow
By this ensample it may well sewe
That man shall homicide eschew
For ever is mercy good to take
But if the law it has forsake
And that Justice is there again
Full ofttyme I have hard said
Among hem that werres haden
But they somwhyle her cause ladden
By mercy, when they might have slain
whereof that they were after fayn
And son, if that thou wolt record
The virtue of Misericorde
Thou syghe never thylke place
where it was used, lack grace
For every law, and every kind
The man's wit to mercy bind
And namely the worthy knights
when that they stonde^ most vprightes
And ben most mighty for to grieve
They shulden then most releue
Tym, whom they myghten overthrow
And by ensample may men know
Hic ponit Confessor exemplum de pietate contra homicidium in guerris /
habenda, Et narrat qualiter Achilles vna cum filio suo contra regem Mesee, qui
tunc Theucer vocabatur / belmolum inierunt, Et cu^ Achilles dictum rege^ in
bello prostratu^ occidere voluisset Thelaphus pietate tu^ ipsum clipeo
cooperiens veniam pro rege a patre postulauit pro quo facto, ipse rex adhuc
vinens Thephalum regni sui heredem libera vo luntate constituit.
He may not faylen of his mede
That has mercy. For this I read
In a Cronycke I find thus
when Achilles with Telaphus
His son, toward Troy were
It fell hem er they come there
Ayene Theucer the king of Mese
To make war, and for to sese
His land, as they that wolden reign
And Theucer put out of his reign
And thus the marches they assaylle
But Theucer yafe to hem bataille
They foughten on both sides fast
But so it happneth at last
This worthy greek this Achilles
The king among all other ches
As he that was cruel and fell
with swerd in hand on him he fell
And smote him with a dethes wound
That he vnhorced fell to ground
Achilles upon him alyght
And would anon, as he well might
Have slain him fulliche in the place
But Thephalus his faders grace
For him besought, and for pity
Prayth, that he would let him be
And cast his sheld between hem two
Achilles asks him why so
And Thephalus his cause told
And says, that he is mochel hold
For whylome Theucer in a stead
Great grace and socour to him deed
And says, that he him would acquyte
And praythe his fader to respyte
Achles tho withdrough his hand
But all the power of the land
wha^ that they saw her king thus take
They fled, and hathen the field forsake
The greeks unto the chaas fall
And for the most part all
Of that couutre the lords great
They took and won a great beyete
And anon after this victory
The king, which had memory
Upon the great mercy thought
which thelaphus taward him wrought
And in presence of all the land
he took him fair by the hand
And in this wise he began to seye
My son I mote by double weye
Love and desire thyn encrees
First for thy fader Achilles
whyl^^^ full many a day er this
when I should have fare amys
Rescouse did in my quarele
And kept all mine estate in hele
How so there fall now distaunce
Among us, yet remembrance
I have of mercy, which he deed
As than: and thou now in this stead
Of gentilnes, and of fraunchesse
Have do mercy the same I guess
So woll I not, that any time
Be lost, of that thou haste do hyme
For how so this fortune fall
yet stant my trust abouen all
For the mercy which I now find
That thou wylt after this be kind
And for that such is mine espeyr
And for my son and for mine heir
I the receive, and all my land
I give and sese in to thyn hand
And in this wise they accord
The cause was mysericorde
The lords do her obeysaunce
To Thelaphus, and purueaunce
was made, so that he was coroned
And thus was mercy reguerdoned
w^c^e he to Theucer did tofore
To this ensample is made therefore
That thou might take remembrance
(...), and when thou see a chance
(...) other men's passion
(...) ^^te and compassion
And let no thing to the be leef
which to another man is greef
And after this if thou desire
(...) ^^^nde a^en the vice of Ire
(...) the with patience
(...) take in to thy conscience
(...) to be thy governor
(...) ^halt thou feel no rancour
(...) thyn heart shall debate
with homicide, ne with hate
yet ^heste or melancolye
(...) ^halt be soft in company
without contecke or foolhast
For ^i^es might thou long wast
Thy time, er that thou have thy will
Of love, for the wedir stylle
Men preyse, and blame the tempests
My fader I woll do your hestes
And of this point ye have me taught
Toward my self the better saught
I th^nke be, while that I live
But for as much as I am shryue
Of wrath, and all his circumstaunce
^^ne what ye list to my penance
And ask forther of my life
if otherwise I be gyltyf
Of any thing, that touches sin
My son, er we depart a twynne
I shall behind no thing leave
My good fader by your leave
Than asks forth what so you lift
For I have in you such a tryfte
As ye that be my soul hele
That ye fro me nothing wol hele
For I shall tell you the truth
My son art thou culpable of slouthe
In any point, which to him long h^
My fader of thou points me longs
To wit pleynly, what they mean
So that I may me shriue clean.
Now herke, I shall tho points devise
And understand well mine appryse
For shryfte stant of no value
To him, that woll him naught virtue
To leave of vices the folly
For word is wynd, but the maystrye
Is, that a man him self defend
Of thing, which is not to commend
whereof ben few now a day
And netheles so as I may
Make unto thy memory know
The points of sloth, thou shall know
Explicit liber tercius.
Hic in quarto libro loquitur confessor de speciebus Accidie quarum primam
tardacionem vocat, cuius condicionem pertractans Amanti, super hoc consequenter
opponit.

Incipit liber quartus.
Dicunt accidiam fore nutricem viciorum
Torpet et in cuntis tarda que leuta bonis
Que sieri possent hodie transfert piger in cras
Furatoque prius hostia claudit equo.
Poscenti tardo negat emolumenta Cupido
Sed Venus in celeri ludit amore viti.
Upon the vices to proceed
After the cause of man's deed
The first point of sloth I call
Lachesse, and is the chief of all
And has this properly of kind
To leven all thing behyned
Of that he might do now here
He taryeth all the long year
And evermore he says, To morrow
And so he woll his time borowe
And wyssheth after, God me send
That when he weneth to have an end
Than is he forthest to begin
Thus brings he many a meschiefe in
Unware, till that he be mescheued
And may not than be releued
And right so another more ne less
It stant of love, and of lachesse
Some time he sloutheth on a day
That he never after get may
Now son as of this ilke thing
If thou have any knowlechynge
That thou to love have done er this
Tell on, My good fader yis
As of laches I am beknowe
That I may stand upon his row
As I that am cladde of his suit
For when I thought my pursuit
To make, and thereto set a day
To speak unto that sweet may
Lachesse had abide yet
And bare on hand it was no wit
Ne time, for to speak as tho
Thus with his tales to and fro
My time in taryenge he drough
when there was time good enough
He said another time is better
Thou shall now senden her a letter
And par caas write more pleyn
Than thou by mouth durstest seyn
Thus have I let time slide
For slouthe, and kept not my tide
So that laches with his vice
Full often has made my wit so nyce
That what I thought to speak or do
with taryenge he held me so
Till when I would, and might naught
I not what thing was in my thought
Or it was dread, or it was shame
But ever in ernest and in game
I wot there is long time passed
But yet is not the love lassed
which I unto my lady have
For though my tongue is slow to crave
At all time, as I have bid
Mine heart stant ever in o stead
And asks besylyche grace
The which I may not yet embrace
And god wot that is maulgre mine
For this I wot right well afyn
My grace comes so selde about
That is the slouthe, which I doubt
More than of all the remenaunte
which is to love appartenaunte
And thus as touchende of lachesse
As I have told, I me confess
To you my fader, I beseech
That ferthermore ye wol me teache
And if there be to my mattere
Some goodly tale for to here
How I may do lachesse awey
That ye it would tell, I prey
To wysse the my son and read
Among the tales, which I red
An old ensample thereupon
Now harken, and I wol tell on
Hic ponit Confessor exemplum contra istos qui in amoris causa tardantes
delinquunt. Et narrat qualiter Dido regina Cartaginis Ened. ab incendus Troie
fugitinum in amorem fuum gauisa suscepit / qui cum postea in parts Italy a
Cartagine bellaturum se transtulit, nimiam que ibidem moram faciens / tempus
redditus sui ad Didone^ vltra modu^ tardauit / ipsa intolle^abili dolor
co^cussa sui cordis intima gladio tra^sfodit.
A^ayne lachessein loves caas
I find, how whylome Eneas
Home Anchyses to son had
with great nauye, which he ladde
Fro Troy, arryueth at Cartage
wherefore a while his herbergage
He took, and it betid so
with her, which was a queen tho
Of the Cite, his acqueintaunce
He wan, whose name in remembrance
Is yet, and Dido she was hot
which loves Eneas so hot
Upon the words, which he said
That all her heart on him she laid
And did all holy, what he would
But after that, as it be should
Fro thens he goth toward Itayle
By ship, and there his arryuayle
Has take, and shope him for to ride
But she, which may not long abide
The hot pain of loves throw
Anon within alytel throw
A letter unto her knight has write
And did him pleinly for to wit
If he made any taryinge
To dretche of his again coming
That she ne might him feel and se
She should stand in such degree
As whylome stood a swan to fore
Of that she had her make lore
For sorrow a fether in to her brain
She sh^of, and has her self slain
As king Menander in a lay
The soth has fond, where she lay
Spraulend with her wings twey
As she which should than deye
For love of him, which was her make.
And so shall I do for thy sake
Th^^ ^nene said, well I wot
Lo to Ence thus she wrote
with many a another word of compleynt
But he which had his thoughts feynt
Toward love, and full of sloth
His time let, and that was routhe
For she, which loves him to fore
Desires ever more and more
And when she saw him tarry so
Her heart was so full of woe
That compleynend manyfolde
She has her own tale told
Unto her self, and thus she spoke
A who fond ever such a lack
Of sloth in any worthy knight?
Now wot I well my death is dyght
Through him, which should have be my life
But for to stynten all this strife
Thus when she syghe none other bote
Right even unto her heart rote
A naked swerd anon she threfte
And thus she gat her self rest
In remembrance of all slow
whereof my son thou might know
How tarynge upon the need
In loves cause, is for to dread
And that has Dido sore abought
whose death shall ever be bethought
And evermore if I shall seche
In this matter another speech
In a Cronycke I find write
A tale, which is good to wit.
Hic loquitur super eodem, qualiter Penolope Vlixem maritum suum in obsidione
Troie diucius morantem ob ipsius ibidem tardacionem epistola sua redarguit.
At Troy when king Vlyxes
Upon the sege among the pres
Of hem, that worthy knights were
Abode long time stylle there
In thylke time a man may se
How goodly that Penelope
which was to him his true wife
Of his lachesse was pleyntyfe
whereof to Troy she him send
Her will by letter, thus spekende:
My worthy love, and lord also
It is and has be ever so
That where a woman is alone
It makes a man in his person
The more hardy for to wowe
In hope that she would bow
To such thing, as his will were
while that her lord were else where
And of my self I tell this
For it so long passed is
Sith first that ye from home went
That well nygh every man is went
To there I am, while ye be out
Had made and each of hem about
which love can, my love secheth
with great prayer, and me besecheth
And some maken great manace
That if they might come in place
where that they might her will have
There is no thing me should save
That they ne would worch things
And some tell me tidings
That ye ben deed: and some seyne
That certainly ye ben beseyne
To love a new, and leave me
But how as ever that it be
I thonke unto the gods all
As yet for ought, that is befall
May no man do my chekes read
But netheles it is to dread
That lachesse in contynuaunce
Fortune might such a chance
which no man after should amend
'Lo thus this lady compleynende
A letter unto her lord has write
And prayde him, that he would wit
And think, how that she was al his
And that he tarry not in this
But that he would his love acquyte
To her ayenewarde, and not write
But come him self in all haste
That he none other paper waste
So that he keep, and hold his troth
without let of any slouthe
Unto her lord and love liege
To Troy where the great siege
was leyde, this letter was conueyde
And he which wisdom has purueid
Of all that to reason belongs
with gentle heart it vnderfongeth
And when he has it over rad
In part, he was right inly glad
And eke in part he was disesed
But love his heart has so through sesed
with pure imaginacyon
That for for none occupacyon
which began take on other side
He may not flytte his heart aside
For that his wife him had informed
whereof he has him self conformed
with all the will of his courage
To shape and take the viage
Homewarde, what time that he may
So that him thinks of a day
A thousand year till he may se
The visage of Penelope
which he desires most of all
And when the time is so befall
That Troy was distroyed, and brent
He made no delayment
But goth him home in all hye
where that he fond tofore his eye
His worthy wife in good estate
And thus was sesed the debate
Of love, and sloth was excused
which does great harm, where it is used
And hinders many a cause honest.
Nota ad huc de quodam Astrologo super eodem, qui quoddam opus ingeniosum quasi
ad complementum septennios perducens vnius momenti tardacione omni sui operis
diligentiam penitus frustrauit.
For of the great clerk Grostest
I read how busy that he was
Upon the clergy an heed of bras
To forge and make it for to tell
Of such things as befelle
And seven years business
He laid, but for the lachesse
Of half a mynute of an hour
Fro first he began labor
He lost all that he had do
And other while it fares so
In loves cause, who is slow
That he without under the wowe
By night stant full often a cold
which might, if that he had would
His time kept, have be within.
Nota ad huc contra taidationem de virginibus fatuis, que nimiam moram
facientes intra^te sponso ad nupcias / cum ipso non introierunt.
But sloth may not profyt win
But he may sing in his Carole
How late ware came to the dole
where he no good receive might
And that was proved well by night
(...) of the maidens five
(...) ^^ylke lord came for to wyue
(...) that her oil was aweye
To light him lamps in his wey
Her sloth brought it so about
Fro him that they be shette without
whereof my son be thou ware
Als ferforth as I tell dare
For slouthe must ben awayted
And if thou be not well affayted
In love, to eschew flouthe
My some for to tell truth
Thou might not of thy self ben able
To win love, or make it stable
All though thou myghtest love acheue
My father that I may well leave
But me was never assygned place
where yet to get any grace
Ne me was no such time appointed
For than I would I were unjointed
Of every lymme that I have
And I ne should keep and save
Mine hour both, and eke my stead
If my lady it had bid
But she is otherwise auysed
Than grant such a time assised
And nethelesse of my lachesse
There b^th by no defaulte I guess
Of time lost, in that I might
But yet her lyketh not alyght
Upon no lure, which I cast
For ^y the more I cry fast
The less her lyketh for to here
So for to speak of this matere
I seche, that I may not find
I haste, and ever I am behind
And wot not, what it may amount
But father upon mine account
which ye ben set to examyne
Of ^hayfte after the discipline
Say what your best counsel is.
My son my counseyle is this
How so it stand of time ago
Do forth thy besynes so
That no lachesse in the be found
For slouthe is mighty to confound
The speed of every man's work
For many a vice, as says the clerk
There hongen upon slouthes lap
Of such as make a man myshappe
To pleyne and tell of Had I wist
And thereupon if that the list
To know of slouthes cause more
In special yet ouermore
There is a vicefull greuable
To him, which is thereof culpable
And stant of all virtues bare
Here after as I shall declare
Qui nihil attemptat, nihil expedit, oreque mut^
Munus amicitie ^ur sibi raro capit
Est modus in uerbis, sed ei qui parcit amori
Verba refer sua nouifauet ullus amor.
Hic loquitur Confessor de quadam specie Accidie / que pusillanimitas dicta est
/ cuius imaginatiua formido neque virtutes aggredi, neque vicia fugere audet /
sicque vtriusque vite tam active quam contemplative premium non attingit.
Touchende of sloth in his degree
There is yet pusillanimite
which is to say in this langage
He that has little of courage
And dare no man's work begin
So may he naught by reason win
For who that naught dare undertake
By right he shall no profyt take
But of this vice the nature
Dare nothing set in adventure
Him lacks both word and deed
whereof he should his cause speed
He woll no manhood understand
For ever he has dread upon hand
All is peril, that he shall say
Him thinks the wolf is in the way
And of imaginacion
He makes his excusacion
And feyneth cause of pure dread
And ever he fails at need
Till all be spylte, that he with deals
He has the sore, which no man heleth
The which is cleped Lack of heart
Though every grace about him sterte
He woll not ones stere his foot
So that by reason lose he mote
That woll not aunter for to win
And so forth son, if we begin
To speak of love and his service
There ben truantes in such a wise
That lacken heart, when best were
They speken of love, and right for fear
They waxen dombe, and dare not tell
without sown, as does the belle
which has no clapper for to chyme
And right so they, as for the time
Ben herteles without speech
Of love, and dare nothing eseche
And thus they lose, and win naught
For thy my son if thou art ought
Culpable, as touchende of this slouthe
Shryue the thereof, and tell me troth.
My father I am all beknowe
That I have been one of the slow
As for to tell in loves cas
Mine heart is yet, and ever was
Although the world should al to break
So fearful, that I dare not speak
Of what purpose that I have nome
when I toward my lady come
But let it pass and over go
My son do no more so
For after that a man pursues
To love so fortune seweth
Full often, and yeueth her happy chance
To him, which makes continuance
To preye love, and to beseech
As by ensample I shall the teache.
Hic in amoris causa loquitur contra pusilla nimes, Et dicit / quod amans, pro
timore verbis obtumescere non debet, sed concinnando preces sui amoris
expeditionem tutius prosequatur / Et ponit Confessor exemplum, qualiter
Pigmalion pro eo quod preces continuauit, quandam imaginem eburneam, cuius
pulchritudinis concupiscentia illaqueatus extitit, in carnem et sanguinem ad
latus suum tranformatam sentiit.
I find, how whilom there was one
whose name mas Pigmalyone
which was a lusty man of youth
The works of entayle he couthe
Above all other men as tho
And through fortune it fell him so
As he, whom love shall travail
He made an image of entayle
Lyche to a woman in semblaunce
Of feature, and of countenance
So fair yet never was figure
Right as a lives creature
She seems, for of yuor white
He has it wrought of such delight
She was rody on the cheke
And read on her lyppes eke
whereof that he him self begyleth
For with a goodly look she smyleth
So that through pure impression
Of his imagination
with all the heart of his courage
His love upon this fair image
He set: and her of love preyde
But she no word ayenewarde said
The long day what thing he deed
This image in the same stead
was ever by, that at meat
He would her serve, and prayde her eat
And put unto her mouth the cup
And when the board was taken up
He has her unto his chaumbre nome
And after when the night was come
He leyde her in bed all naked
He was forwepte, he was forwaked
He kyste her cold lyppes often
And wyssheth, that they were soft
And often he rowneth in her ear
And often his arm now here now there
He laid, as he her would enbrace
And ever among he asks grace
As though she wist what it meant
And thus him self he began tourment
with such disease of loves pain
That no man might him more pain
But how it were of his penance
He made such countenance
Fro day to night, and prayde so long
That his prayer is vnderfonge
which Venus of her grace herd
By night, and when that he werst ferde
And it lay naked in his arm
The cold image he felt warm
Of flesh and bone, and full of life
Lo thus he wanne a lusty wife
which obeisaunt was at his will
And if he would have hold him stylle
And nothing spoke, he should have failed
But for he has his word trauayled
And durst speak, his love he spedde
And bad all that he would abedde
For er they went than a two
A knave child between hem two
They gate, which was after hot
Paphus, of whom yet has the note
A certain i will, which Paphos
Men clepe, and of his name it rose
By thts ensample thou might find
That word may worche above kind
For thy my son if that thou spare
To speak, lost is all thy fare
For slouthe brings in all woe
And over this to look also
The god of love is favorable
To hem, that been of love stable
And many a wondre has befall
whereof to speak among all
If that ye list to taken head
Thereof a solemn tale I read
which I shall tell in remembrance
Upon the sort of loves chance
(...) Hic venit exemplum super eodem qualiter (...) L^gdus vxori sue Thelacuse
pregnanti mina^atur ^q^si filiam pareret / infans occideretur. ou^ tamen postea
cum filiam ediderat, Isis dea part^s tunc presens filia^ nomine Iphi appellari
(...) more masculi educare admonuit, quam (...) filium credens / ipsam in
maritagium filie (...) principis etate solita copulanit / Sed cu^ (...) debitum
sui comugu, vnde foluere non ha^ (...) in sui aduitorium interpellebat, qui su^
(...) miserti femineum genus in masculinum (...) nature in Iphe per ^ia
transmutarili.
THe king Lygdus upon a strife
Spoke unto Thelacuse his wife
which tha^ was with child great
He swore it should naught be let
That if she have a daughter bore
That it ne should be forlore
And slain, whereof she sorry was
So it befelle upon this cas
when she delivered should be
I^^s by night in pryuete
^ which of childynge is the goddess)
Came for to help in that distress
Till that this lady was all small
And had a daughter forth with all
which the goddess in all weye
Bad keep, and that they should seye
It were a son: and thus Iphis
They named him, and upon this
The father was made for to wene
And thus in chamber with the queen
This Iphis was forth draw tho
And clothed, and arrayed so
Right kings as a son should
Till after, as fortune it would
when it was of a ten year age
Him was betake in marriage
A dukes daughter for to wedde
which Iaunte hight, and often a bed
These children lay, she and he
which of one age both be
So that within time of years
Together, as they ben play feres
Lyggende abedde upon a night
Nature, which does every wight
Upon her law for to muse
Constreyneth hem, so that they use
Thing, which to hem was all unknow
whereof Cupyde thylke throw
Took pite for the great love
And let do set kind above
So that her law may ben used
And they upon her lust excused
For love hates nothing more
Than thing, which stant against the lore
Of that nature in kind has set
For thy Cupyde has so besette
Her grace upon this adventure
That be accordant to nature
when that he sygh his time best
That each of hem has other kest
Transformeth Iphe into a man
whereof the kind love he wan
Of lusty yongth, Iante his wife
And tho they led a merry life
which was to kind none offense
And thus to take an evidence
It seems love is welwyllende
To hem, that been contynuende
with besy heart to pursue
Thing, which that is to love due
whereof my son in this matere
Thou might ensample taken here
That with thy great business
Thou might atteyne the richesse
Of love, that there be no sloth
I dare well say by my troth
Als far as my wit can seche
My father, as for lack of speech
But so as I me shrofe tofore
There is none other time lore
whereof there might be obstacle
To let love of his miracle
which I beseech day and night
But father so as it is right
In form of shryfte to be know
what thing belongs to the slow
your fatherhode I woll preye
If there be forther any weye
Touchende unto this ilke vice
My son ye, of this office
There serves one in special
which lost has his memorial
So that he can no wit witholde
In thing, which he to keep his hold
whereof fulle often him self he greueth
And who that most upon him leueth
when that his wits ben so weyued
He may full lightly be deceived.
Mentibus oblitus alienis labitur ille,
Quem probat accidia non meminisse sui.
Sic amor incautus, qui uo^ memoratur ad horas
Perdit, et offendit, quod cuperare nequit.
Hic tractat Confessor de vitio obliuionis / qua^ matter eius Accidia ad omnes
virtutum memorias, necnon et in amoris causa immemorem se constituit.
To serve Accidie in his office
There is of sloth an other vice
which is cleped Foryettylnes
That naught may in his heart impresse
Of virtue, which reason has set
So clean his wits be foryete
For in telling of his tale
No more his heart than his male
Has remembrance of thylke form
whereof he should his wit enfourme
As than, and yet ne wot why
Thus is his purpose naught for thy
Forlore, of that he would abide
And scarsely if he sees the thridde
To love of that he had meant
Thus many a lover has be shent
Tell on further, have thou ben one
Of hem, that has sloth begone?
ye father often it has been so
That when I am my lady fro
And think untoward her draw
Than cast I many a new law
And all the world turn up so down
And so record I my lesson
And write in my memorial
what I to her tell shall
Right all the matter of my tale
But all nis worth a nutte shale
For when I come there she is
I have it all foryete iwis
Of that I thought for to tell
I can not than uneaths spelle
That I wend alther best have read
So sore of her I am adredde
For as a man that suddenly
A ghost beholds so fare I
So that for fear I can naught get
My wit: but I my self foryete
That I wot never, what I am
Ne whither I shall, ne when I came
But mufe, as be that were amassed
Lyche to the book, in which is rased
The letter, and may nothing be radde
So ben my wits ouerladde
That what as ever I thought have spoken
It is out of mine heart stoken
And sto^de, as who says, dombe and deefe
That all nys worth an iuye lefe
Of that I wend well have said
And at last I make abrayde
Last up mine heed, and look about
Right as a man, that were in doubt
And wot not, where he shall become
Thus am I often all overcome
There as I wend best to stand
But after when I understand
And am in other place alone
I make many a woeful moan
Unto my self, and speak so
A fool, where was thine heart tho
when thou thy worthy lady sye
were thou afered of her eye?
For of her bond there is no dread
So well I know her woman head
That in her is no more oultrage
Than in a child of three year age
why have thou dread of so good one
whom all virtue has begone
That in her is no violence
But goodlyhede, and innocence
without spotte of any blame
A nyce heart, fie for shame
A cowarde heart of love vnlered
whereof art thou so sore afered?
That thou thy tongue suffrest frese
And wolte thy good words lose
when thou have fond time and space
How sholdest thou deserve grace?
when thou thy self dare ask none
But all thou have foryete anon
And thus dispute in loves lore
But help ne find I naught the more
But stomble upon mine own treyne
And make an ekynge of my pain
For ever when I think among
How all is on my self alonge
I say, O fool of all fools
Thou farest as he between two stoles
That would sytte, and goth to ground
It was, ne never shall be found
Between Foryettylnes and Dread
That man should any cause speed
And thus mine holy father dear
Toward my self, as ye may here
I pleyne of my foryettylnes
But else all the business
That may be take of man's thought
My heart takes and is through sought
To thynken ever upon that sweet
without^n slouthe I you byhete
For what so fall or well or woe
That thought foryete I neuermo
w^^^e so I laugh, or so I loure
Not half a mynute of an hour
Ne might I let out of my mind
But if I thought upon that hende
Thereof me shall no sloth let
Till death out of this world me fette
All though I had on such a ring
As Moses, through his enchauntyng
Sometime in Ethyope made
when that he Tharbys wedded had
which ring bare of oblivion
The name, and that was by reason
That where on a finger it sat
Anon his love he so foryate
As though he had it never know
And so it fell that ilke throw
when Tharbis had it on her hand
No knowlegynge of him she fond
But all was clean out of memory
As men may read in his storye
And thus he went quyte away
That never after thylke day
She thought, that there was such one
All was foryete, and ouergone
But in good feyth so may not I
For she is ever fast by
So nigh, that she mine heart touches
That for no thing that sloth voucheth
I may foryete her lefe ne loath
For over all where as she goth
Mine heart follows her about
Thus may I say withouten doubt
For bet, for wers, for ought, for naught
She passes never fro my thought
But when I am there, as she is
Mine heart, as I you said er this
Sometime of her is sore adradde
And sometime is ouergladde
All out of reule, and out of space
For when I se her goodly face
And think upon her high prys
As though I were in Paradys
I am so rauysshed of the sight
That speak unto her I ne might
As for the time, though I would
For I ne may my wit unfold
To find o word of that I mean
But it is all foryete clean
And though I stand there a mile
All is foryete for the while
A tongue I have / and words none
And thus I stand, and think alone
Of thing, that helps often naught
But what I had before thought.
To speak, when I come there
It is foryete, as naught ne were
And stand amassed, and assoted
That of no thing, which I have noted
I can not than a note sing
But all is out of knowlegynge
Thus what for joy, and what for dread
All is foryeten at need
So that my father of this sloth
I have you said the plain troth
ye may it, as ye list, redress
For thus stant my foryetylnesse
And eke my pusyllanymite
Say now forth, what ye list, to me
For I wol only do by you
My son I have well herd, how thou
Have said, and that thou must amend
For love his grace wol not send
To that man, which dare ask none
For this we known euerychone
A man's thought without speech
God wot, and yet that men beseech
His will is: for without bedis
He does his grace in few stedis
And what man that foyete him selue
Among a thousand be not twelve
That wol him take in remembrance
But let him fall, and take his chance
For thy pull up a besy heart
My son, and let no thing asterte
Of love fro thy business
For touching of foryetylnesse
which many a love has set behind
A tale of great ensample I find
whereof it is pity to wit
In the manner as it is write.
Hic in amoris causa contra obliuiosos ponit Confessor exemplum, qualiter
Demophon versus bellum Troianum itinerando a Philli de Rodipea regina non
tantum in hospicium / sed etlam in amorem gaudio magno susceptus eft, qui
postea ab ipsa Troie descendens rediturum infra certum tempus fidelissime se
compromisit sed quia huiusmodi promissiones diem statutum post modum oblitus
est, Phillis obliuionem Demephontis lacrimis primo deplangens / tandem cordula
collo suo cerculigata se mortua^ suspedit.
King Demopho^ wha^ he by ship
To troy ward with felauship
Seylend goth upon his weye
It happens him at Rodepeye
As Eolus him had blow
To land, and rested for a throw
And fell that ylke time thus
That the daughter of Lycurgus
which queen was of the country
was soiourned in that Cite
within a castle nygh the stronde
where Demophon came up to land
Phylles she hight, and of young age
And of stature, and of vysage
She had all that her best besemeth
Of Demopho^ right well her quemeth
wha^ he was come, and made him chere
And he that was of his manner
A lusty knight, ne might asterte
That he ne set on her his heart
So that within a day or two
He thought, how ever that it go
He would assaye the fortune
And began to comune
with goodly words in her ere
And for to put her out of fere
He swore, and has his troth plyght
To be for ever her own knight
And thus with her he stylle abode
There, while his ship on anchor rood
And had enough of time and space
To speak of love, and seek grace
This lady herd all that he said
How he swore, and how he prayde
which was and an enchauntement
To her, that was as an Innocent
As though it were truth and feyth
She leueth all, that ever he feyth
And as her fortune should
She grants him, all that he would
Thus was he for the time in joy
Till that he should go to Troy
But tho she made mochel sorrow
And he his troth leyd to borowe
To come, and if that he live may
Again, within a month day
And thereupon they kysten both
But were him leef or were him loath
To ship he goth, and forth he went
To Troy, as was his first intent
The days go the month passes
Her love encreseth, and his lassethe
For him she lost sleep and mete
And he his time has all foryete
So that this woeful young queen
which wore not what it might mean
A letter sent, pnd prayed him come
And says how she is overcome
with strength of love, in such a wise
That she not long may suffyse
To lyuen out of his presence
And put upon his conscience
The truth, which he has behote
whereof she loves him so hot
She says, that if he longer let
Of such a day, as she him set
She should steruen in his slouthe
which ware a shame unto his troth
This letter is forth upon her sonde
whereof somdele comfort on hand
She took, as she that would abide
And wayteth upon that ylke tide
which she has in her letter write
But now is pity for to wit
As he did erst, so he forgate
His time estsone, and over sat
But she, which might not do so
The tide owayteth euermo
And cast her eye upon the sea
Sometime nay, sometime ye
Sometime he came, sometime naught
Thus she disputes in her thought
And wot not, what she think may
But fastend all the long day
She was, in to the derke night
And tho she has do set up light
In a lantern on high alofte
Upon a toure, where she goth often
In hope, that in his coming
He should se the light brennynge
whereof he might his weyes right
To come, where she was by night
But all for naught, she was deceived
For Venus has her hope weyued
And showed her upon the sky
How that the day was fast by
So that within a little throw
The days light she might know
The she beheld the sea at large
And when she sygh there was no barge
He ship, als fer as she may kenne
D^^ne fro the tour she began to run
In to an herber all her own
where many a wonder woeful moan
She made, that no life it wist
As she, which all her joy mist
That now she swouneth, now she pleyneth
And all her face she dysteyneth
with teres, which as of a well
The stremes from her eyes fell
So as she might and ever in one
She cleped upon Demephoon
And said: Allas thou slow wight
There was never such a knight
That so through his vngentilnesse
Of slouthe and of foryetylnesse
Against his truth breketh his steven
And tho her eye up to the heaven
She cast, and said: O thou unkind
Here shall thou through thy sloth find
(If that the list to come and see)
A lady deed for love of the
So as I shall my selue-spylle
whom, if it had be thy will
Thou myghtest save well enough
with that upon a grene bough
A saint of sylke, which she there had
She knyt: and so her self she lad
That she about her white swear
Hit did, and henge her self there
whereof the gods were amoued
And Demephon was reproved
That of the gods prouydence
was shape such an evidence
Ever afterward ayene the slow
That Phyllis in the same throw
was shape in to a nute tree
That all men it might se
And after Phyllis Phylberd
This tree was cleped in the yerd
And yet for Demophon to shame
In to this day it bears the name
This woeful chance how that it ferde
Anon as Demephon it herd
And every man it had in speech
His sorrow was not tho to seche
He began his slouthe for to banne
But it was all to late thanne
Lo thus my son might thou wit
Ayene this vice how it is write
For no man may the harms guess
That fallen through foryetylnesse
whereof that I thy shryft have herd
But yet of slouthe how it has ferd
In other wise I think oppose
If thou have gylt, as I suppose
Dum plantare licet, cultor qui negligit ortum
Si desint fructus, imputat ipse sibi.
Preterit ista dies bona, nec valebit illa secunda.
Hoc caret exemplo lentus amore suo.
Her tractat Confessor de viciis negligen cie, cuius condicio Accidiam
amplectens omnes aries sciencia tom in amoris causa que aliter ignominiosa
pretermittens, cum nullum poterit eminete remedium sui ministerii diligenciam
ex post facto in vacuum attemptare presumit.
Fulfilled of slouthes exemplair
There is yet one his secretayr
And he is cleped Negligence
which woll not look his euydence
whereof he may beware tofore
But when he has his cause lore
Than is he wise after the hand
when help may no manner bond
Than at first would he bind
Thus evermore he stant behind
when he the thing may not amend
Than is he ware, and says at end
A would god I had know
whereof beiaped with a mow
He goth, for when the great stead
Is stole, than he takes bid
And makes the stable door fast
Thus ever he pleyth an after cast
Of all that he shall say or do
He has a manner eke also
Him list not learn to be wise
For he set of no virtue pryse
But as him lyketh for the while
So feleth he fulofte gyle
when that he weneth seker to stand
And thus thou might well understand
My son, if thou art such in love
Thou might not come at thyn above
Of that thou would well acheue.
Mine holy fader as I leave
I may well with sauf conscience
Excuse me of negligence
Toward love in all wise
For though I be none of the wise
I am so truly amorous
That I am ever curyous
Of hem, that can best inform
To known and wyten all the form
what falls unto loves craft
But yet ne fond I naught the have
which might unto the blade acorde
For never herd I man record
what thing it is, that might avail
To win love, without fail
yet so fer couthe I never find
Man, that by reason ne by kind
Me couthe teache such an art
That he ne failed of a part
And as toward mine own wit
Contryue I couthe never yet
To find any sikernesse
That me might other more or less
Of love make for to speed
For leueth well withouten dread
That if there were such aweye
As certainly as I shall deye
I had it learned long a go
But I wot well there is none so
And netheles it may well be
I am so rude in my degree
And eke my wits ben so dull
That I ne may naught to the full
Attain unto so high a lore
But this I dar sey ouermore
All though my wit ne be not strong
It is not on my will alonge
For that is besy night and day
To learn all that he learn may
How that I might love win
But yet I am as to begin
Of that I would make an end
And for I not, how it shall wend
That is to me my most sorrow
But I dare take god to borowe
As after mine entendement
None other wise neglygent
Than I you say, have I not be
For thy pur saint charity
Tell me my fader, what you seems
In good feith son well me quemeth
That thou thy selue have thus acquyte
Toward this, in which no wight
Abide may for in an hour
He lest all that he may labor
The long year: so that men seyne
what ever he does, it is in vein
For through the sloth of negligence
There was yet never such science
Ne virtue which was bodily
That nys destroyed, and lost thereby
Ensample, that it has be so
In book I find write also.
Hic contra vicium negligencie ponit Confessor exemplum. Et narrat / quod cum
Phaeton filius Solis currum patris sui per era regere deliuerat, admo nitus a
patre, vt equos ne deui^rent equa manu diligencius refrenaret, ipse con filium
patris sua negligencia pretiriens, equos cum curru nimis basse errare permisit
/ vnde non solum incendio orbem inflammauit, sed et ipsum de cu^^u cadentem in
quoddam fluuium demergi a^ interitum causauit.
Phoebus, which is the son hot
That shyneth upon earth hot
And causes every lives health
He had a son in all his wealth
which Phaeton hight: and he desires
And with his mother he conspyreth
The which was cleped Clemene
For help and counsayl, so that he
His faders cart led might
Upon the fair days light
And for this thing they both prayde
Unto the fader: And he said
He would well, but forth with all
Three points he had in special
Unto his son in all wise
That he him should well auyse
And take it as by weye of lore
(...) first was, that he his horse to sore
T^^pryke: And over that he told
^^at he the reins fast hold
And also that he be right ware
In what manner he ledeth his chare
That he mistake not his gate
But upon au^sement algat
He should bear a syker eye
That he to low, ne to hye
His cart drive, at any throw
whereof that he might overthrow
And thus by Phoebus ordinance
Took Phaeton in to governance
The Sons cart, which he ladde
But he such vayn glory had
Of that he was set upon high
That he his own estate ne sygh
Through negligence, and took none head
So might he well not long speed
For he the horse withouten law
The cart let about draw
where as him lyketh, wantonly
That at the last suddenly
For he no reason would know
This fyry cart he drove to low
And fyreth all the world about
whereof they weren all in doubt
And to the god for help cryden
Of such vnhappes, as betyden
Phoebus which saw the negligence
How Phaeton ayene his defense
His chare has drive out of the weye
Ordeyneth, that he fell aweye
Out of the cart in to the flood
And dreint: lo now how it stood
with him, that was so negligent
That fro the high fyrmament
For that he would go to low
He was anon down overthrow
In high estate it is a vice
To go to low, and in service
It greueth, for to go to hye
whereof a tale in Poesye
Exemplum super eodem de Icharo filio Dedali in carcere Minotauri existente,
cui Dedalus, vt inde euolaret alas componens firmiter iniunxit, ne nimis alte
propter solus ardorem ascenderet, quod Icharus sua negligencia post ponens cum
altius sublimatus fuisset subito ad terram corruens expirauit.
I find, how whylom Dedalus
which had a son, and Icharus
He hight, and though him thought loath
In such prison they were both
with mynotaurns, that about
They myghten no where wenden out
So they bygonnen for to shape
How they the prison might escape
This Dedalus, which fro his youth
was taught, and many crafts couthe
Of feathers, and of other things
Has made to flee diverse wings
For him, and for his son also
To whom he yafe in charge tho
And had him think thereupon
How that his wings ben set on
with wax: and if he took his flight
To high, all sodenlyche he might
Make it to melt with the son
And thus they have her flight begone
Out of the prison fair and soft
And when they weren both alofte
This Icharus began to mount
And of the counseyll none acompte
He set, which his fader taught
Till that the son his wings caught
whereof it melt, and from the hight
withoutten help of any flight
He fell to his destruction
And liche to that condition
There fallen oftimes feel
For lack of governance in well
Als well love as other weye.
Now good fader I you preye
If there be more in this mattere
Of sloth, that I might here
My son as for thy dylygence
which every man's conscience
By reason should reule and keep
If that the list to take keep
I wol the tellen abouen all
In whom no virtue may befall
which yeueth unto the vices rest
And is of slouthe the slowest.
Absque labor vagus vir inurilis ocia plectens
Nescio quid presens vita valebit ei.
Non amor in ta^ misero viget, imo valoris
Qui faciunt opera clamat habere suos.
Hic loquitur Confessor super illa specie accidie, que Ocium dicitur / cuius
condicio in virtutum cultura nullius occupacionis diligenciam admitte^s /
cuiuscu^que expedicione^ cause no^ attigit.
Among these other of slouthes kind
which al labor set be hind
And hates all besynes
There is yet one, which ydelnes
Is cleped: and is the noryce
In man's kind of every vice
which secheth cases many fold
In winter does he naught for cold
In somer may be naught for hete
So wether that he trese or sweet
Or be he in, or be he out
He woll ben ydel all about
But if he pley ought at dies
For who as ever take fees
And thinks worship to deserve
There is no lord whom he woll serve
As for to dwell in his service
But if it were in such a wise
Of that he sees parauenture
That by lordship and by couerture
He may the more stand stylle
And use his Idelnesse at will
For he ne woll no trauaylle take
To ride for his ladis sake
But lives all upon his wysshes
And as a catte would ete fysshes
without wetynge of his clees
So would he do, but netheles
He fails often of that he would
My son if thou of such a molde
Art made, now tell me pleine thy shrift
Nay fader god I give a yift
That toward love, as by wit
All ydel was I never yette
Ne never shall, while I may go
Now son tell me than so
what have thou done of besyshyp
To love, and to the ladyship
Of her, which thy lady is?
My fader ever yet er this
In every place, in every stead
what so my lady has me head
with all mine heart obedyent
I have there to be dylygent
And if so is that she bid naught
what thing that than in to my thought
Comes first, of that I may suffyse
I bow, and profer my service
Sometime in chamber, sometime in hall
Right so as I se the times fall
And when she goth to here mass
That time shall naught ouerpasse
That I ne approach her lady head
In aunter if I may her led
Unto the chapel and again
Than is not all my wey in vain
Somdele I may the better fare
when I, that may not feel her bare
May led her clothed in mine arm
But after ward it does me harm
Of pure imagination
For than this collation
I make unto my seluen often
And say: O lord how she is soft
How she is round, how she is small
Now would god, I had her all
without danger at my will
And than I syke, and sytte stylle
Of that I se my besy thought
Is turned Idel in to naught
But for all that let I ne may
when I se time a another day
That I ne do my besynes
Unto my ladies worthynes
For I thereto my wit affayte
To se the times and awayte
what is to done, and what to leave
And so when time is, by her leave
what thing she byt me don, I do
And where she byt me gone, I go
And when her list to clepe, I come
Thus has she fullyche overcome
Mine ydelnesse till I sterue
So that I mot her needs serve
For as men seyn, need has no law
Thus mot I nedely to her draw
I serve, I bow, I look, I lowte
Mine eye follows her about
what so she woll, so woll I
when she woll sit, I knele by
And when she stout, than woll I stand
And wha^ she takes her werk on hand
Of weuynge, or of embrouderye
Than can I not but muse and prye
Upon her fyngers long and small
And now I think, and now I tale
And now I sing, and now I syke
And thus my contenaunce I pyke
And if it fall, as for a time
Her lyketh naught abide byme
But busy en her on other things
Than make I other taryenges
To drive forth the long day
For me is loath depart away
And than I am so simple of port
That for to feyn some disporte
I play with her little hounde
Now on the bed, now on the ground
Now with the birds in the cage
For there is none so little page
Ne yet so simple a chamberere
That I ne make hem all chere
And all for they should speak well
Thus mow ye se my besy whel
That goth not ydelyche about
And if her list to ryden out
On pylgremage, or other stead
I come, though I be not bid
And take her in mine arm alofte
And set her in her sadel soft
And so forth led her by the brydel
For that I would not ben ydel
And if her list to ride in chare
And that I may thereof beware
Anon I shape me to ride
Right even by the chares side
And as I may, I speak among
And other while I sing a song
which Ouyde in his bokees made
And said: O what sorrows glad
O which wolull prosperity
Belongs to the propirte
Of love? who so wol him serve
And there fro may no man swerue
That he ne mote his law obey
And thus I ride forth my weye
And am right besy ouerall
with heart, and with my body all
As I have said you here tofore
My good fader tell therefore
Of ydelnes if I have gylt
My son but thou tell wylt
Ought else, than I may now here
Thou shall have no penance here
And netheles a man may se
How now a days that there be
Full many of such hertes slow
That woll not besyen hem to know
what thing love is: till at last
That he with strength hem ouercast
That maulgre hem they mote obey
And done all ydelshyp awey
To serve well and besyliche
But son thou art none of syche
For love shall the well excuse
But otherwise if thou refuse
To love thou might so par caas
Ben ydel, as sometime was
A kings daughter unadvised
Till that Cupyde her has chastysed
whereof thou shall a tale here
Accordaunt unto this matere
Hic ponit Confessor exemplum contra istos, qui amoris occupationem omittentes
/ grauioris infortunii casus expectant / Et narrat de quada^ Armenie regis
filia, que huiusmodi conditionis in principio inuentutis ocio sapersiftens /
mirabili postea visione castigata in amoris obsequium pre ceteris efficitur.
Of Armenye I read thus
There was a king, which Herupus
was hot: and he a lusty maid
To daughter had, and as men said
Her name was Rosiphele
which tho was of great renome
For she was both wise and feyre
And should be her fathers heir
But she had one defaut of sloth
Toward love, and that was routh
For so well couthe no man seye
which might set her in the weye
Of loves occupacion
Through none imagination
That scole would she not know
And thus she was one of the slow
As of such hertes business
Till when Venus the goddess
which loves court has for to reule
Has brought her in to better rule
Forth with Cupyde, and with his might
For they maruayle of such a wight
which tho was in her lusty age
Desires nouther marriage
Ne yet the love of peramours
which ever has been the common course
Among hem, that lusty were
So was it after showed there
For he that hye hertes loweth
with fyry dart, which he throws
Cupydo, which of love is god
In chastisynge has made a rod
To drive away her wantonness
So that within a while I guess
She had on such a chance spourned
That all her mode was ouertourned
which first she had of slow manner
For this it fell / as thou shall here.
when come was the month of may
She would walk upon a day
And that was er the son aryst
Of women but a few it wist
And forth she went pryuely
Unto the park was fast by
All soft walkende on the gras
Till she came there the launde was
Through which there ran a great riuere
It thought her fair: and said here
I woll abide under the shawe
And badde her women to withdraw
And there she stood alone stylle
To think what was in her will
She sygh the sweet flowers spring
She herd glad fowls sing
She sygh beasts in her kind
The bucke, the do, the heart, the hynde
The males go with the femele
And so began there a quarele
Between love and her own heart
Fro which she couthe not asterte
And as she cast her eye about
She sygh clad in one suit a route
Of ladies, where they comen ride
A long under the wodde side
On fair ambulende horse they set
That were all white, fair and great
And euerychone ride on side
The sadels were of such a pride
with perles and gold so well begone
So rich sigh she never none
In kyrtels and in copes rich
They were clothed all alyche
Departed even of white and blewe
with all lusts, that she knew
They were embroudred over all
Her bodies weren long and small
The beauty of her fair face
There may none erthly thing deface
Corownes on their heedes they bear
As each of hem a queen were
That all the gold of Cresus halle
The least coronall of all
Might not have boughte, after the worth
Thus come^ they ridend forth
The kings daughter, which this sigh
For pure abasshe drew her adrigh
And held her close under the bough
And let hem still ride enough
For as her thought in her auise
To hem that were of such a price
She was not worthy to ask there
Fro when they come, or what they were
But lever than this worlds good
She would have wist how it stood
And put her heed a little out
And as she looked her about
She saw comende under the lynde
A woman upon an horse behind
The horse, on which she rode was black
All lene, and galled upon the back
And halted, as he were encloyed
whereof the woman was annoyed
Thus was the horse in sorry plight
And for all that a sterre whyt
Amyddes in her front she had
Her saddell eke was wonder badde
In which the woeful woman sat
And netheles there was with that
A rich brydell for the nones
Of gold, and precious stones
Her cote was somedele to tore
About her myddell twenty score
Of horse halters, and well mo
There hangen that time tho
Thus when she came the lady nyghe
T^^^ took she better head, and syghe
The woman was right fair of face
All though her lacked other grace
And so ^his lady, there she stood
Bethought her well and understood
That this, which came rydende tho
Tidings couth tell of tho
which as she sygh tofore ride
And put henforth, and prayde abide
And said? A sister let me here
what ben they, that ryden now here
And ben so rychely arrayed?
This woman which come so esmayed
Answerde with full soft speech
And said: Madame I shall you teache
These are of tho, that whylom were
Servants to love, and troth bear
There as they had their hertes set
Fare well. For I may not be let
Madame I go to my service
So must I haste in all wise
For thy madame give me leave
I may not long with you leave
A good sister yet I preye
Tell me why ye be so beseye
And with these halters thus begone?
Madame, whylom I was one
That to my father had a king
But I was slow, and for no thing
Me list not to love obey
And that I now full sore abeye
For I whylom no love had
My horse is now feeble and badde
And all to tore is mine arraye
And every year this fresshe may
These lusty ladies ride about
And I must needs sewe her route
In this manner, as ye now se
And trusse her halters forth with me
And am but her horse knave
None other office I ne have
Hem thinks I am worthy no more
For I was slow in loves lore
when I was able for to lere
And would not the tales here
Of hem, that couthe love teache
Now tell me than I you beseech
wherefore that rich brydell serves
with that away her chere she swerueth
And began to weep / and thus she told
This brydell, which ye now behold
So rich upon mine horse heed
Madame before er I was deed
when I was in my lusty life
There fell in to mine heart a strife
Of love, which me overcome
So that thereof head I nome
And thought I would love a knight
That last well a fourtenyght
For it no longer might last
So nygh my life was at last
But now at last to late ware
That I ne bad him loved are
For death came so have byme
Er I thereto had any time
That it ne might ben acheued
But for all that I am releued
Of that my will was good thereto
That love suffers it be so
That I shall such a brydell were
Now have ye herd all mine answer
To god madame I you betake
And warns all for my sake
Of love, that they be naught idell
And bid hem think upon my brydell
And with that word all suddenly
She passes, as it were a sky
All clean out of the ladies sight
And tho for fear her heart aflyght
And, said to her self, alas
I am right in the same cas
But if I live after this day
I shall amend if I may
And thus homewarde this lady went
And changed all her first intent
within her heart, and began to swear
That she no halters would bear
Lo son, here might thou take heed
How idelnes is for to dread
Namelyche of love, as I have write
For thou might understand and wite
Among the gentle nacyon
Love is an occupacyon
which for to keep his lusts save
Should every gentle heart have
For as the lady was chastysed
Right so the knight may be auysed
which idell is, and woll not serve
To love, he may percase deserve
A greatter pain than she had
when she about with her ladde
The horse halters, and for thy
Good is to be ware thereby
But for to loken abouen all
These maidens, how so it fall
They should take ensample of this
which I have told forsooth it is
My lady Venus, whom I serve
what woman woll her thank deserve
She may not thylke love eschew
Of peramours, but she mote sewe
Cupydes law, and netheles
Men seen such love selde in pees
That it nys ever upon aspye
Of tanglynge / and of falls envy
Full often meddled with disease
But thylke love is well at ease
which set is upon marriage
For that dare shown the vysage
In all places openly
A great marvel it is for thy
How that a maid woll let
That she her time ne besette
To haste unto thylke feste
whereof the love is all honest
Men may recover loss of good
But so wise a man yet never stood
which may recover time ylore
So may a maiden well therefore
Ensample take, of that she straungeth
Her love, and long or that she changes
Her heart upon her lusts grene
To marriage, as it is seen
For thus a year, two, or three
She left, er that she wedded be
while she the charge might bear
Of children, which the world forbere
Ne may, but if it should fail
But what maiden that in her spousaile
would tarry, when she take may
She shall perchance an other day
Be let, when that her leuest were
whereof a tale unto thyn ear
which is culpable upon this deed
I think tell of that I read.
Hic ponit exemplum super eodem: Et narrat de filia Iepte / que cum ex sui
patris voio in holocaustum deo occidi et offerri deberet, ipsa pro eo / quod
virgo fuit, et prolem ad augmentationem populi dei nondum genuisset.xl. dierum
spacium, vt cum suis sodalibus virginibus suam defleret virginitatem priusquam
moreretur / in exemplum asiorum a patre postulauit.
Among the jews, as men told
There was whylom by days old
A noble duke, which Iepte hight
And fell, he should go to fight
Again Amon the cruel king
And for to speak upon this thing
within his heart he made a vow
To god, and said: A lord, if thou
wolte grant unto thy man victory
I shall in token of thy memory
The first life, that I may se
Of man or woman, where it be
Anon as I come home again
To the, which art god souereyne
Sleen in thy name, and sacrifie
And thus with his chivalry
He goth him forth, so as he should
And wanne all that he win would
And overcame his fomen all
May no man know that shall fall
This duke a lusty daughter had
And fame, which the worlds sprad
Has brought unto this ladies ear
How that her father has do there
She wayteth upon his coming
with daunsynge, and with carolynge
As she that would be tofore
All other, and so she was therefore
In masphat at her fathers gate
The first: and when he comes there at
And sygh his daughter, he to brayde
His clothes, and wepende he said
* O mighty god among us here
Now wot I that in no manner
This worlds joy may be plain
I had all that I couth said
Ayene my fomen by thy grace
So when I came toward this place
There was no gladder man than I
But now my lord all suddenly
My joy is turned in to sorrow
For I my daughter shall to morrow
To hew and brenne in thy service
To loving of thy sacrifice
Through mine auowe, so as it is
The maiden when she wist of this
And saw the sorrow her fatheer made
So as she may with words glade
Comforted him, and had him hold
His covenant, as he was behold
Toward god, as he behyght
But netheles his heart aflyght
Of that she saw her death comende
And than unto the ground knelende
Tofore her father she is fall
And says, so as it is fall
Upon this point, that she shall deye
Of one thing first she would him prey
That forty days of respyte
He would her grant, upon this plyght
That she the while may bewepe
Her maydenhode, which she to keep
So long has kept, and not be set
whereof her lusty youth is let
That she no children has forth draw
In marriage after the law
So that the people is not increased
But that it might be released
That she her time has lore so
She would by his leave go
with other maidens to complain
And afterward unto the pain
Of death, she would come again
The father herd his daughter seyne
And thereupon of one assent
The maidens were anon assent
That shulden with this maiden wend
So for to speak unto this end
They gone the downs and the dales
with weeping, and with woeful tales
And every wight her maydenhede
Complayneth upon thilke need
That she no children had bore
whereof she has her youth lore
which never she recover may
For so fell, that her last day
was come, in which she should take
Her death, which she may not forsake
Lo thus she deyde a woeful maid
For thylke cause, which I said
As thou have understand above
My father as toward the love
Of maidens for to tell truth
ye have thylke vice of slouthe
Me thinks right wonder well declared
That ye the women have not spared
Of hem that taryen so behind
But yet it falls in my mind
Toward the men, how that ye speak
Of hem that woll no travail seek
In cause of love upon deserte
To speak in words so couerte
I not what travail that ye meant
My son and after mine intent
I woll the tell, what I thought
How whylom men her loves boughte
Through great travail in strange lo^des
where that they wrought with her hondes
Of arms many a worthy deed
In sundry places, as men may read.
Que^, probat armoru^ probitas Venus ap probat er que^
Torpor habet reprobum, reprobat illa uiru^,
Vecors segnicies insignia nescit amoris,
Nam piger ad brauium tardius ipse uenit.
Hic loquitur, quod in amoris causa militie probitas ad armorum laboris
exercitium nullatenus torpescat.
That every love of pure kind
Is first forth draw, well I find
But nethelesse yet over this
Deserte does so, that it is
The rather had in many place
For thy who secheth loves grace
where that these worthy women are
He may not than him selue spare
Upon his travail for to serve
whereof that he may thank deserve
where as these men of arms be
Sometime over the great see
So that by land, and eke by ship
He mote travail for worship
And make many hasty rodes
Sometime in Pruys, sometime in Rodes
And some time in to Tartarye
So that these herauldes on him cry
Vaylant vaylant, lo where he goth
And than he yeueth hem gold and cloth
So that his fame might spring
And to his ladies ear bring
Some tydynge of his worthynesse
So that she might of his prowess
Of that she herd men record
The better unto his love accord
And danger put out of her mood
when all men recorden good
And that she wot well for her sake
That be no travail woll forsake
My ^^^ne of this travail I mean
Now shryue the: for it shall be seen
If thou art ydell in this cas
My father ye, and ever was
For as me thinks truly
That every man does more than I
As of this point, and if so is
That I have ought done so er this
It is so little of account
As who says, it may not amount
To win of love his lusty yifte
For this I tell you in shryfte
That me were lever her love win
Than Raire, and all that is therinne
And for to slay the heathen all
I not what good there might fall
So much blod though there were shad
This find I write how Christ bad
That no man other should slay
what should I win over the sea
If I my lady lost at home?
But pass they the salt foam
To who^ Christ bad they shulde^ preche
To all the world, and his feyth teach
But now they rucken in her nest
And resten, as hem lyketh best
In all the swetenes of delyces
Thus they defenden us the vices
And sytten hem self all amydde
To slay and fight, they us bydde
Hem who^ they should, as the book says
Conuerten unto Christ's faith
But hereof have I great marvel
How that they should me bid travail
A sarazyn if I slay shall
I slay the soul forth withal
And that was never Christ's lore
But now hoo thereof, I say no more
But I woll speak upon my shrifte
And to Cupyde I make a yefte
That who as ever price deserve
Of arms I wol love serve
As though I should hem both keep
Als well yet would I take keep
when it were time to abide
And for to travail, and for to ride
For how as ever a man labor
Cupyde appointed has his hour
Hic allegat Ama^s in sui excusatione qualiter Achilles apud Troiam propter
amorem Polixene arma sua per aliquod tempus dimisit.
For I have herd tell also
Achilles left his arms so
Both of him self, and of his men
At Troy or Polyxen
Upon her love when he fell
That for no chance that befelle
Among the greeks or vpor down
He would naught ayene the town
Ben armed for the love of her
And so me thinks leave sir
A man of arms may him rest
Sometime in hope for the best
If he may find a werre nerre
what should I than go so far?
In strange lands many a mile
To ride, and lose at home there while
My love, it were a short beyete
To win chafe, and lose whete
But if my lady bide would
That I for her love should
Travail, me thinks truly
I might flee through out the sky
And go through out the deep see
For all ne set I not a stre
what thonke that I might else get
what helps a man have mete
where drink lacks on the board
what helps any man's word
To say how I travail fast
where as me fails at last
That thing, which I travail fore
O in good time were he bore
That might atteyne such a mede
But certes if I might speed
with any manner business
Of worlds travail than I guess
There should me none idelshyp
Depart from her ladyshyp
But this I se on days now
The blind god I wot not how
Cupydo, which of love is lord
He set the things in discord
That they that lest to love entende
Full often he woll hem give and send
Most of his grace, and thus I find
That he that should go behind
Goth many a time far to fore
So wot I not right well therefore
On whether board that I shall seyle
Thus can I naught my self counsel
But all I set on adventure
And am, as who says, out of cure
For ought that I can sey or do
For euermo I find it so
The more business and lay
The more that I knele and pray
with good words, and with soft
The more I am refused often
with besynes, and may not win
And in good feyth that is great sin
For I may seye of deed and thought
That idell man have I be naught
For how as ever that I be deslayde
yet evermore I have assayde
But though my business last
All is but ydell at last
For when theffecte is ydelnesse
I not what thing is business
Say what avails all the deed
which nothing helps at need
For the fortune of every fame
Shall of his end bear a name
And thus for ought is yet befalle
An idell man I woll me call
And after mine entendement
But upon your amendment
Mine holy father, as you seems
My reason and my cause demeth
My son I have herd of thy matere
Of that thou have the shryuen here
And for to speak of idell fare
Me seems that thou tharst not care
But only that thou might not speed
And thereof son I woll the read
Abide, and haste not to fast
Thy deeds ben every day to cast
Thou nost, what chance shall betyde
Better is to wait upon the tide
Than row ayenste the stremes strong
For though so be the think long
Percase the reuolucion
Of henen, and thy condicyon
Ne be not yet of one accord
But I dare make this record
To Venus, whose pressed that I am
That sythen that I hither came
To here, as she me badde, thy life
whereof thou else be gyltyfe
Thou might hereof thy conscience
Excuse, and of great dyligence
which thou to love have so dyspended
Thou ought well to be commended
But if so be that there ought fail
Of that thou slouthest to trauaylle
In arms for to ben absent
And for thou make an argument
Of that thou saydest here above
How Achilles through strength of love
His arms left for a throw
Thou shall an other tale know
which is contrary, as thou shall wite
For this a man may find write
when that knyghthode shall be weired
Lust may not than be preferred
The bed mot than be forsake
And shield and spear on hond take
which thing shall make hem after glad
when thy be worthy knights made
whereof, so as it comes to hand
A tale thou shall understand
How that a knight shall arms sewe
And for the while his ease eschew.
Hic dicit quod amoris delectamento postposito miles arma sua prefer debet,
Et ponit exemplu^ de Vlyxe, cum ipse a bello Troiano propter amorem Penelope
remanere domi voluisset, Nau plus pater Palamidis cum tantis sermonibus
allocutus est, quod Vlixes thoro sue coniugis relicto lobores armorum vna cum
afiis Troie magnanimis subibat.
Upon knyghthode I read thus
How whylome the king Nauplus
The fader of Palamydes
Came for to preyen Vlyxes
with other Gregois eke also
That he with hem to Troy go
where that the syege should be
Anon upon Penelope
His wife, whom that he loves hot
Thynkend, would hem naught behote
But he shope then a wonder wyle
How that he should hem best begyle
So (...) might dwell stylle
At ho^e, and weld his love at will
whereof erly the morrow day
Out of his bed, where that he lay
when he was up, he began to fare
In to the field, and look and stare
As he which feyneth to be wood
He took a plough, where that it stood
wherein anon instead of oxes
He let do yoken great Foxes
And with great salt the land be sewe
But Nauplus, which the cause knew
Ayene the sleyghte, which he feyneth
Another sleyghte anon ordeyneth
And fell that time Vlyxes had
A child to son, and Nauplus radde
How men that son take should
And set him upon the molde
where that his fader held the plough
In thilk forough, which he tho drough
For in such wise he thought assaye
How it Vlyxes should pay
If that he were wood or none
The knights for this child forth gone
Telemachus anon was fette
To fore the plough and even set
where that his fader should drive
But when he saw his child as blyue
He droof the plough out of the weye
And Nauplus tho began to seye
And has half in a ^ape cried
O Vlyxes thou art aspyed
what is all this thou would mean?
For openlyche it is now seen
That thou have feyned all this thing
which is great shame to a king
when that for lust of any slouthe
Thou wylt^n a quarrel of truth
Of arms thylke honor forsake
And dwell at home for loves sake
For better it were honor to win
Than love, which liking is ynne
For thy take worship upon hand
And else thou shall understand
These other worthy kings all
Of Greece, which unto the call
Toward the wol be right wroth
And grieve the perchans both
which shall be to the double shame
Most for the hyndrynge of thy name
That thou for slouthe of any love
Shall so thy lusts set above
And leave of arms the knyghthode
which is the price of thy manhood
And ought first to be desired
But he which had his heart fyred
Upon his wife, when he this herd
Naught one word there ayene answered
But torneth home haluynge ashamed
And has within him self so tamed
His heart that all the sotye
Of love for chyualrye
He left, and be him leef or loath
To Troy forth with hem he goth
That he him might not excuse
Thus stant it, if a knight refuse
The lust of arms to travail
There may no worlds ease avail
But if worship be with all
And that has she wed ouerall
For it sit well in all wise
A knight to ben of high empryse
And putten all dread aweye
For in this wise I have herd seye.
(...) narrat super ^odem, qualiter Laodomia (...) v^or vo^ens ipsum a bello
(...) secunt retinere fatatam sibi mortem in (...) Tr^^e prenunciauit. sed ipse
miliciam poci (...) affectans, Troiam adut vbi sue more (...) perpetue laudis
Cronicam ademit.
The worthy knight Prothesalay
On his passage where he lay
Toward Troy thylke syege
She which was all his own lyege
^^^domye his lusty wife
which for his love was pensyf
As he which all her heart had
Upon a thing, whereof she dradde
A letter, for to make him dwell
Fro Troy, send him, thus to tell
How she has asked of the wise
Touchend of him in such a wise
That they have done her understand
Toward other how so it stand
The destyne it has so shape
That he shall not the death escape
In caas that he arryue at Troy
For thy as to her worlds joy
with all her heart she him preyde
And many another cause alleyde
That he with her at home abide
But he has cast her letter a side
As he which tho no manner head
Took of her wommanlyche dread
And forth he goth, as naught ne were
To Troy, and was the first there
which londeth, and took arryuayle
For him was lever in the bataylle
He seyth, to deyen as a knight
Than for to live in all his might
And be reproved of his name
Lo thus upon the worlds fame
Knyghthode has ever yet beset
which with no cowardys is let.
Adhuc super eodem qualiter Rex Saul, n^ obstante quod Samuelem a Phitonissa
fuscitatum et conturatil vesponsum, quod ipse in bello moreretur, accepisset:
hosts tame^ suos aggrediens milicie fama^ cu^tis huius vit^ bla^deme^tis
preposuit.
Of king Saul also I find
when Samuel out of his kind
Through that the Phitones has lered
In Samarye, was arered
Long time after that he was deed
The king Saul him asks read
If that he shall go fight or none
And Samuel him said anon
The first day of the battle
Thou shalt be slain without fail
And Ionathas thy son also
But how as ever it fell so
This worthy knight of his courage
Has undertake the vyage
And would naught his knyghthode let
For no peril he couth set
whereof that both his son and he
Upon the Mount of Gelboe
Assemblen with her enemies
For they knyghthode of such a prys
By old days than belden
That they none other thing behelden
And thus the fader for worship
Forth with his son of felaushyp
Through lust of arms weren deed
As men may in the bible read
They whose knyghthode is yet in mind
And shall be to the worlds end
Hic loquitur, quod miles in suis primordiis ad audaciam pronocari debet. Et
narrat qualiter Chiro Centaurus Achillem, qui secum ab infan cia in montem
Peleon educauit, vt audax efficere tur, primitus edocuit, quod cum ipse
venacionibus ibidem insifteret, leones, et tigrides, huinsmodique animalia sibi
resistentia, et nulla alia fugitiua agitaret, et sic Achilles in inuentute
animatus famosissime militie probitate^ postmodu^ ad optanit.
ANd for to loken ouermore
It has and shall ben evermore
That of knyghthode the prowess
Is grounded upon hardynesse
Of him that dare well undertake
And who that would ensample take
Upon the form of knights law
How that Achilles was forth draw
with Chiro, which Centaurus hight
Of many a wonder here he might
For it stood thylke time thus
That this Chiro this Centaurus
within a large wilderness
where was lion and leonesse
The lepard, and the Tygre also
with heart, and hynd, buk, and do
Had his dwellenge, as tho befylle
Of Peleon upon the hylle
whereof was than mochel speech
There has Chiro this child to teache
what time he was of twelve year age
wherefore to maken his courage
The more hardy by other weye
In the forest to hunt and pleye
when that Achilles walk would
Centaurus badde that he ne should
After no best make his chas
which would fleen out of his place
As buke and do, and heart and hynde
with which he may no werre find
But tho, that wolden him withstonde
There should be with his dart on hand
Upon the Tygre and the lion
Purchase and make his venyson
As to a knight is acordaunt
And thereupon a covenant
This Chiro with Achilles set
That every day without let
He should seche a cruel best
Or sle or wounden at the lest
So that he might a token bring
Of blood upon his home coming
And thus of that Chiro him taught
Achilles such an heart caught
That he no more a lion drad
when he his dart on hand had
Than if a lion were an ass
And that has made him for to pass
All other knights of his deed
when it came the great need
As it was afterward well know.
Lo thus my son thou might know
That the courage of hardiness
Is of knyghthode the prowess
which is to love suffysaunt
Abouen all the remenaunt
That unto loves court pursue
But who that would no sloth eschew
Upon knyghthode and not travail
I not what love him should avail
But every labor asks why
Of some reward, whereof that I
Ensamples couth tell enough
Of hem that toward love drough
By old days, as they should
My fader thereof here I would
My son it is will reasonable
In place, which is honorable
If that a man his heart set
That than he for no slouthe let
To do what longs to manhede
For if thou wolt the books read
Of Lancelot, and other mo
There might thou seen, how it was tho
Of arms, for they would atteyne
To love, which withouten pain
May not be get of ydelnesse
And that I take to witness
An old Cronycke in special
The which in to memoryall
As write for his loves sake
How that a knight shall undertake.
Hic dicet, quod miles priusqua amoris amplexu dignus efficiatur, euentus
bellicos victoriosus amplectere debet / et narrat qualiter Hercules et
Achillous propter Deianiram Calidonie regis filiam singular duellum ad
inuicemnierunt / cuins victor Hercules existens armorum meritis amorem virginis
laudabiliter conquestauit.
There was a king, which Oenes
was hot, and he under pees
Held Calydonye in his empire
And had a daughter Deyanyre
Men wist in thylke time none
So fair a wight, as she was one
And as she was a lusty wight
Right so was than a noble knight
To whom Mercurye fader was
This knight the two pylers of bras
The which yet a man may find
Set up in the deserte of Inde
That was the worthy Hercules
whose name shall ben endeles
For the meruayles, which he wrought
This Hercules the love sought
Of Deyanyre, and of this thing
Unto her fader, which was king
He spoke touchend of marriage
The king knowend his hye lynage
And dead also his myghtes stern
To him ne durst his daughter werne
And netheles, this he him seyde
How Achilous, er he, first preyde
To wedden her: and in acorde
They stood, as it was of record
But for all that, this he him grau^teth
That which of hem, that other dau^teth
In arms, him she should take
And that the king has undertake
This Achilous was a geaunt
A subtyl man, a deceyuaunt
which through Magyke and sorcerye
Couthe all the world of recherye
And when that he this tale herd
How upon that the king answered
with Hercules he must feyght
He trusts naught upon his sleyght
Al only, when it comes to need
But that, which voydeth all dread
And every noble heart stereth
The love, that no life forbereth
For his lady, whom he desires
with hardynesse his heart fyreth
And sent him word without fail
That he woll take the battle
They setten day, they chosen field
The knights covered under shield
To gyder come at time set
And each one is with other met
It fell they foughten both on foot
There was no stone, there was no rote
which might letten hem the weye
But all was void and take aweye
They smyten strokes but a few
For Hercules, which would show
His great strength, as for the nones
He stert upon him all at ones
And caught him in his arms strong
This geaunt wot, he may not long
Endure under so hard bonds
And thought he would out of his bo^des
By sleyghte, in some manner, escape
And as he couthe him self forshape
In likeness of an adder he slypte
Out of his hand, and forth he skipte
And often, as he that fight wolle
He torneth him in to a bolle
And began to belwe in such a soune
As though the world should al go down
The ground he sporneth, and he trau^ceth
His large horns he auaunceth
And cast hem here and there about
But he, which stant of hem no doubt
Awayteth well when that he came
And him by both bornes nam
And all at ones he him cast
Unto the ground, and held him fast
That he ne might with no sleyght
Out of his hand get upon heyghte
Tylle he was overcome, and yolde
And Hercules has what he would
The king him granted to fulfylle
His asking at his own will
And she, for whom he had served
Her thought he has her well deserved
And thus with great desert of arms
He wan him for to lygge in arms
As he which has it dear abought
For otherwise should he naught
Nota de penthefilea Amazonie regina, que Hectoris amore colligata / contra
Pirrum Achillis filium apud Troiam arma far eciam personaliter non recusauit.
And over this if thou will here
Upon knyghthode of this mattere
How love and arms ben acqueynted
A man may se both write and peynted
So ferforth, that Penthesyle
which was the queen of Femyne
The love of Hector for to seek
And for thonour of arms eke
To Troy came with spear and shield
And rode her self in to the field
with maidens armed all aroute
In rescus of the Town a boute
which with the greeks was belein.
Nota qualiter Philimenia propter milicie famam a finibus terre in defensionem
Troie veniens tres puellas a regno Amazonie quolibet anno percipiendas sibi et
heredibus suis imperpetuum ea de causa habere promeruit.
Fro Paphlagonie and as men sein
which stant upon the worlds end
That time it lyked eke to wend
Philimenis, which was king
To Troy, and came upon this thing
In help of thylke noble town
And all was that for the renoune
Of worship and of worlds fame
Of which he would bear a name
And so he did, and forth with all
He wan of love in special
A fair trybute for euermo
For it fell thylke time so
Pyrrus the son of Achylles
This worthy queen among the pres
with dedely swerd sought out, and fond
And slough her with his own hand
whereof this king of Paphlagonye
Penthesyle of Amazonie
where she was queen, with him ladde
with such maidens as she had
Of hem that were left alive
Forth in his ship, till they aryue
where that the body was begraue
with worsyp, and the women save
And for the goodshyp of this deed
They graunten him a lusty mede
That every year, for his truage
To him and to his heritage
Of maidens fair he shall have three
And in this wise spedde he
which the fortune of arms sought
with his travail his ease he bought
For other wise he should have failed
If that he had naught trauayled
Nota pro eo quod Eneas regem Turnum in bello deuicit non solum amorem Lauine /
sed et regnum Italy sibi subiugaium obtinuit.
Eneas eke within Itayle
He had he won the bataylle
And done his might so besyly
Ayene king Turn his enemy
He had naught Lauine won
But for he has him over run
And gat his prys, he gat her love
By these ensamples here above
Lo now my son, as I have told
Thou might well se, who that is bold
And dar travail, and undertake
The cause of love, he shall be take
The rather unto loves grace
For comonlyche in worthy place
The women louen worthynesse
Of manhood and of gentylnesse
For the gentiles be most desired
My fader but I were inspired
Through lore of you, I wot no weye
what gentylnesse is for to seye
whereof to tell I you beseech
The ground my son for to seche
Upon this diffinicyon
The worlds constitucion
Has set the name of gentylnesse
Upon the fortune of richesse
which of long time is fall in age
Than is a man of high lynage
After the form as thou shall here
But no thing after the matere
For who that reason understand
Upon richesse it may not stand
For that is thing, which fails often
For he that stant to day alofte
And all the world has in his wones
To morrow he fallyth all at ones
Out of riches in to pouerte
So that thereof is no deserte
which gentylnesse makes abide
And for to look on other side
How that a gentylman is bore
Adam, which was all tofore
with Eve his wife, as of hem two
All was alyche gentle tho
So that of generacyon
To make declaration
There may no gentylnes be
For to the reason if we se
Of man's birth the measure
It is so common to nature
That it yeueth every man alyche
As well to the poor as to the rich
For naked they ben bore both
The lord no more has for to clothe
As of him that ilke throw
Than has the poorest of the row
And when they shull both pass
I not of hem which has the less
Of worlds good, but as of charge
The lord is more for to charge
when god shall his account here
For he has had his lusts here
But of the body which shall deye
All though there be diverse weye
To death, yet is there but one end
To which that every man shall wend
As well the beggar as the lord
Of one nature of one accord
She which our old mother is
The earth, both that and this
Receives, and alyche deuoureth
That she do nouther part favors
So were I nothing after kind
where I may gentylles find
For lack of virtue lacks of grace
whereof Richesse in many place
when men best wene for to stand
All suddenly goth out of hand
But virtue set in the courage
There may no world be so saluage
which might it take and done away
Till when that the body deye
And than he shall be ryched so
That it may fail neuermo
So may that well be gentyl^^se
which yeueth so great a sikernes
For after the condition
Of reasonable intencyon
The which out of the soul grows
And the virtue fro vice knows
whereof a man the vice escheweth
without sloth, and virtue seweth
That is a very gentle man
And nothing else, which he can
Ne which he has, ne which he may
But for all that yet now a day
In loves court to taken head
The poor virtue shall not speed
where that the rich vice woweth
For selde it is, that love allows
The gentle man withouten good
Though his condition be good
But if a man of both two
Be rich and virtuous also
Than is he well the more worth
But yet to put him self forth
He must done his business
For another good, ne gentylnesse
May helpen hem, which idel be
But who that woll in his degree
Travail so, as it belongs
It happeth often, that he fongeth
worship, and ease both two
For ever yet it has be so
That love honest in sundry wey
Profyteth: for it does aweye
The vice: and as the books seyne
It makes curteys of the vileyne
And to the cowarde hardyesse
It yeueth: so that the very prowess
Is caused upon loves reule
To him that can manhood reule
And eke toward the womanhede
who that thereof woll taken head
For though the better affayted be
In every thing, as men may se
For love has ever his lusts grene
In gentle folk, as it is seen
which thing there may no kind arest
I trow that there is no beast
If he with love should acqueynt
That he ne would make it queynt
As for the while, that it last
And thus I conclude at last
That they ben ydell, as me seems
which unto thing, that love demeth
For slouthen, that they shulden do
And over this my son also
After the virtue morail eke
To speak of love if I shall seek
Among the holy books wise
I find writ in such a wise
Nota de amore charitatis vbi dicit qui non diliget / manet in morte.
who loves not, as here is deed
For love above all other is head
which has the virtues for to lead
Of all that unto man's deed
Belongs. For of ydelshyp
He hates all the felaushyp
For slouthe is ever to despise
which in disdeyne has all appryse
And that acordeth naught to man
For he that wit and reason can
It sit him well, that he travail
Upon such thing, which might avail
For ydelshyp is naught commended
But every law it has defended
And in ensample thereupon
The noble wise Solomon
which had of every thing insyght
Seyth: As the birds to the flight
Ben made, so the man is bore
To labor, which is naught forbore
To hem, that thynken for to thryue
For we, which are now a live
Of hem that besy whylome were
(As well in schole as else where)
Now every day ensample take
That if it were now to make
Thing, which that they first founden out
It should not be brought about
Her lives than were long
Her wits great, her myghtes strong
Her hertes full of business
whereof the worlds redynesse
In bopy both, and in courage
Stant ever upon his advantage
And for to draw in to memory
Her names both, and her historye
Upon the virtue of her deed
In sundry books thou might read
Expedit de manibus labor, vt de coridianis
Actibus ac vita viuere poscit homo,
Sed qui doctrina causa fert meute labores
Praeualet, et merita perpetuata parat.
Hic loquitur contra ociosos quoscumque, et maxim contra istos, qui
excellentis prudencie ingenium habentes absque fructu operum torpescunt. Et
ponit exemplum de diligencia predecessorum, qui ad tocius humani generis
doctrinam et auxiliu^ suis co^tinuis laboribus et studus gracia mediante diuina
arts et sciencias primitus inueneru^t.
Of every wisdom the parfyt
The high god of his spyryt
yafe to men in earth here
Upon the form and the matter
Of that he would make hem wise
And thus came in the first apryse
Of books, and of all good
Through hem, that whilom understood
The lore, which to hem was give
whereof these other, that now live
Ben every day to learn new
But er the time that men few
And that the labor forth it brought
There was no corn, though men it sout
In none of all the feldes out
And er the wisdom came about
Of hem, that first the books write
This may well every wise man wit
There was great labor eke also
Thus was none ydel of the two
That on the plough has undertake
with labor, which the hond has take
That other took to study and muse
As he which would not refuse
The labor of his wits all
And in this wise it is befalle
Of labor, which that they begone
we be now taught, of that we conne
Her besynes is yet to seen
That it stant ever alyche grene
All be it so the body deye
The name of hem shall never aweye
In the Cronycke as I find
Cham, whose labor is yet in mind
was he, which first the letters fond
And wrote in hebrewe with his hand
Of natural philosophye
He fond first also the clergy
Cadmus the letters of gregoys
First made upon his own chose
Theges of thing, which shall befalle
He was the first angur of all
And Philemon by the visage
Fond to descryue the courage
Claudius, Esdras, and Sulpices
Termegis, Pandulfe, and Frigidilles
Menander Ephiloquorus
Solinus, Pandas, and Josephus
The first were of enditours
Of old Cronyke, and eke auctours
And Heredot in his science
Of meter, of ryme, and of cadence
The first was, which men note
And of musyke also the note
In man's voice or soft or sharp
That fond Iuball, and of the harp
The merry sown, which is to like
That fond Paulius forth with phisike
Z^uzis fond first the portrature
And Promotheus the sculpture
After what form that hem thought
The resemblance anon they wrought
A^b^ll in iron and in steel
F^nde first the forge, and wrought it well
And Iadahel, as says the book
First made net, and fysshes took
Of hunting eke be fond the chase
which now is know in many place
A tent of clothe with cord and stake
He set up first, and did it make
Herconius of cokerye
First made the delycacie
The craft Mynerue of wolle fond
And made cloth her own hand
And Delbora made it of line
The women were of great engyne
But thing which yeueth mete and drink
And does the labor for to swynke
To tylle the lands, and set the vynes
whereof the corn and the wynes
B^n sustenaunce to mankind
In old books as I find
Saturnus of his own wit
Has found first: and more yet
Of chapmenhode he fond the weye
And eke to coygne the money
Of sundry metal, as it is
He was the first man of this
But how that metal came a place
Through man's wit and gods grace
The route of philosophers wise
Contreueden by sundry wise
First for to get it out of mine
And after for to try and fine
And also with great dilygence
They fond thylke experience
which cleped is Alconomy
whereof the silver multiplye
They made, and eke the gold also
And for to tell how it is so
Of bodies seven in special
with four spirits joint withal
Stant the substance of this matere
The bodies, which I speak of here
Of the planettes ben begone
The gold is tytled to the son
The moon of silver has his part
And Iron that stand upon Mart
The leed after Saturn grows
And Iubiter the brass bestows
The copper set is to Venus
And to his part Mercurius
Has the quick silver, as it falls
The which after the book it calls
Is first of thilke four named
Of spirits, which ben proclaimed
And the spirit, which is second
In Sal Armonyake is found
The third spirit Sulphur is
The fourth sewende after this
Arce^nicum by name is hot
with blowynge and with fyres hot
In these things, which I say
They worchen by diverse way
For as the philosopher told
Of gold and silver they ben hold
Two principal extremities
To which all other by degrees
Of the metalles ben accordaunt
And so through kind resemblant
That what man couth away take
The rust, of which they woxen black
And the savor of the hardness
They shulden take the lykenes
Of gold or silver parfectly
But for to worche it sykerly
Between the corpse and the spirit
Er that the metal be parfyte
In seven forms it is set
Of all: and if one be let
The remenaunt may not avail
But other wise it may naught fail
For they, by who^ this art was found
To every point a certain bound
Ordeynen, that a man may find
This craft is wrought by wey of kind
So that there is no fallace inn
But what man that this work begin
He mote awayte at every tide
So that nothing be left a side
First of the distillacion
Forth with the congellation
Solucyon, Discention
And keep in his entencyon
The point of sublymation
And forth with Calcination
Of very approbation
Do that there be fyxation
with temperate hetes of the fire
Till he the parfyte Elyxer
Of thilke philosophers stone
May get, of which that many one
Of philosophers, whylom write
And if thou wolt the names wit
Of thilke stone with other two
which as the clerks maden tho
So as the books it recorden
The kind of hem I shall recorden.

que omnia metalla purificat / et in suum perfectum naturali potencia deducit.
These old philosophers wise
By wey of kind in sundry wise
Thie stones made through clergy
The first I shall specify
was cleped Vegetabilis
Of which the propre virtue is
To man's heal for to serve
As for to keep and to preserve
The body fro sickness all
Till death of kind upon him fall
The second stone I the behote
Is lapis Animalis hot
The whose virtue is propre, and couth
For ear, and eye, nose, and mouth
whereof a man may here and se
And smelle, and taste in his degree
And for to feel, and for to go
It helps a man of both two
The wits five he vnderfongeth
To keep, as it to him belongs
The third stone in special
By name is cleped Mynerall
which the metalles of every mine
Attempreth, till that they ben fine
And pureth hem by such a wey
That all the vice goth a weye
Of rust, of stynke, and of hardness
And when they ben of such clennes
This mynerall, so as I find
Transformeth all the first kind
And makes hem able to conceive
Through his virtue, and receive
Both in substance and in figure
Of gold and silver the nature
For they two ben thextremites
To which after the properties
Has every metal his desire
with help and comfort of the fire
Forth with this stone, as it is said
which to the son and moan is laid
For to the red, and to the white
This stone has power to profit
It makes multiplication
Of gold, and the fyxacion
It causes, and of his habyte
He does the work to be parsyte
Of thilke Elyxer which men call
Alconomy, as is befalle
To hem, that whylom were wise
But now it stant all otherwise
They speken fast of thilke stone
But how to make it, now wot none
After the sothe experience
And netheles great diligence
They setten up thilke deed
And spyllen more than they speed
For always they find a let
which brings in pouerte and debt
To hem, that rich were tofore
The loss is had, the lucre is lore
To get a pound they spenden five
I not how such a craft shall thryue
In the manner as it is used
It were better be refused
Than for to worchen upon wene
In thing, which stant not as they wene
But not for thy who that it knew
The science of him self is true
Upon the form, as it was founded
whereof the names yet be grounded
Of hem, that first it founden out
And thus the fame goth all about
To such as soughten besynes
Of virtue, and of worthynes
Of whom if I the names call
Hermes was one the first of all
To whom this art is most applied
Geber thereof was magnified
And Ortolan, and Moryen
Among the which is Auicen
which fond and wrote a great party
The practyke of Alconomy
whose books pleynly, as they stand
Upon this craft, few understand
But yet to putten hem in assay
There ben full many now a day
That known little what they mean
It is not one to wit, and wene
Inform of words they it trete
But yet they faylen of beyete
For of to much, or of to lyte
There is algate found a wit
So that they follow not the line
Of the partyte medycine
which grounded is upon nature
But they that written the scripture
Of Greek, Arabe, and Caldee
They were of such auctorite
That they first founden out the wey
Of all that thou have herd me sey
whereof the cronyke of her lore
Shall stand in price for evermore
But toward our marches here
Of the Latyns, if thou wolte here
Of hem that whylom virtuous
were, and thereto laborious
Carment made of her engyne
The first letters of latyne
Of which the tongue romayn came
whereof that Aristarchus nam
Forth with Donat and Dyndymus
The first reule of scole, as thus
How that latyne shall be compowned
And in what wise it shall be sowned
That every word in his degree
Shall stand upon congruite
And thilke time at Rome also
was Tullius Cicero
That writes upon Rethorike
How that men should her words pyke
After the form of cloquence
which is, men seyne, a great prudence
And after that out of hebrewe
Jerome, which the langage knew
The bible, in which the law is closed
In to latyne he has transposed
And many an other writer eke
Out of Caldee, Arabe, and Greek
with great labor the books wise
Translateden, and otherwise
The latyns of hem self also
Her study at thylke time so
with great travail of scole took
In sundry form for to look
That we may take her evidence
Upon the lore of the science
Of crafts both, and of clergy
Among the which in poesy
To the lovers O uyde wrote
And taught, if love be to hot
In what manner it should akele,
For thy my son if that thou feel
That love wrynge the to sore
Behold O uyde, and take his lore
My father if they might speed
My love, I would his books read
And if they techen to restreyne
My love, it were an idell pain
To learn a thing, which may not be
For lyche unto the grene tree
If that men take his rote awey
Right so mine heart should deye
If that my love be withdraw
whereof touchende unto this saw
There is but only to pursewe
My love, and idelshyp eschew.
My good son soth to seye
If there be siker any weye
To love, thou have said the best
For who that woll have all his rest
and do no travail at need
It is no reason that he speed
In loves cause for to win
For he, which dare nothing begin
I not what thing he should acheue
But over this thou shalt believe
So as it sit the well to know
That there ben other vices slow
which unto love do great let
If thou thyn heart upon hem set.
Perdit homo causam linquens sua iura sopori
Et quasi dimidium pars sua mortis habet
Est in amore uigil Venus, et quod habet uigilanti.
Obsequium thalamis fert vigilata suis.
HIC loquitur de Sompnolencia / que Accidie Cameraria dicta est / cuins natura
semimortua alicuius negotii vigilius obseruari sopori sero torpore recusat,
vnde quatenus amore^ concernit Confessor Amanti dilige^tius opponit.
Toward the slow progeny
There is yet one of company
And he is cleped Sompnolence
which does to Sloth his reverence
As he which is his chamberleyn
That many an honderde time has lein
To sleep, when he should wake
He has with love truce take
That wake who so wake will
If he may couche adowne his byll
He has all wowed what him list
That often he goth to bed vnkyst
And says, that for no druery
He woll not leave his sluggardy
For though that no man it would allow
To sleep lever than to wowe
Is his manner, and thus on nyghtes
when he sees the lusty knights
Reuelen, where these women are
Awey be sculketh as an hare
And gothe to bed, and leyth him soft
And of his slouthe he dremeth often
How that he stycketh in the mire
And how he sytteth by the fire
And claweth on his bare shankes
And how he clymeth up the banks
And falls in the slades deep
But than who so take keep
when he is fall in such a dreme
Right as a ship against the streme
He routeth with a slepy noise
And brustleth as a monks froyse
when it is throw in to the pan
And otherwhile selde when
That he may dreme a lusty sweuen
Him thinks as though he were in heaven
And as the world were holly his
And than he speaks of that and this
And makes his exposition
After his disposition
Of that he would, and in such a wise
He does to love all his seruise
I not what thonke he shall deserve
But son if thou wolte love serve
I read that thou do not so
A good father certes no
I had leauer by my troth
Er I were set on such a sloth
And bear such a slepy snoute
Both eien of my heed were out
For me were better fully dye
Than I of such sluggardye
Had any name, god me shield
For when my mother was with child
And I lay in her womb close
I would rather Atropos
which is goddess of all death
Anon as I had any breath
Me had fro my mother cast
But now I am nothing aghast
I thank god: for Lachesis
Ne Cloto, which her felawe is
Me shopen no such destine
when they at my natiuite
My werdes setten as they would
But they me shopen that I should
Eschew of sleep the truandyse
So that I hope in such a wise
To love for to ben excused
That I no sompnolence have used
For certes father Genius
yet unto now it has be thus
At all time if it befelle
So that I might come and dwell
In place there my lady were
I was not slow ne slepy there
For than I dare well undertake
That when her list on nights wake
In chamber, as to carole and dance
Me think I may me more auaunce
^f I may gone upon her hand
Than if I win a kings land
For when I may her hand beclyp
with such gladness I dance and skyp
Me thinks I touch not the floor
The Roo, which renneth on the moore
Is than naught so light as I
So mow ye wyten all for thy
That for the time sleep I hate
And when it falls other gate
So that her lyketh not to dance
But on the dies to cast a chance
O^ ask of love some demand
O^ else that her list command
To read and here of Troylus
R^ght as she would, so or thus
I am all ready to consent
And if so is, that I may hent
Sometime among a good leyser
So as I dare of my desire
I tes^e a part: but when I ^reye
Anon she byddeth me go my weye
And ^^ith: it is far in the night
And I swear, it is even light
But as it falls at last
There may no worlds joy last
So mote I needs fro her wend
And of my watch make an end
And if she than head took
How pytouslyche on her I look
when that I shall my leave take
Her ought of mercy for to slake
Her danger, which says ever nay
But he seyth often, Have good day
That loathe is for to take his leave
Therefore while I may believe
I tarry forth the night alonge
For it is naught on me alonge
To sleep, that I soon go
Till that I mote algate so
And than I bydde, god hearse
And so down knelende on my kne
I take leave, and if I shall
I kiss her, and go forth withal
And other while, if that I door
Er I come fully at door
I turn ayene and feyne a thing
As though I had lost a ring
Or somewhat else, for I would
Rysse her eftsone, if I should
But seldom is, that I so speed
And when I se, that I mote need
Depart, I depart, and thanne
with all my heart I curse and banne
That ever sleep was made for eye
For as me thinks I might dry
without sleep to waken ever
So that I should not disseuer
Fro her, in whom is all my light
And than I curse also the night
with all the will of my courage
And say, Away thou black image
which of thy derke cloudy face
Make all the worlds light deface
And causest unto sleep away
By which I mote now gone away
Out of my ladies company
O slepy night I the defye
And would that thou lay in press
with Proserpyne the goddess
And with Pluto the belle king
For till I se the day spring
I set sleep naught at a rysshe
And with that word I sygh and wysshe
And say: A why ne were it day
For yet my lady than I may
Behold, though I do no more
And este I think forthermore
To some man how the night does ease
wha^ he has thing, that may him plese
The long night is by his side
where as I fail, and go beside
But sleep, I not whereof it serves
Of which no man his thank deserves
To get him love in any place
But is an hyndrer of his grace
And makes him deed as for a throw
Right as a stoke were overthrow
And so my fader in this wise
The slepy nyghtes I despise
And ever a mids of my tale
I think upon the nyghtyngale
which slepeth not by wey of kind
For love, in books as I find
Thus at last I goo to bed
And yet mine heart lies to wedde
with her, where as I came fro
Though I depart, he wol not so
There is no lock may shet him out
Him needs naught to gone about
That perce may the hard wall
Thus is he with her ouerall
That be her leef, or he it loath
In to her bed mine heart goth
And softely takes her in his arm
And feleth how that she is warm
And wyssheth that his body were
To feel, that he felyth there
And thus my selfen I torment
Till that the deed sleep me hent
But than by a thousand score
well more than I was tofore
I am tormented in my sleep
But that I dreme is not on sheep
For I ne think naught on wull^
But I am dretched to the full
Of love, that I have to keep
That now I laugh, and now I weep
And now I lose, and now I win
And now I end, and now begin
And other while I dreme, and mete
That I alone with her mete
And that danger is left behind
And than in sleep such joy I find
That I ne bid never awake
But after, when I bid take
And shall arise upon the morrow
Than is all turned in to sorrow
Naught for the cause I shall arise
But for I met in such a wise
And at last I am bethought
That all is vain and helps naught
But yet me thinks by my will
I would have ley, and sleep stylle
To meten ever of such a sweuen
For than I had a slepy heaven
Confessor.
My son and for thou tellyst so
A man may find of time a go
That many a sweuen has be certain
All be it so, that some men seyn
That sweuens ben of no credence
But for to show in euydence
That they full often soth things
Be token, I think in my wrytynges
To tell a tale thereupon
which fell by old days gone
Hic ponit exemplu^ qualiter somnia pre^^stice veritatis quandoque certitudinem
figurant. Et narrat quod cum Ceix rex Troicinie pro reformatione fratris sui
Dedalionis in ancipitrem trans mutati peregre proficiscens in mari longins a pa
tria dimersus fuerat, Juno mittens Iridem miciam suam in parts Chimerie ad
domum somni iussit, quod ipse Alcione dicti regis vxori huius rei euentu^ per
somnia certificaret. Quo facto Alciona rem perscrutans corpus mariti sui, vbi
super fluctus mortuus iactabatur, inuenit: que pro do fore anguftiata cupiens
corpus amplectere, in all tum mare super ipsum prosiliit, vnde du miserti
amborum corpora in aues, que adhuc Alciones dicte sunt, subito conuerterunt.
This find I written in poesye
Ceyx the king of Trocenye
Had Alceon to his wife
which as her own hertes life
Him loves, and he had also
A brother, which was cleped tho
Dedalion, and he par cas
Fro kind of man forshape was
In to a goshauke of lykenes
whereof this king great heaviness
Has take: and thought in his courage
To gone upon a pylgremage
In a strange Regyon
where he has his devotion
To done his sacrifyce, and preye
If that he might in any weye
Toward the gods find grace
His broders hele to purchase
So that he might be reformed
Of that he had been transformed
To this purpose, and to this end
This king is ready for to wend
As he which would go by ship
And for to done him felauship
His wife unto the se him brought
with all her heart, and him besought
That he the time here would seyn
when that he thought come again
within, he says, two monethis day
And thus in all the haste he may
He took his leave, and forth he sayleth
wepend, and she her self bewayleth
And torneth home there she came fro
But when the months were ago
The which he set of his coming
And that she herd no tydynge
There was no care for to seche
whereof the gods to beseech
Tho she began in many wise
And to Juno her sacryfyce
Above all other most she deed
And for her lord she has so head
To wit and know how that he ferd
That Juno the gods her herd
Anon, and upon this matere
She had Irys her massagyer
To Slepes house that she shall wend
And bid him, that he make an end
By sweuen, and shown all the cas
Unto this lady, how it was
This Irys fro the high stage
(which undertake has the message)
Her reyny cope did upon
The which was wonderly begone
with colors of diverse hew
An honderd mo than men it knew
The heaven lyche unto a bow
She bend, and she came down low
The god of sleep where that she fond
And that was in a strange land
which marches upon Chimerye
For there, as seyth the poesye
The god of sleep has made his house
which of entaylle is meruaylous
Under an hylle there is a cave
which of the son may not have
So that no man may know aryght
The point between the day and night
There is no fire, there is no spark
There is no door, which may charke
whereof an eye should vnshet
So that inward there is no let
And for to speak of that without
There stant no great tree nygh about
whereon there might crow or pie
A light? for to clepe or cry
There is no cock to crow day
Ne best none, which noise may
The hylle, but all about round
There is growend upon the ground
Popy, which bears the sede of sleep
with other herbs such an hepe
A stylle water for the nones
Rennend upon the small stones
which hight of Lethes the river
Under that hylle in such manner
There is, which yeueth great appetyte
To sleep, and thus full of delight
Sleep has his house, And of his couch
within his chamber if I shall touch
Of Hebenus that slepy tree
The bordes all about be
And for he should sleep soft
Upon a fether bed alofte
He lies with many a pylowe of down
The chamber is strowed up and down
with sweuenes many a thousand fold
Thus came Iris in to this hold
And to the bed, which is all black
She goth, and there with sleep she spoke
And in this wise as she was bid
The massage of Juno she deed
Full often her word she reherseth
Er she his slepy eres perseth
with mochel woe, but at last
His slomerend eyes he vpcast
And said her, that it shall be do
whereof among a thousand tho
within his house, that slepy were
In special he chese out there
Three, which shulden do this deed
The first of hem, so as I read
was Morpheus, the whose nature
Is for to take the figure
Of that person that him lyketh
whereof that he full often entryketh
The life, which sleep shall by night
And Ithecus that other hight
which has the voys of every son
The chere, and the condycioun
Of every life what so it is
The third sewend after this
Is Panthasas, which may transform
Of every thing the right form
And change it in another kind
Upon hem three, so as I find
Of sweuens stant all thapparence
which other while is euydence
And other while but a iape
But netheles it is so shape
That Morpheus by night allone
Appears until Alccone
In likeness of her husbonde
Al naked deed upon the strond
And bow he dreynt in special
These other two it shown all
The tempest of the black cloud
The wode see, the wyndes loud
All this she met, and sees him dyen
whereof that she began to cryen
Slepend a bed there she lay
And with that noise of her affraye
Her women sterten up about
which of her lady were in doubt
And asken her, how that she ferde
And she right as she sygh and herd
her sweuen has told hem every dele
And they it halsen all well
And seyn, it is a token of good
But till she wist how that it stood
She has no comfort in her heart
Upon the morrow and up she sterte
And to these (where as she met
The body lay) without let
She drough: and wha^ that she came nygh
Stark deed his arms sprade she sigh
Her lord, fletende upon the wawe
whereof her wits be withdraw
And she which took of death no keep
Anon forth lepte in to the deep
And would have caught him there arm
This infortune of double harm
The gods from the heaven above
Beheld, and for the truth of love
which in this worthy lady stood
They have upon the salt flood
Her dreynt lord and her also
Fro death to life turned so
That they ben shapen in to bryddes
Swymmend upon the wawe amyddes
And when she saw her lord lyuend
In likeness of a bird swymende
And she was of the same sort
So as she might do disport
Upon the joy, which she had
Her wings both abroad she spradde
And him both, so as she may suffyse
Beclypte and kyste in such a wise
As she was whylome wont to do
Her wings for her arms tho
She took, and for her lyppes soft
Her hard bylle, and so full often
She fondeth in her berdes form
If that she might her self conform
To do the plesaunce of a wife
As she did in that other life
For though she had her power lore
Her will stood, as it was tofore
And serves him so as she may
whereof in to this ylke day
To geder upon the sea they wone
where many a daughter and son
They bryngen forth of birds kind
And for men shulden take in mind
This Alceon the true queen
Her bryddes yet as it is seen
Of Alceon the name bear
Lo thus my son it may the stere
Of sweuens for to take keep
For often time a man a sleep
May se, what after shall betyde
For thy it helps at some tide
A man to sleep as it belongs
But slouthe no life vnderfongeth,
which is to love appertenaunt
My fader upon the covenant
I dare well make this auowe
Of all my life in to now
Als ferforth as I can understand
yet took I never sleep on hond
when it was time for to wake
For though mine eye it would take
Mine heart is ever there again
But netheles to speak it pleyne
All this that I have said you here
Of my waking, as ye may here
^t touches to my lady sweet
For other wise I you byhete
In strange place when I go
Me list no thing to wake so
For when the women lysten play
And I her se not in the way
Of whom I should myrthe take
Me list not long for to wake
But if it be for pure shame
Of that I would eschew a name
That they ne should have cause none
To seye, A lo where such one
That has forlore his contenaunce
And thus among I sing and dance
And feyne lust, there none is
For often sith I feel this
Of thought, which in min heart falls
when it is night mine head appallyth
And that is for I se her naught
which is the waker of my thought
And thus as tymelyche as I may
F^lo^t^* when it is broad day
I (...) of all these other leave
And go my wey: and they believe
That seen per cas her loves there
And I go forth as naught ne were
Unto my bed, so that alone
I may there lygge, syghe, and groan
^^d wysshen all the long night
(...) that I se the days light
I not if that be sompnolence
But upon your conscience
Mine holy fader demeth ye
My son I am well paid with the
Of sleep, that thou the sluggardye
By night in loves company
Eschew have, and do thy pain
So, that thy love dare not pleyne
For love upon his lust wakende
Is ever, and would that none end
whereof the long night is set
whereof that thou beware the bette
To tell a tale I am bethought
How love and sleep acorden naught
Hic dicit, quod vigilia in amantibus / et non sompnolencia laudanda est. Et
ponit exemplum de Cephalo filio Phebi / qui nocturno silencio auroram amicam
suam diligencius amplectene Solemn et Lunam interpellabat / videlicet quod sol
in circulo ab orient distantiori curru^ cu^ luce sua retardaret, et quod Luna
sphera sua longissima orbem circuens, noctem continuaret / ita vt ipsum
Cephalam amplexibus Aurore volutu^ priusqua^ dies illucesceret suis deliciis
adquiescere diutius permittere dignarentur.
For love who that list to wake
By night, he may ensample take
Of Cephalus, when that he lay
with Aurora the sweet may
In arms all the long night
But when it drough toward the light
That he within his heart sye
The day, which was the morrow nigh
Anon unto the Son he preyde,
For lust of love: and thus he said
O Phoebus, which the days light
Gouernest till that it be night
And gladdest every creature
After the law of thy nature
But netheles there is a thing
which onlyche to thy knowlechynge
Belongs, as in pryuete
To love, and to his dute
which asks not to ben a pert
But in silence, and in covert
Desires for to be beshadyd
And thus when that the light is faded
And vesper shows him alofte
And that the night is long and soft
Under the clouds derke and stylle
Than has this thing most of his will
For thy unto thy myghtes hye
As thou, which art the days eye
Of love and might no counseyl hyde
Upon this derke nyghtes tide
with all mine heart I the beseech
That I pleasaunce might seche
with her, which lies in mine arms
withdraw the baner of thyn arms
And let thy lyghtes ben unborn
And in the sign of Capricorn
The house appropred to Saturn
I preye the, that thou wolt soiourne
where ben the nyghtes derke and long
For I my love have vnderfonge
which lies here by my side naked
As she which would ben awaked
And me list no thing for to sleep
So were it good to take keep
Now at this need of my prayer
And that the like for to stere
Thy fyry ^art, and so ordeyne
That thou thy swyft horse restrain
Low under earth in occident
That they toward thoryent
By sercle go the long weye
And eke to the Dyane I preye
which cleped art of thy noblesse
The nyghtes moan, and the Goddess
That thou to me be gracyous
And in Cancro thyn own house
Ayene Phoebus in opposite
Stond at this time, and of delight
Behold Venus with a glad eye
For than upon Astronomye
Of due constellacyon
Thou make prolifycacion
And do that children ben begete
which grace if that I might get
with all mine heart I woll serve
By night, and thy vygylle observe
Lo thus this lusty Cephalus
Prayed unto Phebe, and to Phoebus
The night in length for to draw
So that he might do the law
In thylke point of loves best
which cleped is the nyghtes feste
with outen sleep of sluggardye
which Venus out of company
Has put awey, as thylke same
which lustles fer from game
In chamber does full often woe
A bed, whean it falls so
That love should ben awayted
But slouthe, which is evil affayted
with sleep has made his retenue
That what thing is to love due
Of all his debt he pays none
The wot not how the night is gone
Ne how the day is come about
But only for to sleep and route
Till high mydday, that he arise
But Cephalus did otherwise
As thou my son have herd above
My fader who that has his love
A bed naked by his side
And would than his eyes hyde
with sleep, I not what man is he
But certes as touchend of me
That fell me never yet er this
But other while when so is
That I may catch sleep on hand
Lyggend alone, than I fond
To dreme a merry sweuen or day
And if so fall, that I may
My thought with such a sweuen plese
Me think I am somdele at ese
For I none other comfort have
So needs naught that I shall crave
The Sons carte for to tarry
Ne yet the Moon, that she carye
Her course a long upon the heaven
For I am naught the more in even
Toward love in no degree
But in my sleep yete than I se
Somewhat in sweuen of that me lyketh
which afterward mine heart entryketh
when that I find it other wise
So wot I not of what service
That sleep to man's case does
My son certes thou say soth
But only that it helps kind
Sometime in Physyk as I find
when it is take by mesure
But he which can no sleep mesure
Upon the reule as it belongs
Fulofte of sodeyne chance he fongeth
Such infortune, that him greueth
But who these old books leueth
Of sompnolence how it is write
There may aman the sothe wit
If that he would ensample take
That other while is good to wake
whereof a tale in Poesye
I think for to specyfye
HIC loquitur in amoris causa contra istos, qui sompnolencie dediti, ea que
seruare tenentur, amittunt, Et narrat quod cum Io puella pulcherrima a Iunone
in vaccant transformata, et in Argi custodiam sic deposit fuisse superueniens
Mercurius Argum dormien tem occidit, vt ipsam vaccam a pastura rapiens, quo

Ouyde tells in his sawes
Hawe Jupiter by old days
Lay by a maid, which Io
was cleped, whereof that Juno
His wife was wroth, and the goddess
Of Io turned the likeness
In to a Cow to go there out
The large feldes all about
And get her mete upon the grene
And thereupon this high queen
Betoke her Argus for to keep
For he was seldon wont to sleep
And yet he had an hundred eyes
And all alyche well they syen
Now harken how that he was begiled
Mercurye, which was all affyled
This Cow to stele he came desguysed
And had a pype well devised
Upon the notes of musyke
whereof he might his eres like
And over that he had affayted
His lusty tales, and awayted
His time: and thus in to the field
He came, where Argus he beheld
with ^o, which beside him went
with that his pype anon he hent
And g^n to pype in his manner
Thyrge, which was slepy for to here
And in his pypynge ever among
He told him such a lusty song
That he the fool has brought a sleep
There was none eye that might keep
His head, which Mercurye of smote
And forth with all anon foot hot
He stale the cow, which Argus kept
And all this fell for that he slepte
Ensample it was to many mo
That mochel sleep does often woe
when it is time for to wake
For if a man this vice take
In sompnolence, and him delight
Men should upon his door write
His Epytaphe, and on his grave
For he to spylle, and naught to save
Is shaped, and though he were deed
For thy my son hold up thin head
And let no sleep thyn eye englue
But when it is to reason due
My fader as touchend of this
Right so as I you told, it is
That often a bed, when I should
I may not sleep, though I would
For love is ever fast byme
which takes none head of one time
For when I shall mine eyes close
Anon my heart he woll oppose
And hold his schole in such a wise
Tylle it be day that I arise
That selde it is when that I sleep
And thus fro sompnolence I keep
Mine eye, and for thy if there be
Ought else more in this degree
Now ask forth. My son yis
For sloth, which as mother is
The forth drawer and the Noryce
To man of many a dredful vice
Has yet another last of all
which many a man has made to fall
where that he might never arise
whereof for thou the shall auyse
Er thou so with thy self mysfare
what vice it is, I woll declare.
Nil fortuna inuat, vbi desperacio ledit.
Quo desiccat humor non viridescit humus
Magnanimus sed amor spe^ ponit, et inde salute^
Cousequitur, quod ei prospera fata fauent.
Hic loquitur super vltima specie accidie, que Trifticia sieve desperacio
dicitur, cuius obstinata condicio tocius consolacionis spem deponens ali cuius
remedii, quo liberari poterit, fortunam sibi euenire impossible credit.
when sloth does all that he may
To drive forth the long day
Tylle he become to the need
Than at last upon the deed
He looks how his time is lore
And is so woe begone therefore
That he within his thought conceiueth
Trystesse, and so him self deceyueth
That he wanhope brings inn
where is no comfort to begin
But every joy him is delayed
So that within his heart affrayed
A thousand time with one breath
wepende he wyssheth after death
when he fortune fynt adverse
For than he woll his hope rehearse
As though his world were all forlore
And says, alas that I was bore
How shall I live? how shall I do?
For now fortune is thus my foo
I wot well god me woll not help
what should I than of joy yelpe
where there no bote is of my care
So ouercast is my welfare
That I am shapen all to strife
Alas that I nere of this life
Er I be fullyche overtake
And thus he will his sorrow make
As god him might not avail
But yet ne woll he not travail
To help him self at such a need
But sloutheth under such a dread
which is affermed in his heart
Right as he might naught asterte
The worlds woe, which he is inn
Also when he is fall in sin
Him thinks he is so fer culpable
That god woll not be mercyable
So great a sin to foryeue
And thus he leueth to be shriue
And if a man in thilke throw
would him cou^seile, he would not know
The soth, though a man it find
For trystesse is of such a kind
That for to mayntene his folly
He has with him obstinacy
which is within of such a sloth
That be forsakes all the troth
And woll to no reason bow
And yet he can not allow
His own skylle, but of head
Thus dwyneth he, till he be deed
In hyndrynge of his own estate
For where a man is obstinate
wanhope falls at last
which may not long after last
Till sloth make of him an end
But god wot whyther he shall wend
My son and right in such manner
There be lovers of heavy chere
That sorowen more, than is need
when they be tarried of her speed
And can not them self read
But lesen hope for to speed
And stynten love to pursewe
And thus they faden hyde and hew
And lustles in her hertes wax
Hereof it is, that I would axe
If thou my son art one of tho
A good father it is so
Out take o point, I am beknowe
For else I am overthrow
In all that ever ye have seyde
My sorrow is evermore vnteyde
And secheth over all my veins
But for to counsel of my peynes
I can no bote do thereto
And thus withouten hope I go
So that my wits ben empeyred
And I am, as who says dispeyred
To win love of thilke sweet
without whom, I you behete
Mine heart, that is so bestadde
Right inly, never may be glad
For by my troth I shall not lie
Of pure sorrow, which I dry
For that she says she will me naught
with dretchynge of mine own thought
In such a wanhope I am fall
That I ne can uneaths call
As for to speak of any grace
My ladies mercy to purchase
But yet I say naught for this
That all in my defaute it is
That I am never yet instead
when time was, that I me bid
Ne said, and as I durst told
But never fond I, that she would
For ought she knew of mine intent
To speak a goodly word assent
And netheles this dare I say
That if a sinful would preye
To god of his foryeuenes
with half so great a business
As I have do to my lady
In lack of asking of mercy
He should never come in hell
And thus I may you sothly tell
Saufe only that I cry and bydde
I am in tristesse all amydde
And fulfilled of desperaunce
And thereof give me my penance
Mine holy father, as you lyketh
My son of that thyn heart syketh
with sorrow might thou not amend
Till love his grace woll the send
For thou thyn own cause empeirest
what time as thou thy self despeirest
I not what other thing avails
Of hope, when the heart fails
For such a sore is incurable
And eke the gods ben vengeable
And that a man may right well frede
These old books who so read
Of thing, which has befalle er this
Now here, of what ensample it is.
HIC narrat qualiter Iphis / regis Theucer filius eb amorem cuiusdam puelle
nomine Ara^arathen, qua^ neque donis aut precibus vin^^^ ^^tuit / de^perans
ante patris ipsius puelle (...) nectanter se suspendit, under dii commoti,
(...) ^nellum in lapidem durissimam transmut^^nt quam rex Theucer vna cu^ filio
suo apud S^^^num in Templo veneris pro perpetua (...) morta sepeliri et locari
fecit.
whylom by old days fer
Of Mo^e was the king Theucer
which had a knight to son Iphis
Of love and he so maistred is
That he has set all his courage
As to regard of his lygnage
Upon a maid of low estate
But though he were a potestate
Of worlds good, he was subject
To love, and put in such a plyte
That he excedeth the measure
Of reason, that him self assure
He can naught. For the more he praid
The less love on him she laid
He was with love unwise constreined
And she with reason was restreyned
The lusts of his heart he seweth
And she for dread, shame escheweth
And as she should, took good head
To save and keep her womanhede
And thus the thing stood in debate
Between his lust, and her estate
He yaue, he send, he spoke by mouth
But yet for ought that ever he couthe
Unto his speed he fond no weye
So that he cast his hope aweye
within his heart he began despeyre
Fro day to day, and so empeire
That he has lost all his delight
Of lust, of sleep, of appetyte
That he through strength of love lasseth
His wit, and reason ouerpasseth
As he which of his life ne rought
His death upon him self he sought
So that by night his weye he nam
There wist none, where he becam
The night was derke, there shone no moan
Tofore the gates he came sone
where that this young maid was
And with this woeful word, alas
His deadly pleyntes he began
So still, that there was no man
It herd: and than he said thus
O thou Cupyde, O thou Venus
Fortuned by whose ordinance
Of love, is every man's chance
Ye known all mine hole heart
That I ne may your hondes astert
On you is ever that I cry
And you deyneth not to plie
Ne toward me your ear enclyne
Thus for I se no medicine
To make an end of my quarele
My death shall be instead of hele
Ha thou my woeful lady dear
which dwell with thy father here
And slepest in thy bed at ease
Thou wotest nothing of my disease
How thou, and I be now unmeet
A lord, what sweuen shall thou mete?
what dremes have thou now on hand?
Thou slepest there, and I here stand
Though I no death to the deserve
Here shall I for thy love sterue
Here shall I a kings son dye
For love, and for no felonye
whether thou thereof have joy or sorrow
Here shall thou se me deed to morrow
O hard heart abouen all
This death, which shall to me fall
For that thou would not do my grace
It shall be told in many place
That I am deed for love and troth
In thy defaute, and in thy sloth
Thy danger shall to many mo
Ensample be for euermo
when they the woeful death record
And with that word he took a cord
with which upon the gate tree
He henge him self, that was pite.
The morrow came the night is gone
Men come out, and sygh anon
where that this young lord was deed
There was an house without read
For no man knew the cause why
There was weeping, there was cry
This maiden, when she it herd
And sigh this thing how it mysferde
Anon she wist what it meant
And all the cause how it went
To all the world she told it out
And preyeth to hem, that were about
To take of her the vengeance
For she was cause of thilke chance
why that this kings son is spylt
She takes upon her self the gilt
And is all ready to the pain
which any man her would ordeyne
But if any other would
She says, that her self she should
Do wreche with her own hand
Through out the world in every lord
That every life thereof shall speak
How she her self it should wreke
She wepeth, she cries, she swouneth often
She cast her eien up alofte
And said among full pitously
O god, thou wost that it am I
For whom Iphis is thus beseyne
Ordeyne so, that men may seyne
A thousand winter after this
How such a maiden did amys
And as I did, do to me
For I ne did no pite
To him, which for my love is lore
Do no pite to me therefore
And with this word she fell to ground
A swoune, and there she lay astounde
The gods, which her pleyntes herd
And sygh how woefully she ferde
Her life they took awey anon
And shopen her into a stone
After the form of her image
Of body both, and of visage
And for the marvel of this thing
Unto the place came the king
And eke the queen, and many mo
And when they wysten it was so
As I have told it here above
How that Iphis was dead for love
Of that he had be refused
They helden all men excused
And wondren upon the vengeance
And for to keep remembrance
This fair image maiden lyche
with company noble and rich
with torches, and great solempnite
To Salamyne the City
They lead and carry forth withal
This dead corpse, and seyne it shall
Beside thilke image have
His sepulture, and be begraue
This corpse and this image thus
In to the city to Venus
where that goddess her temple had
Together both two they ladde
This ilke image as for miracle
was set upon an high pinnacle
That all men it might know
And under that they maden low
A tomb rich for the nones
Of marble and eke of Iaspre stones
wherein that Iphis was beloken
That evermore it shall be spoken
And for men shall the sothe wit
They have her ephitaphe write
As thing, which should abide stable
The letters graven in a table
Of marble were, and said this
Here lies, which sloughe himself, Iphis
For love of Araxarathen
And in ensample of the women
That suffren men dyen so
Her form a man may seen also
How it is turned flesh and bone
In to the figure of a stone
He was to nesshe, and she to hard
Beware for thy here afterward
ye men and women both two
Ensampleth you of that was tho.
Lo thus my son as I the say
It greueth by diverse way
In dispeire a man to fall
which is the last branch of all
Of sleep, as thou have herd deuyse
whereof that thou thy self auyse
Good is er that thou be deceived
where that the grace of hope is weyued
My father how so that it stand
Now have I pleynly understand
Of stouthes court the properte
whereof touchende in my degree
For ever I think to beware
But over this so as I dare
with all mine heart I you beseech
That ye me would inform and teach
what there is more of your appryse
In love als well as otherwise
So that I may me clean shryue
My son while thou art alive
And have also thy full mind
Among the vices, which I find
There is yet one such of the seven
which all this world has set uneven
And causes many a wrong
where he the cause has vnderfonge
whereof hereafter thou shalt here
The form both, and the matere.
Explicit liber quartus.
Hic in quinto libro intendit Confessor tractare de auaritia, que omnium
malorum radix esse dicitur, necnon de eiusdem vicii speciebus, et primum ipsuis
auaritie naturam describit.

Incipit liber quintus.
Of ^^at auaricia naturae legibus, et quae
Largus amor poscit, strictius illa netat.
Om^^ quod est nimium, uiciosum dicitur auru^
Ve^^ia sicut oues seruat auarus opes.
Non decet, ut soli seruabitur aes, sed amori
Debet homo solam solus habere suam.
First when the high god began
This world, and that the kind of man
was fall into no great encre^
For worlds good was tho no pres
But all was set to the commune
They speken than of no fortune
Or for to lose or for to win
Till Avarice brought it in
And that was when the world was woxe
Of man, of horse, of sheep, of ox
And that men knewen the money
Tho went pees out of the wey
And werre came on every side
which all love leyde aside
And of common his propre made
So that instead of shouell and spade
The sharp sword was take on hand
And in this wise it came to land
whereof men made dyches deep
And high walls for to keep
The gold, which avarice encloseth
But all to little him supposes
Though he might all the world purchase
For what thing, that he may enbrace
Of gold, of catell, or of land
He let it never out of his hand
But get him more, and halt it fast
As though the world should ever last
So is he lyche unto the hell
For as these old books tell
what comes there in less or more
It shall depart neuermore
Thus when he has his cofer loken
It shall not after ben vnstoken
But when him list to have a sight
Of gold, how that it shyneth bright
That he thereon may look and muse
For otherwise he dare not use
To take his part or less or more
So is he poor, and ouermore
Him lacks, that he has enough
An ox draws in the plough
Of that him self has no profit
A sheep right in the same plyte
His wolle bears, but on a day
An other takes the flees away
Thus has he, that he naught ne has
For he thereof his part ne tath
To seye how such a man has good
who so that reasone understood
It is vnproperlyche said
That good has him, and halt him tayde
That he ne gladdeth naught withal
But is unto his good a thrall
And a subject thus serves be
where that he should master be
Such is the kind of thauarous
My son as thou art amorous
Tell if thou fare of love so
My father as it seems no
That auarous yet never I was
So as ye setten me the cas
For as ye tolden here above
In full possession of love
yet was I never here tofore
So that me thinks well therefore
I may excuse well my deed
But of my will withouten dread
If I that treasour might get
It should never be foryete
That I ne would it fast hold
Till god of love him selue would
That death us should depart a two
For leueth well, I soue her so
That even with mine own life
If I that sweet lusty wife
Might ones welden at my will
For ever I would hold her stille
And in this wise takes keep
If I her had, I would her keep
And yet no friday would I fast
Though I her keep and held fast
Fie on the bags in the ^^st
I had enough, if I her kyst
For certes if she were mine
I had her lever than a mine
Of gold: for all this worlds rich
Ne might me make so rich
As she that is so inly good
I set naught of other good
For might I get such a thing
I had a treasour for a king
And though I would it fast hold
I were than well behold
But I might pype now with less
And suffer that it over pass
Not with my will, for thus I would
Ben auorous if that I should
But father I herd you sey
How the auarous has yet some wey
whereof he may be glad. For he
May, when him list, his treasure se
And grope, and feel it all about
But I full often am shet theroute
There as my worthy tresour is
So is my life liche unto this
That ye me tolden here to fore
How that an ox his yoke has bore
For thing that should him not avail
And in this wise I me travail
For who that ever has the welfare
I wot well that I have the care
For I am had, and naught ne have
And am, as who says, loves (...)
Now deem in your own thought
If this be avarice or naught
My son I have of the no wonder
Though thou to serve be put under
with love, which to kind accords
But so as every book records
It is to kind no pleasaunce
That men above his sustenaunce
Unto the gold shall serve, and bow
For that may no reason auowe
But avarice netheles
If he may getten his encrees
Of gold, that would he serve and keep
For he takes of naught else keep
But for to fylle his bags large
And all is to him but a charge
For he ne parts naught withal
But keeps it, as servant shall
And thus though that he multiply
His gold, without treasorye
He is, for man is naught amended
with gold, but if it be dispended
To man's use, whereof I read
A tale, and take thereof good head
Of that befelle by old tide
As tells us the clerk Ouyde.
HIC loquitur contra istos auaros, of narrai qualiter Mida rex Frigie Cillenu^
Baccbi sacerdotem, quem rustici vinculis ferreis alligarunt, dissoluit, et in
hospiciu^ suu^ benignissime recollegit: pro quo Bacchus quodcunque munus rex
exigere vellei, donari co^cessit. Vnde rex auatitia ductus / vt quicquid
tangeret, in aurum conuerteretur, indiscrete petiit.
Bacchus, which is the god of wine
Accordant unto his divine
A pressed, the which Cillenus hight
He had, and fell so, that by night
This pressed was drunk, and goth a strayde
whereof the men were evil apayde
In Frygelonde, where as he went
But at last a chorle him hent
with strength of other felaushyp
So that upon his drunkeshyp
They bounden him with cheynes fast
And forth they lad him also fast
Unto the king, which hight Myde
But he that would his vice hyde
This curtois king took of him head
And bad, that men should him led
In to a chamber for to keep
Till he of leyser had sleep
And thus this pressed was sone unbound
And upon a couche fro the ground
To sleep he was leyde soft enough
And wha^ he woke, the king him drough
To his presence, and did him chere
So that this priest in such manner
while that him likes, there he dwells
And all this he to Bacchus tells
when that he came to him again
And when that Bacchus hard seyne
How Myde has done his curtesy
Him thinks, it were a vilanie
But he reward him for his deed
So as he might of his godhede
Unto this king this god appears
And clepeth, and that other hereth
This god to Myde thonketh fair
Of that he was so debonayre
Toward his pressed, and had him seye
what thing it were, he would preye
He should it have of worlds good
This king was glad, and stylle stood
And was of his asking in doubt
And all the world he casts about
what thing was best for his astate
And with him self stood in debate
Upon three points, which I find
Ben leuest unto man's kind
The first of hem it is delight
The two ben worship and profit
And than he thought, if that I crave
Delight, though I delight may have
Delight shall passen in my age
That is no syker advantage
For every joy bodily
Shall end in woe, delight for thy
woll I not chese, and if I worship
Ask, and of the world lordshyp
That is an occupation
Of proud imagination
which makes an heart vain within
There is no certain for to win
For lord and knave is all one wey
when they be bore, and when they dey
And if I profit ask would
I^ not in what manner I should
Of worlds good have sykernes
For every these upon richesse
Awayteth, for to rob and stele
Such good is cause of harms feel
And also though a man at ones
Of all the world within his wones
The treasour might have every dele
yet had he but one man's dele
Toward him self, so as I think
Of clothing, and of meat and drink
For more out take vanite
There has no lord in his degree
And thus upon these points diverse
Dyuersly he began reherce
what point him thought for the best
But plainly for to get him rest
He can no syker way cast
And netheles yet at last
He fell upon the couetyse
Of gold, and than in sundry wise
He thought, as I have said tofore
How treasour may be soon lore
And had an inly great desire
Touchende of such recover
How that he might his cause avail
To get him gold withouten fail
within his heart and thus he preyseth
The gold, and faith, how that he peyseth
Abouen all other metal most
The gold, he says, may led an host
To make werre ayene the king
The gold put under all thing
And set it when him list above
The gold can make of hate love
And werre of pees: and right of wrong
And long to short, and short to long
without gold may be no fest
Gold is the lord of man and best
And may hem both bye and selle
So that a man may sothely tell
That all the world to gold obeys
For thy this king to Bacchus preyth
To grant him gold, but he excedeth
Mesure, more than him needs
Men tellen, that the maladye
which cleped is hydropsye
Resembled is unto this vice
By way of kind of Auaryce
The more hidropsy drynketh
The more him thrsteth: for him thinks
That he may never drink his fylle
So that there may no thing fulfylle
The lusts of his appetyte
And right in such a manner plyte
Stant ever Auaryce, and ever stood
The more he has of worlds good
The more he would it keep streyte
And ever more and more coueyte
And right in such condycion
without good discrecyon
This king with Auaryce is smitte
That all the world it might wit
For he to Bacchus than preyd
That thereupon his hand he leyd
It should through his touch anon
Become gold, and thereupon
This god him grants, as he badde
Tho was this king of Fryge glad
And for to put it in assaye
with all the have that he may
He touches that, he touches this
And in his hond all gold it is
The stone, the tree, the leef, the gras
The flower, the fruit all gold it was
Thus touches he, while he may last
To go: but honger at last
Him took so, that he mote need
By wey of kind his honger feed
The cloth was leyd, the board was set
And all was forth tofore him set
His dyssh, his cup, his drynk, his meet
But when he would or drink or ete
Anon as it his mouth came nyghe
It was all gold, and than he syghe
Of Auaryce the folly
And he with that byganne to cry
And preyde Bacchus to foryeue
His gylt, and suffer him for to live
And be such, as he was tofore
So that he were naught forlore
This god which herd of this greuaunce
Took routhe wpon his repentance
And had him go forth redyly
Unto a flood was fast by
which Paceole than hight
In which als fast as ever he might
He should him wasshe ouerall
And said him than that he shall
Recover his first astate ageyn
This king right as he herd seyn
In to the flood goth fro the land
And wesshe him both foot and hond
And so forth all the remenaunte
As him was set in covenant
And than he sygh meruayles strange
The flood his color began to change
The grauel with the small stones
To gold they torn both attones
And he was quyte of that he had
And thus fortune his chance ladde
And when he sygh his touch awey
He goth him home the right wey
And lives forth as he did er
And put all auaryce a fer
And the riches of gold despyseth
And seith, that mete and cloth suffyseth
Thus has this king experyence
How fools done the reverence
To gold, which of his own kind
Is less worth than is the rynde
To sustenaunce of mars fode
And than he made laws good
And all his thing set upon skylle
He bid his people for to tylle
Her land, and live under the law
And that they should also forth draw
Bestayl, and seche none encrees
Of gold, which is the breche of pees
For this a man may find write
To fore the time, er gold was smite
In coygne, that men the floren knew
There was well nyhe noman untrue
Tho was there shield ne spear
Ne dedely wepen for to here
Tho was the town withouten wall
which now is closed over all
Tho was there no brocage in land
which now takes every cause on hond
So may men know, how the florayn
was mother first of malengyn
And brynger in of all werre
whereof this word stant out of herre
Through the counseyl of auaryce
which of his own propre vice
Is as the hell wonderful
For it may neuermore be full
That what as ever comes therynne
A wey ne may it never win
But son mine do thou not so
Let all such auaryce go
And take thy part of that thou have
I hyd not that thou do wast
But hold largess in his mesure
And if thou se a creature
which through pouert is fall in need
Yeu^ him sum good: for this I read
To him that wol not yeuen here
what pain he shall have else where
There is a peyn among all
Benethe in hell, which men call
The woeful pain of Tantaly
Of which I shall the redely
Deuyse how men therein stand
In hell thou shall understand
There is a flood of thylke office
which serves all for auaryce
what man that stond shall therein
He stant up even to the chynne
Above his head also there hongeth
A fruit, which to that pain longs
And that fruit touches ever in one
His ouerlyppe, and thereupon
Such thirst and honger him affayleth
That never his appetyte ne fails
But when he would his honger feed
The fruit withdraws him at need
And though he heue his head on high
The fruit is ever alyche nygh
So is the honger well the more
And also though him thurst sore
And to the water bow a down
The flood in such condycion
Aualeth, that his drink areche
He may not, lo now which a wreche
That mete and drink is him so couth
And yet there comes none in his mouth
Lyche to the peynes of this flood
Stant Auaryce in worlds good
He has enough, and yet him needs
For his scarcenes it him forbedeth
And ever his honger after more
Trauayleth him alyche sore
So is he peyned ouerall
For thy thy goods forth withal
My son look thou dyspende
whereof thou might thy self amend
Both here, and eke in other place
And also if thou wolte purchase
To be beloved, thou must use
Largess: for if thou refuse
To give for thy loves sake
It is no reason that thou take
Of love, that thou would crave
For thy if thou wolte grace have
Be gracious and do largess
Of Auaryce, and the sickness
Eschew above all other thing
And take insample of Myde the king
And of the flood of hell also
where is enough of all woe
And though there were no matere
But only that we fynden here
Men ought Auaryce eschew
For what man thylke vice sewe
He get him self but little rest
For how so that the body rest
The heart upon the gold trauayleth
whom many a nyghtes dread assayleth
For though he ligge a bed naked
His heart is evermore awaked
And dremeth, as he lies to sleep
How besy that he is to keep
His tresour, that no these it stele
Thus has he but a woeful well
And right so in the same wise
If thou thy self wolt well auyse
There be lovers of such inow
That wol unto reason bow
If so be they come above
when they ben masters of her love
And that they shulden be most glad
with love, they ben most bestadde
So fayn they would it holden all
That her heart, her eye is ouerall
And wenen every man be thief
To stele awey that hem is lefe
Thus through her own fantasye
They fallen in to Ielousye
Than has the ship to brok his cable
with every wind and is meuable
My fader for that ye now tell
I have herd ofttyme tell
Of Ielousye, but what it is
yet understood I never or this
wherefore I would you beseech
That ye me would inform and teache
what manner thing it might be.
My son that is hard to me
But netheles as I have herd
Now herke^, and thou shall be a^swerd.
Nota de Zelotipia, cuius fantastica suspicio amorem quemuis fidelissimum
multociens sine causa corruptum imaginatur.
Among the men lack of manhod
In marriage upon wishode
Makes that a man him self deceives
whereof it is, that he conceyueth
That ylke vnesy maladye
The which is cleped Ielousye
Of which if I the propyrte
Shall tell, after the nycete
So as it worcheth on a man
A fever it is cotidian
which every day wol come about
where so a man be in or out
At home if that a man wol won
This fever is than of common won
Most grievous in a man's eye
For than he makes him tote and prye
where so as ever his love go
She shall not with her little to
My step, but he sees it all
His eye is walkend ouerall
where that she sing, or that she dau^ce
He sees the lest countenance
If she look on a man a side
Or with him rowne at any tide
Or that she laugh, or that she loure
His eye is there at every hour
And when it draws to the night
If she than be without light
Anon is all the game shente
For than he set his parlyament
To speak it when he comes to bed
And says: if I were now to wed
I would never have wife
And so he torneth in to strife
The lust of loves dute
And al upon dyuersyte
If she be fresshe, and well arrayed
He says her baner is dysplayed
To clepe in gestes by the way
And if she be not well heseye
And that her list not to be glad
He bears on hand that she is mad
And loves not her husbonde
He says, he may well understand
That if she would his company
She should than before his eye
Show all the plesyre, that she might
So that by day ne by night
She not what thing is for the best
But lives out of all rest
For what as ever him list to seyn
She dare not speak o word ageyn
But wepeth, and holt her lyppes close
She may well write, Sance repose
The wife, which is to such one married
Of all women be he waryed
For with his fever of Ielousye
His each days fantasye
Of sorrow is ever alyche grene
So that there is no love seen
while that him list at home abide
And when so is he woll out ride
Than has he ready his aspye
Abiding in her company
A iangler, an evil mouthed one
That she ne may no whether gone
Ne speak one word, ne ones look
But he ne wol it wend, and croke
And torn after his own intent
Though she no thing but honor me^t
wha^ that the lord comes hom again
The iangler must somewhat seyn
So what without and what withinne
This fever is ever to begin
For where he comes, he can not end
Till death of him has made an end
For though so be, that he ne here
Ne se, ne wit in no manner
But all honor and womanhede
Thereof the Ielous takes none head
But as a man to love unkind
He cast his stafe and as the blind
And fynt defaulte, where is none
As who so dremeth on a stone
How he is leyde, and groneth often
when he lies on his pylowe soft
So is there naught but strife and chest
when love should make his fest
It is great thing if he her kiss
Thus has she lost the nyghtes bliss
For at such time he grutcheth ever
And bears on hand, there is a lever
That she would another were
Instead of him abedde there
And with tho words, and with mo
Of Ielousye, he torneth her fro
And lies upon that other side
And she with that draws her aside
And there she wepeth all the night
A to what pain she is dyght
That in her youth has so beset
The bond, which may not ben vnknet
I wot the time is often cursed
That ever was the gold vnpursed
The which was laid upon the book
when that all other she forsook
For love of him, but all to late
She pleyneth: for as than algate
She mote forbere, and to him bow
Though he ne woll it naught allow
For man is lord of thylke feyre
So may the woman but empeyre
If she speak ought ageyn his will
And thus she beryth her pain stylle
But if this Fever a woman take
She shall be well more hard shake
For though she both se and here
And find, that there is no matter
She dare but to her self pleyne
And thus she suffers double pain
Lo thus my son, as I have write
Thou might of Ielousye wit
His fever, and his condycyon
which is full of suspectyon
But whereof that this fever grows
who so these old books troweth
There may he find how it is
For they us teache, and tell this
How that this fever of Ielousye
Somdel it grows of sotye
Of love, and somdele of untrust
For as a sekman lest his lust
And when he may no sauoure get
He hates than his own mete
Right so this feuerous malady
which caused is of fantasye
Makes the Ielous in feeble plyte
To lose of love his appetyte
Through feyned informacyon
Of his ymaginacyon
But finally to taken head
Men may well make a lykelyhede
Between him, which is auarous
Of gold, and him that is Ielous
Of love: in o degree
They stand both, as seems me
That one would have his bags still
And naught departen with his will
And dare not for the thieves sleep
So feign he would his treasour keep
That other may not well be glad
For evermore he is adrad
Of these lovers, that gone about
In aunter, if they put him out
So have they both little joy
As well of love, as of money
Now have thou son of my techynge
Of Ielousy a knowlechynge
That thou might understand this
Fro whance he comes, and what he is
And eke to whom that he is like
Beware for thy thou be not syke
Of thylke fever, as I have spoke
For it woll in him self be wroke
For love hates no thing more
As men may find by the lore
Of hem, that whylom were wise
How that they speak in many wise
My fader sothe is that ye seyn
But for to look there again
Before this time how it is fall
whereof there might ensample fall
To such men as ben Ielous
In what manner it is grievous
Right fayn I would ensample here
My good son at thy prayere
Of such ensamples as I find
So as they comen now to mind
Upon this point of time agone
I think for to tellen one.
HIC ponit Confessor exemplum contra istos maritos, quos Zelotipia maculauit,
Et narrat qualiter Vulganus cuius vxor Venus extitit, suspecione^ inter ipsa^
and Marte^ co^cipie^s eoru^ gestus dilige^tins explorabat, Vnde co^tigit, quod
cu^ ipse quada^ vice ambos inter se pariter amplexantes in lecto nudos inuenit,
et exclamans omnem cetum deorum et dearu^ ad tantum spectaculum conuocauit /
super quo tamen derisum pocius quam remedium a tota cohorte consecutus est.
Ouyde wrote of many things
Among the which, in his wrytynges
He told a tale in poesye
which touches unto Ielousye
Upon a certain cas of love
Among the gods al above
It fell at thylke time thus
The god of fire, which Vulganus
Is hot, and has a craft forth with
Assygned for to be the smyth
Of Jupiter, and his figure
Both of vysage and of stature
Is lothly, and malgracyus
But yet he has within his house
As for the liking of his life
The fair Venus to his wife
But Mars, which of bataylles is
The god, an eye had unto this
As he which was chyualrous
It fell him to ben amorous
And thought it was great pity
To se so lusty one as she
Be coupled with so lourd a wight
So that his pain day and night
He did, if he her win might
And she that had a good insyght
Toward so noble a knyghtly lord
In love fell of his acorde
There lacks naught but time and place
That he nys sycker of her grace
But when two hertes fallen in one
So wise a wait was never none
That at sometime they ne mete
And thus this fair lusty sweet
with Mars has often company
But thylke unkind Ielousye
which evermore the heart opposes
Makes Vulcanus, that he supposes
That it is not well ouerall
And to him self he said, he shall
Aspye better, if that he may
And so it fell upon a day
That he this thing so slyghtly led
He fond hem both two a bed
All warm, echone with other naked
And he with craft all ready maked
Of strong cheynes has hem bound
As he togeder hem had found
And left hem both lygge so
And began to clepe and cry tho
Unto the gods all about
And they assembled in a route
Come all at ones for to se
But none amends had he
But was rebuked here and there
Of hem, that loves friends were
And sayden that he was to blame
For if there fell him any shame
It was through his mysgouernaunce
And thus he lost contenaunce
This god, and let his cause fall
And they to scorn him laughen all
And losen Mars out of his hondes
whereof these erthely husbondes
For ever might ensample take
If such a chance hem overtake
For Vulcanus his wife bewrayd
The blame upon him self he laid
whereof his shame was the more
which ought for to ben a lore
For every man, that lives here
To reulen him in this matere
Though such an hap of love asterte
yet should he not apoynte his heart
with Ielousy of that is wrought
But feyne, as though he wist it naught
For if he let it over pass
The sklaunder shall be well the less
And he the more in ese stand
For this thou might well understand
That where a man shall needs lose
The less harm is for to chese
But Ielousye of his vntryst
Makes that full many an harm aryste
which ciles should not arise
And if a man would him auyse
Of that befelle to Vulcanus
Him ougth of reason think thus
That sith a god was thereof shamed
w^^ should an erthyly man be blamed
T^ take upon him such a vice
For thy my son in thine office
Beware, that thou be naught Ielous
which often time has shent the house
My fader this ensample is hard
How such thing to the heuenward
Among the gods might fall
For there is but o god of all
which is the lord of heaven and hell
But if it like you to tell
How such gods come aplace
y^ might mochel thank purchase
For I shall be well taught withal
My son it is thus ouerall
with hem, that stonden mysbyleued
That such gods ben byleued
In sundry place, in sundry wise
Among hem, which be unwise
There is bytaken of credence
whereof that I the dyfference
In the manner, as it is writ
Shall do the plainly for to wit.
Mentibus illusis signantur templa deorum
Vnde deos caecos nacio caeca colit.
Nulla creaturi racio facit esse creatum
Equiparans quod ad huc Iura pagana fouent.
Quia secundum poetarum fabulas in huinsmodi lib elli locis quampluribus nomina

clarius innotescat / intendit de ipsorum origin secundum varias pagana rum

Er Christ was bore among us here
Of the byleues, that tho were
In four forms thus it was
They of Chaldee, as in this cas
Had a believe by hem selue
which stood upon the signs twelve
Forth eke with the planites seven
which as they syghen upon the heaven
Of sundry constellacion
In her ymaginacion
with sundry kerse and portrature
They made of gods the figure
In thelementes, and eke also
They hadden a believe tho
And all was that unreasonable
For the elements ben seruysable
To man: And often of accidence
As men may se the experience
They ben corrupt by sundry weye
So may no man's reason seye
That they ben god in any wise
And eke of men hem well auyse
The son and move eclipsen both
That be hem lef, or be hem loath
They suffer, and what thing is posyble
To ben a god is inpossyble
These elements ben creatures
So ben these heavenly fygures
whereof may well be iustyfyed
That they may not be defied
And who that takes away the honor
which due is to the creator
And yeueth it to the creature
He does to great a forfayture
But of Chald^^ netheles
Upon this feyth though it be less
They hold affermed the creaunce
So that of hell the penance
As folk, which stant out of believe
They shall receive, as we believe.
Of the Caldens so in this wise
Stant the believe out of assise
But in Egypt worste of all
The faith is false, how so it fall
For they diverse beasts there
Honor, as though they gods were
And nethelesse yet forth withal
Three gods most in special
They have forth with a goddess
In whom is all her sykernesse
Tho gods be yet cleped thus
Orus, Typhon, and Isirus
They were brethren all three
And the goddess in her degree
Her sister was, and Isis hight
whom Isirus forlay by night
And held her after as his wife
So it befelle, that upon strife
Typhon has Isire his brother slain
which had a child, to son O rain
And he his fathers death to heart
So took, that it may naught asterte
That he Typhon after ne slough
when he was ripe of age enough
But yet the Egiptiens trow
For all this error, which they know
That these brethren ben of might
To set and keep Egypt upright
And overthrow, if that hem like
But Isis, as seith the cronyke
Fro Greece in to Egypt came
And she than upon hand nam
To teach hem for to sow and ere
which no man knew tofore there
And when the Egyptiens sye
The feldes full before her eye
And that the land began to greyne
which whylom had be bareyne
For the earth bare after the kind
His due charge, this I find
That she of herth the goddess
Is cleped, so that in distress
The women thereupon childynge
To her clepe, and her offrynge
They beren, when that they ben light
Lo how Egypt all out of sight
Fro reason stant in mysbeleue
For lack of lore as I believe.
De secta Grecorum.
Among the greeks out of the weye
As they that reason put aweye
There was, as the cronyke says
Of mysbeleue an other faith
That they her gods, and goddesses
As who says token all to gesses
Of such as weren full of vice
To whom they made sacrifice
NOTA qualiter Saturnus deorum summus appellatur.
The high god, so as they said
To whom they worship laid
Saturnus hight, and king of Crete
He had be, But of his sete
He was put down, as he which stood
In frenesye, and was so wood
That fro his wife, which Rea hight
His own children he to plight
And ete hem of his commune won
But Jupiter, which was his son
And of full age his father bond
And kyt of with his own hand
His genitalles, which also fast
In to the deep see he cast
whereof the greeks afferme and seye
Thus, when they were cast awey
Came Venus forth by weye of kind
And of Saturn also I find
How afterward in to an isle
This Jupiter him did exile
where that he stood in great mischief
Lo which a god they maden chief
And sythen that such one was he
which stood most high in his degree
Among the gods, thou might know
These other, that been more low
Ben little worth, as it is found
Jupiter deus deliciarum.
For Jupiter was the second
which Juno had unto his wife
And yet a lechour all his life
He was, and in auoutrie
He wrought many a treachery
And for he was so full of vices
They cleped him god of delyces
Of whom if thou wolte more wit
Ouyde the poet has write
But yet her sterres both two
Saturn and Iupyter also
They have, although they be^ to blame
Attytled to her own name.
Mars was an other in that law
The which in Dace was forth draw
Of whom the clerk Vegetius
wrote in his book, and told thus
How he in to Italy came
And such fortune there he nam
That he a maiden has oppressed
which in her order was professed
As she, which was the prioresse
In Vestes temple the goddess
So was she well the more to blame
Dame Ilya this lady name
Men clepe, and eke she was also
The kings daughter, that was tho
which Mynitor by name hight
So that ayene the laws right
Mars thilke time upon her that
Remus and Romulus begat
which after, when they come in age
Of knyghthode, and of vassellage
Italy all holle they overcome
And founden the great Rome
In arms and of such emprise
They weren, that in thilke wise
Her father Mars for the marvel
The god is cleped of battle
They weren his children both two
Through hem he took his name so
There was none other cause why
And yet a sterre upon the sky
He has unto his name applied
In which that he is signified
And other god they hadden eke
To whom for counsel they beseke
The which was brother to Venus
Apollo men him clepe thus
He was an hunt upon the hills
There was with him no virtue else
whereof that any books carpe
But only that he couth harp
which when he walked over land
Full often time he took on hand
To get him with his sustenance
For lack of other purueance
And otherwhile of his falsehede
He feyneth him to conne a read
Of thing, which afterward should fall
whereof among his sleyghtes all
He has the leude folk deceived
So that the better he was received
Lo now through what creacion
He has deifycacion
And cleped is the god of wit
To such as be the fools yet.
An other god, to whom they sought
Mercury hight, and him ne rought
what thing he stale, ne whom ne slough
Of sorcerye he couthe enough
That wha^ he would him self tra^sforme
Full often time he took the form
Of woman, and his own left
So did he well the more theft
A great speker in all things
He was also, and of lesynges
An author, that men wysten none
An other such as he was one
And yet they maden of this thief
A god, which was unto hem lefe
And cleped him in tho beleues
The god of marchantes, and of thieves
But yet a sterre upon the heaven
He has of planettes seven
But Vulcanus, of whom I spoke
He had a courbe upon the back
And thereto he was hyppe halte
Of whom thou understand shall
He was a shrewe in all his youth
And he none other virtue couth
Of craft to help him self with
But only that he was smyth
with Jupiter, which in his forge
Diverse things made him forge
So wot I not for what desire
They clepen him the god of fire.
King of Cecile Hypolitus
A son had, and Eolus
He hight, and of his fathers grant
He held by wey of covenant
The governance of every isle
which was longende unto Sicyle
Of hem that fro the land foreyn
Lay upon the wind all pleyne
And fro thilke isles in to the land
Full often came the wind to bond
And after the name of him for thy
The wyndes cleped Eoly
They were, and be the god of wind
Lo now how this believe is blind.
The king of Crete Iupyter
The same, which I spoke of er
Unto his brother, which Neptune
was hot, it list him to commune
Part of his good, so that by ship
He made him strong of the lordshyp
Of all the sea in tho parties
where that he wrought his tirrannyes
And the strange yles about
He wan, that every man has doubt
Upon his march for to sail
For he anon hem would assail
And rob, what thing that they ladde^
His saufe conduit, but if they hadden
whereof the commen voice aroos
In every land, that such a loos
He caught, all nere it worth a stre
That he was cleped of the sea
The god by name, and yet he is
with hem, that so believe amys
This Neptune eke, was thilke also
which was the first founder tho
Of noble Troy, and he for thy
was well the more let by
The loresman of the shepeherdes
And eke of hem that netherdes
was of Archade, and hight Pan
Of whom has spoke many a man
For in the wodde of Nouarigne
Enclosed with the trees of pygne
And on the mount of Parysie
He had of beasts the bailye
And eke beneth the valeye
where thilke river, as men may seye
(which Ladon hight) made his course
He was the chief of governors
Of hem, that kepten tame beasts
whereof they maken yet the feasts
In the city of Stymphalydes
And forth withal yet netheles
He taught men the forth drawing
Of bestayle, and eke the making
Of oxen, and of horse the same
How men hem should ride and tame
Of fowls eke, so as we find
Full many a subtyle craft of kind
He fond, which no man knew tofore
Men did him worship eke therefore
That be the first in thylke land
was, which the melody fond
Of reeds, when they weren ripe
with double pypes, for to pype
Thereof he yafe the first lore
Till afterward men couth more
To every craft of man's help
He had a ready wit to help
Through natural experience
And thus the nice reverence
Of fools, when that he was deed
The foot was turned to the head
And clepen him god of nature
For so they maden his figure
An other god, so as they feel
which Jupiter upon Semele
Begatte in his auoutrie
whom for to hyde his lechery
That none thereof shall take keep
In a mountain for to keep
which Dyon hight, and was in Jude
He sent, in books as I find
And he by name Bacchus hight
which afterward, when that he might
A wastor was, and all his rent
In wine and bordell he dispent
But yet all were he wonder bad
Among the greeks a name be bad
They cleped him the god of wine
And thus a glotton was divine.
There was yet Esculapius
A god in thilke time as thus
His craft stood upon surgerie
But for the lust of lechery
That he to Daires donghter drough
It fell, that Jupiter him slough
And yet they made him naught for thy
A god, and wist no cause why
In Rome, he was long time so
A god among the Romans tho
For as he said of his presence
There was distroyed a pestylence
when they to the isle of Delphos went
And that Apollo with him sent
This Esculapius his son
Among the Romans for to won
And there he dwelte for a while
Till afterward in to that isle
Fro when he came, ayene he tourneth
where all his life that he soiourneth
Among the greeks, till that he deyde
And they upon him than leyde
His name, and god of medicyne
He hatte, after that ilke line.
An other god of Hercules
They made, which was netheles
A man, but that he was so strong
In all this world that broad and long
So mighty was no man, as he
Meruayles twelve in his degree
As it was couth in sundry lands
He did with his own hondes
^geyne geauntes and monsters both
The which horrible were and loath
But he with strength hem ouercam
whereof so great a price he nam
That they him clepe among all
The god of strength, and to him call
And yet there is no reason inn
For he a man was full of sin
which proved was upon his end
For in a rage him self he brende
And such a cruel man's deed
Accords nothing with godhede.
They had of gods yet an other
which Pluto hight, and was the brother
Of Jupiter, and he for youth
with every word, which came to mouth
Of any thing, when he was wroth
He would swear his common oath
By Lethen, and Phlegeton
By Cochetus, and Acheron
The which after the books tell
Ben the chief floodes of hell
By Segne, and Styge be swore also
That been the deep pyttes two
Of hell, the most principal
Pluto these oaths over all
Swore, of his common customaunce
Till it befelle upon a chance
That he for Iupyters sake
Unto the gods let do make
A sacrifice, and for that deed
One of the pyttes for his mede
In hell, of wiche I spoke of er
was granted him / and thus be there
Upon the fortune of this thing
The name took of hell king
Lo these gods, and well mo
Among the greeks they had tho
And of goddesses many one
whose names thou shall here anon
And in what wise they deceyuen
The foles, which her feith receyuen.
Matter dearum.
So as Saturn is sovereign
Of false gods, as they said
So is Cybele of goddesses
The mother, whom without gesses
The folk preyn, honor, and serve
As they, the which her law observe
But for to known upon this
Fro when she came, and what she is
Berecynthia the country hight
where she came first to man's sight
And after was Saturnus wife
By whom three children in her life
She bare, and they were cleped tho
Juno, Neptunus, and Pluto
The which of nyce fantasye
The people would deifye
And for her children were so
Cybele than was also
Made a goddess, and they her call
The mother of the gods all
So was that name bore forth
And yet the cause is little worth
A voice unto Saturn told
How that his own son him should
Out of his reygne put away
And he because of thilke wey
That him was shape such an hate
Cybele his wife began to hate
And eke her progenye both
And thus while that they were wroth
By Philyra upon a day
In his auoutrie he lay
On whom he Jupiter begat
And thilke child, was after that
which wrought all that was prophesied
As it tofore is specified
So when that Iupyter of Crete
was king, a wife unto him mete
The daughter of Cybele be took
And that was Juno, says the book
Of his deifycation
After the false opinion
That have I told, so as they mean
And for this Juno was the queen
Of Jupiter, and sister eke
The fools unto her seek
And seyn, that she is the goddess
Of reigns both, and of richesse
And eke she, as they understand
The water Nymphs has in hand
To leaden at her own best
And when her list the sky tempest
The reynbowe is her messagere
Lo which a mysbeleue is here
That she goddess is of the sky
I wot none other cause why
An other goddess is Mynerue
To whom the greeks obey and serve
And she was nygh the great lay.
Of Triton found, where she lay
A child for cast, but what she was
There knew no man the soth cas
But in Affrike she was leyde
In the manner as I have seyde
And carried from that ilke place
Into an isle far in Trace
The which Pallene than hight
where a norice her kept and dyght
And after for she was so wise
That she fond first in her auyse
The cloth making of woll and line
Men sayden, that she was deuyne
And the goddess of sapience
They clepen her in that credence
Of the goddess / which Pallas
Is cleped, sundry speech was
One says her father was Pallaunt
which in his time was a geaunt
A cruel man, a bataylous
An other says, how in his house
She was the cause why he deyde
And of this Pallas some eke said
That she Martes wife was, and so
Among the men that were tho
Of mysbeleue in the riot
The goddess of battle she hot
was, and yet she bears the name
Now look how they be for to blame.
Saturnus after his exile
Fro Crete came in great perile
Into the lands of Itayle
And there he did great marvel
whereof his name dwells yet
For he fond of his own wit
The first craft of plough tyllynge
Of earynge, and of corn sowynge
And how men should set vynes
And of the grapes make wines
All this he taught, and it fell so
His wife, the which came with him tho
was cleped Ceres by name
And for she taught also the same
And was his wife that ilke throw
As it was to the people know
They made of Ceres a goddess
In whom her tylthes yet they bless
And sayen that Triptolemus
Her son goth among us
And makethe the corn good chepe ordere
Right as her list from year to year
So that this wife, because of this
Goddess of corn cleped is.
King Jupiter, which his likynge
whylom fulfilled in all thing
So pryuelyche about he ladde
His lust, that be his will had
Of Latona, and on her that
Dyane his daughter he begat
Unknown of his wife Juno
But afterward she knew it so
That Latona for dread fled
Into an isle, where she hyd
Her womb, which of child aroos
Thylke isle was cleped Deloos
In which Dyana was forth brought
And kept so, that her lacks naught
And after when she was of age
She took none head of marriage
But out of man's company
She took her all to venerye
In foreste and in wilderness
For there was all her business
By day, and eke by nyghtes tide
with arowes broad under the side
And bow in hand, of which she slough
And took, all that her list enough
Of beasts, which ben chaceable
whereof the cronyke of this fable
Says, that the gentyls most of all
worship her, and to her call
And the goddess of high hills
Of grene trees, of fresshe wells
They clepen her, in that believe
which that no reason may acheue.
Proserpina which daughter was
Of Ceres, befelle this cas
while she was dwelling in Cecyle
Her mother in that ilke while
Upon her blessing, and her hest
Bad, that she should ben honest
And s^re for to weaue and spynne
And dwell at home, and keep her inn
But she cast all that lore aweye
And as she went her out to pleye
To gather flowers in a plain
And that was under the mountain
Of Ethna, fell the same tide
Than Pluto came the way ride
And suddenly, er she was ware
He took her up into his chare
And as they ryden in the field
Her great beauty he beheld
which was so pleasant in his eye
That for to hold in company
He wedded her, and held her so
To ben his wife for euermo
And as thou have tofore herd tell
How he was cleped god of belle
So is she cleped the goddess
Because of him ne more ne less
Lo thus my son, as I the told
The greeks whylom by days old
Her gods had in sundry wise
And through the lore of her appryse
The Romans held eke the same
And in worship of her name
To every god in special
They made a temple forth withal
And eke of her years day
Attytled had, and of array
The temples weren than ordained
And eke the people was constreyned
To come and done her sacrifyce
The priests eke in her office
Solemn made thylke feasts
And thus the greeks like to beasts
That men instead of god honor
which might naught hem self socour
while that they were alive here
And over this as thou shall here
The greeks (fulfilled of fantasy)
Said eke, that of the hills hye
The gods ben in special
But of her name in general
They hoten all Satiry
There ben of nymphs properly
In the believe of hem also
O reads they sayden tho
Attytled ben to the montaynes
And for the woddes in demeynes
To keep, tho ben Dryades
Of fresshe wells Naiades
And of the nymphs of the sea
I find a tale in properte
How Dorus whilom king of greece
which had of infortune a piece
His wife forth with his daughter all
So as the happes should fall
with many a gentylwoman there
Dreynt in the salt see they were
whereof the greeks that time sayden
And such a name upon hem layden
Nereydes that they ben hot
The nymphs which that they note
To reygne upon the stremes salt
Lo now if this believe halt
But of the nymphs as they tell
In every place where they dwell
They ben all ready obeysaunt
^s damoyselles attendaunt
To tho gods, whose seruyse
They mote obey in all wise
whereof the greeks to hem beseke
with them that been goddesses eke
And have in hem a great credence
And yet without experience
Saufe only of illusyon
which was to hem dampnacion
For men also that were deed
They hadden gods as I read
And tho by name Manes hyghten
To who^ full great honor they dyghten
So as the greeks law says
which was ayene the right feyth
Thus have I told a great party
But all the holle progeny
Of gods in that ilke time
To long it were for to ryme
But yet of that, which thou have herd
Of mysbeleue, how it has ferde
There is a great diversity
My father right so thinks me
But yet one thing I you beseech
which stant in all men's speech
The god, and the goddess of love
Of whom ye nothing here above
Have told, ne spoken of her fare
That ye me would now declare
How they first come to that name
My son I have left it for shame
Because I am her own priest
But for they stand nygh thy breast
Upon the shryfte of thy matere
Thou shall of hem the soth here
And understand now well the cas
Venus Saturnus daughter was
which all danger put aweye
Of love, and fond to lust a weye
So that of her in sundry place
Diverse men fell in to grace
And such a lusty life she ladde
That she diverse children had
Now one by this, now one by that
Of her it was that Mars begat
A child, which cleped was Armene
Of her also came Andragene
To whom Mercury father was
Anchyses begatte Eneas
Of her also, and Herycon
Byten begatte, and thereupon
wha^ that she sigh there was none other
By Jupiter her own brother
She lay, and he begat Cupyde
And thylke son upon a tide
when he was come unto his age
He had a wonder fair visage
And fond his mother amorous
And he was also lecherous
So when they were both alone
As he which eyes had none
To se reason / his mother kyst
And she also that nothing wist
But that / which unto his lust belongs
To been her lover him vnderfongeth
Thus was he blind / and she vnwys
But nevertheless this cause it is
which Cupide is the god of love
For he his mother durst love
And she, which thought her lusts fo^de
Diverse loves took on hand
well more than I the tell here
And for she would her selfeshere
She made common that disporte
And set a law of such a port
That every woman might take
what man her list, and naught forsake
To ben as common as she would
She was the first also, which told
That women should her body selle
Semyramys so as men tell
Of Venus kept thilke appryse
And so did in the same wise
Of Rome fair Neabolye
which sold her body to Regoly
She was to every man felawe
And held the lust of thilke law
which Venus of her self began
whereof that she the name wanne
why men her clepen the goddess
Of love, and eke of gentylnesse
Of worlds lust, and of pleasaunce
Se now the foul myscreaunce
Of greeks in thilke time tho
when Venus took her name so
There was no cause under the moon
Of the which they hadde^ tho to done
Of well or woe where so it was
That they no token in that caas
A god to help or a goddess
whereof to take my witness.
Nota de epistola Dindimi regis Bragmanno^um Alexandro magno directa, vbi
dicit, quod Greci (...) ad corporis co^seruacione^ pro sigulis me^bris singulos
deos specialiter appropriari credunt.
The king of Bragma^s Dyndymus
wrote unto Alysander thus
In blaming of the greeks feyth
And of the mysbyleue he says
How they for every membre hadden
A sundry god, to whom they spradden
Her arms, and of help besoughten
Mynerue for the head they soughte^
For she was wise, and of a man
The wit and reason which he can
Is in the celles of the brayn
whereof they made her souerayn
Mercurye, which was in his dawes
A great speker of falls laws
On him the keeping of the tongue
They laid, when they speak or song
For Bacchus was a gloton eke
H^ in for the throat they byseke
That he it would wasshen often
with foo^e drynkes and with soft
The god of shulders and of arms
was Hercules, for he in arms
The myghtyest was to fight
To him the lymmes they behyght
The god whom they clepen Mart
The breast to keep has for his part
For with the heart in his image
That he address to his courage
And of the galle the goddess
For she was full of hastynesse
Of wrath, and light to grieve also
They made, and said, it was Juno
Cupyde which the brond of fire
Bare in his hond, he was the sire
Of the stomocke, which boyleth ever
whereof the lusts ben the lever
To the goddess Cereres
which of the corn yafe her encrees
Upon the feyth that tho was take
The wombes cure was betake
And Venus through the lechery
For which they her deifye
She kept all down the remenaunt
To thylke office appertinaunt.
Nota de prima Idolorum cultura / que ex tribus precipne statuis exorta est /
quarum prima fuit illa / quam in filii sui memoria^ quida^ Princeps nomine
Cirophanes a sculptore Promotheo fabricari constituit.
Thus was dyspers in sundry wise
The mysbyleue as I deuyse
with many an image of entaylle
Of such as might hem not avail
For thy without lives chere
Vnmyghty be to se, or here
Or speak, or do, or else feel
And yet the fools to hem knele
which is her own hand work
A lord how this believe is derke
And fer fro reasonable wit
And netheles they don it yet
That was this day a raggyd tree
To morrow upon his majesty
Stant in the Temple well beseyne
How might a man's reason seyn
That such a stock may help or grieve?
But they, that been of such believe
And unto such gods call
It shall to hem right so befalle
And faylen at most need
But if the list to taken heed
And of the first image wit
Petronius thereof has write
And eke Nygargarus also
And they afferme and write so
That Promotheus was tofore
And fond the first craft therefore
And Cyrophanes, as they tell
Through counsel, which was take in hell
In remembrance of his lignage
Let setten up the first image
Of Cyrophanes seyth the book
That he for sorrow, which he took
Of that he sygh his son deed
Of comfort knew none other read
But let do make in remembrance
A fair image of his semblaunce
And set it in the market place
which openly to fore his face
Stood every day, to done him ease
And they that than wolden please
The fader, should it obey
when that they comen thylke weye.
Secunda statuta fuit illa / quam ad sui patris Beli culturam, rex Ninus fieri
et adorari decreuit, Et sic de nomine Beli postea Bell et Beelzebub Idolum
accreuit.
And of Nynus king of Assyre
I read, how that in his Empire
He was next after the second
Of hem, that first images found
For he right in semblable caas
Of Belus, which his fader was
From Nembroth in the right line
Let make of gold and stones fine
A precious image rich
After his fader euenlyche
And thereupon a law he set
That every man of pure debt
with sacryfyce, and with truage
Honor should thylke image
So that within time it fell
Of Belus came the name of Belle
Of Bell came Belsabub, and so
The mysbyleue went tho.
Tercia statuta fuit illa, que ad honorem Apis Regis Grecoru^ sculpta fuit, cui
postea nome^ Serapis iupone^tes ipsu^ quasi deu^ pagani coluerunt.
The third image next to this
when the king of Greece Apys
was deed, they made a figure
^n resemblaunce of his stature
Of this king Apys seyth the book
That Serapys his nome took
In whom through long contynuance
Of mysbyleue a great creaunce
They hadden, and the reverence
Of sacryfyce and of encence
To him they made, and as they tell
Among the wonders, that befelle
when Alexander fro Candace
Came rydend in a wild place
Under an hylle a cave he fond
And Candalus, which in that land
was bore, and was Candaces son
Him told, how that of common won
The gods were in thylke cave
And he that would assaye and have
A knoweleygnge, if it be soth
Light of his bors, and in he gothe,
And fond therein, that he sought
For through the fendes sleyght him thought
Among other gods mo
That Serapys spoke to him tho
whom he sygh there in great array
And thus the fend from day to day
The worship of ydolatrye
Drough forth upon the fantasye
Of hem, that were than blind
And couthen naught the troth find
Thus have thou herd in what degree
Of Greece, Egypt, and Chaldee
The mysbyleue whylome stood
And how so they be not good
Ne true, yet they sprongen out
whereof the wide world about
His part of mysbyleue took
Till so befelle, as seyth the book
That god a people for him selue
Has chose, of the lynages twelve
whereof the sothe redyly
As it is written in Genesy
I think tell in such a wise
That it shall be to thyn a pryse.
De hebreorum seu Iudeorum secta, quorum Sinogoga, ecclesia Cristi
superueniente, defecit.
After the flood, fro which Noe
was saufe, the world in his degree
was made as who seyth new ageyn
Of flour, of fruit of gras, of greyn
Of be, of byrd, and of mankind
which ever has be to god unkind
For not withstondinge all the fare
Of that this world was made so bare
And afterward it was restored
Among the men was nothing mored
Toward god of good living
But all was turned to liking
After the flesh, so that foryete
was he, which yafe hem life and mete
Of heaven and earth creator
And thus came forth the great error
That they the high god ne knew
But maden other gods new
As thou have herd me said tofore
There was no man that time bore
That he ne had after his choys
A god, to whom ye yafe his voys
whereof the mysbeleue came
In to the time of Abraham
But he fond out the right wey
How only men should obey
The high god, which weldeth all
And ever has done, and ever shall
In heaven, in earth, and eke in hell
There is no tongue his might may tell
This Patriarche to his lynage
Forbad, that they to none image
Enclyne should in no wise
But her offrende and sacryfyse
with all the hole hertes love
Unto the mighty god above
They shulden give, and to no mo
And thus en thylke time tho
Began that sect upon this earth
which of byleues was the ferthe
Of ryghtwysnes it was conceived
So must it needs be received
Of him, that all right is ynne
The high god, which would win
A people unto his own feyth
On Abraham the ground he leyth
And made him for to multyply
In to so great a progeny
That they Egypt all over sprad
But Phaaro with wrong hem lad
In seruytude again the pees
Till god let send Moses
To make the delyueraunce
And for his people great vengeance
He took, which is to here a wonder
The king was slain, the land put under
God bad the reed se deuyd
which stood vpryght on every side
And yafe unto his people aweye
That they on foot it passed dreye
And gone so forth in to desert
where for to keep hem in covert
The days when the son brent
A large cloud hem over went
And for to wyssen hem by night
A fyry pyller hem alyght
And when that they for honger pleyn
The mighty god began to reyne
Manna fro heaven down to ground
whereof that each of hem has funde
His fod, such right as him list
And for they should upon him tryst
Right as who set a tonne a broche
He perced the hard roche
And spronge out water all at will
That man and best has drunk his fille
And afterward he yafe the law
To Moses, that hem withdraw
They should not fro that he had
And in this wise they be lad
Till they took in possessyon
The lands of promyssyon
where that Caleph and Iosue
The marches upon such degree
Departen after the lynage
That each of hem as heritage
His pourpartye has vnderfonge
And thus stood this believe long
which of prophets was governed
And they had eke the people learned
Of great honor, that should hem fall
But at most need of all
They fayleden, when Christ was bore
But how that they her feith have lore
It needs naught to tellen all
The matter is so general
when Lucyfer was best in heaven
And ought most have stand in even
Toward god he took debate
And for that he was obstynate
And would naught to troth enclyne
He fell for ever in to ruin
And Adam eke in paradys
when he stood most in all his prys
After the state of Innocence
Again the god brake his defense
And fell out of his place awey
And right by such manner weye
The Jews in her best plyte
when that they should most parfyte
Have stand upon the prophecye
Tho fellen they to most folly
And him, which was fro heaven come
And of a maid his flessh has nome
And was among hem bore and fed
As men that wolden naught be sped
Of gods son, with o voys
They henge and slough upon the croys
whereof the parfyte of her law
Fro then forth hem was withdraw
So that they stand of no merit
But in truage as folk subgect
without propyrte of place
They lyuen out of gods grace
Dyspers in all lands out
And thus the feyth is come about
That wylome in the Jews stood
which is naught parfytelych good
To speak as it is now befalle
There is a feyth abouen all
In which the truth is comprehended
whereof that we ben all amended.
De fide Christiana, in qua perfect legis complementu^, summi mistirii
sacramentu^, nostreque sal nacionis fu^dame^tu^ ifallibiliter co^siftere
creditur.
The high almighty majesty
Of ryghtwysnes, and of pity
The sin, which that Adam wrought
when he sygh time ayene he bought
And send his son fro the heaven
which man's soul has set in even
And has his grace reconciled
Fro which the man was first exiled
And in him self so sore fall
Upon the point which is befall
That he ne might him self arise
Gregorye says in his apryse
It helps naught aman be bore
If gods son were vnbore
For than through the first sin
which Adam whylom brought us ynne
There shulden all men be lost
But Christ restores thylke lost
And bought it with his flesh and blod
And if we thynken, how it stood
Of thylke raunson, which he paid
As saint Gregorye it wrote and said
All was behouely to the man
For that, whereof his woe began
was after cause of all his wealth
when he, which is the well of health
The high creator of life
Upon the need of such a strife
So would he for his creature
Take on him self the forfeture
And suffer for the man's sake
Thus may no reason well forsake
That thylke sin orygynal
Ne was the cause in special
Of man's worship at last
which shall withouten end last
For by that cause the godhede
Assembled was with the manhede
In the vyrgyne, where he nome
Our flesh, and very man become
Of bodily fraternity
whereof the man in his degree
Stant more worth, as I have told
Than he stood erst by many fold
Through baptysme of the new law
Of which Christ lord is and felawe
Through virtue of his might
which in Mary was alyght
To bydge man's soul again
And this believe is so certain
So full of grace and of virtue
That what man clepeth to Jesus
In clean life forth with good deed
He may not faylen of heaven mede
So that it stonte upon believe
That every man may well acheue
which taken has the right feyth
For else, as the gospel seyth
Salvation there may be none
And for to preche thereupon
Christ had to his apostles all
The whose power as now is fall
On us, that been of holy church
If we the good deeds worch
For feyth, but if there be good deed
Thapostle feyth, is worth no mede
Now were it good, that thou for thy
which through baptysme propyrly
Art unto Christ's feyth professed
Beware that thou be not oppressed
with antichrystes lollardy
For as the Jews prophecye
was set of god for advantage
Right so this new tapynage
Of lolardye goth about
To set Christ's feyth in doubt
The saints, that were us tofore
By whom the feyth was first up bore
That holy church stood releued
They ought better be believed
Than these, which that men know
Not holy, though they feyne and blow
Her lollardye in men's ere
But if thou wylt live out of fere
Such new lore I read eschew
And hold forth right the weye, and sewe
As thyn auncestres did er this
So shall thou naught believe amys
Christ wrought first, and after taught
So that his deed the word araught
He ^afe ensample in his parsone
And we the words have alone
Like to the tree with leaves grene
Upon the which no fruit is seen.
^ta quod tum Anibenor palladium Troie a (...) A^^^erue abstulit, Thoas ibidem

The pressed Thoas, which of Minerue
The temple had for to serve
And the Palladyon of Troy
Kept under keye: for money
Of Anthenor, which he has nome
Has suffered Anthenor to come
And the Palladyon to stele
^herof the worship and the well
Of the Trojans was overthrow
But Thoas at same throw
when Anthenor this Iewele took
wynkend cast awey his look
For a deceyte, and for a wyle
As he that should him self begyle
He hyd his eyes fro the sight
And wend well, that he so might
Excuse his false conscience
I wot not if thylke euydence
Now at this time in her estates
Excuse might the prelates
Knowend how that the feith discresyth
And al moral virtue cesseth
whereof that they the keys here
But yet hem lyketh not to stere
Her goostly eye for to se
The world in his aduersyte
They wol no labor undertake
To keep that hem is betake
Christ dyed him self for the feyth
But now our ferful prelate seyth
The life is sweet, and that he keeps
So that the feyth vnholpe slepyth
And they unto her ease entenden
And in her lust her life dispenden
And every man do what him list
Thus stant this world fulfilled of mist
That no man sees the right weye
The words of the church keye
Through myshandlynge ben miswreint
The worlds wawe has welnigh dreint
The ship, which Peter has to stere
The form is kept, but the matere
Transformed is in other wise
But if they weren gostly wise
And that the prestes were good
As they by old days stood
It were than little need
Among the men to taken head
Of that they heren pseudo tell
which now is come for to dwell
To sow Cockyl with the corn
So that the tylthe is nygh forlorn
which Christ sewe first his own hond
Now stant the Cockylle in the land
where stood whylom the good greyne
For the prelates now, as men seyne
For slouthen that they should tylle
And that I trow be the skylle
when there is lack in hem above
The people is straunged to the love
Of troth, in cause of ignorance
For where there is no purueaunce
Of light, men erren in the dark
But if the prelates wolden work
Upon the feyth, which they us teach
Men shulden naught her way seche
without light as now is used
Men se the charge all day, refused
which holy church has undertake.
Gregorius. Quando Petrus cum Judea / Andreas cum Achia, Thomas cum India / et

But who that would ensample take
Gregory upon his O melye
Again the sloth of Preclacye
Compleyneth him, and thus he says
when Peter, father of the faith
At Domesday shall with him bring
Iudeam, which through his preching
He wan, and Andrewe with Achay
Shall come his debt for to pay
And Thomas eke with his beyete
Of Inde, and Poule the routes great
Of sundry lands to present
And we fulfilled of land and rent
which of this world we holden here
with void hondes shall appear
Touchende our cure spirtuall
which is our charge in special
I not what thing it may amount
Upon thilke end of our account
which Christ him self is auditour
which takes none head of vein honor
The office of the Chauncellery
Or of the kings treasory
Ne for to write, ne for to tail
To warrant may not than avail
The world, which now so well we trow
Shall make us than but a mow
So pass we without mede
That we none otherwise speed
But as we read, that he spedde
The which his lords besaunt hedde
And thereupon gat none encrees
But at his time netheles
what other man his thank deserve
The world so lusty is to serve
That we with him ben all accorded
And that is wist and well recorded
Through out this earth in all lands
Let knights win with her bonds
For our tongues shall be stylle
And stand upon the flesshes will
It were a travail for to preche
The faith of Christ, as for to teache
The folk paynem, it woll not be
But every prelate hold his see
with all such as he may get
Of lusty drink / of lusty meat
whereof the body fat and full
Is unto gostely labor dulle
And slough to handle thylke plough
But else we ben swyfte enough
Toward the worlds avarice
And that is as a sacrifyce
which after that thapostle says
Is openly ayene the faith
Unto the idols you and granted
But netheles as it is now haunted
And virtue changed into vice
So that largess is avarice
In whose chaptre now we trete
My father this matter is beat
So far / that ever while I live
I shall the better head give
Unto my self by many weye
But over this now would I prey
To wit what the branches are
Of avarice, and how they fare
Als well in love as otherwise.
My son and I the shall deuyse
In such a manner as they stand
So that thou shall understand.
A gros iungit agris Cupidus domibus domosque

Dame avarice is naught soleyne
which is of gold the capiteyne
But of her court in sundry wise
After the schole of her apryse
She has of servants many one
whereof that couetyse is one
which with the large world about
To seche thauauntages out
where that he may the profit win
To avarice and brings it inn
That one halt, and that other draws
There is no day which hem bedaweth
No more the son than the moon
when there is any thing to done
And namely with couetyse
For he stant out of all assyse
Of reasonable man's fare
where he purposes him to fare
Upon his lucre, and his beyete
The small pathe, the large street
The furlonge, and the long mile
All is but one for thilke while
And for that he is such one hold
Dame avarice him has with hold
As he which is the princypall
Outward for he is over all
A purue our, and an espy
For right as of an hungry py
The storue beasts ben awayted
Right so is couetyse affayted
To look where be may purchase
For by his will be would enbrace
All that this wide wolrde beclyppeth
But ever be somewhat ouerhyppeth
That he may naught all fulfylle
The lusts of his gredy will
But where it falls in a land
That couetyse in mighty hand
Is set, it is full hard to feed
For than he takes none other head
But that he may purchase and get
His conscience has all foryete
And not what thing it may amount
That be shall afterward account
But as the Luce in his degree
Of tho, that less ben than he
The fysshes gredily deuoureth
So that no water hem socoureth
Right so no law may rescowe
Fro him, that woll not right allow
For where that such one is of might
His will shall stand instead of right
Thus ben the men distroyed full often
Till that the great god alofte
Ayene so great a couetyse
Redress it in his own wise
And in example of all tho
I find a tale written so
The which for it is good to lere

Romanor^ Imperatore qui turrimin qua speculum Virgi^^ Rome fixum extiterat,
doloso circumuentus cupiditate euertit, vnde non solum sui ipsius perdicionem
sed tocius ciuitatis intollerabilem damnum contingere causauit.
when Rome stood in noble plite
Virgile, which was tho parfite
A mirror made of his clergy
And set it in the towns eye
Of marbre on a pyller without
That they by thirty mile about
By day and eke also by night
In that myrrour behold might
Her enemies / if any were
with all her ordinance there
which they ayene the city cast
So that while thilke myrrour last
There was no land, which might acheue
with werre Rome for to grieve
whereof was great envy tho
And it fell that ilke time so
That Rome had werres strong
Again Carthage, and stood long
The two cities upon debate
Carthage sygh the strong astate
Of Rome, in thilke myrrour stand
And thought all privily to fond
To overthrow it by some wyle
And Haniball was thilke while
The prince and leader of Carthage
which had set all his courage
Upon knyghthode in such a wise
That he by worthy and by wise
And by none other, was counsayled
whereof the world is yet meruayled
Of the maistries that he wrought
Upon the marches, which he sought
And fell in thilke time also
The king of Puyle, which was tho
Thought ayene Rome to rebelle
And thus was take the quarelle
How to distroy the myrrour
Of Rome tho was emperor
Crassus, which was so covetous
That he was ever desirous
Of gold to get the pyllage
whereof that Puyle, and eke Carthage
with philosophers wise and great
Begin of this matter to treat
And at last in this degree
There was philosophers three
To do this thing which undertook
And thereupon they with hem took
A great treasure of gold in cotres
To Rome, and thus these philosophers
To gether in company went
But no man wist what they meant
when they to Rome come were
So privily they dwelt there
As they that thoughten to deceive
was none, that might of hem perceive
Till they in sundry stedes have
Her gold under the earth begraue
In two treasours that to behold
They should seem as they were old
And so forth than upon a day
All openly in good array
To the emperor they hem present
And tolden, it was her intent
To dwell under his seruyse
And he hem asks in what wise
And they him told in such a plyte
That each of hem had a spirit
The which slepende a night appears
And hem by sundry dremes lereth
After the world that has betyd
Under the ground if ought be hyd
Of old treasour at any throw
They shall it in her sweuen know
And upon this condition
They sein, what gold under the town
Of Rome is hyd, they woll it find
There shall naught be left behind
Be so that he the balue dele
Hem grant, and he assenteth well
And thus came sleyght for to dwell
with couetyse as I the tell
This emperor badde redily
That they be lodged fast by
where he his own body lay
And when it was at morrow day
That one of hem says, that he met
where he a gold boorde shall set
whereof this emperor was glad
And thereupon anon he bad
His mynours for to go, and mine
And he him self of that couyne
Goth forth withal, and at his hand
The treasour ready there he fond
where as they said it should be
And who was than glad but be?
Upon that other day second
They have an other gold horde fond
which the second master took
Upon his sweuen, and undertook
And thus the sothe experience
To the emperor yafe such credence
That all his trust, and all his feith
So sykerlyche on hem he layth
Of that he fond him so releued
That they be parfitely believed
As though they were gods three
Now harken the subtylite.
The third master should mete
which as they sayden was unmeet
Above hem all, and couth most
And he without noise or boste
All priuelyche, so as he would
Upon the morrow his sweuen told
To the emperor right in his ear
And said him, that he wist were
A treasour was, so plentious
Of gold / and eke so precious
Of iewelles, and of rich stones
That it to all his horse at ones
It were a charge suffisaunt
This lord upon this covenant
was glad, and asks where it was
The master said under the glass
He told him eke as for the mine
He would ordeyne such engyne
That they the work should vndersette
with tymbre, and without let
Men may the treasour sauely delue
So that the myrrour by him selue
without empeirement shall stand
All this the master upon hand
Has undertake in all weye
This lord, which had his wit awey
And was with couetyse blent
Anon thereto yafe his assent
And thus to mine forth withal
The tymbre set up over all
whereof the pyller stood vpryght
Till it befelle upon a night
These clerks, when they were ware
How that the timber only bare
The pyller, where the myrrour stood
Her sleyght no man understood
They go by night unto the mine
with pitche, with sulphur, and with rosyne
And when the cite was a sleep
A wild fire in to the deep
They cast among the timber work
And so forth while the night was derke
Desguysed in a poor array
They passeden the town or day
And when they comen upon an hylle
They syghen how the myrrour fylle
whereof they made joy enough
And each of hem with other lough
And said: Lo what couetyse
May do, with hem that he not wise?
And that was proved afterward
For every land to Romewarde
which had be subject tofore
when this myrrour was so forlore
And they the wonder herd seye
Anon begone disobeye
with werres upon every side
And thus has Rome lost his pride
And was defouled over all
For this I find of Hanyball
That be of Romans in a day
when he hem fond out of array
So great a multitude slough
That of gold rings, which he drough
Of gentle hands, that been dead
Busshelles full three, I read
He filled / and made a bridge also
That he might over Tyber go
Upon the corpse that deed were
Of the Romans, which he slough there
But now to speak of the iuyse
The which after the couetyse
was take upon this emperor
For he distroyed the myrrour
It is a wonder for to here
The Romaynrs maden a chayer
And set her emperor therein
And sayden, for he would win
Of gold the superfluite
Of gold he should such plente
Receive, till he said bo
And with gold, which they had tho
Boylende hot within a pan
Into his mouth they pour thanne
And thus the thirst of gold was queint
with gold, which had been atteint
whereof my son thou might here
when couetyse has lost the stere
Of reasonable governance
There falls often great greuance
For there may he no werse thing
Than couetyse about a king
If it in his person be
It does the more aduersite
And if it in his counsel stand
It brings all day mischief to hand
Of common harm and if it grow
within his court it woll be know
For than shall the king be pylled
The man, which has his land tylled
Awayteth naught more redily
The heruest, than they gredily
Ne make than ward and watch
where they the profyt myghten catch
And yet full often it falls so
As men may seen among hem tho
That he, which most coueyteth fast
Has leest advantage at last
For when fortune is there again
Though he coueyte, it is in vain
The happes ben naught al lyche
One is made poor, an other rich
The court to some it does profit
And some ben ever in one plyte
And yet they both alyche sore
Coueyte, but fortune is more
Unto that one part fanourable
And though it be naught reasonable
This thing may a man seen al day
whereof that I the tell may
After ensample in remembrance
How every man may take his chance
Or of richesse, or of pouerte
How so it stand of the deserte
Here is naught every thing acquit
For often a man may se this yet
That who best does, lest tho^k shall have
It helps naught the world to crave
which out of reule and of measure
Has ever stand in adventure
As well in court, as else where
And how in old days there
It stood so as the things fell
I think a tale for to tell.
Hic ponit exemplum contra illos, qui in domibus regum sernientes, pro eo quod
ipsi secundu^ eorum cupiditate^ promoti non existunt / de regio seruitio
quamuis i^ eoru^ defectu indiscrete murmura^t.
In a cronyke this I read
About a king, as must need
There was knights and squiers
Great route, and eke officers
Some of long time him had served
And thoughte^, that they have deserved
Auauncement, and gone without
And some also ben of the route
That comen but a while agone
And they auaunced were anon
These old men upon this thing
So as they durst again the king
Among hem self compleynen often
But there is nothing said so soft
That it ne comes out at last
The king it wist, anon als fast
As he which was of high prudence
He shope therefore an evidence
Of hem that playnen in the cas
To know in whose defaute it was
And all within his own intent
That no man wist what it meant
Anon be let two cofres make
Of one semblaunce, of one make
So lyche, that no life thilke throw
That one may fro that other know
They were in to his chaumber brought
But no man wot why they be brought
And netheles the king has bid
That they be set in preuy stead
As he that was of wisdom slygh
when he thereto his time sygh
All priueliche, that none it wist
His own bonds that one kyst
Of fine gold / and of fine perye
The which out of his tresorie
was take, anon he fylde full
That other coffre of straw and mull
with stones meued he fylde also
Thus be they full both two
So that erelyche upon a day
He had within / there he lay
There should to fore his bed
A bourde up set, and fair spredde
And than he let the cofres fette
Upon the bourde and did hem set
He knew the names well of tho
The which ayene him grutched so
Both of his chamber, and of his halle
Anon and sent for hem alll
And said to hem in this wise:
There shall no man his hap despise
I wot well ye have long served
And god wot what ye have deserved
But if it is alonge on me
Of that ye vnauaunced be
Or else if it belong on you
The soth shall be preued now
To stop with your evil word
Lo here two cofers on the board
Chese which you list of both two
And wyteth well, that one of tho
Is with treasour so full begone
That if ye hap thereupon
Ye shall be rich men for ever
Now chese and take which you is lever
But be well ware, er that ye take
For of that one I undertake
There is no manner good therein
whereof ye might profit win
Now goth to gether of one assent
And makes your aduisement
For but I you this day auaunce
It stant upon your own chance
All only in default of grace
So shall be show in this place
Upon you all well afyne
That no defaute shall be mine
They knelen all, and with one voys
The king they thanken of this choys
And after that they up arise
And gone a side, and hem auyse
And at last they acorde
whereof her tale to record
To what issue they ben fall
A knight shall speak for hem all
He kneleth down to the king
And says, that they upon this thing
Or for to win, or for to lose
Ben all auysed for to chese
Tho took this knight a yerd on hond
And goth there as the cofers stond
And with thassent of euerychone
He leyd his yard upon one
And seyth the king, how thylke same
They chese in reguerdon by name
And preith him that they might it have
The king, which would his honor save
when he has herd the common voys
Has granted hem her own choys
And took hem thereupon the keye
But for he would it were seye
what good they have, as they suppose
He had anon the cofer unclose
which was fulfilled with straw and stones
Thus be they served all at ones
This king than in the same stead
Anon that other Cofer vndede
where as they sawen great richesse
well more than they couthen guess
Lo, seyth the king, now may ye see
That there is no defaute in me
For thy my self I wol acquyte
And bears ye your own wit
Of that fortune has you refused
Thus was this wise king excused
And they left of her evil speech
And mercy of her king beseech.
Nota de diuiciarum accidencia / vbi narrat, qualiter Fredericus Romanoru^
imperator duos ^anperes andiuit litigantes, quorum vnus dixit Been potest
ditari, quem rex vult ditare. Et alius dixit quem deus vult ditare dives erit /
que rex cum ad experime^to^ postea probata fuiffet, ill equi deum innocabat
pastellum auto plinum sortit^^ est, alius vero caponis pastellum sort
preelegit.
Somdele to this matter like
I find a tale, how Frederyke
Of Rome that time Emperor
Herd, as he went. a great clamor
Of two beggars upon the weye
That one of hem began to seye
Halord well may the man be rich
whom that a king list to rich
That other said no thing so
But he is rich, and well bego
To whom that god wol send well
And thus they maden words feel
whereof this lord has head nome
And did hem both for to come
To the payleys, where he shall ete
And bad ordeyn for her mete
Two pasteys, which he let do make
A capon in that one was bake
And in that other for to win
Of floreyns all that may within
He let do put a great riches
And even as lyche as man may guess
Outward they were both two
This beggar was commanded tho
He that which held him to the king
That he first chese upon this thing
He saw hem, but he felt hem naught
So that upon his own thought
He chese the capon, and forsook
That other, which his felawe took
But when he wist how that it ferde
He seyth aloude, that men it herd
Now have I certainly conceived
That he may lightly be deceived
That trysteth unto man's help
But well is him, that god wol help
For he stant on the syker side
which else should go beside
I se my felawe well recover
And I mote dwell still pouer
Thus spoke the beggar his intent
And power he came, and power he went
Of that he has richesse sought
His infortune it would naught
So may it show in sundry wise
Between fortune and couetyse
The chance is cast upon a dee
But yet a man may full often see
I^owe of such netheles
which ever put hem self in pres
To get hem good, and yet they fail
And for to speak of this entayle
Touchende of love in thy mattere
My good son as thou might here
That right as it with tho men stood
Of infortune of worlds good
As thou have me herd tell above
Right so full often it stant by love
Though thou coueyte it evermore
Thou shalt have no dele the more
But only that, which is the shape
The remenant is but a iape
And netheles inowe of tho
There ben, that now coueite so
That where as they a woman se
ye ten or twelve though there be
The love is now so vnauised
That where the beauty stant assised
The man's heart anon is there
And rouneth tales in her ere
And seyth, how that he loves streyte
And thus he set him to coueyte
And hundred though he saw a day
So would he more than he may
So for the great couetyse
Of sotye and fool emprise
In each of hem he fynt somewhat
That pleases him, or this or that
Some one, for she is white of skin
Some one, for she is noble of kynne
Some one, for she has a rody cheke
Some one, for that she seems meke
Some one, for she has eyes greye
Some one, for she can laugh and pleye
Some one, for she is long and small
Some one, for she is lyte and talle
Some one, for she is pale and bleche
Some one, for she is soft of speech
Some one, for that she is camused
Some one, for she has not be used
Some one, for she can dance and sing
So that some thing of his lykyng
He fynt: and though no more he feel
But that she has a little hele
It is enough, that he therefore
Her love, and thus an hundred score
while they be new, he would he had
whom he forsakes, she is bad
The blind man no color demeth
But all is one right as him seems
So has his lust no judgment
whom couetyse of love blent
Him thinks, that to his couetyse
How all the world ne may suffyse
For by his will he would have all
If that it might so befall
Thus is he common as the street
I set naught of his beyete.
My son haste thou such couetyse?
Nay fader such love I despise
And while I live shall don ever
For in good feyth yet had I lever
Than to coueyte in such aweye
To ben for ever till I deye
As pouer as Job, and loueles
Out taken one; for haueles,
His thonkes is no man a live.
For than a man should all vnthryue
There ought no wise man coueyte
The law was not set so streyte
For thy my self with all to save
Such one there is I would have
And none of all this other mo
My son of that thou would so
I am not wroth, but over this
I woll the tell, how it is
For there be men, which other wise
Right only for the couetyse
Of that they seen a woman rich
There wol they all her love affyche
Naught for the beauty of her face
Ne yet for virtue ne for grace
which she has else right enough
But for the park and for the plough
And other thingis, which thereto lo^geth
For in none other wise hem longs
To love, but if they profit find
And if the profit be behind
Her love is ever less and less
For after that she has richesse
Her love is of proportion
If thou have such condition
My son tell right as it is
Mine holy fader nay ywys
Condycyon such have I none
For truly fader I love one
So well, with all mine hertes thought
That certes though she had naught
And were as power as Medea
which was exyled for Creusa
I would her naught the less love
Ne though she were at her above
As was the rich queen Candace
which to deserve love and grace
To Alysander, that was king
^afe many a worthy rich thing
Or else as Panthasylee
which was the queen of Femyne
And great richesse with her nam
when she for love of Hector came
To Troy, in rescous of the town
I am of such condycion
that though my lady of her selue
were also rich, as such twelve
I ^^nth not, though it were so
No better love her, than I do
^or I love in so plain a wise
That for to speak of couetyse
As for pouerte, or for richesse
Thy love is another more ne less
For in good feyth I trow this
So covetous no man there is
For why, and he my lady sye
That he through lokynge of his eye
He should have such a strocke within
That for no gold he might wyn
He should naught her love asterte
But if he left there his heart
Be so it were such a man
That couthe skylle of a woman
For there be men so rude some
when they among the women come
They gone under protectyon
That love and his affectyon
Ne shall not take hem by the sleue
For they ben out of that believe
Hem lusts of no lady chere
But ever thynkend there and here
where as the gold is in the cofer
And wol none other love profre
But who so wot, what love amou^teth
And by reason trulyche acompteth
Than may he know, and taken head
That all the lust of woman head
which may ben in a ladys face
My lady has, and eke of grace
If men should yeuen her apryse
They may well seye, how she is wise
And sober, and simple of countenance
And all that to good governance
Belongs of a worthy wight
She has plainly: for thylke night
That she was bore, as for the nones
Nature set in her at ones
Beauty with bounte so beseyn
That I may well afferme and seyn
I saw yet never creature
Of comely head, and of feture
In any kings regyon
Be lyche her in comparyson
And thereto, as I have you told
Yet has she more a thousand fold
Of bounte, and shortly to tell
She is pure heed and well
And myrroure, and ensample of good
who so her virtues understood
Me thinks it ought enough suffyse
withouten other couetyse
To love such one, and to serve
which with her chere can deserve
To be beloved better ywys
Than she par cas that rychest is
And has of gold a mylyon
Such has be mine opinion
And ever shall, But nevertheless
I say naught she is haueles
That she nis rich, and well at ese
And has enough, wherewith to plese
Of worlds good, whom that her list
But one thing I would well ye wist
That never for no worlds good
Mine heart unto her ward stood
But only right for pure love
That wot the high god above
Now fader what say ye thereto?
My son I say it is well do
For take of this right good believe
what man that wol him self releue
To love, in any other wise
He shall well find his couetyse
Shall sore grieve him at last
For such a love may not last
But now men seyn in our days
Men maken but a few assayes
But if the cause be richesse
For thy the love is well the less
And who that would ensamples tell
By old days as they fell
Than might a man well understand
Such love may not long stand
Now harken son, and thou shall here
A great ensample of this matere
Hic ponit exemplum contra istos / qui non propter amorem sed propter diuicias
sponsalia fumunt. Et narrat de quodam regis Apulie Se nescalo / qui non solum
propter pecuniam vxore^ duxit, sed eciam pecunie commercis vxorem sibi
desponsatum vendidit.
To trete upon the cas of love
So as we to^d here above
I find write a wonder thing
Of Puyle whylom was a king
A man of high complexion
And young, but his affectyon
After the nature of his age
was yet not fall in his courage
The lust of woman for to know
So it betyd upon a throw
This lord fell in to great sekenes
Physyke has done the besynes
Of sundry cures many one
To make him holle, and thereupon
A worthy master, which there was
Yafe him counseyle vhon this cas
That if he would have parfyte hele
He should with a woman dele
Atress he, a young, a lusty wight
To don him company a night
For than he said him redely
That he shall be al hole there by
And other wise he knew no cure
The king which stood in a venture
Of life and death for medicine
Assented was and of couyne
His steward whom he trusts well
He took and told him every dele
How that this master had said
And thereupon he has him prayde
And charged upon his lygeaunce
That he do make purueaunce
Of such one as be couenable
For his pleasaunce, and delitable
And badde him, how that ever it stood
That he shall spare for no good
For his will is right well to pay
The steward said, he would assay
But now here after thou shall wit
As I find in the books write
what couetyse in love does
This steward, for to tell soth
Among all the men on alive
A lusty lady has to wyue
which netheles for gold he took
And naught for love, as says the book
A rich merchant of the land
Her fader was, and he her fond
So worthily, and such richesse
Of worlds good, and such largess
with her he yafe in marriage
That only for thilke advantage
Of good, the steward has her take
For lucre, and naught for loves sake
And that was afterward well seen
Now harken, what it woll mean
The steward in his own heart
Sigh that his lord may not asterte
His malady, but he have
A lusty woman him to save
And though he would give enough
Of his treasour, whereof he drough
Great couetyse in to his mind
And set his honor far behind
Thus he whom gold has ouersette
was trapped in his own net
The gold has made his wits lame
So that sechende his own shame
He ronneth in the kings ear
And said him, that he wist where
A gentle and a lusty one
Tho was, and thither would he gone
But he mote give yeftes great
For but it be through great beyete
Of gold, he said he should not speed
The king him bad upon the need
That take an hundrede pound he should
And give it, where that he would
Be so it were in worthy place
And thus to stand in loves grace
This king his gold has habandoned
And when this tale was full rouned
The steward took the gold, and went
within his heart and many a went
Of couetyse than he cast
whereof a purpose at last
Ayene love, and ayene his right
He took, and said how thilke night
His wife shall lygge by the king
And goth thynkende upon this thing
Toward his inn till he came home
In to the chaumbre, and than he nome
His wife, and told her all the cas
And she, which read for shame was
with both her hands to him prayde
K^^lende and in this wise said
That she to reason, and to skylle
In what thing that he bydde will
Is ready for to done his best
But this thing that were not honest
That he for gold her should selle
And he tho with his words fell
Forth with his gastely countenance
Says, that she shall done obeysaunce
And follow his will in every place
And thus through strength of his manace
Her innocence is ouerladde
whereof she was so sore adradde
That she his will mote need obey
And thereupon was shape a weye
That he his own wife by night
Has out of all men's sight
So privily that none it wist
Brought to the king, which as him list
May do with her what he would
For when she was there as she should
with him a bed under the cloth
The steward took his leave, and goth
In to the chamber fast by
But how he slepte, that wot not I
For he sygh cause of ielousy
But he which has the company
Of such a lusty one as she
Him thought that of his degree
There was no man so well at ease
She does all that she may to please
So that his heart all holle she had
And thus this king his joy lad
Till it was nygh upon the day
The steward than where she lay
Came to the bed, and in this wise
Has bydde she should arise
The king says nay, she shall not go
The steward said nothing so
For she mote gone er it be know
And so I swore, at thilke throw
when I her fette to you here
The king his tale would not here
And seith how that he has her bought
For thy she shall depart naught
Till he the bright day behold
And caught her in her arms fold
As be which list for to pleye
And bad his steward gone aweye
And so he did ayene his will
And thus his wife a bed stylle
Lay with the king the long night
Till that it was high son light
But who she was he knew nothing
Tho came the steward to the king
And prayde him without shame
In saving of her good name
He might leaden home ayene
This lady, and told him pleyne
How that it was his own wife
The king his ere unto this strife
Has leyde: and when that he it herd
well nyhe out of his wit he ferde
And said: A caytife most of all
where was it ever or this befall
That any Cokarde in this wise
Betoke his wife for couetyse
Thou have both her and me begyled
And eke thyn own estate reuyled
whereof that buxome unto the
Here after shall she never be
For this auowe to god I make
After this day / if I the take
Thou shalt be honged and to draw
Now look anon thou be withdraw
So that I se the never more
This steward that drad him sore
with all the have that he may
And fled awey the same day
And was exyled out of land
Lo there a nyce husbond
which thus his wife has lost for ever
But netheles she had a lever
The king her weddeth and honors
whereof her name she socoureth
which erst was lost through couetyse
Of him, that lad her other wise
And has him self also forlore
My son be thou ware therefore
where thou shall love in any place
That thou no couetyse embrace
The which is not of loves kind
But for all that a man may find
Now in this time of thylke rage
Full great dysese in marriage
when venym medleth with the sugar
And marriage is made for lucre
Or for the lust, or for the hele
what man that shall with other dele
He may not fail to repent.
My fader such is mine intent
But netheles good is to have
For good may often time save
The love, which should else spylle
But god, which wot my hertes will
I dar well take to witness
yet was I never for richesse
Be set with marriage none
For all mine heart is upon one
So freely, that in the person
Stant all my worlds joy alone
I ask another park ne plough
If I her had, it were enough
Her love should me suffyse
withouten other couetyse
Lo now my fader, as of this
Touchend of me, right as it is
My shryfte I am be know pleyn
And if ye wol ought else seyn
Of couetyse if there be more
In love, agropeth out the sore
Fallere cum nequeat, propria vir fraud subornat
Testes sit quod eis uera retorta fides
Sicut agros cupidus dum querie amans mulieres
Vult testes falfos falsus habe^^ fuos.
Non sine uindicta periurus abibit in eis
Visu qui cordis intima cuncta uidet.
Fallere periuro non est laudanda puellam
Gloria sed falso conditionis opus.
HIC tractat super illis auaricie speciebus / que falsum testimonium et
periurium nuncupantur, quorum fraudulenta circumuentio tam in cupiditatis quam
in amoris causa sui desiderit propositu^, qua^ sepe fallaciter attingit.
My son thou shall understand
How couietse has yet on hand
In special two counseylours
That been also his procurours
The first of hem is false witness
which ever is ready to witness
what thing his master woll him hot
Periure is the second hot
which spares naught to swear an oath
Though it be falls, and god be wroth
That one shall falls wytnes bear
That other shall the thing forswere
when he his charged on the book
So what with hepe, and what with croke
They make her master often win
And woll not know, what is sin
For couetise: and thus men seyn
They make many a falls bargeyn
There may no true quarrel arise
In thylke queste of thylke assyse
where as they two the people inform
For they keep ever o manner form
That upon gold her conscience
They found / and take her evidence
And thus with falls witness and oaths
They win hem mete, drink, and clothes
Right so there be, who that hem knew
Of these lovers full many untrue
Now may a woman find ynowe
That each of hem, when he shall wowe
Anon he will his hand down leyne
Upon a book, and swear and seyne
That he wol feyth and troth bear
And thus he profe^eth him to swear
To seruen ever till be dye
And all is very treachery
For when the soth him self tries
The more he swereth, the more he lies
when he his feyth makes all thermest
Than may a woman trust him lest
For till he may his will acheue
He is no longer for to leave
Thus is the trothe of love exyled
And many a good woman beguyled
And eke to speak of falls witness
There ben now such many I guess
That lyche unto the prouysours
They make he her preuy procuratours
To tell how there is such a man
which is worthy to love, and can
All that a good man should conne
So that with lesynge is begone
The cause, in which they woll proceed
And also syker as the creed
They make of that they known falls
And thus full often about the half
Love is of falls men embraced
But love, which is so purchaced
Come afterward to little pryse
For thy my son, if thou be wise
Now thou have herd this evidence
Thou might thyn own conscience
Oppose, if thou have be such one
Nay god wot father I am none
Ne never was, for as men says
when that a man shall make his faith
His heart and tongue must accord
For if so be that they discord
Than is he falls, and else naught
And I dare say, as of my thought
In love, it is not discordable
Unto my word, but accordable
And in this wise father I
May right well swear, and saufly
That I my lady love well
For that accords every dele
It needs naught to my soth saw
That I witness should draw
Into this day, for ever yet
Ne might it synke in to my wit
That I my counsel should seye
To any wight or me hewreye
To sechen help in such manner
But only for my lady dear
And though a thousand men it wyste
That I her love, and than hem list
with me to swear / and to witness
yet were that no falls witness
For I dare unto this troth dwell
I love her more, than I can tell
Thus am I father gylteles
As ye have herd, and netheles
In your dome I put it all
My son wit in special
It shall not commonlyche fail
All though it for a time fail
That falls witness his cause speed
Upon the point of his falsheed
It shall well afterward be kyd
whereof so as it is betyd
Ensample of such things blind
In a cronyke write I find.
HIC PONIT exemplum de iffis, qui falsum testificantes, amoris innocentiam
circumueniunt / Et narrat qualiter Thetis Achillem filium suum ad o lscentem
muliebri vestitum apparatu afferens esse puellam inter regis Lithomedis filias
ad educandum produxit, Et sic Achilles decepto rege filie sue Deidamie soci^ et
cubicularia effectus super ipsam Pirrum genuit, qui postea mire probitatis
miliciam affecutus mortem patris sui apud Troiam Polixent Tirrannice vindicauit.
The goddess of the sea Thetis
She had a son, and his name is
Achilles, whom to keep and ward
while he was young, and in to ward
She thought him saufly to betake
As she, which drad for his sake
Of that was said of prophecy
That he at Troy should dye
when that the city was beleyne
For thy so as the books seyne
She cast her wit in sundry wise
How she him might so desguyse
That no man should his body know
And so befelle that ilke throw
while that she thought upon this deed
There was a king, which Lychomede
was hot, and he was well begone
with fair daughters many one
And dwelte far out in an isle
Now shall thou here a wonder wyle
This queen, which the mother was
Of Achilles, upon this cas
Her son, as a maiden were
Let clothen in the same gere
which longs unto womanhede
And he was young, and took none bid
But suffers all that she him deed
whereof she has her women bid
And charge by her oaths all
How so it afterward byfalle
That they discover naught this thing
But feyne and make a knowlegynge
Upon the counseyle, which was nome
In every place where they come
To tell and to witness this
How he her ladys daughter is
And right in such a manner wise
She had they should her don seruyse
So that Achilles vnderfongeth
As to a young lady belongs
Honor, service, and reverence
For Thetys with great dylygence
Him has so taught, and so affayted
That how so that he were awayted
with sobre, and goodly contenaunce
He should his womanhede auaunce
That none the soth know might
But that in every man's sight
He should seem a pure maid
And in such wise, as she him said
Achylles, which that ylke while
was young, upon him self to smyle
Began, when he was so beseyn
And thus after the books seyn
with frette of perle upon his head
All fresshe between the white and read
As he which tho was tender of age
Stood the color in his visage
That for to look upon his cheke
And seen his chyldy manner eke
He was a woman to behold
And than his mother to him told
That she him had so begone
By cause that she thought gone
To Lichomede at thylke tide
where that she said, be should abide
Among his daughters for to dwell
Achylles h^^d his mother tell
And wist no ^ght the cause why
And netheles full buxomly
He was ready to that she had
whereof his mother was right glad
To Lychomede and forth they went
And when the king knew her intent
And saw this young daughter there
And that it came unto his ere
Of such record, of such witness
He had right a great gladness
Of that he both sygh and herd
As he that wot not how it ferde
Upon the counseyl of the need
But for all that king Lychomede
Has toward him his daughter take
And for Thetys his mother sake
He put her in to company
To dwell with Deydamye
His own daughter the eldest
The fairest, and the comlyest
Of al his daughters, which he had
Lo thus Thetys the cause lad
And left there Achylles feyned
As be, which has him self restreyned
In all that ever be may and can
O ute of the manner of a man
And took his womanysshe chere
whereof unto his bedfere
Deydamye he has by night
where kind would him selue right
After the Philosophers seyn
There may no wight be there ageyn
And that was thylke time seen
The long nyghtes hem between
Nature, which may not forbere
Has made hem both for to stere
They kyssen first, and ouermore
The high wey of loves lore
They gone, and all was done in deed
whereof lost is the may denhede
And that was afterward well know
For it befell that ylke throw
At Troy, where the syege lay
Upon the cause of Menelay
And of his queen dame Eleyne
The gregoys badden mochel pain
All day to fight, and to assail
But for they might naught avail
So noble a cite for to win
A preuy counsel they begin
In sundry wysewhere they treat
And at last among the great
They fellen unto his accord
That Phorceus of his record
which was an Astronomyen
And eke a great magicien
Should of his calculation
Screbe of constellation
How they the city myghten get
And he which had naught foryete
Of that belongs to a clerk
His study set upon this work
So long his wit about he cast
Till that he fond out at last
But if they hadden Achilles
Her werre shall ben endeles
And over that he told hem pleyne
In what manner he was beseyne
And in what place he shall be found
S^ to at within a little stounde
Vl^^es forth with Dyomede
Upon this point to Lychomede
Agamemnon to gether sent
But Vlyxes, er he forth went
which was one of the most wise
Ordained has in such a wise
That he the most rich array
whereof a woman may be gay
with him be took manifold
And ouermore, as it is told
An harnoys as for a lusty knight
which burned was as silver bright
O^ sword, of plate, and cke of mayle
As though he should do battle
He took also with him by ship
And thus to gether in felawshyp
Forth gone this Dyomede and be
In hope till they myghten se
The place, where Achilles is
The wind stood than naught amys
But every topsayle cole it blewe
Till Vlyxes the marches knew
where Lychomede his reygne had
The styresman so well him ladde
That they be comen saufe to land
where they gone out upon the stronde
In to the burgh, where that they found
The king, and he which has facounde
Vlyxes did the message
But the counsel of his courage
why that he came, he told naught
But underneath he was bethought
In what manner he might aspie
Achilles from Deidamye
And fro these other, that there were
Full many a lusty lady there
They plaide hem there a day or two
And as it was fortuned so
It fell that time in such a wise
To Bacchus that a sacrifice
These young ladies shulden make
And for the strange men's sake
That comen fro the siege of Troy
They maden well the more joy
There was revel, there was daunsynge
And every life, which couth sing
Of lusty women in the route
A fresshe caroll has song about
But for all this yet netheles
The greeks unknow of Achilles
So weren, that in no degree
They couthen wit, which was he
Ne by his voys, ne by his paas
Vlyxes than upon the caas
A thing of high prudence has wrought
For thilk array, which he has brought
To give among the women there
He let do fetten all the gear
Forth with a knights harnoys eke
In all the country for to seek
Men shulden naught a fayrer se
And every thing in his degree
Endelonge upon a bourde he laid
So Lychomede and than he preyde
That every lady chese should
what thing of all that she would
And take it as by way of yefte
For they hem self it should sheft
He said after her own will.
Achilles than stood naught stylle
when he the bright helm beheld
The sword, the hauberke, and the shield
His heart fell thereto anon
Of all that other would he none
The knights gere he vnderfongeth
And thylke array, which that belongs
Unto the women he forsook
And in this wise, as says the book
They known than which he was
For he goth forth the great paas
In to the chamber, where he lay
Anon, and made no delay
He armeth him in knyghtly wise
That better can no man devise
And as fortune should fall
He came so forth tofore hem all
As he, which tho was glad enough
But Lychomede nothing lough
when that he sigh, how that it ferde
For than he wist well and herd
His daughter had be forleyn
But that he was so ouerseyn
The wonder ouergoth his wit
For in Cronike is written yet
Thing, which shall never be foryete
How that Achilles has begette
Pytrus upon Deydame
whereof came out the trecherye
Of falls witness, when he said
How that Achilles was a maid
But that was nothing seen tho
For he is to the syege go
Forth with Vlyxes and Dyomede
Lo thus was proved in the deed
And fully spoke at thylke while
If o woman an other begyle
where is there any sekyrnesse
wha^ Thetis which was tha^ the goddess
Daydamye has so beiaped
I not how it shall been escaped
with tho women, whose innocence
Is now al day through such credence
Deceived often, as it is seen
with men, that such untruth mean
For they ben slygh in such a wise
That they by sleyght and by queyntise
Of falls wytnes bryngyn inn
That does hem often for to win
That they be not worthy thereto
For thy my son do not so
My father as of falls witness
The troth, and the manner express
Touchende of love, how it has ferde
As ye have told, I have well herd
But for ye sayden other wise
How thylke vice of couetyse
Has yet periur of his acorde
If that you list of some record
To tell an other tale also
In loves cause of time ago
what thing it is to be forswore
I would preye you therefore
whereof I might ensamble take.
My good son and for thy sake
Touchende of this I shall fulfill
Thyn axynge, at thine own will
And the mattere I shall declare
How the women deceived are
when they so tender hertes bear
Of that they here men so swear
But when it comes unto thassay
They find it falls a another day
As Jason did unto Medee
which stante yet of authority
In token, and in memorial
whereof the tale in special
Is in the book of Troy writ
which I shall do the for to wit
Hic in amoris caufa ponit exemplum contra periuros, Et narrat qualiter Jason
priusquam ad Insulam Colchos pro aureo vellere ibidem conquestando transmearet,
in amorem et coningium Medee regis Othonis filie iurame^to firmius se
aftrinxit, sed suo postea completo negotio cil ips^ secum nauigio in Cretiam
perduxisset, vbi illum senectam patris sui Efonis in floridam inuentute^
mirabili scientia reformauit, Ipse Jason fidei sue ligamento, aliis que
beneficiis post positis, dictam Medeam pro quadam Crensa regis Creontis filia
periurus dereliquit.
In greece whylom was a king
Of whom the fame and knowlegyng
By leueth yet, and Peleus
He hyghte: but it fell him thus
That his fortune her whele so lad
That he no child his own had
To reignen after his decesse
He had a brother netheles
whose right name was Eson
And he the worthy knight Jason
Begatte, the which in every land
All other passed of his hand
In arms, so that he the best
was named, and the worthyest
He sought worship over all
Now harken, and I the tell shall
An adventure that he sought
which afterward full dear he bought.
There was an isle, which Colchos
was cleped, and thereof aroos
Great speech in every land about
That such marvel was none out
In all the wide world no where
As tho was in that isle there
There was a sheep, as it was told
The which his flees bare all of gold
And so the gods had it set
That it ne might away be fette
By power of no worlds wight
And yet full many a worthy knight
It had assayed, as they dorst
And ever it fell hem to the worst
But he that would it naught forsake
But of his knyghthode undertake
To do, what thing thereto belongs
This worthy Jason sore alongeth
To se the strange regions
And know the conditions
Of other marches, where he went
And for that cause his hole intent
He set Colchos for to seche
Cnd thereupon he made a speech
To Peleus his eme the king
And he well paid was of that thing
And shope anon for his passage
Such as were of his lignage
with other knights, which he chees
with him he took: and Hercules
which full was of chivalry
with Jason went in company
And that was in the month of may
when cold storms were away
The wind was good, the ship was yare
They took her leave, and forth they fare
Toward Colchos, but on the weye
what hem byfelle, is long to seye
How Laamedon the king of Troy
which ought well have made hem joy
when they to rest a while him preyde
Out of his land he them congeyde
And so befelle the dissension
which after was destruction
Of that city, as men may here
But that is naught to my matere
But thus the worthy folk gregoys
Fro that king, which was not curtois
And fro his land with seyl vpdrawe
They went hem forth, and many a saw
They made, and many a great manace
Till at last in to that place
which as they sought, they arryue
And stryken seyle, and forth as blyue
They senten unto the king, and tolden
who weren there, and what they wolden
O etes which was then king
when that he herd this tydynge
Of Jason, which was comen there
And of these other, what they were
He thought done hem great worship
For they anon come out of ship
And straight unto the king they went
And by the hand Jason he hente
And that was at the paleys gate
So far the king came on his gate
Toward Jason to done him chere
And he, whom lacks no manner
when he the king sigh in presence
Yafe him again such reverence
As to a kings state belongs
And thus the king him vnderfongeth
And Jason in his arm he caught
And forth in to the halle he straught
And there they sat, and speak of things
And Jason told him tho tidings
why he was come, and fair him preide
To have his time, and the king thus said
Jason thou art a worthy knight
But it lies in no man's might
To done, that thou art come fore
There has been many a knight forlore
Of that they wolden it assaye
But Jason would not him esmaye
And said: of every worlds cure
Fortune stant in adventure
Paranter well, paranter woe
But how as ever that it go
It shall be with mine bond assayed
The king tho held him not well paid
For he the greeks sore dredde
In aunter if Jason ne spedde
He might thereof bear a blame
For tho was all the worlds fame
In greece, as for to speak of arms
For thy he drad him of his harms
And began to preach, and to preye
But Jason would not obey
But said, he would his purpos hold
For ought that any man him told
The king when these words herd
And sigh how that this knight a^swerde
Yet for he would make him glad
After Medea gone he bad
which was his daughter: and she came
And Jason which good head nam
when he her sigh, ageyn her goth
And she, which was him nothing loath
welcomed him in to that land
And soft took him by the hand
And down they setten both same
She had herd spoken of his name
And of his great worthynes
For thy she began her eye impresse
Upon his face, and his stature
And thought how never creature
was so welfarende, as was he
And Jason right in such degree
Ne might not withholde his look
But so good head on her he took
That him ne thought under the heaven
Of beauty sighe he never her euene
with all that tell to womanhede
Thus each of other token head
Though there no word was of record
Her hertes both of one accord
Ben set to love, but as tho
There myghten be no words mo
The king made him great joy and feast
To all his men he yafe an hest
So as they would his thonke deserve
That they should all Jason serve
while that he would there dwell
And thus the day, shortly to tell
with many myrthes they dispent
Till night was come, and tho they went
Echone of other took his leave
when they no longer myghten leave
I not how Jason that night sleep
But well I wot, that of the sheep
For which he came in to that i will
He thought but a littell while
All was Medea that he thought
So that in many wise he sought
His wit wakende / er it was day
Some time ye, some time nay
Some time thus, some time so
As he was stered to and fro
Of love, and eke of his conquest
As he was hold of his behest
And thus he rose up by the morrow
And took him self seint John^ to borow
And said he would first begin
At love, and after for to win
The flees of gold, for which he come
And thus to him good heart he nome
Medea right in the same wise
Till day came, that she must arise
Lay, and bethought her all the night
How she that noble worthy knight
By any way might wedde
And well she wist, if he ne spedde
Of thing / which he had undertake
She might her self no purpose take
For if he deyde of his battle
She must than algate fail
To getten him, when he were deed
Thus she began to set read
And turn about her wits all
To look how that it might fall
That she with him had a leyser
To speak and tell of her desire
And so it fell the same day
That Jason, with that sweet may
To geher set, and hadden space
To speak, and he besought her grace
And she his tale goodly herd
And afterward she him answerde
And said: Jason as thou wylt
Thou might be saufe, thou might be spilt
For wit well, that never man
But if he couth, that I can
Ne might that fortune acheue
For which thou come: but as I leave
If thou wolt hold covenant
To love of all the remenaunt
I shall thy life and honor save
That thou the flees of gold shall have
He said: Al at your own will
Madame I shall truly fulfylle
Your hest, while my life may last
Thus long he prayed, and at last
She grants, and behyght him this
That when night comes, and it time is
She would him send certeynly
Such one, that should him privily
Alone in to her chamhre bring
He thanketh her of that tydynge
For of that grace is him begone
Him thinks al other things won
The day made end, and lost his sight
And comen was the derke night
The which all the days eye blent
Jason took leave, and forth he went
And when he came out of the prees
He took to counsel Hercules
And told him, how it was betyd
And prayde it should well ben hyd
And that he would look about
The whiles that he should be out
Thus as he stood, and head name
A maiden fro Medes came
And to her chamber Jason led
where that he fond ready to bed
The sayrest, and the wysest eke
And she with simple chere and meke
when she him sigh, waxt all asshamed
Tho was her tale new entamed
For sykernesse of marriage
She fette forth a rich image
The which was the figure of Iubitere
And Jason swore, and said there
That also wys god him help
That if Medea did him help
That he his purpose might win
They should never part a twynne
But ever while him last life
He would her hold for his wife
And with that word they kystend both
And for they should hem unclothe
There come a maiden in her wise
She did hem both full seruyse
Till that they were in bed naked
I wot that night was well bewaked
They hadden both what they would
And than at leyser she him told
And began fro point to point inform
Of this battle, and all the form
The which that he should find there
when he to that isle come were
She said, at enter of the pas
How Mars, which god of arms was
Has set two oxen stern and stout
That casten fire and flam about
Both at mouth and at nase
So that they setten all on blase
what thing that passes hem between
And forthermore upon the grene
There goth the flees of gold to keep
A serpent which may never sleep
Thus who that ever it should win The fire to stop he mote begin
The which that tho fierce beasts cast
And daunt he mot hem at last
So that he may hem yoke and drive
And there upon he als blyue
The serpent with such strength assail
That he may sleyn him by battle
Of the which he must the teth outdraw
As it belongs to that law
And than he must the oxen yoke
Till they have with a plough to broke
A forow of loud, in which a row
The teeth of thadder he must sow
And thereof shull arise knights
well armed at all ryghtes
Of hem is naught to taken head
For each of hem in hastibede
Shall other slay with dethes wound
And thus wha^ they be brought to ground
And go so forth, and take his pray
Than must he to the gods pray
But if he fail in any wise
Of that ye here me deuyse
There may be set non other weye
That he ne mote algates deye
Now have I told the perel all
I will you tell forth withal
(Quod Medea to Jason tho)
That ye shall known er ye go
Again the venym and the fire
what shall be the recouere
But sir for it is nygh day
Arises up, so that I may
Deliver you, what thing I have
That may your life and honor save
They were both loath to rise
But for they were both wise
Up they risen at last
Jason his clothes on him cast
And made him ready right anon
And she her shi^^ did upon
And cast on her a mantell close
withouten more, and than aros
Tho took she forth a rich tie
Mad all of gold and of perye
Out of the which she took a ring
The stone was worth all other thing
She said, whiles he would it were
There might no peril him dear
In water may it not be dreynte
where as it comes the fire is queynt
It daunteth eke the cruel heste
There may none quad that man arest
where so he be on se or land
That has this ring upon his hand
And over that she began to seyne
That if a man will ben vnsayne
within his hand hold close the stone
And he may inuysyble gone
The ring to Jason she betaught
And so forth after she him taught
what sacrifyce he should make
And began out of her cofer take
Him thought an heavenly figure
which all by charm and by conjure
was wrough, and eke it was through writ
with names, which he should wit
As she him taught tho to read
And had him as he would speed
without rest of any while
when he were londed in that isle
He should make his sacryfyce
And read his carecte en the wise
As she him taught on knes down bent
Three sythes towerd oryent
For so should he the gods plese
And wyn him self mochel ese
And when he had it thryse radde
To open a box she him badde
That she there took him in present
And was full of such oignement
That there was fire ne venym none
That should fastenen him upon
when that he were anoint withal
For thy she taught him how he shall
Anoint his arms all about
And for he should nothing doubt
She took him than a manner glue
The which was of so great virtue
That where a man it should cast
It should bind anon so fast
That no man might it done away
And that she had by all way
He should into the mouths throw
Of tho two oxen that fire blow
Thereof to stop the malice
The glue shall serve of that office
And over that her oignement
Her ring, and her enchauntement
Ayene the serpent should him were
Till he him slay with sword or spear
And than he may saufely enough
His oxen yoke in to the plough
And the teeth sow in such wise
Till he the knights se arise
And each of other down be leyde
In such a manner as I have said
Lo thus Medea for Jason
Ordeyneth, and prays thereupon
That he nothing foryete should
And eke she prays him that he would
when he has all his arms done
To ground knele, and thonke anon
The gods, and so forth by ease
The flees of gold he should sese
And when he had it sesed so
That than he were sone ago
without any taryenge
when this was said into weeping
She fell, as she that was through nome
with love, and so porth overcome
That all her world on him she set
But when she sygh there was no let
That he mote needs part her fro
She took him in her arms two
An honderde times and began him kiss
And said: O all my worlds bliss
My trust, my lust, my life, mine hele
To ben thyn help in this quarele
I pray unto the gods all
And with that word she began down fall
Of swoune, and he her up nam
And forth with that the maiden came
And they to bed anon her brought
And than Jason her besought
And to her seyde, in this manner
My worthy lusty lady dear
Comfort you, for by my troth
It shall not fallen in my sloth
That I ne woll throughout fulfylle
your hestes, at your own will
And yet I hope to you bring
within a while such tydynge
The which shall make us both game
But for he would keep her name
when that he wist it was nygh day
H^ said, adewe my sweet may
And forth with him he nam his gere
which as she had take him there
And straught unto his chamber went
And goth to bed, and sleep him hent
And lay, that no man him a woke
For Hercules head of him took
(...) it was vnd^rne high and more
And than he began to sygh sore
And suddenly he brayde of sleep
(...) they than took of him keep
(...) ^hamberleins ben soon there
And maden ready all his gere
And he arose, and to the king
He went, and said, how to that thing
For which he came, he would go
The king thereof was full woe
And for he would him feign withdraw
He told him many a dredefull saw
But Jason would it naught record
And at last they accord
when that he would naught abide
A boat was ready at tide
In which this worthy knight of greece
Full armed up at every piece
To his battle, which belongs
Took sore in hand, and sore him longs
Till he the water passed were
when he came to that isle there
He set him on his knees down straught
And his carecte, as he was taught
He rad, and made his sacryfyce
And sithe anoynte him in that wise
As Medea him has bid
And than arose up fro that stead
And with the glewe the fire he queynt
And anon after he atteynt
The great serpent, and him slough
But erst he had sorrow enough
For that serpent made him travail
So hard and sore of his battle
That now he stood, and now he fell
For long time it so befelle
That with his swerd and with his spear
He might not the serpent dear
He was so sherded all about
It hueld all edge tole without
He was so rude and hard of skyn
There might no thing go there in
Venym and fire to geder he cast
That he Jason sore a blast
And if it ne were his oyntement
His ring, and his enchauntement
which Medea took him before
He had with that worm be lore
But of virtue, which thereof came
Jason the dragon ouercam
And he anon the tethe out drough
And set his oxen in his plough
with which he brake a piece of land
And sewe it with his own hond
Tho might he great merueyle se
Of every toth in his degree
Sprung up a knight with spear and sheld
Of which anon right in the feld
Echone slough other, and with that
Jason Medea not forgot
On both his knees he began down fall
And gafe thonke to the godddes all
The flees he took, and gothe to hot
The son shyneth bright and hot
The flees of gold shone forth with all
The water glysterd ouerall
Medea wept / and syghed often
And stood upon a tower alofte
All pryuely within her self
There herd it not nen ne twelfe
She prayed, and said: O god him speed
The knight, which has my maide^hede
And aye she looks toward the isle
But when she sygh within a while
The flees glisterynge ageyn the son
She said: O lord all is ywonne
My knight the feld has ouercomen
Now would god, he were comen
O lord god I would he were in land
But I dare take this on hand
If that she had wings two
She would have flowen to him tho
Straight there he was unto the hot
The day was clear, the son hot
The greeks were in great doubt
The while that her lord was out
They wist not what should betyde
But waited ever upon the tide
To se what end should fall
There stoden eke the nobles all
Forth with the comun of the town
And as they loken up and down
They were ware^ within a throw
where came the hot, which they well know
And sy^gh how Jason brought his preye
And tho they gauen all seye
And cryden al with o steven
O where was ever under the heaven
So noble a knight, as Jason is?
And well nyghe all sayden this
That Jason was a fair knight
For it was never of man's might
The flees of gold so for to win
And thus tellen they begin
with that the king came forth anon
And sygh the flees, how that shone
And when Jason came to the land
The king him self took his hand
And kyssed him, and great joy him made
The greeks weren wonder glade
And of that thing right meri he^ thought
And forth with he^ the fles they brought
And each on other began to lygh
But well was him that might nygh
To se there of the properte
And thus they passen the cite
And gone unto the paleis straught
Medea, which forgot her naught
was ready there, and said anon
welcome, O worthy knight Jason
She would have kyst him wonder fayn
But shame turned her again
It was naught the manner as tho
For thy she dorste naught do so
She took her leave, and Jason went
Into his chamber, and she him sent
Her maiden, to seen how he ferde
The which when that he sygh and herd
How that he had faren out
And that it stood well all about
She told her lady what she wist
And she for joy, her maiden kyst
The bathes weren than arrayed
with herbs tempred and assayed
And Jason was unarmed soon
And did, as it befelle to done
Into his bathe, he went anon
And wyss he him clean as any bone
He took a soppe, and out he came
And on his best array he nam
And kempt his heed, when he was clad
And goth him forth all merry and glad
Right straught in the kings halle
The king came with his knights all
And made him glad welcomynge
And he hem told tho tydynge
Of this and that, how it befelle
when that he wan the shepes fell
Medea when she was after sent
Come soon to that parliament
And when she might Jason se
was none so glad of all as she
There was no joy for to seche
Of him made every man a speech
Some man said one, some said other
But though he were gods brother
And might make fire and thonder
There might be no more wonder
Than was of him in that city
Echone taught other this is he
which has in his power within
That all the world ne might win
Lo here the best of all good
Thus they sayden, that there stood
And eke that walkende up and down
Both of the court, and of the town
The time of souper came anon
They wysshen, and thereto they gone
Medea was with Jason set
Tho was there many a deynte fette
And set tofore hem on the board
But none so liking as the word
which was there spoke among hem two
So as they dorst speak tho
But though they had little space
Yet they acorden in that place
How Jason should come at night
when every torche and every light
were out, and than other things
they speak alowde for supposinges
Of hem that stoden there about
For love is evermore in doubt
For if it be wysly governed
Of hem that been of love learned
when al was done, that dissh and cup
And cloth, and board, and all was up
They wake, while hem list to wake
And after that they leave take
And gone to bed for to rest
And when him thought for the best
That every man was fast on sleep
Jason, that would his time keep
Both forth stalkynge all pryuely
Unto the chamber, and redyly
There was a maid, which him kept
Medea woke, and no thing slepte
But netheles she was a bed
And he with all have him spedde
And made him naked, and all warm
Anon he took her in his arm
what need is for to speak of ease
Hem list each other for to plese
So that they had joy ynowe
And tho they setten, when and how
That she with him awey shall stele
with words such and other feel
when all was treted to an end
Jason took leave, and began forth wend
unto his own chamber in pes
There wist it non but Hercules
He slepet, and ros when it was time
And when it fell toward pryme
He took to him such as he tryste
In secre, that none other wist
And told hem of his counseyle there
And said, that his will were
That they to ship had all thing
So privily in the evening
That no man might her deed aspie
But tho that weren of company
For he woll go without leave
And longer woll he naught believe
But he ne would at thilke throw
The king or queen should it know
They said all this shall well be do
And Jason trust well thereto
Medea in the mean while
which thought her father to begyle
The treasour, which her father had
with her all privily she ladde
And with Jason at time set
Away she stale, and fond no let
And straught she goth her unto ship
Of greece with that felaushyp
And they anon drough up the sail
And all that night this was counsel
But erly when the son shone
Men sygh, that they were agone
And come unto the king, and told
And he the soth know would
And axeth where his daughter was
There was no word, but out alas
She was a go, the mother wept
The fa her as a wood man lepte
And began the time for to warye
And swore his oath he would no ttary
That with Calyphe, and with galeye
The same course, the same wey
which Jason took, he would take
If that he might him overtake
To this they sayden all ye
Anon as they weren at the sea
And all, as who says at one word
They gone within ships boorde
The sail goth up, and forth they straught
But none exploit thereof they caught
And so forth they tournen home ayene
For all that labor was in vain
Jason to greece with his pray
Goth through the sea the right way
when he there come, and men it told
They maden joy young and old
Eson when that he wist of this
How that his son comen is
And has acheued that he sought
And home with him Medea brought
In all the wide world was none
So glad a man as he was one
Together been these lovers tho
Till that they had sons two
whereof they weren both glade
And old Eson great joy made
To seen the encrees of his lignage
For he was of so great an age
That men awayten every day
when that he should gone away
Jason, which sigh his fader old
Upon Medea made him bold
Of art magyke, which she couth
And prays her, that his fathers youth
She would make ayenewarde new
And she that was toward him true
Behyghte him, that she would it do
when that she time sigh thereto
But what she did in that matere
It is a wonder thing to here
But yet for the nouelrye
I think tellen a great party
Nota quibus medicamentis Essonem senet tute decrepitum, ad sue inuentutis
adolescenciam prudens Medea reduxit.
Thus it befell upon a night
when there was naught but sterre light
She was vanisshed, right as her list
That no wight, but her self wist
And that was at mydnyght tide
The world was stylle on every side
with open heed, and foot all bare
Her here to sprad she began to fare
Upon her clothes gyrte she was
All specheles upon the gras
She glode forth as an adder does
None other wise she ne goth
Till she came to the fresshe flode
And there a while she withstode
Thryes she turned her about
And thryes eke she began down loute
And in the flode she weet her here
And thryes on the water there
She gaspeth with a dretchynge onde
And tho she took her speech on hand
First she began to clepe and call
Upward unto the sterres all
To wind, to air, to see, to land
She preyde, and eke held up her hand
To Echates and began to cry
which is the goddess of Sorcerie
She said, helps at this need
And as ye maden me to speed
when Jason came the flees to seche
So help me now, I you beseech
with that she looks, and was ware
Down fro the sky there came a chare
The which dragons about drowe
And tho she began her heed down bow
And up she styghe, and fair and well
She drofe forth by chare and wheel
Above in the air among the skies
The land of Crete, in tho parties
She sought, and fast began her high
And thereupon the hulles high
Of Othryn, and Olymphe also
And eke of other hulles moo
She fond, and gethereth herbs snote
She pulls up some by the rote
And many with a knyfe she shereth
And all in to her chaar she bears
Thus wha^ she has the hulles sought
The flodes there foryate she naught
Erydyan, and Amphrysos
Peneyee, and eke Sperceydos
To hem she went, and there she nome
Both of the water, and of the foam
The sonde, and eke the small stones
which as she chese out for the nones
And of the read see a part
That was behouelyche to her art
She took, and afterward that about
She sought sundry seeds out
In feldes, and in many greues
And eke a part she took of leaves
But thing, which might her most avail
She fo^de in Crete and in thessaile
In days, and nyghtes nine
To make with this medicine
She was purueyed of every piece
And torneth homward in to greece
Before the gates of Eson
Her chare she let away to gone
And took out first that was therein
For tho she thought to begin
Such thing, as seems impossible
And made her selfen inuysible
As she that with the air enclosed
And might of no man be disclosed
She took up turues of the land
without help of man's hand
And heled with the grene gras
Of which an Altar made there was
Unto Echates the goddess
Of art magyke and maistresse
And efte an other to invent
As she which did her holle intent
Tho took she feldwodde, and verueyne
Of herbs ben not better tweyne
Of which anon without let
These aulters ben about set
Two sundry pyttes fast by
She made, and with that hastily
A wether, which was black she slough
And out thereof the blood she drough
And did in to the pyttes two
warm milk, she put also thereto
with honey meynt, and in such wise
She began to make her sacrifice
And cried and prayde forth withal
To Pluto the god infernal
And to the queen Proserpyne
And so she sought out all the line
Of hem that longen to that craft
Behind was no name laft
And prayed hem all, as she well couth
To grant Eson his first youth
This old Eson brought forth was tho
Away she bad all other go
Upon peril, that might fall
And with that word they wenten all
And left there them two alone
And tho she began to gasp, and gone
And made signs many one
And said her words thereupon
And with spellynge, and her charms
She took Eson in both her arms
And made him for to sleep fast
And him upon her herbs cast
The black wether tho she took
And hew the flesh, as does the cook
On either altar part she laid
And with the charms that she said
A fire down from the sky alyght
And made it for to brenne light
And when Medea saw it brenne
Anon she began to sterte and run
The fyry aulters all about
There was no best, which goth out
More wild, than she seems there
About her shulders henge her here
As though she were out of her mind
And torneth in to another kind
Tho lay there certain wodde clefte
Of which the pieces now and efte
She made hem in the pyttes wete
And put hem in the fyry hete
And took the bronde with all the blase
And thries she began to raze
About Eson, there as he slepte
And efte with water / which she kept
She made a cercle about him thries
And efte with fire of sulphur twyes
Full many another thing she deed
which is not written in the stead
But she ran up so and down
She made many a wonder soune
Sometime lyche unto the cock
Sometime unto the lauerocke
Sometime cacleth as an hen
Sometime speaks as don the men
And right so as her iargon strangeth
In sundry wise her form changes
She seems fair, and no woman
Forth with the crafts that she can
She was as who says, a goddess
And what her list more or less
She did, in books as we find
That passes over man's kind
But who that woll of wonders here
what thing she wrought in this matter
To make an end of that she began
Such meruayl herd never man
Appointed in the new moan
when it was time for to done
She set a cauldron on the fire
In which was all the hole attire
where on the medicine stood
Of Iuse, of water, and of blood
And let it boil in such a plyte
Till that she sygh the spume white
And tho she cast in rynde, and rote
And sede, and flower, that was for bote
with many an herb, and many a stone
whereof she has there many one
And eke Cimpheius, the serpent
To her has all her scales lent
Chelidre her yafe her adders skyn
and she to boil cast hem in
And part eke of the borned oule
The which men here on nights houle
And of a raven, which was told
Of nine hundred winter old
She took the heed, with all the bylle
And as the medycine it will
She took herafter the bowele
Of the se foul, and for the bele
Of Eson with a thousand mo
Of things, that she had tho
In that caldron to gyder as blyue
She put, and took than of olyue
A dry branch hem with to stere
The which anon began flower and bear
And wax all fresshe, and grene again
when she this virtue had seyne
She let the leeste drop of all
Upon the bare flower down fall
Anon there sprung up flower and gras
where as the drop fall was
And wax anon all medowe grene
So that it might well be seen
Medea than knew and wist
Her medicine is for to tryst
And gothe to Eson there he lay
And took a sword was of assay
with which a wound upon his side
She made, that there out may slide
The blood within, which was old
And seek and trouble, feeble, and cold
And tho she took unto his use
Of herbs of all the best Iuse
And poured it in to his wound
That made his veins full and sound
And tho she made his wounds close
And took his hand and up he rose
And tho she yafe him drink a draught
Of which his youth again he caught
His heed, his heart, and his visage
Lyche unto twenty winter age
His hoar here is were away
And lyche unto the fresshe may
when passed been the cold shoures
Right so recouereth he his flowers.
Lo what might any man deuyse
A woman show in any wise
More hertely love in any stead
Than Medea to Jason deed
First she made him the flees to win
And after that from kyth and kyn
with great treasore with him she stale
And to his fader forth with all
His elde has turned in to youth
which thing none other woman couth
But how it was to her a quyt
The remembrance dwells yet
King Peleus his eme was deed
Jason bare croune on his heed
Medea has fulfilled his will
But when he should of right fulfill
The troth, which to her before
He had in the i will of Colchos swore
Tho was Medea most deceived
For he an other has received
which daughter was to king Creon
Creusa she hight, and thus Jason
As he that was to love untrue
Medea left, and took a new
But that was afterward so a bought
Medea with her art has wrought
Of cloth of gold a mantell rich
which seems worth a kings rich
And that was unto Creusa sent
In name of yefte, and of present
For systerhode hem was between
And when that young fresshe queen
That mantyl lapped her about
Anon thereof the fire sprange out
And brent her both flesh and bone
Tho came Medea to Jason
with both her sons on her hand
And said: O thou of every land
The most untrue creature
Lo this shall be thy forfayture
with that she both his sons slough
Before his eye, and he out drough
His sword, and would have slain her tho
But farewell she was ago
Unto Pallas the court above
where as she pleyneth upon love
As she that was with that goddess
And he was left in great distress
Thus might thou se, what sorrow it does
To swear a^ oath, which is not soth
In loves cause namely
My son be well ware for thy
And keep, that thou be not forswore
For this, which I have told tofore
Ouide tells every dele
My father I may leave it well
For I have herd it often say
How Jason took the flees aweye
Fro Colchos, But yet herd Inought
By whom it was first thither brought
And for it were good to here
If that you list at my prayere
Go tell I would you beseech.
My son, who that woll it seche
In books he may find it write
And netheles, if thou wolt wit
In the manner as thou have preyde
I shall the tell, how it is seyde.

The fame of thylke shepes fell
which in Colchos, as it befelle
was all of gold, shall never deye
whereof I think for to seye
How it came first in to that isle
There was a king in thylke while
Toward greece, and Athamas
The cronycke of his name was
And had a wife, which Niphyle^ hight
By whom, so as fortune it dight
He had of children young two
Frixus the first was of tho
A knave child, right fair with all
A daughter eke, the which men call
Hell, he had by his wife
But for there may no man's life
Endure upon this earth here
This worthy quen, as thou might here
Er that the children were of age
Took of her end the passage
with great worship and was begraue
what thing it lyketh god to have
It is great reason to ben his
For thy this king, so as it is
with great suffrance it vnderfongeth
And afterward, as him belongs
when it was time for to wedde
A new wife he took to bed
which Ino hight, and was a maid
And eke the daughter, as men said
Of Cadme, which a king also
was hold in thylke days tho.
when Ino was the kings make
She cast, how that she might make
These children to her father loath
And shope a wyle ayene hem both
which to the king was all unknow
A year or two she let do sow
The land with soden whete about
where of no corn may spryngen out
And thus by sleyght, and by couyne
Aros the derth, and the famyne
Through out the land in such a wise
So that the king a sacrifice
Upon the point of this distress
To Ceres, which is the goddess
Of corn, has shape him for to give
To look, if it may be foryeue
The mischief, which was in his land
But she, which knew tofore the hand
The circumstance of all this thing
Ageyn the coming of the king
In to the temple, has shape so
Of her accord, that all tho
which of the temple prestes were
Have said, and full declared there
Unto the king, but if so be
That he deliver the country
Of Phryxus, and of Hell both
with whom the gods ben so wroth
That while tho children be within
Such tylthe shall no man begin
whereof to get him any corn
Thus was it said, thus was it sworn
Of all the prestes, that there are
And she, which causes all this fare
Seyde eke thereto, what that she would
And every man than after told
So as the queen had hem preyde.
The king, which has his ere leyde
And leueth all, that ever he herd
Unto her tales thus answerde
And seyth, that lever is him to chese
His children both for to lose
Than him, and all the remenant
Of hem, which are appertenant
Unto the land, which he shall keep
And bade his wife to take keep
In what manner is best to done
That they delyuerde were sone
Out of this world, and she anon
Two men ordeyneth for to gone
But first she made hem for to swear
That they the children should bear
Unto the sea, that none it know
And hem therein both throw
The children to the sea ben lad
where in the wise, as Ino bad
These men be ready for to do
But the goddess, which Juno
Is bote, appears in the stead
And has unto the men forbede
That they the children naught ne slay
But bad hem look in to the sea
And taken head of that they syghen
There swam a sheep tofore her eyes
whose flees of burned gold was all
And this goddess forth with all
Commands, that without let
They should anon the children set
Above upon the shepes back
And all was do, right as she spak
whereof the men gone home again
And fell so, as the books seyne
Hell the young maiden tho
which of the sea was woe bego
For pure dread her heart has lore
That fro the sheep, which has her bore
As she that was swoune^de feynt
She fell, and has her self adreynt
with Phrixus and this sheep forth swam
Till be to the isle of Colchos came
where Juno the goddess he fond
which took the sheep unto the land
And set it there in such a wise
As thou tofore have herd devise
whereof came after all the woe
why Jason was forswore so
Unto Medee, as it is spoke.
My father who that has to broke
His troth, as ye have told above
He is not worthy for to love
Ne be beloved, as me seems
But every new love quemeth
To him, that newefangle is
And netheles now after this
If that you list to taken head
Upon my shryfte to proceed
In loves cause ayene the vice
Of couetyse and auaryce
what there is more, I would wit
My son this I find write
There is yet one of thylke brood
which only for the worlds good
To make a treasoure of money
Put all conscience aweye
whereof in thy confession
The name and the condition
I shall here afterward declare
which makes one rich, an other bare.
Plus capit usura sibi, quam debetur, et illud
Fraud collocata saebe latenter agit.
Sic amor excessus quam saepe suos ut auarus
Spirat et unius tres capit ipse loco.
Hic tractat de illa specie Auaricie, que vsura dicitur, cuius creditor in
pecunia ta^tum numerata plus quam sibi de iure debetur incrementum lucri
adauger.
Upon the benche syttende on hye
with Avarice usure I syghe
Full clothed of his own suit
which after gold makes chase and suit
with his brocours, that run about
Lyche unto ratches in a route
Such lucre is none above ground
which is not of tho ratches found
For where they see beyete sterte
That shall hem in no wise asterte
But they it drive in to the net
Of lucre, which Usure has set
Usure with the rich dwells
To all that ever he byeth and sells
He has ordained of his sleyght
Mesure double, and double weight
Outward he sells by the less
And with the more he makes his tasse
whereof his house is full within
He recheth naught be so he wyn
Though that there lose ten or twelve
His love is all toward him selue
And to none other but he se
That he may win such three
For where he shall ought give or lene
He woll ayenward take a been
There he has lent the small pese
And right so there ben many of these
Lovers, that though they love alyte
That skarsly would it weye a myte
yet would they have a pound ageyn
As does usure in his bargayne
But certes such usure vnlyche
It falls more unto the rich
Als well of love, as of beyete
Than unto hem, that been naught great
And as who says be^ simple and pouere
For seldom is, when they recouere
But if it be through great deserte
And netheles men se pouerte
with pursuit of countenance
Full often make a great cheuaunce
And take of love his advantage
For with the help of his brocage
That maken seem where is naught
And thus full often is love bought
For litel what, and mochell take
with false weightes that thy make
Now son of that I said above
Thou wotest what usure is of love
Tell me for thy what so thou wylt
If thou thereof have any gylte?
My father nay for ought I here
For of tho points ye tolden here
I will you by my troth assure
My weight of love, and my mesure
Has be more large / and more terteyne
Than ever I took of love again
For so yet couthe I never of sleyghte
To take again by double weyghte
Of love more than I have give
For also wys mote I be shryue
And have remission of sin
As so yet couth I never win
Ne yet so mochel soth to seyne
That ever I might have half again
Of so full love, as I have lent
And if mine hap were so well went
That for the hole I might have half
My thinks I were a goddess half
For where usure would have double
My conscience is not so trouble
I bid never as to my dele
But of the hole an haluen dele
That is none excess, as me thinks
But netheles it me forthynketh
For well I wot, that wol not be
For every day the better I see
That how so ever I give or lene
My love in place that I mean
For ought that ever I axe or crave
I can nothing ayenewarde have
But yet for that I wol not let
what so befalle of my beyete
That I ne shall give and lene
My thought and all my love so clean
That toward me shall naught believe
And if she of her good leave
Reward would me naught again
I wot the last of my bargeyne
Shall stand upon so great a lost
That I may never more the cost
Recover in this world till I dye
So that touchende of this party
I may me well excuse, and shall
And for to speak forth withal
If any brocour for me went
That point come never in mine intent
So that the more me meruayleth
what thing it is, my lady eyleth
That all mine heart, and all my time
She has, and do ne better hyme
I have herd said, that thought is free
And netheles in priuitie
To you my fader, that been here
Mine hole shrifte for to bear
I dare mine heart well disclose
Touchende usury, as I suppose
which, as ye tellen, in love is used
My lady may not been excused
That for o lokynge of her eye
Mine hole heart till I deye
with all that ever I may and can
She has me won to her man
whereof me thinks, good reason would
That she somdele reward should
And give a part, there she has all
I not what fall herafter shall
But in to now yet dare I seyne
Her list never give again
A goodly word in such a wise
whereof mine hope might arise
My great love to recompense
I not how she her conscience
Excuse wol of this measure
By large weight, and great measure
She has my love, and I have naught
Of that, which I have dear abought
And with mine heart I have it paid
But all this is aside laid
And I go loueles about
Her ought stand in full great doubt
Till she redress such a sin
That she wol al my love win
And yeueth me not to live by
Naught al so much, as grant mercy
Her list to seye, of which I might
Some of my great pain alyght
But of this point, lo thus I fare
As he that pays for his chaffare
And byeth it dear, and yet has none
So mote he needs pour gone
Thus bye I dear, and have no love
That I ne may naught come above
To win of love none encrece
But I me will ne the lose
Touchende usure of love acquit
And if my lady be to wit
I pray to god such grace her send
That she by time it mote amend
My son of that thou have answerde
Touchende usure, I have al herd
How thou of love have wonnen small
But that thou tellest in thy tale
And thy lady thereof accusyst
Me thiketh these words thou misusest
For by thyn own knowlechyng
Thou say, how she for one lokyng
Thy hole heart fro the she took
She may be such, that her o look
Is worth thine heart many fold
So have thou well thyn heart sold
when thou have that is more worth
And eke of that thou tellest forth
How that her weight of love uneven
Is unto thine, under the heaven
Stonden ever in even that balance
which stont in loves governance
Such is the statute of his law
That though thy love more draw
And peyse in the balance more
Tho might not ask ageyn therefore
Of duty, but all of grace
For love is lord in every place
There may no law him iustifye
By reddour / ne by company
That he ne wol after his will
whom that him lyketh save or spylle
To love a man may well begin
But whether he shall les or win
That wot no man, till at last
For thy coueyt not to fast
My son, but abide thyn end
Percase all may to good wend
But that thou have me told and said
Of o thing I am right well paid
That thou by sleyght, ne by gyle
Of no brocour, have otherwhyle
Engyned love, of such deed
Is sore venged as I read.
Hic ponit exemplum contra istos maritos, qui vltra id quod proprias habent
vxores, ad noue voluptatis in crementum, alias multeres superf^ne lucrari no^
vere^tur. Et narrat qualiter Juno vindictam suam in Ecco in huiusmodi mulierum
lucris adquirendis de co^silio mariti sui Ionis mediatrix exstiterat.
Brokers of love, that dceyuen
No wonder is though they receyuen
After the wrong, that they deseruen
For whom as ever that they seruen
And do pleasance for a while
yet at the last her own gyle
Upon her own heed descends
The which god of his ve^gea^ce sends
As by ensample of time ago
A man may find, it has be so
It selle some time, as it was seen
The high goddess and the queen
Juno tho had in company
A maiden full of treachery
For she was ever in acorde
with Jupiter, that was her lord
To get him other loves new
Through such brocage, and was untrue
All other wise than him needs
But she, the which no shame dredeth
with queynt words, and with slye
Blent in such a wise her ladys eye
As she, to whom that Juno tryst
So that thereof she nothing wist
But so privy may be nothing
That it ne comes to knowlechyng
Thing done upon the derke night
Is after known on days light
So it befelle, that at last
All that this slygh maiden cast
was over cast, and overthrow
For as the sothe mote be know
To Juno it was done understand
In what manner her husbonde
with falls brocage has taken usure
Of love, more than his mesure
when he took other than his wife
whereof this maid was gyltife
which had been of his assent
And thus was all the game shent
She suffered him, as she mote need
But the brocour of his misdede
She, which her counseile yafe thereto
On her is the vengeange do
For Juno with her words hot
This maiden, which Echo was hot
Reproves, and says in this wise:
O traytresse, of which service
Have thou thyn own lady served
Thou have great pain well deserved
Thy slygh words for to peynt
with flaterye, that is so queynt
Toward me, that am thy queen
whereof thou made me to wene
That my husbonde true were
when that he loves else where
All be it so, him needs naught
But upon the it shall be bought
The which art privy to tho doings
And me full often of thy lesynges
Deceived have: now is the day
That I thy while quite may
And for thou have to me counceled
That my lord has with other dealed
I shall the set in such a kind
That ever unto the worlds end
All that thou herest, thou shalt tell
And clappe it out, as does a belle
And with that word she was forshape
There may no vice her mouth escape
what man that in the world cries
withouten fail Echo replieth
And what word / that him lust to sayn
The same word she says again
Thus she, which whylome had leave
To dwell in chamber, mot belyue
In wodes and on bylles both
For such brocage as wives loath
which does her lords hertes change
And love in other places strange
For thy if ever it so befalle
That thou my son among all
Be wedded man, hold that thou have
For than all other love is waste
O wife shall well to the suffyse
And than if thou for couetyse
Of love would ask more
Thou should don again the lore
Of all hem that true be
My fader as in this degree
My conscience is naught accused
For I no such brocage have used
whereof that lust of love is won
For thy speaks forth, as ye begone
Of auyryce upon my shryft
My son I shall the branches shifte
By order as they ben set
On whom no good is well beset.
Pro uerbis uerba, minius pro munere reddi
Conuenit, ut pondus equa stateta gerat
Propterea Cupido non da^ sua dona cupido.
Nam qui nulla serit, gramina nulla mete^.
Hic tractat auctor super illa specie Auaricie, que parcimonia dictiur, cuius
natura tengx aliqualem sue substa^ntie porcionem, aut deo aut hominibus
participate nullatenus consentit.
Blind Auaryce of his lygnage
For counceylle, and for cosynage
To be witholde again largess
Has one, whose name is said scarsnesse
The which is keeper of his hows
And is so throughout auarous
That be no good let out of hand
Though god him self it would fond
Of yest should he no thing have
And if a man it would crave
He must than fail need
where god him self may not speed
And thus scarcenes in every place
By reason may no thonke purchase
And netheles in his degree
Above all other most pryue
with auaryce stant be this
For he governs that there is
In each astate of his office
After the reule of thylke vice
He takes, he keeps, he halt, he bynt
That lyghter is to flee the flynt
Than get of him in ba^d or neysshe
Only the value of a reysshe
Of good in helping of an other
Naught though it were his own brother
For in the cas of yefte and love
Stant every man for him alone
Him thinks of his vnkyndshype
That him needs no felawshyp
By so the bag and be accorden
Him rycheth naught what men recorde^
Of him, he it evil or good
For, ^ll his tru^^e is on his good
So that alone be falls often
when he best weneth stand alofte
Als well in love as other wise
For love is ever of some repryse
To him that woll his love hold
For thy my son, as thou art hold
Touchende of this tell me thy shryfte
Have thou be scarce or large of gift
Unto thy love to whom thou seruest
For after that thou well deseruest
Of gyfte^, thou might be the bette
For that good hold I well be set
For which thou might the better fare
Than is no wisdom for to spare
For thus men seyne in every need
He was wise, that first made mede
For where as mede may not speed
I not what helps other deed
Full often be fails of his game
That will with ydellbonde reclayme
His hawke / as many a nyce does
For thy my son tell me soth
And says the troth, if thou have be
Unto thy love or scarce, or fre?
My father it has stand thus
That if the treasour of Cresus
And all the gold of Octauyan
Forth with the richesse of Indian
Of perles and of rich stones
were all to gether mine at ones
I set it at no more account
Than would a bare straw amount
To give it her all in a day
Be so that to that sweet may
It might like more or less
And thus because of my largess
ye may well understand and leave
That I shall naught the worse acheue
The purpos, which is in my thought
But yet I yafe her never naught
Ne thereto durst a profre make
For well I wot, she woll naught take
And give woll she naught also
She is eschew of both two
And this I trow be the skylle
Toward me, for she ne will
That I have any cause of hope
Naught als much as a drope
But toward other as I may se^
She takes and yeueth in such degree
That as by wey of frendelyhede
She can so keep her womanhede
That every man speaks of her well
But she wol take of me no dele
And yet she wot well, that I would
give, and do both, what I should
To plesen her in all my might
By reason this wot every wight
For that may by no wey asterte
There she is master of the heart
She mote pe master of the good
For god wo^e well, that all my mode
And all mine heart, and all my thought
And all my good, while I have ought
Als freely as god has it give
It shall be hers, while I live
Right as her list, her selue command
So that it needs no demand
To ask of me, if I have be scarce
To love, for as to tho parse
I will answer, and sey no
My son that is right well do
For often time of scarceness
It has be sen, that for the less
Is lost the more, as thou shall here
A tale, like to this matere.
HIC LOQVITVR CON^^^ (...) / qui ^uaricia stricti largitatis been ^ici^ (...)
amoris causa confundunt. Et ponit exemplum qua^it^^^ Croceus largus et hilaris
Babionem ^^arum et tenacem de amore Viole / que pul^herrima fuit / donis
largissimis circumuenit.
Scarcenes and love acord never
For every thing is well the lever
when that a man has bought it dear
And for to speak in this matere
For sparynge of a little cost
Full often time a man has lost
The large cote for the hode
what man that searse is of his good
And wol not give, he shall naught take
with gift a man may undertake
The high god to plese, and quenie
with gift a man the world may deem
For every creature bo^e
If thou him give, is glad therefore
And every gladshyp as I find
Is comfort unto loves kind
And causes often a man to speed
So was he wise, that first yafe mede
For mede keeps love in house
But where the men be coueytous
And sparen for to give a part
They known naught Cupydes art
For his fortune, and his appryse
Disdeyneth all couetyse
And hates all nygardye
And for to look of this party
A sothe ensample / how it is so
I find write of Babio
which had a love at his menage
There was no fayrer of her age
And hight Viola by name
which full of youth / and full of game
was of her self / and large and fre
But such an other church as be
Men wysten naught in all the land
And had affayted to his hand
His servant / the which Spodius
was hot: and in this wise thus
The worlds good of suffisaunce
was had / but liking and pleasaunce
Of that belongs to richesse
Of love stood in great distress
So that this young lusty wight
Of thing, which fell to loves right
was evil served over all
That she was tho bego withal
Till that Cupyde and Venus eke
A medicine for the seek
Ordeyne wolden in this cas
So as fortune thanne was
Of love upon the destine
It fell right, as it should be
A fresshe, a free / a friendly man
That naught of avarice can
which Croceius by name hight
Toward this sweet cast his sight
And there she was came in in presence
She sygh him large of dispense
And amorous and glad of chere
So that her lyketh well to here
The goodly words, which he said
And thereupon of love he prayde
Of love was all that he meant
To love and for she should assent
He gafe her gifts ever among
But for men sayen, that mede is strong
It was well seen at thilke tide
For as it should of right betyde
This Vyola largess has take
And the nygarde she has forsake
Of Babio she will no more
For he was grutchende evermore
There was with him none other fare
But for to pinche, and for to spare
Of worlds mucke, to get encres
So goth the wretch loueles
Beiaped for his scarsite
And be that large was and fre
And set his heart to dispende
This Croceius his bow bend
which Venus took him for to bold
And shot as often as ever he would
Lo thus departs love his law
That what man woll naught be felawe
To give and spend, as I the tell
He is naught worthy for to dwell
In loves court to be relieved
For thy my son, if it be lieued
Thou shall be large of thy dispense
My father in my conscience
If there be any thing amys
I would amend it after this
Toward my love namely
My son well and redily
Thou say, so that well paid withal
I am, and further if I shall
Unto thy shrifte specify
Of avarice the progeny
what vice sueth after this
Thou shall have wonder how it is
Among the folk in any reign
That such a vice might reign
which is comune at all assayes
As men may find now a days.
Cuncta creatura deus, et qui cuncta creauit
Damnant ingrati dicta que facta uiri.
Non dolor a long stat, quo sibi talis amicam
Traxit, et in sine deserit esse suam.
Hic loquitur supra illa aborta specie auaricie, que ingratitudo dicta est
cuius condicioni non solum creator, sed etia^ cuncte creature abhominabilem
detestantur.
The vice like unto the fend
which never yet was man's friend
And cleped is vnkyndeshyp
Of Couyne, and of felaushyp
with avarice he is witholde
Him thi^keth he should naught ben hold
Unto the mother, which him bare
Of him may never man beware
He wol not know the merit
For that he would it not aquite
which in this world is mochel used
And few ben thereof excused
To tell of him is endeles
And thus I say netheles
where as this vice comes to land
There takes no man his thonke on bo^de
Though he with all his might serve
He shall of him no thonke deserve
He takes what any man will give
But while he has o day to live
He wol nothing reward again
He grutcheth for to give a greyne
where he has take a berne fulle
That makes a kind heart dulle
To set his trust in such frendeshyp
There as he fynt no kyndeshyp
And for to speak words pleyne
Thus here I many a man complain
That now on days thou shalt find
At need, few friends kind
what thou have done for hem tofore
It is forgetten, as it were lore
The books speken of this vice
And tellen, how that god of his Justice
By way of kind and eke nature
And every lyuis creature
The law also, who that it can
They dampne an unkind man
It is all one, to sey unkind
As thing, which done is again kind
For it with kind never stood
A man to yield evil for good
For who that would taken head
A be is glad of a good deed
And loves thylke creature
After the law of his nature
And which does him ease, and for to se
Of this matere authority
Full often time it has befalle
whereof a tale among us all
which is of old ensamplarie
I think for to specify.
Hic narrat quod bestie in fuis beneficiis hominem ingratum naturaliter
precellunt. Et ponit Exemplum de Adriano Rom^ senatore, qui in qua dam foresta
venationibus infistens, dum preda^ ^^^sequeretur in cifternam profundam nescia
fa^^^^ corruit, vbi super peruenie^s quida^ pauper ^^mine Bardus inmissa

To speak of an unkind man
I find, how whylome Adryan
Of Rome, which a great lord was
Upon a day as he par cas
To wode in his huntyng went
^t happens at a sodein went
After the chase as he pursues
Through hap, which no man escheweth
He fell unware in to a pyt
where that it might not be let
The pyt was deep, and he fell low
That of his men none might know
where he became, for none was nygh
which of his fall the mischief sygh
And thus alone there he lay
Clepende, and criende all the day
For socoure and deliverance
Till again eve it fell par chance
A while or it began to night
A pour man, which Bardus hight
Come forth walkende with his ass
And had gethered him a tasse
Of grene styckes and of dry
To selle, whom that would hem bye
As he, which had no lyuelode
But when he might such a lode
To town with his ass carye
And as it fell him for to tarry
That ylke time nyghe the pytte
And has the trusse fast knytte
He herd a voice, which cried dymme
And he his ere to the brymme
Has leyde, and herd it was a man
which said: O help here Adrian
And I will yeuen half my good
The pour man this understood
As he that would gladly wyn
And to this lord, which was within
He spoke and said: if I the save
what sikernes shall I have
Of covenant, that afterward
Thou wolt me give such reward
As thou behyghtest now before?
That other has his oaths swore
By heaven, and by the gods all
If that it might so befalle
That he out of the pyt him brought
Of all the goods, which he ought
He shall have even haluen dele
This Bardus seyde, he would well
And with this word his ass anon
He let untruss / and thereupon
Down goth the cord in to the pyt
To which he has at end knyt
A staff, whereby he said, he would
That Adryan him should hold
But it was tho per chance fallen
In to that pyt was also fallen
An ape, which at thylke trow
wha^ that the cord came down low
And suddenly thereto he skypte
And it in both his arms clypte
And Bardus with his ass anon
Him has up draw, and he is gone
But when he sygh it was an ape
He wend all had been a iape
Of fayery, and sore him dradde
And Adryan eft soon gradde
For help, and cryde and preyde fast
And he eft sone his cord cast
But when it came unto the ground
A great serpent it has by wound
The which Bardus anon up drough
And than him thought welynough
It was fantasyne that be herd
The voys, and he thereto answered
what wight art thou in gods name
I am (quod Adryan) the same
whose good thou shalt have even half
Quod Bardus than a gods half
The third time assay I shall
And cast his cord forth withal
In to the pyt, and when it came
To him, this lord of Rome it name
And thereupon him has adressed
And with his hand full often blessed
And than he had to Bardus hale
And he, which understood his tale
Between him and his ass all soft
Has drawn, and set him up a lofte
without harm all easily
He says not ones grant mercy
But straught him forth in to the cite
And let this pour Bardus be
And netheles this simple man
His covenant, so as he can
Has asked, and that other said
If it so be that he vpbrayde
Of ought, that has be spoke or do
It shall be venged of him so
That him were better to be deed
And he can tho no other read
But on his ass again he cast
His trusse, and hyeth homewarde fast
And when that he came home to bed
He told his wife, how that he sped
But finally to speak ought more
Unto this lord, he dradde him sore
So that one word he durst ne said
And thus upon the morrow again
In the manner, as I record
Forth with his ass, and with his cord
To gader wode, as he did er
He goth, and when that he came ner
Unto the place, where he would
He began his ape anon behold
which had gadred al about
Of styckes here and there a route
And leyde hem ready to his hand
whereof he made his trusse and bond
Fro day to day. and in this wise
This ape profreth his seruise
So that he had of wode enough
Upon a time and as he drough
Toward the wood, he sigh beside
The great ghastly serpent glyde
Till that she came in his presence
And in her kind a reverence
She has him do, and forth withal
A stone more bright than a Crystal
Out of her mouth to fore his way
She let down fall, and went away
For that he shall not be adrad
Tho was this pour Bardus glad
Thankende god, and to the stone
He goth, and takes it up anon
And has great wonder in his wit
How that the beast him has a quitte
where that the man's son has failed
For whom he had most trauayled
But all he put in gods hand
And torneth home, and what he fond
Unto his wife he has it shewde
And they that were both lewd
Acorden, that he should it selle
And he no longer would dwell
But forth anon upon the tale
The stone he profreth to the sale
And right as he him self it set
The ieweller anon forth fette
The gold, and made his payment
Thereof was no delayement
Thus wha^ this stone was bought and sold
Homward with joy many fold
This Bardus goth, and when he came
Hom to his hows, and that he nam
His gold out of his pours within
He fond his stone also therein
whereof for joy his heart playde
Unto his wife and thus he said
Lo here my gold, lo here my stone
His wife has wonder thereupon
And asks him how that may be
Now by my troth I not quod be
But I dare swear upon a book
Unto my merchant I it took
And he it had, when I went
So know I naught to what intent
It is now here, but it be gods grace
For thy to morrow in other place
I will it fond for to selle
And if it woll not with him dwell
But crepe in to my purse again
Than dare I sauely swear and seyne
It is the virtue of the stone
The morrow came, and he is gone
To seche about in other stead
His stone to selle, and so he deed
And left it with his chapman there
But when that he came else where
In presence of his wife at home
Out of his purs and that he nome
His gold fond, his stone withal
And thus it fell him oueral
where he it sold in sundry place
Such was the fortune and the grace
But so well may nothing be hyd
That it his at last kyd
This fame goth about Rome
So ferforth that the words come
^o the emperor Iustynyan
And he let send for the man
And asked him, how that it was
And Bardus told all the cas
How that the worm, and eke the best
Al though they made no biheste
His travail hadden well aquyt
But he, which had man's wit
And made his covenant by mouth
And swore thereto all that he couth
To part and give half his good
Has now foryete how that it stood
As he, which wol no troth hold
This emperor all that he told
Has herd, and thylke unkindness
He said, he would him self redress
And thus in court of judgment
This Adryan was than assent
And the quarrel in audience
Declared was in the presence
Of the emperor and many moo
whereof was mochel speech tho
And great wondering among the prese
But at last nethelese
For the party, which has pleyned
The law has demed, and ordained
By hem, that were auised well
That he shall have the haluen dele
Throughout of Adryans good
And thus of thylke unkind blood
Stant the memory unto this day
where that every wise man may
Ensamplen him, and take in mind
what shame it is, to ben unkind
Again the which, reason debateth
And every creature it hates
For thy my son in thy office
I read flee that ylke vice
For right as the cronycle seyth
Of Adryan how he his feyth
Foryate for worlds couetyse
Full often in such a manner wise
Of lovers now a man may se
Full many that unkind be
For well byhote, and euel last
That is her life, for at last
when that they have her will do
Her love is after soon ago
what say thou son to this cas
My fader I will say allas
That ever such a man was bore
which when he has his troth swore
And has of love what he would
That he at any time should
Ever after in his heart find
To sen fall and to ben unkind
But fader as touchend of me
I may not stond in that degree
For I took never of love why
That I ne may go thereby
And do my profit else where
For any speed I find there
I dare well thynken all about
But I ne dare not speak it out
And if I dorst, I would pleyne
That she, for whom I suffer pain
And love her ever a lyche hot
That another give ne byhote
In rewardynge of my service
Hit list her in no manner wise
I will not sey, that she is kind
And for to sey, she is unkind
That dare I not by god above
which demeth every heart of love
He wot, that on mine own side
Shall none unkindness abide
If it shall with my lady dwell
Thereof dare I no more tell
Now good father as it is
Tell me, what thinks you of this
My son of that vnkyndshyp
The which toward thy ladysshyp
Thou pleynest / for she woll the naught
Thou art to blamen of thy thought
For it may be, that thy desire
Though it brenne ever / as does the fire
Percase to her honor mysset
O rels time come naught yet
which stant upon thy destine
For thy my son, I read the
Think well, what ever the befall
For no man has his lusts all
But as thou toldest me before
That thou to love art naught forswore
And have done no unkindness
Thou might thereof thy grace bless
And leave naught that continuance
That there may be none such greuance
To love, as is vnkyndshyppe
whereof to keep thy worship
So as these old books tale
I shall the tell, a ready tale
Now harken, and be well ware thereby
For I will tell it openly.
Hic ponit exemplum contra viros amori ingratos. Et narrat qualiter Theseus
Aegei filius consilio fultus Adriane regis Minos filie in domo, que Laborinthus
dicitur, Minotaurum vicit, vnde Theseus Adriane sponsalie certissime promittens
/ ipsa^ vna cum Phedra sorore sua a Creta secu^ nauigio duxit Sed statim postea
oblito gratitudinis beneficio Adriadnam ipsum saluantem in insula Chion spretam
post tergu^ re fiquit. Et Phedram Athenis sibi sponsatam ingratus coronauit.
Minos, as tellen the poet
The which whylom was king of Crete
A son had, and Androchee
He hight, and so befelle that be
Unto Athenes for to lere
was sent, and so he bare him there
For that he was of high lignage
Such pride he took in his courage
That he foryeten has the schools
And in riot among the foles
He did many things wrong
And used thylke life so long
Till at last of that he wrought
He fond the mischief, which he sought
whereof it fell, that he was slain
His fader, which it herd said
was wroth, and all that ever he might
Of men of arms he him dyght
A strong power, and forth he went
Unto Athenis, where he brent
The plain country al about
The cities stood of him in doubt
As they that no defense had
Again the power, which he ladde
Egeus, which was there king
His counsel took upon this thing
For he was than in the city
So that of pees in to trete
Bitwene Mynos and Egeus
They fell, and been accorded thus
That king Mynos fro year to year
Receive shall as thou shall here
Out of Athenys for truage
Of men, that were of mighty age
Parsons nine: of which he shall
His will don in special
For vengeance of his sons death
None other grace there ne geth
But for to take the Iuyse
And that was don in such a wise
Upon which stood a wonder cas
For that time so it was
whereof that men yet read and sing
King Mynos had in his keeping
A cruel monster, as seyth the jest
For he was half man and half best
And Mynotaurus he was hot
which was begotten in a ryote
Upon Pasyphae his own wife
whiles he was out upon the strife
Of that great syege of Troy
But she, which lost has all joy
when that she syghe this monstre bore
Bad men ordeyne anon therefore
And fell that ilke time thus
There was a clerk, one Dedalus
which had been of her assent
Of that her lord, was so myswent
And he made of his own wit
whereof the remembrance is yet
For Mynotaure such a house
That was so strong, and meruaylous
That what man that within went
There was so many a sundry went
That he ne should naught come out
But gone amassed all about
And in this house to lock and ward
was Mynotaurus put in ward
That what life, that therein came
Or man or be be ouercam
And slough, and fed him thereupon
And in this wise many one
Out of Athenis for truage
Deuouted weren in that rage
For every year they shopen hem so
They of Athenis er they go
Toward that ilke woeful chance
As it was set in ordinance
Upon fortune her lotte they cast
Till that Theseus at last
which was the kings son there
Among other that there were
In thilke year, as it befelle
The lotte upon his chance fell
He was a worthy knight withal
And when he sygh his chance fall
H^ ^erde as though he took none head
But all that ever he might speed
with him / and with his felaushyp
Forth in to Crete he goth by ship
where that the king Mynos he sought
And profereth all that he him ought
Upon the point of her accord
This stern king, this cruel lord
Took every day one of the nine
And put him in to the discipline
Of Mynotaure to be devoured
But Theseus was so favored
That he was kept till at last
And the mean while he cast
what thing him were best to do
And fell / that Ariadne tho
which was the daughter of Mynos
And had herd the worthy los
Of Theseus, and of his might
And sygh he was a lusty knight
Her holle heart on him she laid
And he also of love her prayed
So ferforth, that they were alone
And she ordeneth, that anon
In what manner she should him save
And shope so, that she did him have
A clewe of threde, of which within
First at door he shall begin
with him to take that one end
Than when he would ageynward wend
He might go the same weye
And over this so as I seye
Of pytche she took him a pelote
The which he should in to the throat
Of Mynotaure cast right
Such wepen also for him she dyght
That he by reason may not fail
To make an end of his bataile
For she him taught in sundry wise
Tylle he was know of thylke empryse
How he this best should quelle
And thus shortly for to tell
So as this maiden him had taught
Theseus with his monster faught
And smote of his head, the which be nam
And by the thread, so as he came
He goth again, till he were out
So was great wonder all about
Mynos the tribute has releced
And so was all the werre seced
Between Athenys and hem of Crete
But now to speak of that sweet
The whose beauty was without wan
This fair maiden Adryan
when that she sygh Theseus sound
was never yet upon this ground
A gladder wight than she was tho
Theseus dwelt a day or two
where that Mynos great chere him did
Theseus in a preue sted
Has with this maiden spoke and rowned
That she to him was abandouned
In all that ever she couth
So that her lusty youth
All pryuely between hem twey
The first flower he took awey
For he so fair tho behyght
That ever while he live might
He should her take for his wife
And as his own bertes life
He would her love, and troth here
And she which might not forbere
So sore loves him again
That what as ever he would seyne
with all her heart she it leueth
And thus his purpose he acheuyth
So that assured of his troth
with him she went, and that was routh
Phedra her young suster eke
A lusty maid, a sobre, a meke
Fulfilled of all curtosye
For susterhode and company
Of love, which was hem between
To se her suster be made a queen
Her fader left, and forth she went
with him, which all his first intent
Forgot within a little throw
So that it was all over throw
when she best wend it should stand
The ship was blown fro the land
wherein that they sailend were
This Ariadne had mochel fere
Of that the wind so loud blewe
As she which of these ne knew
And praid for to rest a while
And so fell, that upon an isle
which Chio hight, they ben dreue
where he to her leave has give
That she shall land and take her rest
But that was nothing for her best
For when she was to land brought
She which that time thought naught
But all troth, and took no keep
Has laid her soft for to sleep
As she which long has been forwatched
But certes she was evil matched
And fer from all loves kind
For more than the best unkind
Theseus, which no troth kept
while that this young lady slept
Fulfilled of all vnkyndshyp
Has all forgeten the goodshyp
which Ariadne him had do
And had unto the shypmen tho
Hale up the sail, and naught abide
And forth he gothe the same tide
Toward Athenis, and her on land
He left, which lay nygh the stronde
Slepend, till that she awoke
But when that she cast up her look
Toward the stronde, and sygh no wight
Her heart was so sore aflyght
That she ne wist what to think
But drough her to the water brinke
where she beheld the sea at large
She sigh no ship, she sigh no barge
Als ferforth as she might kenne
Ha lord, she said, which a senne
As all the world shall after here
Upon this woeful woman here
This worthy knight has done and wrought
I we^d I had his love bought
And so deserved at need
when that he stood upon his dread
And eke the love, he me behyght
It is great wonder, how he might
Toward me now ben unkind
And so to let out of his mind
Thing, which he said his own mouth
But after this, when it is couth
And draw to the worlds fame
It shall ben hyndrynge of his name
For well he wot, and so wot I
He yafe his truth bodily
That he mine honor should keep
And with that word she began weep
And soroweth more than enough
Her fair tresses she to drough
And with her self she took such a strife
That she between the death and life
Swounende lay full often among
And all was this on him alonge
which was to love unkind so
whereof the wrong shall euermo
Stand in cronyke of remembrance
And eke it asks a vengeance
To ben unkind in loves cas
So as Theseus than was
All though he were a noble knight
For he the law of loves right
Forfayted has in all way
That Ariadne he put away
which was a great unkind deed
And after that, so as I read
Phedra, the which his sister is
He took instead of her, and this
Fell afterward to mekell tene
For thilke vice, of which I mean
Vnkyndshyp where it falls
The truth of man's heart it palleth
That he can no good deed acquyte
So may be stand of no merit
Toward god, and eke also
Men call him the worlds fo
For he no more than the fend
Unto none other man is friend
But all toward him self alone
For thy my son in thy person
This vice above all other flee
My fader as ye teache me
I think to do in this matere
But over this I would fayn here
whereof I shall me shryue more
My good son as for thy lore
After the reule of couetyse
I shall the propyrte deuyse
Of every vice by and by
Now harken, and be well ware thereby.

Hic ponit exemplum contra istos in amoris causa raptores, Et narrat qualiter
Pandyon tex Athen.ii. filias vez Progne^ and Philomena^ habuit: Progne autem
regi Tracie Therreo desponsata contigit, quod cum Tereus ad instantiam vxoris
sue Philomenam de Athen in Traciam sororie visitationis causa secum quadam vice
perduceret in concupiscentiam Philomene tanta seneritate in Itinere dilapsus
est, quod ipse non solum sue violentia rapine virginitatem eius oppressit, sed
et ipsius linguam, ne factum detegeret forcipe mitula nit, vnde imperpetue
memory ceonicam tanti raptoris austeritatem miro ordine dii postea vindicarunt.
There was a ryall noble king
A rich of all worlds thing
which of his propre enheritance
Athenis had in governance
And who so thinks thereupon
His name was king Pandyon
Two daughters had he by his wife
The which he loved as his life
The first daughter Progne hight
And the second, as she well might
was cleped fair Philomene
To whom fell after mochel tene
The father of his purueaunce
His daughter Progne would avarice
And ga^e her unto marriage
A worthy king of high lignage
A noble knight eke of his hand
So was he kyd in every land
Of Trace he hight Thereus
The clerk Ouide tells thus
This Thereus his wife home lad
A lusty life with her he had
Till it befelle upon a tide
This Progne, as she lay him beside
Bethought her, how that it might be
That she her suster might se
And to her lord her will she said
with goodly words and him preyde
That she to her might go
And if it lyked him not so
That than he would him self wend
Or else by some other send
which might her dear suster great
And shap^ (...) that they might mete
Her lord anon to that he herd
yafe his accord, and thus answerde
I will (said he) for thy sake
The wey after thy sister take
My self, and bring her, if I may
And she with that, there as she lay
Bigan him in her arms clyppe
And kyst (...) with her soft lyppe
And said* sire grant mercy
And he love after was ready
And took his leave for to go
In sorry time did he so
This Thereus goth forth to ship
And with him his felaushyppe
By see the right course he nam
Unto the country till he came
where Philomene was dwelling
And of her suster the tydynge
He rolde, and tho they weren glad
And mochel joy of him they made
The father and the mother both
To leave her daughter were loathe
But if they were in presence
And netheles at reverence
Of him that would him self travail
They would naught he should fail
And that they prayde, give her leave
And she that would not believe
In all have made her iare
Toward her suster for to fare
with Thereus, and forth she went
And he with his hole intent
when she was fro her friends go
Assottith of her love so
That his eye might he not witholde
That he ne must on her behold
And with the sight began desire
And set his own heart a fire
And fire, when it to towe approaches
To him anon the strength accrocheth
Till with his hete it be devoured
The towe ne may not be souccoured
And so the tyrant rauener
when that she was in his power
And he thereto saw time and place
As he that lost has all grace
Forgate, he was a wedded man
And in a rage on her he ran
Right as a wolf, that takes his pray
And she began to cry and pray
O father, o mother dear
Now help. but they ne might it here
And she was of to little might
Defense again so rude a knight
To make, when he was so wood
That he no reason understood
But held her under in such wise
That she ne might not arise
But lay oppressed and disesed
As if a Gous hawk had feysed
A bird, which durst not for fere
Remue, and thus this tyrant there
By cast her such thing, as men seyne
May never more be yolden again
And that was the virginite
Of such rauyn it was pity
But when she to her self come
And of her mischief head nome
And knew, how that she was no maid
with woeful heart thus she said
O thou of all men the werst
where was there ever man that derst
Do such a deed, as thou have do
That day shall fall, I hope so
That I shall tell out all my fylle
And with my speech I shall fulfylle
The wide world in bread and length
That thou have done to me by strength
If that I among the people dwell
Unto the people I shall it tell
And if I be within wall
Of stones closed, than I shall
Unto the stones clepe and cry
And tell hem thy felonye
And if I to the wodes wend
There shall I tell all and end
And cry it to the birds out
That they shall here it all about
For I so loud it shall rehearse
That my voice shall the heaven perce
That it shall sown in gods ere
A falls man, where is thy fere?
O more cruel than any be
How have thou holden thy behest?
which thou unto my suster made
O thou, which all love vngladest
And art ensample of all untrue
Now would god my suster knew
Of thyn untruth, how that it stood
And he than as a lion wode
with his unhappy bonds strong
He caught her by the tresses long
with the which he bo^de both her arms
That was a feeble deed of arms
And to the ground anon her cast
And out he clyppeth also fast
Her tongue with a pair of sheres
So what with blood and what with teres
Out of her eyes, and out of her mouth
He made her fair face uncouth
She lay swownynge unto the death
There was uneath any brethe
But yet when he her tongue refte
A little part thereof be left
But she withal no word may sown
But chitre, and as a bird iargowne
And nevertheless that wode hounde
Her body bent up fro the ground
And sent her there, as by his will
She should abide in prisone still
For ever mo, but now take heed
what after fell of this mysdede
when all this mischief was befall
This Thereus, that foul him fall
Unto his country home he tigh
And when he come his palais nigh
His wife already there him kept
when he her sigh anon he wept
And that he did for deceyte
For she began to ask him streyte
where is my suster: and he said
That she was deed, and Progne abraide
As she that was a woeful wife
And stood between her death and life
Because she herd such tydynge
But for she sygh her lord weeping
She wend naught but all troth
And had well the more routh
The perles were tho forsake
To her, and black clothes take
As she that was gentill and kind
In worship of her susters mind
She made a rich enterement
For she fond none amendment
To syghen or to sob more
So was there gyle under the gore
Now leave we this king and queen
And torn ayene to Phylomene
As I began to tell erste
when she came in to prison ferst
It thought a kings daughter strange
To make so sodeyne a change
Fro wealth / unto so great a woe
And she began to think tho
Though she by mouth nothing praide
within her heart thus she said
O thou almighty Iubyter
That hye syttest / and lokest far
Thou suffrest many a wrongful doing
And yet it is not thy willing
To the there may nothing ben hyd
Thou wost / how it is betyde
I would I had not be bore
For than had I naught forlore
My speech and my virginite
But good lord all is in the
when thou thereof wolte do vengeance
And shape my delyueraunce
And ever among this lady wept
And thought that she never kept
To be a worlds woman more
And that she wyssheth evermore
But often unto her sister dear
Her heart speaks in this manner
And said: O sister if ye knew
Of mine estate, ye would rewe
I trow, and my delyueraunce
ye would shape and do vengeance
On him / that is so falls a man
And netheles, so as I can
I will you send some tokenynge
whereof ye shall have knowlegynge
Of thing I wot that shall you loathe
The which you touches, and me both
And tho within a while as tyte
She wafe a cloth of sylke all white
with letters and imagery
In which was all the felony
which Thereus to her has do
And lapped it to gether tho
And set her signet thereupon
And sent it unto Progne anon
The messager, which forth it bare
what it amounted is naught ware
And netheles to Progne he goth
And privily takes her the cloth
And went again right as be came
The court of him none bid name
when Progne of Philomene herd
She would know how that it ferde
And opens that the man has brought
And wot thereby, what has be wrought
And what mischief there is befall
In swoune tho she began down fall
And efte arose, and began to stand
And efte she takes the clothe on hand
Beheld the letters and thymages
But at last, of such outrages
She said weeping is naught the boat
And swereth, if that she leave mote
It shall be venged other wise
And with that she began her auyse
How first she might unto her wyn
Her suster, that no man within
But only they, that were swore
It should know, and shope therefore
That Thereus nothing it wist
And yet right as her seluen list
Her sister was delivered sone
Out of prison, and by the moon
To Progne she was brought by night
when each of other had a sight
In chamber there they were alone
They maden many a pytous moan
But Progne most of sorrow made
which sigh her sister pale and fade
And specheles, and dishonored
Of that she had be defloured
And eke upon her lord she thought
Of that he so untruly wrought
And had his espousayle broke
She makes auowe it shall be wroke
And with that word she kneleth down
weeping in great devotion
Unto Cupyde and to Venus
She prayed, and said than thus
O ye, to whom no thing astert
Of love may, for every heart
ye know, as ye that been above
The god and the goddess of love
ye wyten well, that ever yet
withal my will, and all my wit
Sith first ye shope me to wedde
That I lay with my lord a bed
I have been true in my degree
And ever thought for to be
And never love in other place
But all only the king of Trace
which is my lord, and I his wife
But now allas this woeful strife
That I him thus ageynward find
The most untrue, and most unkind
That ever in ladys arms lay
And well I wot that he ne may
Amend his wrong, it is so great
For to little of me he let
when he mine own suster took
And me that am his wife forsook
Lo thus to Venus and Cupyde
She prayed, and ferthermore she cryde
Unto Apollo the highest
And said: O mighty god of rest
Thou do vengeance of this debate
My suster and all her estate
Thou wost, and how she has forlore
Her maydenhede, and I therefore
In all the world shall bear a blame
Of that my suster has ashame
That Thereus to her I sent
And well thou wost / that mine intent
was all for worship and for good
O lord that gyuest the lives fode
To every wight, I pray the here
These woeful systers, that been here
And let us naught to the ben loath
we ben thyn own women both
Thus plaineth Progne / and axeth wreche
And though her sister lack speech
To him that all things wot
Her sorrow is not the less hot
But he / that than herd them two
Him ought have sorowed euermo
For sorrow, which was hem between
with signs playneth Philomene
And Progne says / it shall be wreke
That all the world thereof shall speak
And Progne tho syckenes feyned
whereof unto her lord she pleyned
And preith, she mote her chamber keep
And as her lyketh wake and sleep
And he her grants to be so
And thus to gether ben they two
That would him but a little good
Now harken hereafter / how it stood
Of woeful auntres that befelle
These susters, that been both fell
And that was not on hem alonge
But only on the great wrong
which Thereus had hem do
They shopen for to venge hem tho
This Thereus by Progne his wife
A son has, which as his life
He loves, and I this he hight
His mother wist well she might
Do Thereus no more grieve
Than slay his child, which was so leave
Thus she that was as who says mad
Of woe, which has her ouerladde
without insyght of motherheed
Forgate pity, and lost dread
And in her chamber privily
This child without noise or cry
She slough, and hew him all to pieces
And after with diverse spieses
The flesh, when it was so to hew
She takes, and makes thereof a sewe
with which the fader at his mete
was served, till he had him ete
That he ne wist, how that it stood
But thus his own flesh and blood
Him self deuoureth again kind
As he that was to fore unkind
And than er that he were arise
For that he should been agryse
To shown him the child was deed
This Philomene took the head
Between two dysshes / and all wroth
Tho came forth the susters both
And setten it upon the board
And Progne than began the word
And seyde: O werst of all wykke
Of conscience whom no prykke
May stere, lo what thou have do
Lo here ben now we systers two
O rauener lo here thy preye
with whom so falsely on the weye
Thou have thy tyranny wrought
Lo now it is some dele abought
And better it shall: for of thy deed
The world shall ever sing and read
In remembrance of thy defame
For thou to love have done such shame
That it shall never be forgete
with that he sterte up fro the mete
And shoue the board in to the flore
And caught a sword anon, and swore
That they should of his hondes dye
And they unto the gods cry
Began, with so loud a steuene
That they were herd unto heuene
And in the twynkelyng of an eye
The gods, that the myschiefe seye
Her forms changed all three
Each of hem in his degree
was turned in to a bryddes kind
Dyuerselyche as men may find
After the state that they were ynne
Her forms were set a twynne
And as it tells in the tale
The first in to a nyghtyngale
was shape, and that was Philomene
which in the winter is not seen
For than be the leaves fall
And naked ben the busshes all
For after that she was a brydde
Her will was ever to be hyd
And for to dwell in pryue place
That noman should se her face
For shame, which may not be lassid
Of thing that was tofore passid
when that she lost her maydenhed
Forever upon her womanhede
(Though that the gods would her cha^g)
She thinks, and is the more strange
And holt her clos the winter day
But when the winter goth away
And that nature the goddess
will of her own fre largess
with herbs, and with flours both
The feldes, and the meadows clothe
And eke the woods, and the greues
Ben bylled all with grene leaves
So that a brydde her hyde may
Between March, Apryl, and May
She that the winter held her clos
For pure shame and naught aros
when that she sygh the bows thycke
And that there is no bare stycke
But all his hyd with leaves grene
To wode comes this Philomene
And makes her first yers flight
where as she syngeth day and night
And in her song all openly
She makes her plaint and says: O why
why ne were I yet a maid?
For so this old wise said
which understood, what she meant
Her notes ben of such intent
And eke they said, how in her song
She makes great joy and mirthe among
And s^yth: ba now I am a brydde
He now my face may ben hyd
Though I been lost my maydenhede
Shall no man se my chekes read
Thus medleth she with joy woe
And with her sorrow mirth also
So that of loves maladye
She makes diverse melody
And says: love is a woeful bliss
A wisdom, which can no man wysse
A lusty fever, a wound soft
This note she reherseth often
To hem / which understand her tale
Now have I of this nyghtyngale
which erst was cleped Philomene
Told all that ever would mean
Both of her form, and of her note
whereof men may the storye note
And of her suster Progne I find
How she was turned out of kind
In to a swalowe swyfte of wynge
which eke in winter lies swownynge
There as she may no thing be seen
But when the wodde is woxen grene
And ^omen is the summer tide
Tha flees she forth, and ginneth to chyde
And chetereth out in her langage
what falsehede is in marriage
And tells in a manner speech
Of Thereus the spouse breche
She wol not in the woddes dwell
For she would openlych tell
And eke for that she was a spouse
Among the folk she comes to house
To do these wives understand
The falshode of her husbonde
That they of hem beware also
For there be many untrue of tho
Thus ben the susters bryddes both
And ben toward the men so loathe
That they ne will for pure shame
To no man's hand be tame
For ever it dwells in her mind
Of that they fond a man unkind
And that was falls Thereus
If such one be among us
I note but his condition
Men say in every region
within town and eke without
Now reigns commonly about
And natheles in remembrance
I will declare / what vengeance
The gods hadden him ordained
Of that the susters hadden pleyned
For anon after he was changed
And from his own kind straunged
A lapwynke made he was
And thus he hoppeth on the gras
And on his heed there stont up right
A crest, in token of a knight
And yet unto this day, men seyth
A lapynke has lost his feyth
And is the bird falsest of all
Beware my son er the so fall
For if thou be of such couyne
To get of love by rauyne
Thy lust: it may the fall thus
As it befelle to Thereus
My father god forbede
Me were lever be fortrede
with wild horses / and to draw
Er I again love and his law
Did any thing, or loud or still
which were not my ladies will
Men sayen, that every love has dread
So follows it, that I her dread
For I her love, and who so dredeth
To plese his love and serve him needs
Thus may ye know by this skyll
That no rauyne done I will
Again her will, by such a wey
But while I live, I will obey
Abiding on her courtesye
If any mercy would her plye
For thy my father, as of this
I wot naught I have do amysse
But farthermore I you beseech
Some other point that ye me teache
And asks forth if there be ought
That I may be the better taught.

which sees naught, what shall after fall
That ylke vice, which men call
Of Robbery, he takes on hand
whereof by water and by land
Of thing, which other men beswynke
He gets him clothe, mete, and drink
Him retcheth naught, what he begin
Through theft, so that he may wyn
For thy to make his purchaas
He lies awaytende on the paas
And what thing that he sees there pass
He takes his part, or more or less
If it be worthy to be take
He can the pakkes well ransake
So privily bears none about
His gold, that he ne fynt it out
Or other jewel what it be
He takes it as his proprete
In wodes, and in feldes eke
Thus robbery goth to seek
where as he may his purchase find
And right so in the same kind
My good sone as thou might here
To speak of love in the mattere
And make a very resemblance
Right as a thief makes his cheuesance
And robs men's goods about
In wode and field, where he goth out
So been there of these lovers sum
In wild stedes where they come
And fynden there a woman able
And thereto place couenable
withouten leave er that they fare
They take a part of that chaffare
Ye though she were a shepeherdesse
Yet woll the lord of wantonness
Assay, all though she be unmeet
For other men's good is sweet
But thereof wot nothing the wife
At home, which loves as her life
Her lord, and sit all day wysshynge
After her lords home coming
But when that he comethe home at e^e
Anon he makes his wife believe
For she naught else should know
He tells her, how his hunt has blow
And how his bounds have well run
And how there shone a merry son
And how his hawks flowen well
But he wol tell her never a dele
How he to love untrue was
Of that he robbed in the pas
And took his lust under the shawe
Again love, an again his law
The which thing my son I the forbede
For it is an ungoodly deed
For who that takes by robberye
His love, he may not iustifye
His cause: and so fuloft sithe
For ones that he has been blythe
He shall ben after sorry thryes
Examples for such robberyes
I find written as thou shall here
Acordende unto this matere.
HIC LOQVITVR CONtra istos in amoris causa predones, qui cum suam furtiue
concupiscenciam aspirant, fortuna in contrarium operatur, Et narrat, quod cum
Neptunus quandam virginem nomine Cornicem solam iuxta mare deambulantem
opprimere suo furto voluisset, superueniens Pallas ipsam de manibus eius
virginitate seruata gracius liberauit.
I read how whilom was a maid
The fairest, as Ouyd said
which was in her time tho
And she was of the chamber also
Of Pallas, which is the goddess
And wife to Mars, of whom prowess
Is you to these worthy knights
For he is of so great myghtes
That he governs the battle
withouten him may naught avail
The strong bond, but he it help
There may no knight of arms yelpe
But he fight under his banere
But now to speak of my matere
This fair fresshe lusty may
Alone as she went on a day
Upon the stronde for to play
There came Neptunus in the way
which has these in governance
And in his heart such plesaunce
He took, when he this maiden sygh
That all his heart aros on high
For he so sodenlyche unware
Beheld the beauty, that she bare
And cast anon within his heart
That she him shall no way astert
But if be take in advantage
Fro thilke maid sum pyllage
Naught of the broches ne the rings
But of some other small things
He thought part, er that he went
And her in both his arms bent
And put his hand toward the cofre
where to rob he made a profre
That lusty treasour for to steal
which passes other goods feel
And cleped is the maydenheed
which is the flower of womanheed
This maid, which Cornyr by name
was hot, dredynge all shame
Sigh, that she might naught debate
And well she wist, he would algate
Fulfylle his lust of robbreie
Anon began to weep and cry
And said: O Pallas noble queen
Show now thy might, and let be seen
To keep and save mine honor
Help that I lose naught my flower
which now under thy key is look
That word was not so soon spoke
when Pallas shope recouyre
After the will and the desire
Of her, which a maid was
And sodeinly upon this cas
Out of her womanlyche kind
In to a bryddes lykenes I find
She was transformed forth withal
So that Neptunus nothing stall
Of such thing that he would have stole
with feathers black as any cole
Out of his arms in a throw
She flegh before his eien a crow
which was to her a more delight
To keep her maydenheed white
Under the wede of feathers black
In perles white than forsake
That no life may restore again
But this Neptune his heart in vain
Has upon robberye set
The bryd is iflowe, and he was let
The fair maid is him escaped
whereof for ever he was beiaped
And scorned of that he has lore
My son be thou ware therefore
That thou no maydenheed stele
whereof men se diseses feel
So as I shall the yet deuyse
Another tale thereupon
which fell by old days gone.
HIC ponit exemplum contra istos in causa ^^^ginitatis lose predones, et narrat
quod cum Calisto regis Lichaonis mire pulchritudinis filia suam virginitatem
Diane conseruandam castissima v^nisset, Et in siluam / que Tegea dicitur, inte^
^^^us ibidem nymphas moratura^ se transtu^^^^et, Jupiter virginis castitate^
subtili furto sur^^^^us, quendam filium, qui postea Archas no^^natus est, ex ea
genuit, vnde Juno in Cafistona^ ^^^^ns eius pulchritudinem in vrse turpissime
^^^^mitatem subito transfigurauit.
King Lichaon upon his wife
A daughter had, a goodly life
And cleue maiden of worthy fame
Calistona whose right name
was cleped, and of many a lord
She was besought, but her accord
To love might no man win
As she / which has no lust therinne
But swore within her heart, and said
That she woll ever ben a maid
wherefore to keep her self in pees
with such as Amadriades
were cleped woodmaydens tho
And with the nymphs eke also
Upon the spring of fresshe wells
She shope to dwell, and no where else
And thus came this Calistona
Into the wodde of Tegea
where she virginite behight
Unto Diane, and thereto plight
Her troth upon the bows grene
To keep her maydenheed clean
which afterward upon a day
was priuelyche stole away
For Jupiter through his queintyse
From her it took in such a wise
That sodenlyche forth withal
Her womb arose / and she to swall
So that it might not be hid
And thereupon it is betydde
That Dyane, which it herd tell
In prive place unto a well
with Nymphs al a company
was come, and in a ragery
She said, that she has would
And had that every maiden should
with her all naked has also
And tho began the privy woe
Calistona wex read for shame
But they that knew not the game
To whom no such thing was befalle
Anon they made hem naked all
As they nothing would hyde
But she withdrewe her ever aside
And netheles in the flode
where that Dyana her self stood
She thought to come vnperceyued
But thereof she was all deceived
For when she came a little nyghe
And that Dyana her womb syghe
She said: away thou foul be
For thine astate is not honest
This chaft water for to touch
For thou have take such a touch
which never may ben hole again
And thus goth she, which was forleine
with shame, and the Nymphs fled
Till when that nature her spedde
That of a son, which Archas
was named, she delivered was
And tho Juno, which was the wife
Of Jupiter (wroth and hastyfe
In purpose for to do vengeance)
Came forth upon thylke chance
And to Calistona she spoke
And set upon her many a lack
And said: a now thou art take
That thou thy work might not forsake
A thou ungoodly hypocryte
Thou art greatly for to wit
But now thou shall full sore abye
That ylke stelthe of mycherye
That thou have both take and do
whereof thy fader Lychao
Shall not be glad, when he it wot
Of that his daughter was so hot
That she has broken her chaste vow
But I the shall chastyse now
Thy great beauty shall be turned
Through which that thou have be mestorned
Thy large fro^te, thy eyes gray
I shall hem change in other way
And all the feture of thy face
In such a wise I shall deface
That every man the shall forbere
with that the likeness of a bear
She took, and was forshapen anon
within a time and thereupon
Befelle, that with a bow in bond
To hunte and game for to fond
In to that wood goth to play
Her son Archas, and in his way
It happeth that this here came
And when that he good head name
where that be stood under the bough
She knew him well, and to him drough
For though she had her form lore
The love was naught lost therefore
which kind has set under his law
when she under the wood shawe
Her child beheld, she was so glad
That she with both her arms sprade
As though she were in womanhed
Toward him come, and took none head
Of that he bare a bow bente
And he with that an arowe has bent
And began to teyse it in his bow
As he that can none other know
But that it was a best wild
But Jupiter, which would shylde
The mother, and the son also
Ordeyneth for hem both two
That they for ever were save
But thus my son thou might have
Ensample, how that it is to flee
To rob the virginite
Of a young innocent aweye
And over this by other weye
In old books as I read
Such roberye is for to dread
And namlyche of thylke good
which every woman that is good
Desires for to keep and hold
As whylome was by days old
For if thou here my tale well
Of that was tho / thou might somdele
Of old ensamples taken head
How that the flower of maydenhede
was thylke time hold in pris
And so it was, and so it is
And so it shall for ever stand
And for thou shalt it understand
Now harken a tale next sewende
How may denbede is to commend.
Hic loquitur de virginitatis commendatione, vbi dicit, quod nuper Imperatores
ob tanti status dignitatem virginibus cedebant in via.
Of Rome among the gestes old
I find, how that Valery told
That what man was tho emperor
Of Rome, he should done honor
To the virgyn, and in the weye
where he her mete, he should obey
In worship of virginity
which was tho a great dignity
Naught onelyche of the women tho
But of the chaste men also
It was commended ouerall
And for to speak in special
Touchend of men ensample I find
Hic loquitur qualiter Phirinus inuenu^ Rome pulcherimus / vt illesam sud
virginitate conserna ret, ambos oculos ernens vultus sui decore^ abho minabilem
constituit.
Phirinus which was of man's kind
Above all other the fayreste
Of Rome, and eke the comlyest
That well was her which him might
Behold / and have of him a sight
Thus was be tempted often sore
But for he would be no more
Among the women so coueyted
The beauty of his face streyted
He has, and put out both his eyes
That all women / which it seyne
That afterward of him ne rought
And thus his maydenheed he bought
So may I prove well for thy
Above all other under the sky
That maydenheed is for to preyse
who that the virtues would peyse
which, as the apocalipsis records
To Christ in heaven best accords
So may it show well therefore
As I have told it here to fore
In heaven, and eke in earth also
It is except to both two
Out of his flesh a man to live
Gregory has this ensample give
And says: it shall rather be told
Lyche to an angel many fold
Than to the life of man's kind
There is no reason for to find
But only through the grace above
In flesh without flesshely love
A man to live chaste here
And netheles a man may here
Of such / that have been er this
And yet there been, but for it is
A virtue, which is seldom won
Now I this matter have begone
I think tellen over more
which is my son for thy lore
If that the list to taken head
To trete upon the maydenheed
Vt ^osa de spinis spineto preualet orta
Et ^ilii flores cespite plura ualent:
Sic sibi uirginitas carnis sponsalia uincit
Aeternos flaetus quae fine labe parit.
The book seyth, that a man's life
Upon knyghthode in war and strife
Is set among his enemies
The freyle flesh, whose nature is
Ay ready for to spurn and fall
The first foman is of all
For thylke war is ready ay
It warreth night, it warreth day
So that a man has never rest
For thy is thylke knight the best
Through might and grace of gods sonde
which that battle may withstonde
whereof yet dwells the memory
Of hem, that some time the victory
Of thylke deedly war hadden
The high prowess, which they ladden
whereof the soul stood amended
Upon this earth it is commended
Hic loquitur, qualiter Vale^tinianus imperator eu^ ipse octo genarius plures
prouincias Romano Imperio belliger sub iugauit, dixit se super omnia magic
gandere de eo / quod contra sue carn^^ concupiscentiam victoriam optinuisset /
nam et ipse virgo oibu^ diebus vite sue castissimus permansu^.
An emperor by old days
There was, and he at all assayes
A worthy knight was of his hand
There was none such in all the land
But yet for all his vassellage
He stood unwedded all his age
And in cronyke as it is told
He was an hundred winter old
But when men would his deeds peyse
And his knyghthode of arms preyse
Of that he did with his hondes
when he the kings of the lands
To his subjection put under
Of all that preise has he no wonder
For he it set of none accounte
And said, all that may not amounte
Ayens a point which he has nome
That he his flesh has overcome
He was a virgyne / as he said
On that battle his prys he laid
Lo now my son auyse the
Ye fader all this may well be
But if all other deed so
The world of men were sone a go
And in the law a man may find
How god to man by wey of kind
Has set the world to multyplye
And who that woll him justify
It is enough to do the law
And netheles your good saw
Is good to keep, who so may
I wol naught there again say nay
My son take it as I say
If maydenheed be take away
without laws ordinance
It may not fail of vengeance
And if thou wolte the soth wyten
Behold a tale, the which is written
How that the king Agamemnon
when he the city of Lesbon
Has won, a maiden there he fond
which was the fairest of the land
In thylke time, that men wist
He took of her what him list
Of thing which was most precious
whereof that she was dangerous
This fair maid cleped is
Chryseys the daughter of Chrisys
which was that time in special
Of thylke temple pryncipall
where Phoebus had his sacryfyce
So was it well the more vice
Agamemnon was than in way
To Troywarde, and took a wey
This maiden, which he with him lad
So great lust in her he had
But Phoebus, which has great dysdein
Of that his maide^ was forlein
Anon as he to Troy came
Vengeance upon this deed he name
And sent a comune pestylence
They soughten than her euydence
And maden calculacion
To know in what condycion
This death came in so suddenly
And at last redyly
The cause and eke the man they fond
And forth with all the same stounde
Agame^non opposed was
which has known all the cas
Of the folly which he has wrought
And thereupon mercy they sought
Toward the god in sundry wise
with prayer and with sacrifyce
The maiden home ayene they send
And yafe her good enough to spend
For ever whiles she would live
And thus the sin was forgive
And all the pestylence seced
Lo what it is to ben encrecid
Of love / which is ylle won
It were better naught begone
Than take a thing without leave
which thou most after needs leave
And yet have m^^gre forth with all
For thy to robben ouerall
In loves cause if thou begin
I not what ease thou shall win
My son be well ware of this
For thus of robbery it is
My father your examplarie
In loves cause of robbery
I have it right well understand
But over this how so it stand
yet wol I wit of your apprise
what thing is more of couetyse
Insidiando latens tempus rimatur et lioram
Fur quibus occulto tempore furta parat:
Sic amor insidiis vacat et sub tegmine ludos
Prendere furtiuos nocte fauente quear.
Hic tractat super illa cupiditatis specie, que secretum latrocinium dicitur /
citius natura cusio die rerum nesciente ea que cupit / tam per diem quam per
nocte^ absque strepitu claneulo furatur.
with couetyse yet I find
A servant of the same kind
which stelth is hot / and mycherie
with him is ever in company
Of whom if I shall tell sothe
He stalketh as a pecocke does
And takes his preye so couerte
That no man wot it in aperte
For when he wot the lord from home
Than woll he stalk about and come
And what thing he fynt in his wey
when that he sees the men awey
He steals it and goth forth withal
That thereof no man know shall
And eke full often he goth a night
without moan or sterre light
And with his craft the door vnpiketh
And takes therein what him lyketh
And if the door be so shette
That he be of his enter let
He will in at the wyndowe crepe
And while the lord is fast a sleep
He steleth, what thing him best list
And goth his wey er it be wist
Full often also by light of day
Yet woll he steal, and make assay
Under the cote his hand he put
Till he the man's pure have cut
And ryfely that he fynt therein
And thus he auntreth him to win
And hereth an horn and naught ne blows
For no man of his counsel knows
what he may get of his mychynge
It is all bylle under the wynge
And as an hounde that goth to fold
And has there take what he would
His mouth upon the gras be wypeth
And so with feyned chere him slypeth
That what as ever of sheep be strangle
There is no man thereof shall iangle
And for to know who it deed
Right so does stelthe in every stead
where as him list his preye take
He can so well his cause make
And so well feyne and so well gloss
That there ne shall no man suppose
But that he were an innocent
And thus a man's eye he blent
So that this craft and may remeue
withouten help of any meue
There be lovers of that degree
which all her lust in priuete
As who says getten all by stelth
And often atteynen to great wealth
And for the time that it lasts
For love awayteth ever / and casts
How he may stele, and catch his pray
when he thereto may find a way
For be it night, or be it day
He takes his part, when that he may
And if he may no more do
yet woll he stele a cusse or two
My son what say thou thereto
Tell if thou dyddest ever so
My father how? My son thus
If thou have stole any cusse
Or other thing / which thereto lo^geth
For no man such thieves bongeth
Tell on for thy, and says the troth
My father nay / and that is routh
For by my will, I am a thief
But she, that is to me most lefe
yet durst I never in priuete
Naught ones take her by the kne
To steal of her, or this, or that
And if I durst I wot well what
And netheles but if I lie
By stelth ne by robbery
Of love, which fell in my thought
To her did I never naught
But as men seyne, where heart is failed
There shall no castle be assailed
But though I had hertes ten
And were as strong as all men
If I be not mine own man
And dare not vsen, that I can
I may my self not recouere
Though I be man never so pouere
I bear an heart, and hire it is
So that me fails wit in this
How that I should of mine accord
The servant led against the lord
For if my foot would awhere go
Or that my hand would else do
what that my heart is there ayeyne
The remenant is all in vein
And thus me lacks all well
And yet ne dare I nothing steel
Of thing, which longs unto love
And eke it is so high above
I may not well thereto areche
But if so be a time of speech
Full selde, if than I stele may
A word or two, and go my way
Betwixt her high estate and me
Comparyson there may none be
So that I feel, and well I wot
All is to heavy and to hot
To set on hand without leave
And thus I mot algate leave
To stele that I may not take
And in this wise I mote forsake
To ben a thief again my will
Of thing, which I may not fulfylle
For that serpent, which never slept
The flees of gold so well ne kept
In Colchos, as the tale is told
That my lady a thousand fold
Nys better emed, and bewaked
where she be clothed / or be naked
To keep her body night and day
She has awardeyn ready ay
which is so wounderfull a wight
That him ne may no man's might
with swerd ne with no wepon daunte
Ne with no sleyght of charm enchant
whereof be might be made tame
And Danger is his right name
which under lock, and under key
That no man may it stele awey
Has all the tresour ynder fonge
That unto love may belong
The lest lokynge of her eye
May not be stole, if he it sey
And who so grutcheth for so lyt
He would soon set a wit
On him, that would stele more
And that me greueth wonder sore
For this proverb is ever new
That strong locks maken true
Of hem that wolden stele and pyke
For so well can there no man slyke
By him ne by no other mean
To whom Danger wol give or lene
Of that tresour he has to keep
So though I would stalk and crepe
And wait on eve, and eke on morrow
Of Danger shall I nothing borowe
And stele well ne may I naught
And thus I am right well bethought
while Danger stont in his office
Of stelth, which ye clepe a vice
I shall be gylty never mo
Therefore I would he were ago
So fer, that I never of him herd
How so that afterward it ferde
For than I might yet percas
Of love make some purchase
By stelth, or by some other way
That now fro me stont fer away
But fader as ye told above
who stelth goth a night for love
I may not well that point forsake
That often times I ne wake
On nyghtes, when that other sleep
But how, I pray you take keep
when I am lodged in such a wise
That I by night may arise
At some wyndowe and loken out
And se the howsynge al about
So that I may the chamber know
In which my lady, as I trow
Lies in her bed, and slepeth soft
Than is mine heart a thief full often
For there I stand and behold
The long nyghtes / that been cold
And think on her, that lies there
And than I wisshe, that I were
Als wise as was Nectauabus
Or else as was Protheus
That couthen both of Nigronance
In what likeness in what semblaunce
Right as him list him self transform
For if I were of such a form
I sey than I would flee
In to her chamber for to se
If any grace would fall
So that I might under the palle
Some thing of love pyke and stele
And thus I think thoughts feel
And though there of no thing be soth
yet ese as for a time it does
But at last when I find
That I am fall in to my mind
And se / that I have stand long
And have no profit vnderfonge
Than stalk I to my bed within
And this is all that ever I win
Of love, when I walk on night
My will is good, but of my might
Me lacks both / and of my grace
For who so that my thought embrace
yet have I naught the better ferde
My father Lo, now have ye herd
what I by stelth of love have do
And how my will has be thereto
If I be worthy to penance
I put it to your ordinance
My son of stelth I the behete
Though it be for a time sweet
At end it does but little good
As by ensample how that it stood
whylome, I may the tell now
I pray you father tell me how
My son of him, which goth die day
By wey of stelthe to assay
In loves cause, and takes his pray
Ouide said, as I shall say
And in his Methamor he told
A tale, which is good to hold.
Hic in amoris causa super isto latrocinio, quod de nocte contingit / ponit
exemplum. Et narrat, quod cum Leucothea Orcami filia in cameris sub arcta
matris custodia virgo presernabatur, Phoebus eius pulchritudinem concupiscens in
conclaue bomus elata luce subintra^s, virginis pudiciciam matre obsente
deflorauit, vnde ipsa inpregnata iratus pater filiam suam ad sepeliendum vinam
effodit, ex cuius tumulo florem quem solsequium vocant, dicu^t tunc
co^seque^ter primitus accreuisse.
The poet, upon this matere
Of stelth, wrote in this manner
Venus, which has the law in hand
Of thing, which may not be withsto^de
As she, which the tresoure to ward
Of love, has within her ward
Phoebus to love has so constreyned
That he without rest is peyned
with all his heete to coueyte
A maiden / which was warded streyte
within chamber, and kept so cloos
That seldom was / when she discloos
Goth with her mother for to play
Leuchothea, so as men say
^his maiden hight, and Orchamus
Her father was: and befelle thus
This daughter, that was kept so dear
And had be fro year to year
Under her mothers discipline
A clean maid, and a virgin
Upon the wose nativity
Of comely heed, and of beauty
Nature has set all that she may
That lyche unto the fress he may
which other months of the year
Sourmounteth: so without pere
was of this maiden the feyture
whereof Phoebus out of measure
Her loves, and on every side
Awayteth, if so may betyde
That he through any sleyght might
Her lusty maydenheed unright
The which were all his worlds wealth
And thus lurkynge upon his stelth
In his awayte so long he lay
Till it befell upon a day
That he through out her chamber wall
Came in all sodeynlych, and stall
That thing, that was to him so liefe
But woo the while, he was a thief
For Venus, which was enemy
Of thylke loves mychery
Discouerith all the pleyne caas
To Clymene, which than was
Toward Phoebus his concubyne
And she to let the couyne
Of thylke love, dedely wroth
To pleyn upon this maid she goth
And told her father how it stood
whereof for sorrow well nyghe wode
Unto her mother thus he said:
Lo what it is to keep a maid?
To Phoebus dare I nothing speak
But upon her it shall be wreke
So that these maidens after this
Mow take ensample, what it is
To suffer her maydenhede be stole
whereof that she the death shall thole
And bad with that, to make a pytte
wherein he has his daughter set
As he that woll no pity have
So that she was all quyke begraue
And deide anon in his presence
But Phoebus, for the reverence
Of that she had been his love
Has wrought, through his power above
That she spronge up out of the molde
In to a flower, was named gold
which stonte governed of the son
And thus when love is evil won
Full often it comethe to repentayle
My fader that is no marvel
when that the counceyll is bewreyed
But often time love has pleyed
And stolle many a pryue game
which never yet came in to blame
what that the things weren hid
But in your tale as it betydde
Venus discovers all the cas
And eke also broad day it was
when Phoebus such a stelthe wrought
whereof the maid in blame he brought
That afterward he was so lore
But for ye sayden now to fore
How stelth of love goth by night
And does his things out of sight
Thereof me lust also to here
A tale lyche to the matere
whereof I might ensample take
My good son for thy sake
So as it befelle by days old
And so as the poet it told
Upon the nyghtes mycherye
Now harken a tale of poesye
HIC PONIT EXEMPLVM super eodem, quod de nocte contingit. Et narrat qualiter

concupiscentie voluptatem, nesciente Hercule furari posset. Et cum ad lectum
Herculis muliebri palpata vest ex casu peruenisset, putans Iolen fuisse,
cubiculum nudo corpore ingreditur: quem sencie^s Hercules manibus apprehe^sum
ipsum ad terram ita fortiter allisit, vt impote^s sui corporis effectus vsque
mane ibidem requieuit, Vbi Saba cum Nym phis siluestribus superueniens ipsum
sic illusum deridebat.
The myghtiest of all men
when Hercules with Iolen
which was the love of his courage
To gether upon a pylgremage
Toward Rome shulden go
It fell hem by the way so
That they upon a day a cave
within a roche founden have
which was ryall and glorious
And of entayle curious
By name, and Thophis it was hot
The son shone tho wonder hot
As it was in the somer tide
This Hercules, which by his side
Has Iolen his love there
when they at thylke cave were
He said, he thought it for the best
That she her for the beat rest
All thylke day, and thylke night
And she that was a lusty wight
It lyketh her all that he seyde
And thus they dwell yet and pleyde
The long day, and so befyll
This cave was under the hill
Of Tmolus, which was begrowe
with vynes, and at thylke throw
Faunus with Saba the goddess
By whom the large wilderness
In thylke time stood governed
were in a place, as I am learned
Nyghe by, which Bachus wode hight
This Faunus took a great insyght
Of Iolen, that was now nyghe
For when that he her beauty syghe
Out of his wit he was assoted
And in his heart it has so noted
That he forsook the Nymphs all
And said, he would, how so it fall
Assay an other for to win
So that his heart thought within
He set, and cast, how that it might
Of love pyke away by night
That he by day in other wise
To stele might not suffyce
And thereupon his time he awayteth
Now take good head how love affaireth
Him, which with all is overcome
Fair Iolen when she was come
with Hercules in to the cave
She said him, that she would have
His clothes of, and hirs both
And each of hem should other cloth
And all was do right as she bad
He has her in his clothes clad
And cast on her his golion
which of the skyn of a lion
was made, as he upon the weye
It slough, and over this to pleye
She took his great mace also
And knyt it at her gyrdell tho
So was she lyche the man arrayed
And Hercules than has assayed
To clothen hem in her array
And thus they iape forth the day
Tylle that her souper ready were
And when they hadden souped there
They shopen hem to go to rest
And as it thought hem for the best
They bad, as for thylke night
Two sundry heddes should be dyght
For they togeder lygge nolde
By cause that they offer would
Upon the morrow her sacryfyce
The servants dydden her office
And sundry beds made anon
wherein that they to rest gone
Each by hem self in sundry place
Fair Iolen has set the mace
Besides her beds heed above
And with the clothes of her love
She hylled all her bed about
And he, which nothing had in doubt
Her wymple wonde about his cheke
Her kyrtell, and her mantell eke
Abroad upon his bed he spredde
And thus they slepen both a bed
what of travail, what of wine
The servants like to dronken swyne
Began for to route fast
This Faunus, which his stelth cast
was than comen to the cave
And fond they were all save
without noise, and in he went
The derke night his sight blent
And yet it happed him to go
where Iolen a bed tho
was laid alone for to sleep
But for he would take keep
whose bed it was, he made assay
And of a lion, where he lay
The cote he found, and eke he feleth
The mace, and than his heart keleth
That there durst he not abide
But stalketh upon every side
And sought about with his hand
That other bed till that he fond
where lay bewympled a vysage
Tho was he glad in his courage
For he her kyrtell fond also
And eke her mantell both two
Bespredde upon the bed alofte
He made him naked than, and soft
Into the bed unware he crepte
where Hercules that time slepte
And wend well it were she
And thus instead of Iole
Anon he profreth him to love
But he, which felt a man above
This Hercules him threw to ground
So sore, that they have him found
Lyggende there upon the morrow
And tho was naught a little sorrow
That Faunus of him self made
But else they were all glade
And lough him to scorn about
Saba with Nymphs all a route
Came down to look, how that it ferde
And when that they the soth herd
He was beiaped ouerall
My son be thou ware with all
To seche such mycheryes
But if thou have the better aspyes
In aunter if the so betyde
As Faunus did thylke tide
whereof thou might be shamed so
Mine holy fader certes no
But if I had right good leave
Such mycherye I think leave
My faint heart woll not serve
For maugre would I not deserve
In thylke place, where I love
But for ye tolden here above
Of couetyse and his pyllage
If there be more of that lygnage
which touches to my shryfte I pray
That ye thereof me would say
So that I may the vice eschew
Son if I by order show
The vices as they stand a row
Of couetyse, thou shall know
There is yet one, which is the last
In whom there may no virtue last
For he with god him self debateth
whereof that all the heaven him hates
Sacrilegus tantum furto loca sacra prophanat
Vt sibi sint agri, fic domus alma dei,
Nec locus est, in quo no^ temptat amans, quod amat
Si quae posse nequit, carpere velle capit.
Hic tractat super vltima Cupiditatis specie, que sacrilegium dicitur, cuius
furum ea que altissimo sanctificantur bona depredans ecclesie tantum spoliis
insidiatur.
The high god, which all good
Purueyed has for man's fode
Of clothes and of mete and drink
Bade Adam, that he should swynke
To getten him his sustenaunce
And eke he set an ordinance
Upon a law of Moses
That though a man be haueles
yet shall be not by theft stele
But now a days there ben feel
That woll no labor undertake
But what they may by stelth take
They hold it sykerlyche won
And thus the law is ouerronne
which god has set, and namely
with hem that so untruly
The goods rob of holy church
The theft, which they than wyrche
By name is cleped Sacrylege
Again the whom I think allege
Upon the points as we ben taught
Stont Sacrylege, and else naught
The first point is for to say
when that a thief shall stele away
The holy thing from holy place
The second is if he purchase
By way of theft unholy thing
which he upon his knowleyginge
Fro holy place away took
The third point, as says the book
Is such, as where as ever it be
In wodde, in field, or in cite
Shall no man stele by no wise
That hallowed is to the seruyse
Of god, which all things wotte
But there is another cold ne hot
which he for god or man woll spare
So that the body may well fare
And that he may the world escape
The heaven him thinks is but a iape
And thus the soth for to tell
He riseleth both book and belle
So forth with all the remenaunt
To gods hows appertinaunte
where that he should bydde his bid
He does his theft in holy stead
And takes what thing he fynt therein
For when be sees, that he may wyn
He wondeth for no cursidnesse
That been breketh the holiness
And does to god no reverence
For be has lost his conscience
That though the priest therefore corse
He seyth, he fares not the worse
And for to speak it other wise
what man that lasseth the fraunchyse
And takes of holy church his pray
I not what bedes he shall pray
when he fro god, which has yiue all
The purpartie in special
which unto Christ him self is due
By nemeth, he may not well eschew
The pain coming afterward
For he has made his forewarde
with sacrilege for to dwell
which has his heritage in hell
Hic tractat precipue de tribus sacrilegis, quorum vnus fuit Antiochus, alter
Nabuzardan, tertius Nabugodonosor.
And if we read of tholde law
I find write in thylke law
Of princes, how there weren three
Culpable sore in this degree
That one of hem was cleped thus
The proud king Antiochus
That other Nabuzardan hight
which of his cruelte behyght
The temple to distroye and waste
And so he did in all haste
The thrydde, which was after shamed
was Nabugodonosor named
And he Jerusalem put under
Of sacrilege and many a wonder
There in the holy temple he wrought
which Balthazar his heir abought.
Nota de scripta in pariete tempore regis Balthazar que fuit, Mane Techel
Phares.
when Mane Techel Phares write
was on the wall, as thou might wit
So as the bible it has declared
But for all that it is naught spared
yet now a day, that men ne pylle
And maken argument and skylle
To sacrilege as it belongs
For what man that there after longs
He takes none head what he does
And if a man shall tell soth
Of gyle, and of subtyltie
Is none so slygh in his degree
To feyne a thing for his beyete
As is this vice of which I trete
He can so priuiliche pyke
He can so well his words slyke
To put away suspecion
That in his excusation
There shall no man defaute find
And thus full often men be blind
That stonden of his word deceived
Er his queintise be perceived
But netheles yet other while
For all his stelth, and all his gyle
Of that he would his work forsake
He is atteynt, and overtake
whereof thou shalt a tale read.

Er Rome came to the creance
Of Christis feyth it fell perchance
Caesar, which tho was emperor
Him list for to done honor
Unto the temple Apollinis
And made an image upon this
The which was cleped Apollo
was none so rich in Rome tho
Of plate of gold a herd he had
The which his breast all over spradde
Of gold also without fail
His mantell was of large entayle
Be set with perrey all about
Forth right he straught his finger out
Upon the which he had a ring
To seen it was a rich thing
A fine carbuncle for the nones
Most precious of all stones
And fell that time in Rome thus
There was a clerk one Lucius
A courtier, a famous man
Of every wit somewhat he can
Out take that him lacks reule
His own estate to guide and rule
How so it stood of his speaking
He was not wise in his doing
But every ryote at last
Mote needs fall, and may not last
After the need of his deserte
So fell this clerk in pouerte
And wist not how for to rise
whereof in many a sundry wise
He cast his wits here and there
He looks nygh, he looks far
Till on a time that he come
Into the temple, and head nome
where that the god Apollo stood
He sygh the riches, and the good
And thought he would by some wey
The treasure pycke and stele away
And thereupon so sleyghly wrought
That his purpose about he brought
And went awey vnaperceued
Thus has the man his god deceived
His ring, his mantell, and his berd
As he which nothing was aferd
All privily with him he bare
And when the wardeyns were ware
Of that her god despoiled was
Hem thought it was a wonder cas
How that a man for any well
Durst in so holy place stele
And namely so great a thing
This tale came unto the king
And was through spoken ouerall
But for to know in special
what manner man has do the deed
They soughten help upon the need
And maden calculacion
whereof by demonstracion
The man was found with the good
In judgment and when he stood
The king has asked of him
Sey thou vnsely Lucius
why have thou done this sacrilege?
My lord if I the cause allege
Quod he ayene, me thinks this
That I have do nothing amiss
Three points there ben, which I have do
whereof the first point stant so
That I the ring have take away
Unto that point this woll I say
when I the god beheld about
I sygh / how he his hand straught out
And profred me the ring to give
And I, which would gladly live
Out of pouerte, through his largess
It vnderfange, so that I guess
And thereof am I naught to wit
And ouermore I woll me quyte
Of gold that I the mantell took
Gold in his kind, as says the book
Is heavy both and cold also
And for that it was heavy so
Me thought it was no garnement
Unto the god convenient
To clothen him the summer tide
I thought upon that other side
How gold is cold, and such a clothe
By reason ought to be loathe
In winter time for the chele
And thus thynkende thoughts feel
As I mine eye about cast
His large berde than at last
I sygh, and thought anon therefore
How that his father him before
which stood upon the same place
was berdles, with a yongly face
And in such wise, as ye have herd
I took away the sons berde
For that his father had none
To make hem lyche, and here upon
I ask for to ben excused
Lo thus where sacrilege is used
A man can feyne his conscience
And right upon such evidence
In loves cause if I shall trete
There ben of such small and great
If they no leyser find else
They wol not wonde for the belles
Ne though they se the priest at mass
That wol they leten ouerpasse
If that they find her love there
They stand and tell in her ere
And ask of god none other grace
while they ben in that holy place
But er they gone some advantage
There will they have, and some pyllage
Of goodly words, or of beheste
Or else they take at least
Out of her hand a ring or glove
So nygh the weder they will houe
As who says she shall not foryet
Now I this token of her have get
Thus halowe they the hye feste
Such theft may no church areste
For all is lefull that hem lyketh
To whom that else it myslyketh
And eke right in the self kind
In great cytees men may find
This lusty folk, that make hem gay
And wait upon the holy day
In churches, and in mynstres eke
They gone the women for to seek
And where that such one goth about
To fore the fairest of the route
where as they sytten all a rewe
There will he most his body show
His crooked kempt, and thereupon set
An ouche, with a chapelet
Or else one of grene leaves
which late come out of the greues
All for he should seem fressh
And thus he looks on his flesh
Right as an hawk, which has a sight
Upon the foul, there he shall light
And as he were a fayrye
He shows him to for her eye
In holy place where they sytte
Al for to make her hertes flytte
His eye no where woll abide
But look and pry on every side
On her and her, as him best lyketh
And other while a monge he syketh
Thinks one of hem that was for me
And so there thynken two or three
And yet he loves none of all
But where as ever his schaunce fall
And netheles to sey a soth
The cause why that he so does
Is for to stele an heart or two
Out of the church er that he go
And as I said it here above
All is that sacrylege of love
For well may be that he steleth awey
That he never after yield may
Tell me for thy my son anon
Have thou do sacrylege or none
As I have said in this manner
My fader as of this matere
I will you tell redyly
what I have do, but truly
I may excuse mine intent
That I never yet to church went
In such manner as ye me shryue
For no woman that is on live
The cause why I have it last
May be, for I unto that craft
Am nothing able for so stele
Though there be women not so feel
But yet will I not sey this
when I am there my lady is
In whom lies holy my quarele
And she to church / or to chappele
woll go to matens or to mess
That time I wait well and guess
^o church I come, and there I stand
A^^ though I take a book on hand
(...) countenance is on the book
(...) toward her is all my look
(...) is fall, that I pray
Unto my god, an somewhat say
Of pater noster, or of creed
(...) is for that I would speed
So that my bid in holy church
There might some miracle wirche
^y ladys heart for to change
which ever has he to me so strange
So that all my devotion
And all my contemplacion
with all mine heart and my courage
Is only set on her image
And ever I wait upon the tide
If she look any thing aside
That I me may of her auyse
Anon I am with couetyse
So smite, that me were lefe
To be in holy church a thief
But not to stele a vestement
For that is nothing my talent
But I would stele, if that I might
A glad word, or a goodly sight
And ever my service I profere
And namely when she woll gone offer
For than I led her, if I may
For somewhat would I stele away
when I beclyppe her on the wast
Yet at lest I stele a taste
And other while grant mercy
She says and so win I thereby
A lusty touch, a good word eke
But all the remenant to seek
Is fro my purpos wonder far
So may I say, as I said err
In holy church if that I wowe
My conscience I would allow
Be so that up amendment
I might get assygnement
where, for to speed in other place
Such sacrilege I hold a grace
And thus my father soth to say
In church right as in the way
If I might ought of love take
Such hansell have I naught forsake
But finally I me confess
There is in me no holiness
while I her se in holy stead
And yet for ought that ever I deed
No sacrilege of her I took
But if it were of word or look
Or else if that I her frede
when I toward offrynge her led
Take thereof what I take may
For else bear I naught away
For though I would ought else have
All other things been so save
And kept with such a privilege
That I may do no sacrilege
God wot my will netheles
Though I must needs keep pees
And maugre mine so let it pass
My will thereto is not the less
If I might other wise away
For thy my father I you pray
Tell what you thinks thereupon
(...) I thereof have gylte or none
Thy will my son is for to blame
The remenant is but a game
That I have the told as yet
^ut take this lore in to thy wit
That all thing has time and stead
The church serves for the bid
The chamber is of an other speech
But if thou wystest of the wreche
How sacrilege it has abought
Thou would bettre be bithought
And for thou shalt the more amend
A tale I will on the dispende
Hic in amoris causa super istius vicii articulo ponit exemplum, Et narrat pro
eo quod Paris Priami regis filius Helenam Menelai vxorem in quadam Grecie
Insula a templo Veneris sacriligus abduxit, illa Troie famosiffima obsidia per
vniuersa orbis climita diuulgata precipue cansabat, ita quod huiusmodi
sacrilegium non solum ad ipsius regis Pitami, omniumque fuorum interitum / sed
ad perpetuam vrbis desolacionem vindicte fomitem ministrabat.
To all men, as who says, know
It is, and in the world through blow
How that of Troy Lamedon
To Hercules, and to Jason
when toward Colchos out of Greece
By se seylend upon a piece
Of land of Troy rest preyde
But he wrothfully comeyde
And for they found him so vylleyne
when they came into greece again
with power, that they get might
Toward Troy they hem dyght
And there they took such vengeance
whereof stant yet the remembrance
For they destroyed king and all
And leften but the brent wall
The greeks of Troyens many slow
And prisoners they took inowe
Among the which there was one
The kings daughter Lamedon
Essiona the fair thing
which unto Thelamon the king
By Hercules, and by thassent
Of all the holle parliament
was at his will give and granted
And thus has Greece Troy daunted
And home they turn in such manner
But after this, now shall thou here
The cause why this tale I tell
Upon the chances that befelle
King Lamedon, which deide thus
He had a son one Priamus
which was naught thilke time at home
But when he herd of this he come
And fond how the city was fall
which he began anon to wall
And made there a city new
That they, which other lands knew
Tho seyden that of lyme and stone
In all the world so fair was none
And on that o side of the town
The king let make Ilion
That high toure, that strong place
which was adrad of no manace
Of quarcle, nor of none engyne
And though men wolden make a mine
No man's craft it might approach
For it was set upon a roche
The walls of the town about
Hem stood of all the world no dout
And after the proportion
Six gates were there of the town
Of such a form, of such entayle
That hem to se was great marvel
The dyches weren broad and deep
A few meirit might keep
From all the world, as seems tho
But if the gods weren fo
Great prees unto that city drough
So that there was of people enough
Of burgeys that therein dwellen
There may no man's tunge tellen
How that city was rich and good.
when all was made, and all well stood
King Priamus tho him bethought
what they of greece whilom wrought
And what was of her sword devoured
And how his suster deshonoured
with Thelamon away was lad
And tho thynkende he waxte vnglad
And set anon a parliment
To which the lords were assent
In many a wise there was spoke
How that they myghten been a wroke
But at the last netheles
They saiden all, accord and pees
To setten every part in rest
It thought hem than for the best
with reasonable amendment
And thus was Anthenor forth sent
To ask Esyona again
And witten what they would seyne
So passes he the sea by barge
To greece, for to sey his charge
The which he said redyly
Unto the lords by and by
But where he spoke in greece about
He herd not but words stout
And namelyche of Thelamon
The maiden would he not forgone
He said for no manner thing
And had him gone home to his king
For there gate he none amend
For ought he couth do or send
This Anthenor ayene goth home
Unto his king, and when he come
He told, in greece of that be herd
And how that Thelamon answerde
And how they were at her above
That they wol neither pees ne love
But every man shall done his best
But for men seyen, that night has rest
The king bithought him all that night
And erely when the day was light
He took his council of this matere
And they accord in this manner
That he withouten any let
A certain time should set
A parliament to ben auysed
And in this wise it was auysed
Of parliament he set a day
And that was in the month of May
This Priamus had in his yght
A wife, and Hecuba she byght
By whom that time eke had he
Sons five, and daughters three
Besyden hem and thyrty mo
And weren knights also tho
But not upon his wife begete
But else where he might hem get
Of women, which he had know
Such was the world that ^ilke th^^^^
So that he was of children rich
So thereof was no man him lyche
Of parliament the day was come
There been lords all and some
Tho was pronounced and purposed
And all the cause was hem disclosed
How Anthenor in greece ferde
They sytten all still and herd
And tho spoke every man about
There was alleged many a doubt
And many a proud word spoke also
But for the most part as tho
They wysten, not what was the best
Or for to war, or for to rest
But he that was without fere
Hector among the lords there
His tale told in such a wise
And said: Lords ye ben wise
Ye known this / as well as I
Above all other most worthy
Stant now in greece the manhod
Of worthynes and of knyghthod
For who so will it well agrope
To hem belongs all Europe
which is the third part even
Of all the world under the heaven
And we be but of folk a few
So were it reason for to eschew
The perel, er we fall therein
Better is to leave than begin
Thing, which as may not ben acheued
He is not wise / that find him grieved
And does so, that his grieve be more
For who that looks all tofore
And woll not se, what is behind
He may full often his harms find
wycke is to strive, and have the worse
we have encheson for to corse
This wot I well, and for to hate
The greeks, but er that we debate
with hem, that been of such a might
It is full good, that every wight
Be of him self right well bethought
But as for me thus say I naught
For while that my life woll stand
If that ye take werre in hand
Fall it to the best, or to the werst
I shall my seluen be the ferst
To greuen hem, what ever I may
I wolle not ones say nay
To thing, which that your cou^ceil demeth
For unto me well more it quemeth
The werre certes than the pees
But this I say netheles
As me belongs for to say
Now shape ye the best way
when Hector has said his auyse
Next after him tho spoke Paris
which was his brother, and aleyed
what him best thought, thus he said
Strong thing it is to suffer wrong
And suffer shame is more strong
But we have suffered both two
And for all that yet have we do
what so we might to reform
The pees, when we in such a form
Sent Anthenor, as ye well know
And they her great words blow
Upon her wrongful deeds eke
And who that woll not him self meke
To pees, and list no reason take
Men seyn reason will him forsake
For in the multitude of men
Is not the strength, for with ten
It has be seen in true quarele
Ayene an bonderd false, dele
And had the better of gods grace
Thus has befalle in many place
And if it like unto you all
I will assay how so it fall
Our enemies if I may grieve
For I have caught a great believe
Upon a point I wol declare
This ender day as I began fare
To hunte unto the great heart
which was tofore mine hounds sterte
And every man went on his side
Him to pursewe, and I to ride
Began to chase, and sooth to say
within a while out of my way
I rode, and nyst where I was
And sleep me caught, and on the grass
Beside a well I leyd me down
To sleep, and in a vysyon
To me the god Mercurye came
Goddesses three with him he nam
Minerue, Venus, and Juno
And in his hand an apple tho
He held of gold, with letters write
And this he did me to wit
How that they put hem upon me
That to the fairest of hem three
Of gold that apple should I give
with each of hem, tho was I shryue
And each one fair me behyght
But Venus said, if that she might
That apple of my yefte get
She would it neuermore foryete
And said, how that in greece land
She would bring in to mine hand
Of all this earth the fairest
So that me thought it for the best
To her and yafe the apple tho
Thus hope I well, if that I go
That she for me woll so ordeyne
That they matere for to pleyne
Shull have, or that I come ayene
Now have ye herd, that I woll seyne
Say ye, what stant in your auys
And every man tho said his
And sundry causes they record
But at last they accord
That Paris shall to greece wend
And thus the parliament took end,
Cassandra when she herd of this
The which to Paris sister is
Anon she began to weep and weyle
And said alas, what may us eyle
Fortune with her blind whele
Ne woll naught let us stand well
For this I dare well undertake
That if Paris his way take
As it is said, that he shall do
we ben for ever than undo
The which Cassandra than hight
In all the world as it bears sight
In books, as men find write
Is that Sibille, of whom ye wit
That all men yet clepen sage
when that she wist of this viage
How Paris shall to greece fare
No woman might worse fare
Ne sorrow more than she did
And right so in the same stead
Ferde Helenus, which was her brother
Of prophecy and such another
And all was hold but a iape
So that the purpose, which was shape
Or were hem lefe, or were hem loathe
was hold: and in to Greece goth
This Paris, with his retenance
And as it fell upon his chance
Of Greece he londeth in an isle
And him was told, the same while
Of folk / which he began to freyne
Tho was in thyle queen Heleyne
And eke of countrees there about
Of ladies many a lusty route
with mochel worthy people also
And why they comen theder tho
The cause stood in such a wise
For worship and for sacrifyce
That they to Venus wolden make
As they to fore had undertake
Some of good will, and some of bihest
For than was her by he fest
within a temple, which was there
when Paris wist, what they were
Anon he shope his ordinance
To gone to done his obeisance
^o Venus, on her holy day
And did upon his best array
with great richesse he him behongeth
(...) to such a lord belongs
He was naught armed netheles
B^t as it were in land of pees
And thus he goth forth out of ship
And takes with him his felaushyp
(...) such manner, as I you say
Unto the temple he held his way
Tydyng / which goth ouerall
To great and small forth withal
Come to the queen's ere, and told
How Paris came, and that he would
Do sacrifice to Venus
And when she herd tell thus
She thought / how that it ever be
That she will him abide and se
Forth comes Paris with glad visage
In to the temple on pilgremage
where unto Venus the goddess
He yeueth, and offreth great richesse
And prays her, that he pray would
And than aside he began behold
And se, where that this lady stood
And he forth in his fresshe mode
Goth there she was, and made her chere
As he well couth in his manner
That of his words such plesance
She took, that all her aqueyntance
Als ferforth as the heart lay
He stale / er that he went away
So goth he forth, and took his leave
And thought anon, as it was eve
He would done his sacrilege
That many a man should it abedge
when he to ship ayene was come
To him he has his counsel nome
And all devised the matiere
In such a wise, as thou shall here
within night all privily
His men he warns by and by
That they be ready armed sone
For certain thing, which is to done
And they anon ben ready all
And echone other began to call
And went hem out upon the stronde
And took a purpose there a land
Of what thing that they wolden do
Toward the temple and forth they go
So fell it of devotion
Heleyne in contemplacion
with many an other worthy wight
was in the temple and woke all night
To bydde and pray unto thymage
Of Venus, as was than usage
So that Paris right as him list
In to the temple er they it wist
Came with his men all suddenly
And all at ones set askry
In hem, which in the temple were
For tho was much people there
But of defense was no boot
So suffren they, that suffer mote
Paris unto the queen went
And her in both his arms bente
with him, and with his felaushyp
And forth they here her unto ship
Up goth the sail, and forth they went
And such a wind fortune hem sent
Till they the haven of Troy caught
where out of ship anon they straught
And gone hem forth toward the town
The which came with processyon
Ayene Paris, to seen his pray
And every man began to say
To Paris, and to his felaushyp
All that they couthen of worship
was none so little man in Troy
That he ne made myrthe and joy
Of that Paris had wonnen Heleyne
But all that myrthe is sorrow and pain
To Helenus, and to Cassandre
For they it tolden shame and sklaundre
And loss of all the common grace
That Paris out of holy place
By stelth has take a man's wife
whereof he shall lose his life
And many a worthy man thereto
And all the city be for do
which never shall be made ayene
And so it fell, right as they seyne
The sacrilege, which he wrought
was cause, why the greeks sought
Unto the town, and it belay
And wolden never part away
Till what by sleight, and what by strength
They had it wonnen in bread and length
And burnt / and slain, that was within
Now se my son such a sin
Is sacrilege in holy stead
Beware therefore, and bid thy bid
And do nothing in holy church
But that thou might by reason worche
And eke take bid of Achilles
when be unto his love chees
Polixena, that was also
In holy temple of Apollo
which was the cause why he dyede
And all his lust was leyde aside
And Troylus upon Crescyde
Also his first love leyde
In holy place, and how it ferde
As who seyth, all the world it herd
Forsake he was for Dyomede
Such was of love his last mede
For thy my son I would read
By this emsample as thou might read
Seche else where thou will thy grace
And ware the well in holy place
what thou to love do or speak
In aunter if it so be wreke
As thou have herd me tell to fore
And take good head also therefore
Upon the form of auaryce
More than of any other vice
I have divided in parties
The branches, which of companyes
Through out the world in general
Be now the leders over all
Of couetyse, and of perjury
Of falls brocage, and of usury
Of scarcenes, and of vnkyndeshyp
which never drough to felaushyp
Of robberye and of pryue stelth
which due is for the worlds wealth
Of rauyne and of sacrylege
which makes the conscience agrege
All though it may riches atteyne
It floureth but it shall not greyne
Unto the fruit of ryghtwysnes
But who that would do largess
Upon the reule, as it is yeu
So might a man in troth live
Toward his god, and eke also
Toward the world for both two
Largess awayteth as bylongeth
To neither part, that he ne wrongeth
He keeps him self, he keeps his fre^des
So stant he saufe to both his ends
That he excedeth no measure
So well he can him self measure
whereof my son thou shall wit
So as the philosophe has write.
Prodigus et parcus duo sunt extremaque largus
Est horum medius plebis in ore bonus.
Nota hic de virtute largitatis que ad oppositu^ auaricie inter duo extrema
videlicet percimonia^ et prodigalitem specialiter consistit.
Betwyx the two extremities
Of vice, stont the properties
Of virtue, and to preue it so
Take avarice, and take also
The vice of prodigalite
Betwyx hem liberalite
(which is the virtue of largess)
Stant, and governs his noblesse
For tho two vices in discord
Stand ever, as I find of record
So that between her two debate
Largess rules his astate
For in such wise as avarice
As I tofore have told the vice
Through streit holding, and through scarsnesse
Stant contrary to largess
Right so stant prodigalite
Reuers, but naught in such degree
For so as avarice spares
And for to keep his treasour cares
That other all his own and more
Ayene the wise man's lore
yeueth and dispendeth here and there
So that him recheth never where
while he may borowe, he woll dispende
Till at last he says, I wend
But that is spoken all to late
For than is pouerte at gate
And takes him even by the sleue
For erst woll he no wisdom leave
And right as avarice is sin
That would his treasour keep and win
Right so is prodigalite
But of largess in his degree
which even stant between the two
The high god and man also
The virtue each of hem commends
For he him seluen first amendeth
That over all his name spredeth
And to all other, where it needs
He yeueth his good in such a wise
That he makes many a man arise
which else should fall low
Largess may not ben unknow
For what land that he reigns inn
It may not fail for to win
Through his desert love and grace
where it shall fail in other place
And thus between to much and lyte
Largess, which is naught to wit
Holt ever forth the myddel way
But who that wol torn away
Fro that, to prodigalyte
Anon he leueth the propyrte
Of virtue, and goth to the vice
For in such wise as Auaryce
Leueth for scarsenes his good name
Right so that other is to blame
which through his wast mesur excedeth
For no man wot what harm it bredeth
while that a man has good to give
with great rowtes he may leave
And has his friends ouerall
And eueryche of him tell shall
The while he has his full pack
They say: a good felawe is Jack
when it fails at last
Anon his price they ouercast
For than is there none other law
But Jack was a good felawe
when they him pour and nedy see
They let him pass, and fair well he
All that he wend of company
Is than turned to folly
But now to speak in other kind
Of love, a man may such find
That where they come in every rowte
They cast and wast her love about
Tylle all her time is ouergone
And than have they love none
For who that loves ouerall
It is no reason, that he shall
Of love have any propyrte
For thy my son auyse the
If thou of love have be to large
For such a man is not to charge
And if it so be, that thou have
Dyspended al thy time in wast
And set thy love in sundry place
Though thou the substance of thy grace
Lose at the last it is on wonder
For he that put him seluen under
As who says, common over all
He leseth the love special
Of every one, if she be wise
For love shall noughe bear his prise
By reason / when it passes one
So have I sen full many one
That were of love well at ese
which after fell in great dysese
Through wast of love, that they spent
In sundry places where they went.
Right so my son I ask of the
If thou with prodigalite
Have here and there thy love wasted?
My father nay, but I have tasted
In many a place, as I have go
And yet love I never one of tho
But for to drive forth the day
For leueth well, my heart is ay
withouten mo for evermore
All upon one, for I no more
Desire, but her love alone
So make I many a prive moan
For well I feel I have dispended
My long love, and not amended
My speed: for ought I find yet
If this be wast unto your wit
Of love and prodigalite
Now good father demeth ye
But of o thing I will me shryue
That I shall for no love thryue
But if her self will me releue.
My son that I may well leave
And netheles me seems so
For ought that thou have yet mysdo
Of time, which thou have spended
It may with grace ben amended
For thing which may be worth the cost
Perchance is another wast ne lost
For what thing stant on adventure
That can no worlds creature
Tell in certain, how it shall wend
Till he thereof may seen an end
So that I note as yet therefore
If thou my son have won or lore
For often time, as it is seen
when summer has lost all his grene
And is with winter wast and bare
That him is left nothing to spare
All is recovered in a throw
The cold wyndes ouerblowe
And stylled ben the sharp shoures
And sodeinlyche ayene his flowers
The summer happens, and is rich
And so percase thy grace is lyche.
My son though thou be now pouer
Of love: yet thou might recover
My fader certes grant mercy
ye have me taught so redyly
That ever while I live shall
The better I may be ware with all
Of thing, which ye have said er this
But evermore how that it is
Toward my shryfte, as it belongs
To wit of other points me longs
whereof that ye me wolden teache
with all my heart I you byseche.
Explicit liber quintus.
HIG IN SEXTO LIBRO tractare intendit de illo capitali vicio, quod gula
dicitur, nec non et eiusdem duabus solummodo speciebus, videlicet ebrietate et
delicacia / ex quibus humane concupiscencie oblectamentum habund anciue
augmentatur.

Incipit liber Sextus.
Est gula, que nostrum maculauit prima parentu^
Ex verito pomo quo dol et omnis homo,
Haec agit, vt corpus animae contraria spi^^^
Quo caro fit crassa, spiritus atque macer.
Intus et exterius si quae virtutis habentur
Potibus ebrietas conuiciata ruit.
Mersa sapore labis, q^ Bacchus inebriat hospes,
Indignata Venus oscula raro premit.
THe great sin original
which every man in general
Upon his birth has enuennomed
In paradys it was mystimed
when Adame of thylke appel bote
His sweet morcell was to hot
which dedly made the mankind
And in the books as I find
This vice, which so out of rule
Has set us all, is cleped Gule
Of which the branches ben so great
That of hem all I wol not treat
But onlyche as touchende of two
I think to speak and of no mo
whereof the first is dronkeshyp
which bears the cup felaushyp
Full many a wonder does that vice
He can make of a wysman nyce
And of a fool, that him shall seem
That he can all the law deem
And give every judgment
which longs to the fyrmament
Both of the sterre, and of the moon
And thus he makes a great clerk sone
Of him, that is a lewd man
There is no thing, which he ne can
while he has dronkeshyp on hand
He knowethe the sea, he knowethe the stro^de
He is a noble man of arms
And yet no strength is in his arms
There he was strong inowe tofore
with dronkeshyp it is forlore
And all is changed his estate
And wexeth anon so feeble and mate
That he may neither go ne come
But all to gether he is benome
The power both of hand and foot
So that algate abide he mote
And all his wits he foryete
The which is to him such a let
That he wot never, what he does
He which is false, ne which is soth
Ne which is day, ne which is night
That the time he knows no wyghte
That he ne wot so much as this
what manner thing him seluen is
Or he be man, or he be beast
That hold I right a sorry feast
when he, that reason understood
So sodeinlyche is wexe wode
Or else lyche the dead man
which another go ne speak can
Thus often he is to bed brought
But yet woteth he where he lies naught
Till he arise upon the morrow
And than he says: O which a sorrow
It is for to be drynkeles
So that half drunk in such a rees
with dry mouth be sterte him up
And says: bayles sa the cup
That made him lose his wit at eve
Is than a morrow all his believe
The cup is all that ever him pleases
And also that him most diseseth
It is the cup whom he serves
which all cares from him kerneth
And all bales to him brings
In joy he wepeth, in sorrow he syngeth
For dronkenshyp is so diverse
It may no while stand inuers
He drynketh the wine, but at last
The wine drynketh him, and bynt him fast
And leyth him drunk by the wall
As him, which is his bond thralle
And all in his subjection
And lyche to such condition
As for to speak it otherwise
It falls that the most wise
Ben other while of love adoted
And so biwhapped and assoted
Of dronken men, that never yet
was none, which half so lost his wit
Of drink, as they of such things do
which cleped is the iolyfe woe
And wexen of her own thought
So drunk, that they know naught
what reason is, or more or less
Such is the kind of that syknesse
And that is not for lack of brain
But love is of so great a main
That where he takes a heart on hand
There may nothig his might withsto^de
The wise Solomon was nome
And strong Sampson overcome
The knyghtly David him ne might
Rescue, that he with the sight
Of Bersabe ne was bestade
Virgile also was ouerlade
And Aristotle was put under
For thy my son it is no wonder
if thou be drunk of love among
which is above all other strong
And if so is, that thou so be
Tell me thy shryfte in pryuyte
It is no shame of such a thewe
Of young man to be dronkelewe
Of such phisike as I can a part
And as me seems by that art
Thou should by phisonomye
Be shapen to that maladye
Of love drunk, and that is routhe
A holy fader all is truth
That ye me tell, I am be know
That I with love am so bethrowe
And al my heart is so through sonke
That I am verylyche drunk
And yet I may both speak and go
But I am overcome so
And turned fro my self so clean
That often I wot not what I mean
So that excusen I ne may
My heart fro the first day
That I came to my lady kythe
I was never yet sobre sith
where I her se, or se her naught
with musing of mine own thought
Of love, which my heart assayleth
So drunk I am, that my wit fails
And all my brain is ouertorned
And my manner so mystorned
That I foryete all that I can
And stand like a mased man
That often when I should play
It makes me draw out of the way
In soleyn place by my self
As does a laborer to delfe
which can no gentylmans chere
Or else as a lewd friar
when he is put to his penance
Right so lose I my contenaunce
And if it needs so betyde
That I in company abide
There as I must dance and sing
The houe dance and carolynge
Or for to go the new foot
I may not well heue up my foot
If that she be not in the way
For than is all my mirth away
And wexe anon of thought so full
whereof my lymmes ben so dulle
I may uneaths gone the pas
For thus it is, and ever it was
when I on such thoughts muse
The lust and mirth, that men use
when I se not my lady byme
All is foryete for the time
So ferforth, that my wits change
And all lusts fro me straungen
That they seyn all truly
And swear, that it am not I
For as the man, which often drynketh
The wine, that in his stomach synketh
waxes drunk, and wytles for a throw
Right so my lust is overthrow
And of mine own thought so mate
I wax, that to mine astate
There is no lymme will me serve
But as a dronken man I swerue
And suffer such a passion
That men have great compassyon
And eueryche by him self meruayleth
what thing it is, that me so eyleth
Such is the manner of my woe
which time that I am her fro
Till efte ayene that I her se
But than it were a nycete
To tell you how that I fare
For when I may upon her stare
Her womanheed, her gentylnesse
Mine heart is full of such gladness
That ouerpasseth so my wit
That I wot never where it sit
But am so drunken of that sight
Me thinks, that for the time I might
Right sterte through the holle wall
And than I may well, if I shall
Both sing and dance, and lepe about
And hold forth the lusty route
But netheles it falls so
Full often that I fro her go
Ne may, but as it were a stake
I stand / auysement to take
And look upon her fair face
That for the while out of the place
For all the world ne might I wend
Such lust comth than into my mind
So that without mete and drink
Of lusty thoughts, which I think
Me thinks I might stonden ever
And so it were to me lever
Than such a sight for to leave
If that she would give me leave
To have so mochel of my will
And thus thinkende I stand still
without blenchinge of mine eye
Right as me thought that I seye
Of paradys the most joy
And so there while I me reioy
Unto mine heart a great desire
The which is hoter than the fire
All sodenlyche upon me renneth
That all my thought within brenneth
And am so ferforth overcome
That I note where I am become
So that among tho hertes strong
Instead of drink I vnderfonge
A thought so sweet in my courage
That never pyement ne vernage
was half so sweet for to drink
For as I would, than I think
As though I were at mine above
For so through drunk I am of love
That all that my soty demeth
Is soth, as than it to me seems
And while I may tho thoughts keep
Me thinks as though I were a sleep
And that I were in gods barme
But when I se mine own harm
And that I sodenlyche awake
Out of my though, and head take
How that the sothe stant in deed
Than is my sykernesse in dread
And joy torneth in to woe
So that the hete is all ago
Of such soty, as I was inn
And than ayenwarde I begin
To take of love a new thurst
which me greueth all there worst
For than comes the blanch Fever
with chele, and makes me so to cheuer
And so it coldeth at mine heart
That wonder is, how I asterte
In such a point that I ne deye
For certes there was never keye
Ne frosen is upon the wall
More inly cold, than I am all
And thus suffer I the hot chele
which passes other peynes feel,
In cold I brenne, and frese in hete
And than I drink a better-swete
with dry lip, ang eyes wete
Lo thus I temper my dyete
And take a draught of such relees
That all my wit is herteles
And all my heart there it sytte
Is, as who says witoute wit
So that I preue it by reason
In making of comparyson
There may no difference be
Betwyx a dronke^ man and me
But all the werst of euerychone
Is ever, that I thurst in one
The more that my heart drynketh
The more I may, so that me thinks
My thurst shall never be acqu^ynt
God shield, that I be not dreynt
Of such a superfluite
For well I feel in my degree
That all my wit is ouercast
whereof I am the more aghast
That in defaute of ladyshyp
Perchance in such a dronkeshyp
I may be dead, er I beware
For certes father this I dare
Beknowe, and in my shryfte tell
But I a draught have of that well
In which my death is and my life
My joy is turned in to strife
That sobre shall I never worth
But as a dronken man for worth
So that in land, where I fare
The lust is lore of my welfare
As he that may no bote find
But this me thinks a wonder kind
As I am drunk of that I drink
Of these thoughts that I think
Of which I find no relees
But if I might netheles
Of such a drink as I coueyte
So as me lust have o receyte
I should assobre and fare well
But so fortune upon her whele
On high me deyneth not to set
For evermore I find a let
The botiler is not my friend
which has the key by the bend
I may well wysshe, and that is waste
For well I wot so fresshe a taste
(But if my grace be the more)
I shall assay neuermore
Thus am I drunk of that I se
For tastynge is defended me
And I can not my seluen staunche
So that my father of this branch
I am gylyfe, to tell troth.
My son that me thinks routh
For love drunk is the mischyefe
Above all other the most chyef
If he lusty thought assy
which may his sorry thurst alay
As for the time yet it lesseth
To him, which other joy mysseth
For thy my son above all
Think well, how so it the befall
And keep thy wits that thou have
And let hem not be drunk in wast
But netheles there is no wight
That may withstonde loves might
But why the cause is, as I find
But that there is diverse kind
Of love drunk why men pleyneth
After the court, which all ordeyneth
I will the tell the manner
Now list my son, and thou shall here
Hic narrat secundum poetam, qualiter in suo cellario duo dolia Jupiter habet,
quorum primu^ figuoris dulcissimi / secundum amarissimi plenum ronsistit, ita
quod ille / cui fatata est prosperitas de dulci potabit, Alter vero cui
aduersabitur poculum gustabit amarum.
For the fortune of every chance
After the gods purueaunce
To man it grows from above
So that the speed of every love
Is shape there, er it befalle
For Jupiter abouen all
which is of gods sovereign
Has in his seller, as men feign
Two tonnes full of love drink
That makes many a heart synke
And many an heart also to flete
Or of the sour, or of the sweet
That one is full of such pyement
which passes all entendement
Of man's wit, if he it taste
And makes a ioylyfe heart in have
That other bitter as the galle
which makes a man's heart palle
whose dronkeship is a sykenesse
Through feeling of the bytternesse
Cupyde is botyler of both
which to the leefe, and to the loathe
yeueth of the sweet, and of the sour
That some laugh, and some loure
But for so much as he blind is
Full often time he goth amys
And takes the badde for the good
which hyndreth many a man's fode
without cause, and forthereth eke
So ben there some of love seek
which ought of reason to ben bole
And some comen to the dole
In hap, and as hem self lest
Drink, undeserved of the best
And thus this blind botiler
yeueth of the trouble instead of chere
And eke chere instead of trouble
Lo how he can the hertes trouble
And makes men drunk al upon chance
without law of governance
If he draw of the sweet tonne
Than is the sorrow all over run
Of love drunk, and shall naught greuen
So to be drunk every even
For all is than but a game
But when it is naught of the same
And be the better tonne draws
Such dronkeshyp an heart gnaweth
And febleth all a man's thought
That better him were have dro^k naught
And all his bree have eaten dry
For than he leseth his lusty weye
with dronkeship, and wot not whyther
To go, the ways been so slydre
In which he may percas so fall
That he shall break his wits all
And in this wise men ben drunk
After the drink they have drunk
But all drynken not ylyke
For some shall sing, and some shall sike
So that it me nothing merauyleth
My son of love that the ayleth
For I well know by thy tale
That thou have dronken of the dwale
which bitter is, till god the send
Such grace, that thou might amend
But son thou shall bydde and pray
In such a wise, as I shall say
That thou the lust well atteyne
Thy woeful thurstes to restreyne
Of love, and taste the swetenes
As Bacchus did in his distres
when bodelyche thirst him hent
In strange lands, where he went.
Nota hic qualiter potus aliquando sicienti precibus adquiritur, Et narrat
exemplum / quod cu^ Bacchus de quodam bello ab Orient repatria^s in quibusdam
Lybie partibus alicuius generis potum non inuenit / fusis ad Ionem precibus /
apparuit / ei aries, qui terra pede percussit / statim que fons emanauit / et
sic potum petenti peticio preualuit.
This Bacchus son of Jupiter
was hot, and as he went far
By his fathers assignement
To make a werre in Orient
And great power with him he ladde
So that the higher hand he had
And victory of his enemies
And tourneth homwarde with his prise
In such a country which was drey
A meschiefe fell upon the weye
As he rode with his company
Nygh to the strondes of Lybie
There might they no drink find
Of water, nor of other kind
So that him self, and all his host
were for defaut of drink almost
Distroyed: and than Bacchus prayde
To Jupiter, and thus he said
O high father, that see all
To whom is reason, that I shall
Beseech, and pray in every need
Behold my father, and take heed
This full thurst, that we be inn
To staunche, and grant us for to win
And saufe unto the country fare
where that our lusty loves are
waytende upon our home coming
And with the voice of his prayenge
which herd was to the gods hye
He sygh anon tofore his eye
A wether, which the ground has spurned
And where he has it ouerturned
There spronge a well fresshe and clear
whereof his own botylere
After the lusts of his will
Yaue every man to drink his fylle
And for this ilke great grace
Bacchus upon the same place
A rich temple let arere
which ever should stand there
To thrusty men in remembrance
For thy my son after this chance
It sytte the well to taken head
So for to prey upon thy need
As Bacchus preyde for the well
And think, as thou have herd me tell
How grace he gradde, and grace he had
He was no fool, that first so rad
For seldom get a dombe man land
Take that proverb, and understand
That words ben of virtue grette
For thy to speak thou ne let
And ask, and preye erely and late
Thy thurst to que^che, and think algate
The botiller / which bears the keye
Is blind, as thou have herd me seye
And if it might so betyde
That he upon the blind side
Parcas the sweet tonne a raught
Than shalt thou have a lustye draught
And wax of love drunk sobre
And thus I read thou assobre
Thyn heart, in hope of such a grace
For dronkeshyp in every place
To whether side that it turn
Does harm, and makes a man to spurn
And often fall in such a wise
where he percas may naught arise
Hic de amoris ebrietate ponit exemplu^, qualiter Tristrans ob potu^, que^
Brangweyn in vani ei porrexit de amore belle Isolde inebriatus extitit.
And for to look in evidence
Upon the sothe experience
So that it has befall er this
In every man's mouth it is
How Trystram was of love drunk
with bele I sold when they drunk
The drink, which Brangweine hem betok
Er that king Mark his eme her took
To wife, as it was after know
And eke my son, if thou will know
As it has fallen over more
In loves cause, and what is more
Of dronkeshyp for to dread
As it whylome befell in deed
whereof thou might the better eschew
Of dronken men that thou ne sewe
The company in no manner
A great ensample thou shall here
Hic de periculis ebrietatis causa in amore contingentibus narrat / quod cum
Perithous illam pulcherrimam Ipotatiam in vxorem duceret / quosdam qui Lentauri
vocabantur / inter alios vicinos ad nupcias inuitanit, qui vino imbuti / none
nupte formocitatem aspicientes, duplici ebrietate a mensa Ipotaciam a Peritho
marioto suo impetu rapuerunt.
This find I write in poesye
Of thylke fair Ipotasye
Of whose beauty there as she was
Spoke every man, and fell per cas
That Perythous so him sped
That he to wife her should wed
whereof that he great joy made
And for he would his love glad
Again the day of marriage
By mouth both, and by message
His friends to the fest be prayed
with great worship and as men said
He has this young lady spoused
And when that they were all housed
And set and served at mete
There was no wyn, which may begete
That there ne was plenty enough
But Bacchus thylke tonne drough
whereof by way of dronkeshyp
The greatest of the felaushyp
were out of reason over take
And Venus, which also has take
The cause most in special
Has give him drink forth with all
Of thylke cup, which exciteth
The lust, wheren a man deliteth
And thus by double wey drunk
Of lust that ylke fyry fonke
Has made be^, as who seith, half wode
That they no reason understood
Ne to none other thing they seyen
But her, which to fore her eyes
was wedded thylke same day
That fresshe wife, that lusty may
Of her it was all that they thoughten
And so farforth her lusts saughten
That they, which named were
Centauri at the feste there
Of one assent, of one accord
This young wife maugre her lord
In such a rage away forth ladden
As they, which none insyght hadden
But only to her drunken fare
which many a man has made misfare
In love, als well as other weye
whereof, if I shall more seye
Upon the nature of this vice
Of custom, and of exercise
The man's grace, how it fordoth
A tale, which was whylom soth
Of fools, that so dronken were
I shall reherce unto thine ere
Hic loquitur specialiter contra vicium illoru^ / qui nimia potacione ex
consuetudine ebriosi efficiuntur, Et narrat exemplum de Galba et Vitello qui
potentes in Hispania principes fuerunt, sed ipse cotidiane ebrietatis potibus
assuetii, tanta vicinis intulerunt enormia / quod tandem toto co^clamante
populo, pena sententie capitalis in eos iudicialiter diffinita est, qui
prinsqua^ morere^tur vt pena^ mortis alleuiare^t, spontanea vim ebrietate
sopiti, quasi porci semimortui gladio interierunt.
I read in a cronicle thus
Of Galba, and of Vitellus
The which of Spain both were
The greattest of all other there
And both of o condition
After the disposition
Of glotony, and dronkshyp
That was a sorry felaushyp
For this thou might well understand
That man may well not long stand
which is wine drunk of co men use
For he has lore the virtues
whereof reason should him does
And that was sen upon hem both
Men seyn, there his no euydence
whereof to know a difference
Between the dronken and the wode
For they be never another good
For where that wine does wit a weye
wisdom has lost the right weye
That he no manner vice dredeth
No more than a blind man thredeth
His nedel, by the son light
No more is reason than of might
when be with dronkeshyp is blent
And in this point they weren shent
This Galba both and eke Vytelle
Upon the cause, as I shall tell
whereof good is to take heed
For they two through her dronkenhede
Of witles excitation
Oppressed all the nation
Of Spain: for all foul vsaunce
which done was of continuance
Of hem, which all day drunk were
There was no wife ne maiden there
what so they were, or fair or foul
whom they ne taken to defoule
whereof the land was often woe
And eke in other things mo
They wroughten many a sundry wrong
But how so that the day be long
The derke night comes at last
God would naught, they shulden last
And shope the law in such a wise
That they through dome to the Iuyse
B^ damned for to be forlore
But they, that had be tofore
E^^lyned to all dronkenesse
Her end than bare witness
For they in hope to assuage
The pain of death upon the rage
That they less shulden feel
Of wine let fill full a meele
And dronken till so was befell
That they her strengthes losen all
withouten wit of any brain
And thus they ben half deed slain
That hem ne greueth but a lite
My son if thou be for to wite
In any point, which I have said
whereof thy wits been vnteyde
I read clepe hem home again
I shall do father as ye seyne
Als ferforth as I may suffice
But well I wot, that in no wise
The dronkeshyp of love aweye
I may remue by no weye
It stant naught upon my fortune
But if you list to common
Of the second glotonye
which cleped is delicacye
whereof ye spoke here to fore
Beseech I would you therefore
My son as of that ylke vice
which of all other is the noryce
And stant upon the retenue
Of Venus, so as it is due
The properte how that it fares
The book herafter now declares
Deliciae cum diuiciis sunt iura potentum.
In quibus orta Venus excitat ora gulae
Non sunt deliciae tales, que corpora pascunt,
Ex quibus impletus gaudia uenter agit.
Qui completus amor maiori munere gaudet.
Cum data deliciis men's in aman te fatur.
HIC tractat super illa specie gule que delicatia nuncupatur, cuius mollicies
volupiuose carni personis precipue potentibus queque compla centia corporaliter
ministrat.
Of this chapter, in which we trete
There is yet one of such dyete
To which no pore may attain
For all is past as payndemayne
And sundry wine and sundry drink
whereof that he woll eat and drink
His cooks ben for him affayted
So that his body is awayted
That him shall lack no delight
Als ferforth as his appetite
Suffyseth to the meats hot
whereof the lusty vice is hot
Of Gule the delycacye
which all the holle progenye
Of lusty folk has undertake
To feed, while that he may take
Richesse, whereof to be found
Of abstinence he wot no bound
To what profit it should serve
And yet phisyke of his conserve
Makes many a restrauracion
Unto his recreacion
which would be to Venus lefe
Thus for the point of his relefe
The cook, which shall his meat array
But he the better his mouth assay
His lords thonke shall often lose
Er he be served to the chese
For there may lack not so lyte
That he ne fyut anon a wit
But his lust be fully served
There has no wight his thonke desued
And yet for man's sustenaunce
To keep and hold in governance
To him that woll his hele get
Is none so good, as common mete
For who that looks on the books
It seyth, confection of Cooks
A man him should well auyse
How he it took, and in what wise
For who that uses, that he knows
Full seldom sikenes on him grows
And who that uses metes strange
Though his nature empayre and change
It is no wonder lyefe son
when that he does ayene his won
For in sikenes this I find
Usage is the second kind
In love, als well as other wey
For as these holy books sey
The bodily delyces all
In every point how so they fall
Unto the soul done greuance
And for to take in remembrance
A tale accordant unto this
which of great understanding is
To man's soul reasonable
I think tell, and is no fable
HIC PONIT EXEMPLVM contra iftos delicatos, et narrat de diuite et Lazaro,
quorum gefta in euangelio Lucas euidentius describit.
Of Christis word, who wol it read
How that this vice is for to dread
In theuangile it tells pleyne
which mote algate be certain
For Christ him self it bears witness
And though the clerk, and the clergesse
In laten tongue, it read and sing
yet for the more knowlechynge
Of truth, which is good to wite
I shall declare, as it is wriie
In english, for thus it began
Christ seith, there was a rich man
A mighty lord of great astate
And he was eke so delycate
Of his clothing, that every day
Of purpre and bysse he made him gay
And ete and drank thereto his fill
After the lusts of his will
And he, which all stood in delice
And took none head of thilke vice
And as it should so betyde
A pour lazer upon a tide
Came to the gate, and axed mete
But there might he nothing get
His deedly hungre for to staunche
For he, which had his full paunche
Of all lusts at board
Ne deyneth not to speak a word
Onlyche a Cromme for to give
whereof this pour might leave
Upon the yefte of his alms
Thus lay this pour in great distress
A cold and hongred at the gate
For which he might go no gate
So was he woefully besene
And as these holy books seyn
The hounds comen fro the hail
where that this sick man was fall
And as he lay there for to deye
The wounds of his maladye
They lycken, for to done him ese
But he was full of such dysese
That he may not the death escape
But as it was that time shape
The soul fro the body passes
And he, whom nothing ouerpasseth
The high god up to the heaven
Him took, where he has set him even
In Abraham's barme on high
where he the heuens joy syghe
And had all that he have would
And fell as it befall should
This rich man the same throw
with sodeyn death was overthrow
And forth withouten any went
Unto the bell straught he went
The fend in to the fire him drough
where that he had pain enough
Of flame, which that ever brenneth
And as his eye about renneth
Toward the heaven he cast his look
where that he sygh, and head took
How lazar set was in his see
Als far as ever he might see
with Abraham, and than he prayde
Unto the patriarche, and said
Send lazar down fro thylke sete
And do, that he his finger wete
In water, so that he may drop
Upon my tongue for to stop
The great hete, in which I brenne
But Abraham answerde then
And said to him in this wise
Solomon. Qui obturat aures suas ad clamore^ ^^^^^rum, ipse clamabit, et non
exaudictur.
My son, thou the might auise
And take in to thy remembrance
How lazar had great penance
while he was in that other life
But thou in all thy lust iolyfe
The bodily delices soughtest
For thy so as thou than wroughtest
Now shalt thou take thy reward
Of deedly pain here afterward
In hell, which shall ever last
And this lazar now at last
This worlds pain is ouerronne
In heaven and has his life begone
Of joy, which is endeles
But that thou preydest netheles
That I shall lazar to the send
with water on his finger end
Thine hot tongue for to kele
Thou shalt no such graces feel
For to that foul place of sin
For ever, in which thou shalt be inn
Comes none out of this place thither
Ne none of you may comen hyder
Thus be ye parted now a two
The rich ayeneward cryde tho
O Abraham, sithe it so is
That lazar may naught do me this
which I have axed in this place
I would pray an other grace
For I have yet brethren five
That with my father been a live
To gether dwellende in one house
To whom, as thou art gracious
I pray that thou would send
Lazar, so that he might wend
To warn hem, how the world is went
That afterward they be not shent
Of such peynes as they dry
Lo this I pray, and this I cry
How I may not my self amend
The patriarch anon sewende
To this prayer answerde Nay
And said him, how that every day
His brethren might know and here
Of Moses on earth here
And of prophettes other mo
what hem was best: and he says no
But if there might a man arise
From death to life in such a wise
To tellen hem, how that it were
He said than of pure fere
They shulden well beware thereby
Quod Abraham, nay sikerly
For if they now will not obey
To such, as teache hem the wey
And all day teach, and all day tell
How that it stant of heaven and hell
They will not than taken head
Though it befelle so in deed
That any dead man were arered
To ben of him no better lered
Than of an other man on live
If thou my son can descriue
This tale, as Christ him self it told
Thou shall have cause to behold
To se so great an evidence
whereof the sothe experience
Has showed openlyche at eye
That bodily delicacye
Of him, which yeueth none alms
Shall after fall in great distress
And that was seen upon the rich
For he ne would unto his lyche
A cromme yeuen of his bread
Than afterward when he was deed
A drop of water him was werned
Thus may a man's wit be learned
Of hem, that so delytes taken
when they with death ben overtaken
That erst was sweet is, than sour
But he that is a governor
Of worlds joy, if he be wise
within his heart he set no prise
Of all the world, and yet he uses
The good, that he nothing refuses
As he, which lord is of the things
The ouches, and the rich rings
The cloth of gold, and the perrye
He takes, and yet the delicacye
He leueth, though he were all this
The best mete, that there is
He eats, and drynketh the best drink
But how that ever he eat or drink
Delicacie he put aweye
As he, which goth the right weye
Naught only for to feed and clothe
His body, but his soul both
But they that taken other wise
Her lusts, been none of the wise
But now a day a man may se
The world so full of vanite
That no man takes of reason head
Or for to clothe, or for to feed
But all is set unto the vice
To new and changen his delice
And right so changes his astate
He that of love is delicate
For though he had to his hand
The best wife of all the land
Or the fairest love of all
yet would his heart on other fall
And think hem more delicious
Than he has in his own house
Men seyne it is now often so
Auyse hem well, they that so do
And for to speak in other way
Full often time I have herd say
That he, which has no love acheued
Him thinks that he is not relieved
Though that his lady make him chere
So as she may in good manner
Her honor, and her name save
But he the surplus might have
Nothing withstanding her astate
Of love more delicate
He set her chere at no delight
But if he have all his appetyte
My son if it with the be so
Tell me? Mine holy father no
For delycate in such a wise
Of love, as ye to me devise
Ne was I never yet gyltyfe
For if I had such a wife
As ye speak of, what should I more
For than I would never more
For lust of any womanhede
My heart upon none other feed
And if I did, it were a waste
But all without such repaste
Of lust, as ye me told above
Of wife, or yet of other love
I fast, and may no fode get
So that for lack of deintie mete
Of which an heart may be fed
I go fasting to my bed
But might I getten as ye told
So mochel, that my lady would
Me feed with her glad semblaunte
Though me lack all the remenaunt
yet should I somdele ben abeched
And for the time well refreshed
But certes fader she ne does
For in good feyth to tellen soth
I trow, though I should sterue
She would not her eye swerue
My heart with one goodly look
To feed, and thus for such a coke
I may go fasting euermo
But if so is, that any woe
May feed a man's heart well
Thereof I have at every mele
Of plente more that enough
But that is of him self so tough
My stomach may it not defye
Lo such is the delycacye
Of love, which my heart fedeth
Thus have I lack of that me needs
But for all this yet netheles
I say not, I am gylteles
That I somdele am delycate
For else were I fully mate
But if that I some lusty stounde
Of comfort and of ease found
To take of love some repast
For though I with full taste
The lust of love may not feel
Mine honger otherwise I kele
Of small lusts, which I pyke
And for a time yet they like
If that ye wysten, what I mean
Now good son shryue the clean
Of such deynties as ben good
whereof thou take thyn heart food
My father I shall you rehearse
How that my fodes ben diverse
So as they fallen in degree
One fedynge is of that I se
An other is, of that I here
The third, as I shall tellen here
^t grows of mine own thought
And else should I live naught
For whom that fails food of heart
He may naught well the death asterte.
Nota qualiter visus in amore se continet delicatus.
Of sight is all my first food
Through which mine eye of all good
Has that to him is accordant
A lusty food suffisant
when that I go toward the place
where I shall se my ladies face
Mine eye, which is loathe to fast
Begins anon to hungre so fast
That him thinks of an hour three
Till I there come, and he her se
And than after his appetite
He takes a fode of such delight
That him none other deyntie needs
Of sundry sightes he him fedeth
He sees her face of such color
That fressher is than any flower
He sees her front is large and pleyne
without frounce of any greyne
He sees her eyes lyche an heaven
And sees her nose streyte and even
He sees her rudde upon the cheke
And sees her red lips eke
Her chynne accords to the face
All that he sees is full of grace
He sees her neck round and clean
Therein may no bone be seen
He sees her hands fair and white
For all this thing without wit
He may se naked at lest
So is it well the more feste
And well the more delicacie
Unto the fedyng of the eye
He sees her shap forth with all
Her body round, her myddell small
So well begone with good array
which passes all the lust of may
when he is most with soft showers
Full clothed in his lusty flowers
with such sightes by and by
Mine eye is fed, but finally
when he the port and the manner
Sees of her womannysshe chere
Than has he such delight on hand
Him thinks he might still stand
And that he has full suffisance
Of lyuelode, and of sustenaunce
As to his part for euermo
And if it thought all other so
Fro then would he never wend
But there unto the worlds end
He would abide, if that he might
And feden him upon the sight.
For though I might stonden aye
In to the time of domes day
And look upon her ever in one
yet when I should fro her gone
Mine eye would, as though he fast
Ben honger storuen also fast
Tylle efte again that he her sey
Such is the nature of mine eye.
There is no lust so deyntefull
Of whlche a man should not be full
Of that the stomach vnderfongeth
But ever in one mine heart lo^geth
For look, how that a goshauke tyreth
Right so does he / when that he pyreth
And tooteth on her womanhede
For he may never fully feed
His lust, but ever a lyche sore
Him hongreth, so that he the more
Desires to be fed algate
And thus mine eye is made the gate
Through which the deinties of my thought
Of lust ben to min heart brought
Right as mine eye with his look
Is to mine heart a lusty cook
Of loves food delycate
Qualiter auris in amore delectatur.
Right so mine ear in his state
where as mine eye may not serve
Can well mine hertes thonke deserve
And feden him fro day to day
with such deintes, as he may
For thus it is, that over all
where as I come in special
I may here of my lady price
I here one say, that she is wise
An other says, that she is good
And some men seyne, of worthy blood
That she is come, and is also
So fair, that no where is none so
And some men preyse her goodly chere
Thus every thing, that I may here
which sowneth to my lady good
Is to mine ear a lusty food.
And eke mine ear has over this
A deynty feast, when so is
That I may here her seluen speak
For than anon my fast I break
On such words, as she says
That full of troth, and full of feyth
They ben, and of so good disporte
That to mine ear great comfort
They done, as they that been delices
For all the meats and the spices
That any Lumbarde couth make
Ne ben so lusty for to take
Ne so farforth restauratyfe
I sey as for mine own life
As ben the words of her mouth.
For as the wyndes of the south
Ben most of all debonaire
So when her lust to speak fair
The virtue of her goodly speech
Is verily mine hertes leche.
And if it so befalle among
That she carole upon a song
when I it here, I am so fed
That I am fro my self so led
As though I were in Paradys
For certes as to mine auys
when I here of her voice the steven
Me thynkth it is a bliss of heaven
And eke in otherwise also
Full often time it falls so
Mine ere with a good pitaunce
Is fed, of redinge of romaunce
Of ydoyne, and of Amadas
That whylome were in my cas
And eke of other many a score
That loueden long, er I was bore
For when I of her loves read
Mine ere with the tale I feed
And with the lust of her histoire
Sometime I drew in to memoire
How sorrow may not ever last
And so hope comes in at last
when I none other fode know
And that endures but a throw
Right as it were a chery feste
But for to counten at lest
As for the while yet it eseth
And somdele of my heart appeseth
For what thing to my ere spredeth
which is plesaunt, somdele it eseth
with words such as he may get
My lust instead of other mete.
Lo thus my fader as I you sey
Of lust, the which mine eye has seye
And eke of that my ere has herd
Full often I have the better ferde
And tho two bryngen in the thrydde
The which has in mine heart amydde
His place take, to array
The lusty thoughts, which assay
I mote, and namelyche on nyghtes
when that me lacks all sightes
And that min heringe is awey
Than is he ready in the wey
My rere souper for to make
Of which my hertes fode I take.
Qualiter cogitatus impressiones leticie imaginatiuas cordibus inferit amantum.
This lusty cooks name is hot
Thought, which has ever his pottes hot
Of love boylend on the fire
with fantasye, and with desire
Of which er this full often be fed
Mine heart, when I was a bed
And than he set upon my board
Both every sight, and every word
Of lust, which I have herd or seyne
But yet is not my fest all pleyn
But all of woldes, and of wysshes
Thereof have I my full disshes
But as of feeling, and of taste
Yet might I never have o repaste.
And as I have said to forne
I lycke honey of the thorn
And, as who seith, upon the brydell
I chewe, so that all is ydell
As in effect the fode I have
But as a man, that would him save
when he is syke, by medycyne
Right so of love the famyne
I fond in all that ever I may
To feed and drive forth the day
Tylle I may have the great fest
which all my honger might areste.
Lo such ben my lusts three
Of that I think, and here, and se
I take of love my fedinge
with out tastinge or feeling
And as the plouer does of the heir
I live, and am in good espeyre
That for none such delycacye
I trow I do no gloteny
And netheles to your auys
Mine holy fader, that been wys
I recommande mine estate
Of that I have been delicate.
My son I understand well
That thou have told here, every dele
And as me thinks by thy tale
It ben delytes wonder small
whereof thou take thy loves fode
But son if that thou understood
what is to ben delicious
Thou would not be curious
Upon the lust of thyn astate
To ben to hot or delycate
whereof that thou reason excede
For in the books thou might read
If man's wysdom shall be sewed
It ought well to ben eschewed
As well by reason as b^ kind
Of old ensamples as men find.
Hic loquitur de delicacia Neronis, qui corpora libus delicus magis adherens,
spiritualia gandia minus obtinuit.
That man that would him well auise
Delycacye is to dispyse
when kind accords not withal
whereof ensample in special
Of Nero whylom may be told
which ayens kind manyfolde
His lusts took, till at last
That god him would all ouercaste
Of whom the cronyke is so pleyne
Me lust no more of him to seyne
And netheles for glotony
Of bodily delycacy
To know his stomach how it ferde
Of that no man tofore herd
which he within him self bethought
A wonder subtyle thing he wrought
Three men upon election
Of age, and of complexion
Lyche to him self by all way
He took toward him to play
And eat and drank as well as he
Thereof was no diversity
For every day when that they ete
To fore his own bourde they sete
And of such meat as he was served
All though they had it not deserved
They token service of the same
But afterward all thilke game
was into woeful ernest turned
For when they were thus soiourned
within a time at after mete
Nero, which had not foryete
The lusts of his freel astate
As he which all was delycate
To know thylke experience
The men let come in his presence
And to that one the same tide
A courser, that he should ride
Into the field, anon he had
whereof this man was wonder glad
And goth to prycke and praunce about
That other, while that he was out
He laid upon his bed to sleep
The third, which he would keep
within his chamber fair and soft
He gothe now up now down full often
walking a pace, that he ne slepte
Till be which on the courser lepte
was comen fro the field again.
Nero than as books seyne
These men did done take all three
And slough hem, for he would se
The whose stomach was best defied.
And when he has the sothe tried
He found, that he, which goth the pas
Defied best of all was
which afterward he used aye
And thus what thing unto his pay
was most pleasant, he left none
with any lust he was begone
whereof the body might glade
For he no abstynence made
But most of all erthely things
Of women unto the lykinges
Nero set all his hole heart
For that lust him should not asterte
wha^ that the thurst of love him caught
where that him list he took a draught
He spares nether wife ne maid
That such a another, as men said
In all this world was never yet
He was so drunk in all his wit
Through sundry lusts, which he took
That ever, while there is a book
Of Nero men shall read and sing
Unto the worlds knowlechynge.
My good son as thou have herd
For ever yet it has so ferde
Delycacy in loves cas
without reason is and was.
For where that love is heart set
Him thinks, it might be no bet
All though it be not fully mete.
The lust of love is ever sweet.
Lo thus to gether of felaushyp
Delycacy and dronkshyp
(whereof reason stant out of herre)
Have made many a man err
In loves cause most of all
For than how so that ever it fall
wit can no reason understand
But let the governance stand
To will, which than wexeth so wild
That he can not him self shylde
Fro the peril, but out of fere
The way he secheth here and there
Him retcheth not upon what side
For often time he goth beside
And does such thing without dread
whereof him ought well to dread
But when that love assoteth sore
It passes all men's lore.
what lust it is, that he ordeyneth
There is no man's might restreyneth.
And of god takes he none head
But lawles withouten dread
His purpos for he would acheue
Against the points of the believe
He tempts heaven, earth, and hell
Here afterward as I shall tell.
Du^ stimulai amor, quic quid iubet orta voluptas
Auder, et aggreditur nulla timenda timens
Omne quod astra queunt lierbaru^ sieve potestas,
Seu vigor inferni singula temptat amaus.
Quod nequid ipse, deo mediante, parare sinistru^,
Daemonis hoc magica credulus art parat.
Sic sibi non curat ad opus quae retia tendit.
Du^modo nudatam prendere posset anem.
Hic tractat, qualiter ebrietas et delicacia omnis pudicicie contrarium
infligantes inter alia ad carnalis concupiscencie promocionem sortilegio
magicam requirunt.
who dare do thing, which love ne dare?
To love is every law unware
But to the laws of his best
The fysshe, the foul, the man, the beast
Of all the worlds kind lowteth
For love is he, which nothing douteth
In man's heart where it sytte
He counts naught toward his wit
The woe, no more than the well
No more the hete, than the chele
No more the wete, than the dry
No more to live, than to dye
So that to fore ne behind
He sees no thing, but as the blind
without insyght of his courage
He does meruayles in his rage
To what thing that he wol him draw
There is no god, there is no law
Of whom that he takes any head
But as baiarde the blind stead
Till he fall in the dytche a mydde
He gothe there no man will him bydde
He stant so ferforthe out of rewle
There is no wit, that may him reule
And thus to tell of him in sothe
Full many a wonder thing he does
That were better to be lafte
Among the which is witch craft
That sum men clepen sorcerie
which for to win his drewry
with many a circumstance he uses
There is no point, which he refuses.
Nota de autorum nec non et librorum tam nat^^ alis quam execrabilis magice
nominibus.
The craft, which that Saturnus found
To make pykes in the sound
That Geomance cleped is
Full often he uses it amys
And of the floode his ydromance
And of the fire the pyromance
with questions each one of tho
He tempts often. and eke also
Aeromance in judgment
To love be brings of his assent
For these crafts as I find
A man may do by way of kind
Be so, it be to good intent
But he goth all another went
For rather er he should fail
with ^y gromance he would assail
To make his incantacion
with bote subfumygacion
Thylke art, which spatula is hot
And used is of common rote
Among pains, which that craft eke
Of which is auctor Thosez the greek
He wercheth one and one by row
Razel is not to him unknow
The Salamones Candarye
His Ideac, his Eutonye
The figure of the book withal
Of Balamuz, and of Ghenball
The seal, and thereupon thymage
Of Thebith, for his auantage
He takes: and some what of Gybere
which helpliche is to this matere
Babylla to her sons seven
which has renounced to the heaven
with Cernes both square and round
He traceth often upon the ground
Making his invocation
And for full information
The schole, which Honorius
wrote, he pursues, and lo thus
Magyke he uses for to win
His love, and spares for no sin.
And over that of his soty
Right as he secheth sorcery
Of hem that been magycyens
Right so of the naturyens
Upon the sterres from above
His wey he secheth unto love
Als far as he hem understands
In many a sundry wise he fondeth
He makes image, he makes sculpture
He makes writing, he makes figure
He makes his calculacions
He makes his demonstrations
His hours of astronomy
He keeps, as for that party
which longs to the inspection
Of love, and his affection
He would in to the hell seche
The deuell him self to beseech
If that he wist for to speed
To get of love his lusty mede
where that he has his heart set
He bydde never fare bet
Ne wit of other heaven more
My son if thou of such a lore
Have ben er this, I read the leave.
Mine holy father by your leave
Of all that ye have spoken here
which touches unto this matere
To tell soth right as I wene
I wot not o word, what ye mean
I woll not say, if that I couth
That I nolde in my lusty youth
Beneth in hell and eke above
To win with my ladies love
Done all that ever that I might.
For thereof have I none insyght
where afterward that I am become
So that I won and overcome
Her love, which I most coueyte.
My son that gothe wonder streyte
For this I may well tell sothe
There is no man, which so does
For all the craft that he can cast
That he ne byeth it at last
For often he that will begyle
Is guyled with the same guyle
And thus the guyler is beguyled
As I find in a book compyled
To this matere an old histoire
The which comth now to my memoire
And is of great ensamplarye
Ayene the vice of sorcerye
whereof none end may be good
But how whylome thereof it stood
A tale, which is good to know
To the my son I shall biknowe.
Nota contra istos ob amoris causam sortilegos, vbi narrat in exemplum, quod
cum Vlixes a subuersione Troie repatriare nauigio voluisset, ipsum in Insula
Cilli, vbi illa expertissima maga nomine Cyrces regnauit, co^tigit applicuisse,
quem vt in sui amoris concupiscentiam exardesceret, Circes omnibus suis
incantationibus vincere conabatur: Vlixes tamen Magica potentior ipsam in amore
subegit, Ex qua filium nomine Telegonum genuit, qui postea patrem suum
interfecit, et sic contra fidei naturam genitus co^tra generationis naturam
patricidium operatus est.
Among hem, which at Troy were
Vlixes at the syege there
was one by name in special
Of whom yet the memorial
Abides, for while there is a mouth
For ever his name shall be couthe
He was a worthy knight and a king
And clerk knowende of every thing
He was a great Rethorien
He was a great magicien
Of Tullius the Rethoryke
Of king Zorastes the magyke
Of Ptolome thastronomye
Of Plato the philosophye
Of Daniel the slepy dremes
Of Neptune eke the water stremes
Of Solomon and the proverbs
Of Macer all the strength of herbs
And the phisyke of hipocras
And lyche unto Pythagoras
Of surgery he knew the cures
But some what of his auentures
which shall to my matter accord
To the my son I will record.
This king, of which thou have herd sein
From Troy as he goth home again
By ship, he found the sea diverse
with many a wyndy storm reuerse
But he through wisdom, which he shapeth
Full many a great peril escapes
Of which I think tellen one
How that maugre the nedell and stone
wind drive he was all suddenly
Upon the strondes of Cylly
where that he must abide a while
Tway queen's weren in that isle
Calipso named and Cyrces
And when they herd, how Vlyxes
Is londed there upon the Ryue
For him they senden also blyue.
with him such as he would he nam
And to the court to hem he came
These queen's were as two goddesses
Of art magyke sorceresses
That what lord comes to that ryuage
They make him love in such a rage
And upon hem assote so
That they woll have, er that he go
All that he has of worlds good
Vlyxes well this understood
They couth much, he couthe more
They shape and cast against him sore
And wrought many a subtyle wyle
But yet they might him not begyle
But of the men of his nauye
They two forshope a great party
May none of hem withstonde her hestes
Some part they shopen in to bestes
Some part they shopen in to fowls
To beres, tygres, apes, oules
Or else by some other wey
There might nothing bem disobey
Such craft they had above kind
But that art couth they not find
Of which Vlyxes was deceived
That he ne has hem all weyued
And brought hem in to such a rote
That upon him they both assote
And through the science of his art
He took of hem so well his part
That he begat Circes with child
He kept him sobre, and made hem wild
He set him selue so above
That with her good, and with her love
who that thereof belief or loathe
All quite in to his ship he gothe.
Circes to swolle both sides
He left, and wayteth on the tides
And straught throughout the salt foam
He takes his course, and comth him home
where as he found Penelope
A better wife there may none be
And yet there been ynowe of good
But who that her goodship understood
^^o first that she wyfehode took
^^we many loves she forsook
And how she bare her all about
There whiles that her lord was out
He might make a great auant
Among all the remenant
That she, one of all the best
well might he set his heart in rest
This king when he her fond in hele
For as he couthe in wisdom dele
^e couthe she in woman bid
And when she sygh withouten dread
(...) ^^rde upon his own ground
That he was come safe and sound
In all this world ne might be
A gladder woman than was she
The fame, which may naught be hyd
Throughout the land is sone kyd
Her king is comen home ayene
There may no man the full seyne
How that they weren all glade
So mochel joy of him they made
The presents every day been newed
He was with yeftes all bisnewed
The people was of him so glad
That though none other man hem bad
T^llage upon hem self they set
And as it were of pure debt
They give her goods to the king
This was a glad home welcomynge
Thus has Vlyxes what he would
His wife was such as she be should
His people was to him subject
Him lacks nothing of delight
Horatius, Omnia sunt hominum tenni pendentia filo.
But fortune is of such a fleyght
That when a man is most on heyght
She makes him rathest for to fall
There wot no man what shall befalle
The happes over man's head
Ben honged with a tender threde
That proved was on Vlyxes
For when he was most in his pees
Fortune began to make him werre
And set his welthe out of herre
Upon a day as he was merry
As though there might him no thing derye
when night was come, he goth to bed
with sleep and both his eyes fed
And while he slepte, he met a sweuen
Him thought he sygh a statu even
which bryghter than the son shone
A man it seemed was it none
But yet it was a figure
Most lyche to mannyssh creature
But as of beauty heuenlych
It was most to an angel lyche
And thus between angel and man
Beholden it this king began
And such a lust took of the sight
That feign he would, if that he might
The form of that figure embrace
And goth him forth toward that place
where he sygh that image tho
And takth it in his arms two
And it embraces him again
And to the king thus began it seyne.
Vlyxes understand well this
The token of our acquaintance is
Here afterward to mochel tene
The love that is us between.
Of that we now such joy make
That one of us the death shall take
when time comes of destyne
It may none otherwise be.
Vlixes the began to pray
That this figure would him say
what wight he is, that says him so.
This wight upon a spear tho
A pensell, which was well begone
Embroudred, shows him anon
Three fysshes all of o color
In manner as it were a toure
Upon the pensell were wrought.
Vlyxes knew this token naught
And prayth to wit in some party
what thing it might signify
A sign it is, the wight answerde.
Of an empire, and forth he ferde
All suddenly, when he that said.
Vlyxes out of sleep abrayde
And that was right ayene the day
That longer slepen he ne may.
Men say, a man has knowlegynge
Save of him self, of all thing.
His own chance no man knows
But as fortune it on him throws.
was never yet so wise a clerk
which might know all gods work
Ne the secret, which god has set
Ayene a man, may not be let.
Vlyxes though that he be wise
with all his wit in his auyse
The more that he his sweuen accou^teth
The less he wot, what it amounts
For all his calculation
He sees no demonstration
As pleynly for to know an end
But netheles how so it wend
He drad him of his own son
That makes him well the more astone
And shope therefore anon withal
So that within castle wall
Thelemachus his son he shette
And on him strong ward he set
The sothe farther he ne knew
Till that fortune him ouerthrewe
But netheles for sykernesse
where that he might wit and guess
A place strengest in his land
There let he make of lyme and sonde
A strength, where he would dwell
was never man yet herd tell
Of such an other, as it was
And for to strength him in that cas
Of all his land the sykerest
Of servants, and the worthyest
To kepen him within ward
He set his body for to ward
And made such an ordinance
For love, ne for aqueintance
That were it erely, were it late
They should let in at yate
No manner man, what so betyd
But if so were him self it bid
But all that might him not avail
For whom fortune wol assail
There may be no such resistance
which might make a man defense
All that shall be mote fall algate.
This Cyrces, which I spoke of late
On whom Vlyxes has begete
A child, though he it have foryete
when time came, as it was won
She was delyuerde of a son
which cleped is Telegonus
This child when he was borne thus
About his mother to full age
That he can reason and langage
In good estate was draw forth
And when he was so mochell worth
To stonden in a man's stead
Circes his mother has him bid
That he shall to his father go
And told him all to geder tho
what man he was, that him begat
And when Thelegonus of that
was ware, and has full knowlechynge
How that his fader was a king
He prayth his mother fair this
To go, where that his fader is
And she him grants, that he shall.
And made him ready forth with all
It was that time such vsance
That every man the cogysaunce
Of his contre bare in his hand
when he went in to strange land.
And thus was every man therefore
well know, where that he was bore
For espyall and mystrowynges
They did than such things
That every man might other know.
So it be fell in that throw
Telegonus as in this cas
Of his contre the sign was
Three fisshes, which he should here
Upon the pynon of a spear
And when that he was thus arrayde
And has his barneys all assayde
That he was ready euerydele
His mother bad him, fare well
And said him, that he should swythe
His fader griete a thousand sith.
Telegonus his mother kissed
And took his leave, and where he wist
His fader was, the way name
Till he unto Nachaie came
which of that land the chyefe cite
was cleped, and there asks he
where was the king, and how he ferde
And when that he the soth herd
where that the king Vlixes was
Alone upon his horse great pas
He roode him forth, and in his hand
He bare the sygnall of his land
with fisshes three, as I have told
And thus he went unto that hold
where that his own fader dwells
The cause why he came, he tells
Unto the kepars of the gate
And would have comen in there ate
But shortly they him said nay
And he als fair as ever he may
Besought, and told hem of this
How that the king his fader is
But they with proud words great
Began to manace and threte
But he go fro the gate fast
They wolden him take and set fast
Fro words unto strokes thus
They fell, and so Telegonus
was sore hurt, and well nyghe deed
But with his sharp speres head:
He makes defense, how so it fall
And wan the yate upon hem all
And has slain of the best five
And they ascryden als blyue
Through out the castle all about
On every side men come out
whereof the kings heart afflight
And he with all the have he might
Aspere caught, and forth he gothe
As he that was right wood for wroth
He sighe the gates full of blood
Telegonus, and where he stood
He sighe also, but he ne knew
what man it was, but to him threw
His spear, and he sterte out a side
But destine, which shall betyde
Befell that ylke time so
Telegonus knew nothing tho
what man it was, that to him cast
And while his own spear last
with all the sign thereupon
He cast unto the king anon
And smote him with a dedly wound.
Vlixes fell anon to ground
Tho every man, the king the king
Began to cry, and of this thing
Telegonus which sigh the caas
On knes he fell, and said alas
I have mine own fader slain
Now would I deye wonder feign
Now sle me, who that ever will
For certes it is right and skyll.
He cries, he wepeth, he seyth therefore
Alas that ever was I bore
That this unhappy destine
So woefully comth in by me
This king, which yet has life enough
His heart again unto him drough
And to that voice an ear he laid
And understood all that he said
And began to speak, and said on high
Bring me this man: and when he sigh
Telegonus, his thought he set
Upon the sweuen, which he met
And asks, that he might se
His spear, on which the fysshes three
He sigh upon the pensell wrought
Tho wist he well, it fails naught
And bad him, that he tell should
Fro whens he came, and what he would
Telegonus in sorrow and woe
So as he might, told tho
Unto Vlyxes all the cas
How that Cyrces his mother was
And so forth said him every dele
How that his mother griete him well
And in what wise she him sent.
Tho wist Vlyxes what it meant
And took him in his arms soft
And all bledend kyst him often
And said: Son while I live
This infortune I the foryeue
After his other son in have
He sent, and he began him have
And came unto his fader tyte.
But when he sygh him in such plyte
He would have run upon that other
Anon, and slain his own brother
Ne had been that Vlyxes
Between hem made a cord and pees
And to his heir Thelemachus
He bad, that he Telegonus
with all his power should keep
Till he were of his wounds deep
All hole, and than he should him give
Land, where upon he might live.
Thelemachus when he this herd
Unto his fader he answered
And seyde: he would done his will.
So dwell they to geder stylle
These brethren, and the fader sterueth
Lo whereof sorcery serves
Through sorcerye his lust he wan
Through sorcery his woe began
Through sorcerye his love he chese
Through sorcery his life he lose
The child was get in sorcerye
The which did all his felony
Thing which was again kind wrought
Vnkyndlyche it was a bought
The child his own fader slough
That was vnkyndshyp enough.
For thy take heed how that it is
So for to win love amys
which ends all his joy in woe
For of this art I find so
That has be do for loves sake
whereof thou might insample take
A great cronycke Imperial
which ever in to memoryall
Among the men, how so it wend
Shall dwell / to the worlds end
HIC narrat exemplum super eobem, qualiter Nectanabus de Egipto in Macedoniam
fugitiuus Olimpiadem Philippi regis ibide^ tu^c absentis vxorem art magyca
decipiens, cum ipsa concubuit / magnumque ex ea Alexandrum sortelegus genuit,
qui naius postea cum ad erudiendit sub custodia. Nectanabi co^mendatus fuisset,
ipsum Nectanabum patrem suum ab altitudine cuiusdam turris in fossam profundam
precipiens inter fecit, Et sic sortilegus pro suo sortilegio infortunii sortem
sortitus est.
The high creator of things
which is the king of all kings
Full many wonder worlds chance
Let slide under his sufferaunce
There wot no man the cause why
But he, the which is almighty
And that was proved whylom thus
when that the king Nectanabus
which had Egypt for to lead
But for he sygh tofore the deed
Through magike of his sorcerie
whereof he couth a great party
His ennemies to him comende
From whom he might him not defend
Out of his own land he fled
And in the wise, as he him dredde
It fell, for all his wytchecrafte
So that Egypt him was berafte
And he desguysed fled away
Byshyp, and held the right way
To Macedoyne, where that he
Arryueth at the chief city.
Three yomen of his chamber there
All only for to serve him were
The which he trusts wonder well
For they were true as any stele
And happens, that they with him ladde
Part of the best good he had
They take lodging in the town
After the disposition
where as him thought best to dwell
He axeth than, and herd tell
How that the king was out go
Upon a werre he had tho
But in that city than was
The queen, which Olympias
was hot, and with solempnite
The feste of her natiuite
As it befell, was than hold
And for her lust to be behold
And preysed of the people about
She shope her for to ryden out
At after meat all openly
Anon all men were ready
And that was in the month of May.
This lusty queen in good array
was set upon a mule white
To seen it was a great delight
The joy that the city made.
with fresshe things, and with glade
The noble town was all behonged
And every wight was sore alonged
To se this lusty lady ride.
There was great mirth on all side
where as she passes by the street
There was full many a tymbre beat
And many a maid carolende.
And thus through out the town plaiend
This queen unto the pleyne rode
where that she houed and abode
(...) se diverse games play
^he lusty folk just and journey
And so forth every other man
which pley couth, his pley began
(...) plese with this noble queen.
Nectanabus came to the grene
Among other, and drough him nigh
(...) when that he this lady sygh
and of her beauty head took
^e couth not withholde his look
^o s^ naught else in the field
But stood, and only her beheld.
Of his clothing, and of his gere
He was vnlyche all other there
So that it happens at last
The queen upon him her eye cast
And knew, that he was strange, anon
But he beheld her ever in one
without blenchynge of his chere.
She took good head of his manner
And wondreth, why he did so
And bad men should for him go.
He came, and did her reverence.
And she him asks in silence
From whens he came, and what he would
And he with sobre words told.
He says: Madame a clerk I am
To you and in message I came
The which I may not tellen here
But if it likes you to here
It mote be said so privily
where none shall be, but ye and I.
Thus for the time he took his leave.
The day gothe forth till it was eve
That every man mote leave his work
And she thought ever upon this clerk
what thing it is, that he would mean
And in this wise abode the queen
And ouerpasseth thylke night
Till it was on the morrow light
She send for him, and he came
with him his Astrolabe he name
with points and cercles merueylous.
which was of fine gold precious
And eke the heavenly fygures
wrought in a book full of peyntures
He took this lady for to show
And told of each of hem by rewe
The course and the condition.
And she with great affection
Sat still and herd what he would.
And thus when he sees time, he told
And feyneth with his words wise
A tale, and seyth in such a wise.
Madame but a while a go
where I was in Egypt tho
And radde in schole of this science
It fell in to my conscience
That I unto the temple went
And there with all my holle intent
As I my sacrifice deed
One of the gods has me bid
That I you warn privily
So that ye make you ready
And that ye be nothing aghast
For he such love has to you cast
That ye shall been his own dear
And he shall be your bedfere
Till ye conceive and be with child.
And with that word she wex all mylde,
And somdele read bicame for shame,
And asks him the gods name
which so woll done her company.
And he seide Amos of Luby /
And she says, that may I not leave
But if I se a better preue.
Madame, quod Nectanabus
In token that it shall be thus
This night for enformation
ye shall have a vision
That Amos shall to you appear
To show and teache in what manner
The thing shall afterward befall
ye oughten well abouen all
To make joy of such a lord.
For when ye be of one accord
He shall a son of you begete
which with his sword shall win and get
The wide world in length and bread.
All erthely kings shall him dread
And in such wise I you behote
The god of earth he shall be hot.
If this be sothe, tho quod the queen
This night (thou seyest) it shall be seen
And if it fall in to my grace
Of god Amos that I purchase
To take of him so great worship
I wol do the such ladyshyp
whereof thou shalt for euermo
Be rich, And he her thanketh tho
And took his leave, and forth he went.
She wist little, what he meant
For it was gyle and sorcerye
All that she took for prophecye.
Nactanabus through out the day
when he came home, where as he lay
His chamber he him self bitoke
And ouertorneth many a book
And through the craft of artemage
Of wexe he forged an image
He looks his equacions
And eke the constellacions
He looks the conjunctions
He looks the receptions
His sign, his hour, his ascendent
And draws fortune of his assent
The name of queen Olympias
In thylke image written was
A mids in the front above.
And thus to win his lust of love
Nectanabus this work has dyght
And when it came within night
That every wight is fall a sleep
He thought he would his time keep
As he, which has his hour appointed.
And than first he has anointed
with sundry herbs that figure
And thereupon he began conjure
So that through his enchantement
This lady, which was innocent
And wyste nothing of this guyle
Met, as she slepte thylke while
How fro the heaven came a light
which all her chamber made light
And as she looks to and fro
She sigh, her thought, a dragon tho
whose scherdes shynen as the son
And has his soft pas begone
with all the chere that he may
Toward the bed there as she lay
Till he came to the beds side
And she lay still, and nothing cryde
For he did all his things fair
And was courteis, and debonayre
And as he stood her fast by
His form he changes suddenly
And the figure of man he nome
To her and in to bed he come
And such thing there of love he wrought
whereof, so as her than thought
Through lykenes of this god Amos
with child anon her womb aros
And she was wonder glad withal.
Nectanabus, which causes all
Of this metred the substance
when he sees time his nygromance
He stynt, and nothing more seyde
Of his carecte, and she abreyde
Out of her sleep, and leueth well
That it is soth than every dele
Of that this clerk her had told
And was the glader many fold
In hope of such a glad metrede
which after shall befalle in deed
She longs sore after the day
That she her sweuen tell may
To this gilour in priuete
which knew it also well as she
And netheles on morrow sone
She left al other thing to done
And for him sent: and all the cas
She told him pleynely, as it was
And said: how than well she wist
That she his words might tryst
For she fond her auision
Right after the condition
which he her had told to fore
And praide him hertely therefore
That he her hold covenant
So forth of all the remenant
That she may through his ordinance
Toward god do such plesance
That she wakende might him keep
In such wise, as she met a sleep.
And he that couthe of guyle enough
when be this herd, for joy he lough
And seyth: Madame it shall be do
But this I warn you thereto
This night, when that he comth to play
That there be no life in the way
But I, that shall at his liking
Ordeine so for his coming
That ye ne shall not of him fail.
For this madame I you counsel
That ye it keep so prive
That no wight else, but we three
Have knowlechynge, how that it is
For else might it fare amys
If ye did ought, that should him grieve.
And thus he makth her to believe
And fayneth under guyle feyth
But netheles all that he seyth
She troweth: and ayene the night
She has within her chamber dyght
where as this guyler fast by
Upon this god shall privily
Awayte, as he makth her to wene.
And thus this noble gentle queen
when she most trysted, was deceived.
The night came, and the chamber is weiued
Nectanabus has take his place
And when he sigh time and space
Through the disceite of his magyke
He put him out of man's like
And of a dragon took the form
As he, which would him all conform
To that she saw in sweuener this.
And thus to chamber come he is
The queen lay a bed, and syghe
And hops ever, as he came nyghe
That he god of Luby were
So has she well the less fere
But for he would her more assure
yet efte he changes his figure
And of a wether the likeness
He took in sign of his noblesse
with large horns for the nones
Of fine gold and rich stones.
A crown on his heed he bare
And sodeinlyche, er she was ware
As he, which all guyle can
His form he torneth in to man
And came to bed, and she lay still
where as she suffers all his will
As she, which wend not mysdo.
But netheles it happens so
All though she were in part deceived
yet for all that she has conceived
The worthiest of all kithe
which ever was tofore or since
Of conquest, and of chyualrye
So that through gyle and sorcery
There was that noble knight begone
which all the world has after won
Thus fell the thing, which fall should
Nectanabus has that he would
with gyle he has his love sped
with gyle he came in to the bed
with gyle he gothe him out ayene
He was a shrewed chamberleyne
So to begyle a worthy queen
And that on him was after seen.
But netheles the thing is do
This false god was sone go
with his deceyte, and held him close
Till morrow came, that he arose
And tho, when time and leyser was
The queen told him all the cas
As she, that gyle none supposes
And of two points she him apposeth.
One was, if that this god no more
will come ayene: and ouermore
How she shall stonden in accord
with king Philip her own lord
when he comth home, and sees her groan
Madame, he seyth, let me alone
As for the god I undertake
That when it lyketh you to take
His company at any throw
If I a day to fore it know
He shall be with you on the night
And he is well of such a might
To keep you from al blame.
For thy comfort you madame
There shall none other cause be.
Thus took he leave, and forth goth he.
And tho began be for to muse
How he the queen might excuse
Toward the king, of that is fall
And found a craft among all
Through which he has a se foul da^ted
with his magike, and so enchaunted
That he flewe forth, when it was night
Unto the kings tent right
where that he lay amidde his host.
And when he was a sleep most
with that the se foull to him brought
An other charm, which he wrought
At home within his chamber stylle.
The king he torneth at his will
And makth him for to dreme and se
The dragon and the priuete
which was between him and the queen.
And over that he made him wene
In sweuen, how that the god Amos
when he up fro the queen aros
Took forth a ring, wherein a stone
was set and grave thereupon
A son, in which when he came nighe
A lion with a sword he sigh.
And with that prente, as he so met
Upon the queen's womb he set
A seal, and goth him forth his way
with that the sweuen went a way.
And tho began the king a wake
And sighe for his wives sake
where as he lay within his tent
And has great wonder, what it mente.
with that he hasted him to rise
Anon and sent after the wise.
Among the which there was one
A Clerk, his name is Amphyon
when he the kings sweuen herd
what it betokneth he answerde
And says, as sekerly as the life
A god has layne by thy wife
And got a son, which shall win The world, and all that is withinne.
As the lion is king of beasts
So shall the world obey his bestes
which with his sword shall al be won
Als far as shyneth any son.
The king was doutife of this dome
But netheles when that be come
Again into his own land
His wife with child great be found
He might not him selfen stere
That he ne made her heavy chere.
But he which couth of all sorrow
Nectanabus upon the morrow
Through the deceyte of Nygromaunce
Took of a dragon the semblaunce
And where the king sat in his halle
Came in rampende among hem all
with such a noise and such a rore
That they aghast were all so sore
As though they should dye anon
And netheles he greueth none
But goth toward the deyse on bye
And when he came the queen nigh
He stynt his noise, and in his wise
To her he profreth his service
And layth his heed upon her barme
And she with goodly chere her arm
About his neck ayenewarde laid
And thus the queen with him playde
In sight of all men about
And at last began to loute
And obeysaunce unto her make
As he that would his leave take.
And suddenly his lothely form
In to an egle began transform
And flewe, and set him on a rail
whereof the king had great marvel
For there he pruneth him and pyketh
As does an hawk, when him well lyketh
And after that him self he shoke
whereof that all the halle quoke
As it a terremote were.
They seyden all, god was there
In such a rees and forth he flygh.
The king, which all this wonder sygh
when he came to his chamber alone
Unto the queen made his moan
And of foryeues he her praide.
For than he knew well, as he said
She was with child with a god.
Thus was the king without rod
Chastised, and the queen excused
Of that she had been accused.
And for the greatter evidence
yet after that in the presence
Of king Philip, and other mo
when they yode in the fyldes tho
A fesaunt came before her eye
The which anon, as they her seye
Fleende, let an neye down fall
And it to brake tofore hem all.
And as they token thereof keep
They sigh out of the shelle crepe
A l^tell serpent on the ground
which rampeth all about round
And in ayene he woll have won
But for the brennyng of the son
It might not, and so be deide.
And thereupon the clerks seyde
As the serpent, when it was out
went enuyron the shelle about
And might not torn in ayene
So shall it fall in certain
This child the world shall enuirone
And above all, the corone
Him shall befall, and in his young age
He shall desire in his courage
when all the world is in his hand
To turn ayene unto the land
where he was bore, and in his weye
Homewarde he shall with poison deye.
The king, which all this sigh and herd
Fro that day forth, how so it ferde
His ielousye has all foryete
But he, which has the child begete
Nectanabus in priuite
The time of his natiuite
Upon the constellation
Awayteth, and relation
Makes to the queen, how she had do
And every hour appoints so
That no mynute thereof was lore.
So that in due time is bore
This child: and forthwith thereupon
There fell wonders many one
Of teremote vniuersele.
The son took colloure of stele
And lost his light, the winds blewe
And many strengthes ouerthrewe
These his propre kind changes
And all the world his form strangeth
The thonder with his fyry leven
So cruel was upon the heaven
That every erthely creature
Tho thought his life in adventure.
The tempest at last sesseth
The child is kept, his age encreceth:
And Alisaunder his name is hot
To whom Calystre and Arystote
To techen him philosophye
Entenden: and Astronomye
(with other things, which he couth
Also to teache him in his youth)
Nectanabus took upon hand
But every man may understand
Of sorcery, how that it wend
It wolle him self prove at end
And namely for to begyle
A lady / which without gyle
Supposes truth all that she hereth
But often he, that evil stereth
His ship is dreint therein a mydde
And in this cas right so betydde
Nectanabus upon a night
when it was fair and sterre light
This young lord lad upon high
A boue a tower, where as he syghe
The sterres such as he acounteth
And says, what each of hem amounts
As though he knew of all thing
yet has he no knowlechinge
what shall unto him self befall
when he has told his words all
This young lord than him apposeth
And asks, if that he supposes
what death he shule him self deye.
He seith, or fortune is aweye
And every sterre has lost his won
Or else of mine own son
I shall be slain, I may not fle
Thought Alysaunder in priuete
Hereof this old dotarde lies.
Ander that other ought aspyeth
All sodeinlyche his old bones
He shofe over the wall at ones
And says him: Lie down there a part
whereof now serves all thyn art?
Thou knew all other men's chance
And of thy self have ignorance
That thou have said among all,
Of thy person is not befall.
Nectanabus which has his death
yet whiles him lasts life and brethe
To Alysaunder he spoke, and said:
That he with wrong blame on him leid.
Fro point to point and all the cas
He told, how he his son was.
Tho be, which sorry was enough
Out of the dyche his father drough
And told his mother, how it ferde
In counsel, and when she it herd
And knew the tokens, which he told
She nyst what she say should
But stood abashed, as for the while
Of this magike, and all the gyle.
She thought, how that she was deceived
That she has of a man conceived
And wend a god it had he.
But netheles in such degree
So as she might her honor save
She shope the body was begraue.
And thus Nectanabus abought
The sorcery, which he wrought
Though he upon the creatures
Through his caretes and fygures
The maystry and the power had
His creator to naught him lad
Again whose law his craft he uses
when he for lust his god refuses
And took him to the deuyls craft
Lo what profit is him belafte?
That thing through which he we^d have stand
First him exiled out of land
which was his own, and from a king
Made him to be an vnderlynge
And sythen to deceive a queen
That torneth him to mochel tene
Through lust of love he gat him hate
That end couth he naught abate
His old sleyghtes, which he cast
young Alisandre him ouercast.
His father, which him mysbegat
He sloughe, a great myshappe was that
But for omys, an other mys
was yolde, and so full often it is.
Nectanabus his craft myswent
And so it mysfell him, er he went
I not what helps that clergy
which makes a man to do folly
And namelyche of Nygromance
which stont upon the myscreance.
Nota qualiter rex Zorastes statim cum ab vtero matris sue nasceretur gaud^o
magno risit, in quo pronosticum doloris subsequentis signum figurabatur. Nam et
ipse detestabilis artis magice primus fuit inuentor, que^ postea rex Surrie
dira morte trucidauit, et sic opus operariu^ co^sumpsit.
And for to se more evidence
Zorastes, which thexperience
Of art magike ferst forth drough
Anon as he was bore he lough
which token was of woe suinge.
For of his own controuinge
He fond magik, and taught it forth
But all that was him little worth
For of Surry a worthy king
Him slew, and that was his endinge.
But yet through him this craft is used
And he through all the world excused
For it shall never well acheue
That stont not right with the believe
But liche to wolle is evil sponne
who leseth him self has litell won
And end proves every thing.
Saul, which was of jews king
Up pain of death forbad this art
And yet he took thereof his part.
The phitonysse in Samary
yafe him counsel by sorcery
which after fell to much sorrow
For he was slain upon the morrow.
To conne mochell thing it helps
But of to much no man yelpeth.
So for to look on every side
Magyke may not well betyde.
For thy my son I woll the read
That thou of these ensamples dread
That for no lust of erthly love
Thou seche so to come above
whereof as in the worlds wonder
Thou shall for ever be put under.
My good fader grant mercy
For ever I shall beware thereby
Of love what me so befalle
Such sorcery abouen all
Fro this day forth I shall eschew
That so ne will I not pursewe
My lust of love for to seche.
But this I would you beseech
Beside that me stant of love
As I you herd speak above
How Alysandre was betaught
Of Arystotle, and so well taught
Of all that to a king belongs
whereof my heart sore longs
To wit what it would mean.
For by reason I would wene
But if I herd of things strange
Yet for a time it should change
My pain, and lisse me somdele.
My good son thou say well
For wisdom how that ever it stand
To him that can it understand
Does great profit in sundry wise
But touchend of so high a pryse
which is not unto Venus know
(...) may it not my self know
which of her court am all forth draw
And can no thing but of her law.
But netheles to know more
As well as thou, me longs sore
And for it helps to commune
All be they naught to me common
The schools of philosophye
Yet think I for to specyfye
In books as it is comprehended
whereof thou might ben amended.
For though I be not all counninge
Upon the form of this wrytinge
Some part thereof yet I have herd
In this matter how it has ferd.
Explicit liber sextus.
QVIA OMNIS DOCTRIna bona humano regimini salute^ confert / In hoc septimo
libro ad instantiam amantis languidi intendit Genius illam, ex qua philosophi
et Astrologi philosophy doctrinam regem Alexandrum imbuerunt secundum aliquid
declarare. Diuidit enim philosophiam in tres parts / quarum prima Theorica /
secunda Rhetorica, tertia Practica nuncupata est, de quarum condicionibus
subsequenter per singula tractabit.

Incipit liber Septimus
Omnibus in causis sapiens doctrina salutem
Consequitur, nec habet quis nisi docttus open.
Naturam superat doctrina uiro quod et ortus
Ingenij docilis no^ dedit, ipsa dabit.
Non ita discretus hominum per climata regnat
Quin magis ut sapiat, indiget ipse scholae.
I Genius the priest of love
My son as thou have praid above
That I the schole shall declare
Of Aristotle, and eke the fare
Of Alysaunder, bow he was taught
I am somdele thereof distraught
For it is not the matere
Of love, why we sytten here
To shryue so as Venus badde
But netheles for it is glad
So as thou say for thyn appryse
To here of such things wise
whereof thou might thy time lysse
So as I can, I shall the wysse
For wisdom is at every throw
Above all other thing to know
In loves cause and else where
For thy my son unto thyn ear
Though it be not in the registre
Of Venus, yet of that calistre
And Aristotle whylom write
To Alysaunder, thou shall wit
But for the lores ben diverse
I think first to the reherce
The matter of philosophy
which Aristotle of his clergy
wise and expert in the science
Declared thilke intelligence
As of the points principalle
whereof the first in specialle
Is Theoryke, which is grounded
On him, which all the world has founded
which comprehended all the lore.
And for to loken ouermore
Next of science the second
Is Rhetoric, whose facounde
Above all other is eloquent.
To tell a tale in judgment
So well can no man speak as he.
The last science of the three
It is practyke, whose office
The virtue tries fro the vice
And techeth upon good thewes
To fle the company of shrewes
which stant in disposicion
Of man's fre election.
Practyke enformeth eke the rewle
How that a worthy king shall rule
His realm, both in werre and pees.
Lo thus dane Aristoteles
These three sciences has divided
And in nature also decyded
whereof that each of hem shall serve.
The first which is the conserve
And keeper of the remenaunte
As that, which is most suffisaunt
And chief of the philosophye.
If I thereof shall speciphye
So as the philosopher told
Now bark, and keep that thou it hold.
Prima creatorem dat scire scientia summum.
Qui capit, agnoscit, sufficit illud ei.
Plura viros quandoque iuuat nescire, sed illud,
Quod vidit ex pediens sobrius ille sapit.
HIC TRACTAT DE PRIma part philosophy, que theorica dicitur / cuius natura
triplici dotata est sciencia / scilicet Theologia, Phisica, et Mathematica, Sed
primo illam partem Theologice declarabit.
Of Theoryk principalle
The philosopher in specialle
The propirtes has determined
As thilke which is enlumined
Of wisdom, and of high prudence
Above all other in his science
And stant departed upon three
The i frst of which in his degree
Is cleped in philosophye
The science of Theology
That other named is phisike
The third is seide Mathematike.
Theology is that science
which unto man yeueth evidence
Of thing, which is not bodily
whereof men know redely
The high almighty trinite
which is o god in unite
withouten end and beginning
And creature of all thing
Of heaven, of earth, and of hell
whereof as old books tell
The philosopher in his reason
wrote upon this conclusion
And of his writynge in a clause
He clepeth god the first cause
which of him self is thylke good
withouten whom nothing is good
Of which that every creature
Has his being, and his nature.
After the being of the things
There ben three forms of beynges
Nota quod triplex dicitur assencia. Prima te^poranea, que incipit and definit:
Secunda perpetua, que incipit / et non definit / Tercia sempiterna / que nec
incipit, nec definit.
Thing which began, and end shall
That thing is cleped temporal
There is also by other way
Thing, which began and shall not dey
As souls, that been spirituell
Her being is perpetuell.
But there is one above the son
whose time never was bigonne
And endless shall ever be
That is the god, whose mageste
All other things shall govern
And his being is sempiterne.
The god, to whom all honor
Belongs, he is creatoure.
And other ben his creatures,
He commands the natures
That they to him obeien all.
withouten him, what so befalle
Her might is none, and he may all
The god was ever and ever shall
And they begone of his assente.
The times al ben present
To god, and to hem all unknow
But what him lyketh, that they know
Thus both an angel and a man
The which of all, that god began
Ben chief, obeien gods might
And he stont endeles up right.
To this science ben pryue
The clerks of divinity
The which unto the people preche
The feythe of holy church and teache
which in one ^as upon believe
Stant more than they can preue
By wey of argument sensyble
But netheles it is credible
And does a man great mede have
To him that thynkth him self to save
Theology in such a wise
Of high science and high aprise
^^oue all other stant unlike
And is the first of theorike.
(...) de secunda part Theorice, que Phisica (...).
Phisike is after the second
Through which the philosophre has fo^de
To teache sundry knowlechynges
Upon the bodelyche things
Of man, of be, of herb, of stone
Of f^^he, of foul, of euerichone
That been of bodily substance
The nature and the circumstaunce.
Through this science it is full sought
Which vaileth and which vaileth naught.
(...) tercia part Theorice / que Mathe^^^ (...), ^uius condicio quaruor in se
conti^ (...) ^^^gencias, scilicet Arithmeticam, Musica^ ^^^^^me^^^m / et
Astronomiam, Sed primo de (...) natura dicere intendit.
The third point of Theoryk
which cleped is Mathematyk
Divided is in sundry wise
And ^rant upon diverse apprise
The ferst of which is Arthmetik
And the second is said Musik
The therd is eke Geomatry
Also the forth Astronomye.
Of Arthmetyk the matere
As that of which a man may lere
what Algorysme in nombre amounts
when that the wise man accounts
After the formel proprete
Of Algorismes a, b, c.
By which multiplication
Is made, and diminution
Of sommes by thexperience
Of this art, and of this science.
Nota de musica, que secunda part artis mathematice dicitur.
The second of mathematike
which is the science of music
That teaches upon armony
A man to maken melody
By voice and soune of instrument
Through notes of accordement
The which men pronounce alofte
Now sharp notes, and now soft
Now hye notes, and now low
As by Gam vt, a man may know
which techeth the prolacion
Of note, and the condition.
Nota de tertia specie artis Mathematice / qud Geometriam vocant.
Mathematyke of his science
Has yet the third intelligence
Full of wisdom and of clergy
And cleped is Geometry
Through which a man has the sleight Of length, of bread, of depth, of heyght
To know the proporcion
By very calculacion
Of this science: and in this wise
These old philosophres wise
Of all this worlds earth round
How large, how thick was the ground
Contrived by the experience
The Cercle, and the circomference
Of every thing unto the heaven
They setten point and mesure even.
Mathemetike above the earth
Of high science above the ferth
which speaks upon Astronomy
And techeth of the sterres bye
Beginning upward fro the moon
But first, as it was for to done
This Aristotle in other thing
Unto this worthy young king
The kind of every element
which stant under the firmament
How it is made, and in what wise
Fro point to point began devise.
Quatuor omnipotens elementa creauit origo:
Quatuor et uenti partibus ora dabat.
Nostra que quadruplici complectio sort creatur.
Corpore sic que suo stat uariatus homo.
Hic traciat de creatione quatuor elementorum scilicet terre, aque, aeris, et
ignis, Nec non et de eorum naturis nam et singulis proprietates singula
attribituntur.
Tofore the creation
Of any worlds station
Of heaven, of earth, or eke of hell
So as these old books tell
As soune to fore the song is set
And yet they ben to gether knet:
Right so the high purueance
Tho had under his ordenance
A great substance, a great mattere
Of which he would in his manner
These other things make and form
For yet withouten any form
was that matere universal
which hight Ilem in special.
Of Ilem as I am informed
These elements ben made and formed.
Of Ilem clementes they hot
After the schole of Aristote
Of which if more I shall rehearse
Four elements there ben diverse.
Nota de terra, quod est primum elementum.
The first of hem, men earth call
which is the lowest of hem all:
And in his form is shape round
Substanciall, strong, sad, and sound
As that, which made is suffisant
To bear up all the remenant.
For as the point in a compass
Stant even amyddes, right so was
This earth set, and shall abide
That it may swerue to no side.
And has his center after the law
Of kind: and to that Center draw
Desires every worlds thing:
If there ne were no lettynge.
Nota de aqua, quod est secundum elementum.
Above the earth keeps his bound
The water, which is the second
Of elements: and all without
It enuyronneth therthe about.
But as it shows naught for thy
The subtyle water myghtily
Though it be of him self soft
The strength of the earth passes often.
For right as veins ben of blood
In man, right so the water flood
Therth of his course makth full of veins
Als well the hills as the pleines:
And that a man may seen at eye.
For where the hills ben most hye
There may men well stremes find.
So preueth it by way of kind
The water higher than the land.
And over this now understand
Nota de era, quod est tertium elementum.
Air is the third of elements
Of whose kind his aspirementes
Takes every lyuysshe creature
The which shall upon earth endure.
For as the fysshe if it be dry
Mote in defaute of water dye
Right so without air on live
No man, ne be, might thryue
The which is made of flesh and bone
There is out take of all none.
Nota quod aer in tribus periferiss diuiditur.
This air in periferis three
Divided is of such degree:
Beneth is one, and one amydde
To which above is the thrydde.
And upon the deuysions
There ben diverse oppressions
Of moist, and eke of dry also
which of the son both two
Ben draw, and haled upon bye
And maken clouds in the sky
And showed is at man's sight
whereof by day, and eke by night
After the times of the year
Among us upon earth here
In sundry wise things fall
Nota de prima aeris periferia.
The first periferye of all
Engenders mist, and ouermore
The dewes, and the frostes bore
After thilke interstition
In which they take impression.
Nota de secunda aeris periferia.
Fro the second, as books seyne
The moist drops of the reyne
Descenden in to the myddel earth
And tempreth it to sede and earth
And does to spring gras and flower
And often also the great shoure
Out of such place it may be take
That it the form shall forsake
Of reyne, and in to snow be turned
And eke it may be so soiourned
In sundry places up alofte
That in to hayle it tourneth often.
Nota de tertia aeris periferia.
The third of air, after the law
Through such matere as is up draw
Of dry thing, as it is often
Among the clouds upon lofte
And is so close, it may not out:
Than is it chased sore about
Till it to fire and leyte fall
And than it breketh the clouds all
The which of so great noise craken
That they the fearful thonder maken.
The thonder stroke smyt, er it leyte
And yet men seen the fire and leyte
The thonder stroke er that men here.
So may it well be proved here
In thing, which showed is fro far
A man's eye is there nerre
Than is the sound to man's ear
And netheles it is great fear
Both of the stroke, and of the fire
Of which is no recouerire
In place where that they discende
But if god would his grace send.
Nota qualiter ignes, quos motantur in ae^e discurrere videmus secundum varias
apparentie formas varia gesta ni nomina, quorum primus Assub, Secondus Capra
saliens, tertius Eges, Et quarius Daali in libris philosophorum nuncupa^ns est.
And for to speaken over this
In this part of the air it is
That men full often seen by night
The fire in sundry form alyght:
Sometime the fire drake it seems
And so the lewd people it demeth.
Sometime it seems as it were
A sterre, which that glydeth there.
But it is nether of the two
The philosophre tells so,
And seith: that of impressions
Through diverse exaltations
Upon the cause and the matere
Men seen diverse form appear
Of fire, the which hat^ bondry name.
Assub, he says, is thylke same
The which in sundry place is found
when it is fall down to ground
So as the fire it has aneled
Like unto slyme, which is congeled.
Of exaltation I find
Fire kengled of the same kind
But it is of an other form
whereof, if that I shall conform
The figure unto that it is
These old clerks tellen this:
That it is like a got skyppende
And for that it is such semende
It is hot Capra saliens.
And eke these Astronomyens
An other fire also by night
which shows him to man's sight
They clepen Eges, the which brenneth
Like to the current fire, that renneth
Upon a cord, as thou haste seen
when it with poudre is so besene
Of sulphur, and other things mo.
There is a another fire also
which seems to a man's eye
By nyghtes time, as though there fly
A^ragon brennynge in the sky
And that is cleped proprely
Da^li, whereof men say full often:
Lo where the fyrye drake a lofte
Flees up in thaire: and so they de^en.
But why the fyres such semen
Of sundry form to behold
The wise philosophre told
So as to fore it has been herd.
Lo thus my son it has ferde
Of air, the due proprete
In sundry wise thou might se.
And how under the firmament
It is eke the third element
which enuyroneth both two
The water and the land also.
Nota de igne, quod est quartum elementum.
And for to tell over this
Of elements, which the forth is
That is the Fire in his degree
which enuironeth the other three
And is without moist all dry.
But list now, what seyth the clergy.
For upon hem, that I have said
The creator has set and leyde
The kind and the complexion
Of all men's nation.
Four elements sundry there be
Lyche unto which of that degree
Among the men there been also
Complections four, and no mo:
whereof the philosophre treteth
That he nothing behind leteth
And seyth, how that they been diverse
So as I shall to the reherce.
Nota hic qualiter secundum naturam quatuor elementoru^, quatuor in humano
corpore complexiones scilicet Mela^colia, Flengma, Sa^guis, et Colera
naturaliter constituuntur, vnde primo de Melancolia dicendum est.
He which naturith every kind
The mighty god, so as I find
Of man, which is his creature
Has so divided the nature:
That none till other well accords.
And by the cause it so discordeth
The life, which feleth the sykenesse
May stand upon no likernesse.
Of therthe, which is cold and dry
The kind of man Melancolye
Is cleped, and that is the first
The most vngoodlyche, and the werste.
For unto loves work on night
Him lacks both will and might.
No wondre is in lusty place
Of love though he lose grace.
what man has that complexion
Full of imagination
Of deeds, and of wrathful thought
He freteth him seluen all to naught.
De complexione fleugmatis.
The water, which is moist and cold
Makes fleme, which is manyfolde
Foryetel, slow, and weary sone
Of every thing, which is to done.
He is of kind suffisaunt
To hold love his covenant:
But that him lacks appetyte
which longs unto such delight.
De complexione sanguinis.
what man that takth his kind of thaier
He shall be light, he shall be fair.
For his complexion is blood
Of all there is none so good
For he has both will and might
To please and pay love his right
where as he has love undertake
wrong is, if that he forsake.
De complexione colere.
The first of his condition
Appropreth the complexion
whose properties ben dry and hot
which in a man is coler hot
It makes a man ben engynous
And swyfte of foot, and eke yrous.
Of conteke, and fool hastynesse
He has a right great business
To think on love and little may
Though he be hot well a day
On night when that he woll assay
He may full evil his dettes pay
Nota qualiter quatuor complexiones quatuor in homine habitationes diuisim
possident.
After the kind of thelement
Thus stant a man's kind went
As touchend his complexion
Upon sundry division
Of dry, of moist, of chele, of beat
And each of hem his own sete
Appropred has within a man.
And first to tell as I began
Splen domus melancholy.
The splen is to Melancolye
Assigned for berbyrgery.
Pulmo domus flengmatis.
The moist fleume, with the cold
Has in the longes for his hold
Ordained him a propre stead
To dwell there as he is bid.
Epar domus sanguinis.
To the sanguine complexion
Nature of his inspection
A propre bous has in the liver
For his dwellinge made deliver.
Fell domus colere.
The dry coler, with his beat
By wey of kind his propre sete
Has in the galle, where be dwells
So as the philosophre tells
Nota de stomacho, qui vna cum aliis cordi s^ec^alius deseruit.
Now over this is for to wit
As it is in phisike write
Of liver, of long, of galle, of spleen
They all unto the heart been
Servants, and each in his office
Entenden to don him service
As he which is chief lord above.
The liver makth him for to love
The long gives him wey of speech
The galle serves to do wreche
The splen does him to laugh and pl^y
when all uncleanness is a way.
Lo thus has each of hem his deed
To susteynen hem and feed.
In time of recreation
Nature has increation
The stomach for a comune koke
Ordained so, as says the book.
The stomach cook is for the ball
And boyleth mete for hem all
To make hem mighty for to serve
The heart, that he shall naught sterue.
For as a king in his empire
Above all other is lord and sire:
So is the heart principal
To whom reason in special
Is give, as for the governance.
And thus nature his purueance
Has made for man to lyuen here.
But god, which has the soul dear
Has formed it in other wise,
That can no man pleynely devise.
But as the clerks us inform
That lyche to god it has a form.
Through which figure, and which likeness
The soul has many an high noblesse
Appropried to his own kind.
But of her wits ben made blind
Al onelyche of this ylke point
That her abydyng is conioynte
Forth with the body for to dwell.
That one desires toward belle
That other upward to the heaven
So shall they never stand in even.
But if the flesh be overcome
And that the soul have holly nome
The governance: and that is selde
while that the flesh him may bewelde
All erthely thing, which god began
was only made to serve man.
But he the soul all only made
Him seluen for to serve and glade.
All other bestes that men find
They seruen unto her own kind.
But to reason the soul serves
whereof the man his thonke deserves
And get him with his works good
The perdurable lives food.
Hic laquitur vlterin^ de diuisione terre: que post diluuium tribus filiis Noe
in tres parts scilicet Asiam, Affricam / et Europam diuidevatur.
Of what matere it shall be told
A tale lyketh many fold
The better, if that it be spoke pleyne
Thus think I for to turn again
And tell plenerly therefore
Of the earth, whereof now tofore
I spoke, and of the water eke
So as these old books speak
And set properly the bound
After the form of Mappamounde
Through which the ground by purparties
Departed is in three parties
That is Asye, Affrike, Europe
The which under the heaven cope
Begrypeth all this earth round
As far as stretches any ground.
But after that the high wreche
The water weyes let out seche
And ouergo the hills bye
which every kind made dye
That upon myddell earth stood
Out take Noe, and his blood
His sons, and his daughters three
They were save, and so was he.
Her names, who that read right
Sem, Came, Iaphet, the brethern hight
And when thylke almighty bond
withdrough the water fro the land
And all the rage was away:
And earth was the man's way:
The sons three, of which I told
Right after that hem self would
This world depart they begone.
Asia, which lay to the son
Upon the march of Oryent
was granted by commune assent
To Sem, which was the son eldest
For that party was the best
And double, as much as other two.
And was that time bounded so
where as the flood, which men Nile calls
Departed fro his course, and falls
In to the sea Alexandryne
There takes Asye first sesyne
Towardeth weste, and over this
Of Canabim, where the flode is
In to the great see rennende
Fro that in to the worlds end
Estwarde Asye it is algates
Till that men comen to the gates
Of paradys, and there ho.
And shortly for to speak it so
Of Orient in general
within his bound Asye has all.
De Africa et Europa.
And than upon that other side
westwarde, as it fell thylke tide
The brother, which was hot Came
Unto his part Affryke nam.
Iaphet Europe tho took he
Thus parten they the world on three.
But yet there ben of lands feel
In Occident, as for the chele
In orient as for the hete
which of the people be forlete
As land deserte, that is unable
For it may not ben habitable.
Nota de mare, quod magnu^ Oceanu^ dicitur.
The water eke has sundry bound
After the land, where it is found
And takth his name of thylke lands
where that it renneth on the strondes.
But thilke se, which has no wane.
Is cleped the great Ocean:
Out of which arise and come
The hye flouddes all and some.
Is none so little well spring
which there ne takth his beginning
And lyche a man that lacks brethe
By wey of kind, so it gethe
Out of the sea, and in again
The water as the books seyne.
Nota hic secundum philosophum de quinto elemento, quod omnia sub celo creata
infra suum ambitum continet, cui nomen orbis specialiter appropriatum est.
Of elements the properties
How that they stonden by degrees
As I have told, now might thou here
My good son all the matere
Of earth, of water, air, and fire.
And for thou say, that thy desire
Is for to weten ouermore
The form of Aristotle's lore.
He says in his entendement
That yet there is an element
Above the four, and is the fyfte
Set of the high gods yefte:
The which that Orbis cleped is.
And thereupon he tells this
That as the shelle bole and sound
Encloseth all about round
what thing within a neye belongs:
Right so this Orbis vnderfongeth
These elements euerychone
which I have spoke of one and one.
But over this now take good head
My son: for I wol proceed
To speak upon Mathematyke
which grounded is on Theoryke.
The science of Astronomye
I think for to specifye
without which to tell plain
All other science is in vain
Toward the schole of erthly things.
For as an egle with his wings
Flees above all that men find
So does this science in his kind.
Lege planetarum magis inferiora reguntur
(...) ^ed interdum regula fallit opus.
(...) ^d^ante deo, sapiens dominabitur astris,
(...) nec immerito quod nouitatis agunt.
Hic soquitur de artis Mathematice quarta (...), que astronomia nuncupatur, cui
eciam Asti^^ogia socia connumeratur, Sed primo de se^^em planetis, que inter
astra potenciores existu^t, I^^ piendo a luna seorsum tractare intendit.
Bynethe upon this earth here
Of all things the matere
As tellen us they, that been learned
Of thing above it stont governed
That is to seyne of the planetes
The cheles both, and eke the hetes.
The chances of the world also
That we fortune clepen so
Among the men's nation
All is through constellacion
whereof that some man has the well:
And some men have diseses feel
In love as well as other things.
The state of realms, and of kings
In time of pees, in time of werre
It is conceived of the sterre.
And thus seyth the naturien
which is an Astonomyen.
But the divine says other wise
That if men were good and wise
And pleasant unto the godhede
They should not the sterres dread.
For one man, if him well befalle
Is more worth than be they all
Toward him, that weldeth all.
But yet the law original
which he has set in the natures
Mot worchen in the creatures
That thereof may be none obstacle
But if it stand upon miracle
Through prayer of some holy man.
And for thy so as I began
To speak upon astronomye
As it is write in the clergy
To tell how the planetes fare
Some part I think to delare
My son unto thin audience.
Astronomy is the science
Of wisdom and of high coninnge
which makth a man have knowleching
Of sterres in the fermament
Figure, circle, and mouement
Of each of hem in sundry place:
And what between hem is of space
How so they move or stand fast
All this it tells to the last.
Assembled with astronomy
Is eke that ilke astrology
The which in judgment accounts
Theffecte, what every sterre amounts.
And how they causen many a wonder
To the clymates, that stond hem under.
And for to tell it more pleyne
These old philosophers seyne
That Orbis, which I spoke of er
Is that, which fro therthe a far
Behold, and firmament it call
In which the sterres stonden all.
Among the which in special
Planettes seven principalle
There ben, that man's sight demeth:
By thorizont, as to us seems.
And also there ben signs twelve
which have her cercles by hem selue
Compassed in the Zodiake:
In which they have her places take.
And as they stonden in degree
Her cercles more or less be
Made after the proportion
Of the earth, whose condition
Is set, to be fundament
To sustain up the firmament.
And by this skylle a man may know
The more that they stonden low
The more ben the cercles less
That causes why that some pass
Her due course tofore an other.
But now my lieue dear brother
As thou desyrest for to wit
what I find in the books write
To tell of the planettes seven
How that they stand upon the heaven:
And in what point that they ben in
Take heed: for I woll begin:
So as the philosopher taught
To Alysaunder and it be taught
whereof that he was fully taught
Of wysdom, which was him betaught.
Nota hic de prima planeta / que aliis inferior luna dicitur.
Benethe all other stont the Moon
The which has with the sea to done
Of floodes high, and ebbes low
Upon his change it shall be know.
And every fysshe, which has a shelle
Mote in his governance dwell
To wexe and wane in his degree
As by the moon a man may se
And all that stont upon the ground
Of his moisture, it mote be found.
All other sterres, as men find
Ben shynende of her own kind
Out take only the moon light
which is not of him self bright
But as he takth it of the son.
And yet he has naught all full won
His light, that he nis somdell derke
But what the let is of that work
In Almagest it tells this.
The mones cercle so low is
whereof the son out of his stage
Ne seth him not with full visage
For he is with the ground beshaded
So that the moon is somdele faded
And may not fully shine clear.
But what man under his powere
Is bore, he shall his place change
And seche many lands strange.
And as of this condition
The mones disposicion
Upon the land of Alemayne
Is set, and eke upon Britayne
which now is cleped England
For they travail in every land.
De secunda planeta, que Mercurine dicitur.
Of the planetes the second.
Above the moon has take his bond
Mercurye: and his nature is this
That under him who that borne is
In book he shall be studious
And in writing curious
And slow and lustles to travail
In thing, which else might avail
He loves ese, he loves rest
So is be not the worthiest.
But yet with somdele besinesse
His heart is set upon richesse.
And as in this condition
Theffecte and disposicion
Of this planete, and of his chance
Is most in Borgoyne, and in France.
De tercia planeta / que Venus dicitur.
Next to Mercurye as wolle befalle
Stont that planet, which men call
Venus: whose constellacion
Governs all the nation
Of lovers, where they speed or none.
Of which I trow thou be one.
But whetherward thin happes wend
Shall this planete show at end
As it has do to many mo.
To some well, to some woe.
And netheles of this planete
The most party is soft and sweet.
For who that thereof takth his birth
He shall desire joy and myrthe
Gentyl curtoys and debonayre
To speak his words soft and fair
Such shall he be by wey of kind.
And ouerall where he may find
Plesaunce of love, his heart boweth
with all his might and there he woweth.
He is so forforth amorous
He not what thing is vicious.
Touchend love for that law
There may no manner man withdraw
The which Veneryen is bore
By wey of kind, And therefore
Venus of love the goddess
Is cleped, but of wanto^nesse
The climate of her lecherye
Is most comune in lumbardye.
(...) de sole, qui medio planetarum residens, ^^^^rum principatum obtinet.
Next unto this planete of love
The bright son stont above
which is the hind^rer of the night
And fortherer of the days light:
As he which is the worlds eye
Through whom the lusty company
Of fowls by the morrow singe:
The fresshe flowers sprede and spring
The high tree the ground beshadeth
And every man's heart gladdeth
And for it is the head planete
How that he sits in his sete
Of what richesse, of what nobleye
These books tell: and thus they seye.
Nota de curru solis, necnon de v^rio eiusdem apparatu,
Of gold glistrende spoke and whele
The son his carte has fair and well
In which he sit, and is coroned
with bright stones enuyroned:
Of which if that I speak shall
There be tofore in special
Set in the front of his corone
Three stones, which no person
Has upon earth, and the first is
By name cleped Licuchis.
That other two cleped thus
Astrices and Ceraunus
In his corone, and also behind
By old books as I find
There ben of worthy stones three
Set each of hem in his degree
whereof a Crystal is that one
which that corone is set upon.
The second is an adamant.
The third is noble and auenaunt
which cleped is Idriades
And over this yet netheles
Upon the sides of the work
After the writing of the clerk.
There sytten five stones mo
The Smaragdine is one of tho
Iaspis and Elitropius
And Vendides and Iacinctus.
Lo thus the corone is beset
whereof it shyneth well the bet
And in such wise his light to sprede
Sit with his Diadem on heed
The son shynende in his carte
And for to lead him swithe and smarte
After the bright days law
There ben ordained for to draw
Four horse his chare, and him withal
whereof the na^^^ tell I shall.
Eritheus the first is hot
The which is read and shyneth hot
The second Acteos the bright
Lamps the third courser hight
And Philogeus is the ferth
That bringen light unto this earth
And gone so swifte upon the heaven
In four and twenty hours even
The carte with the bright son
They draw, so that over run
They have under the cercles bye
All mydde earth in such an bye.
And thus the son is over all
The chief planet imperial
Above him and beneth him three
And thus between hem renneth he
As he that has the middel place
Among the seven: and of his face
Ben glad all erthely creatures
And taken after the natures
Her ease and recreacion.
And in his constellacion
who that is bore in special
Of good will and of liberal
He shall be found in all place
And also stonden in mochel grace
Toward the lords for to serve
And great profit and thonke deserve.
And over that it causes yet
A man to be subtyl of wit
To worch in gold, and to be wise
In every thing, which is of prise.
But for to speken in what cost
Of all this earth he regneth most
As for wisdom it is in greece
where is appropred thilke spece.
Nota de quinta planeta / que Mars dicitur.
Mars the planete bataillous
Next to the son glorious
Above stant, and does meruailles
Upon the fortune of batayles.
The Conquerours by days old
were unto this planete hold.
But who that his natyuite
Has take upon the propirte
Of Martis disposicion
By wey of constellacion
He shall be fers and full hastyfe
And desirous of werre and strife.
But for to tellen ridily
In what climate most commonly
That this planete has his effect.
Said is, that he has his aspecte
Upon the holy land so cast
That there is no pees steadfast.
Nota de sexta planeta / que Jupiter dicitur.
Above Mars upon the heaven
The sixte planete of the seven
Stant Jupiter the delicate
which causes pees, and no debate.
For he is cleped the planete
which of his kind soft and sweet
Attempreth all that to him longs.
And whom this planette vnderfongeth
To stand upon his regiment
He shall be meke and pacient
And fortunate to marchandye
And lusty to delicacie
In every thing, which he shall do.
This Jupiter is cause also
Of the science of light works
And in this wise tellen clerks
He is the planette of delyces.
But in Egypt of his offices
He reygneth most in special
For there ben lusts over all
Of all that to this life befalls.
For there no stormy weder falls
which might grieve man or be
And eke the land is so honest
That it is plentuous and plain
There is no ydell ground in vain
And upon such felicite
Stant Jupiter in his degree.
De septima planeta, que reliquis celcior Saturnus dictus est.
The highest, and abouen all
Stant that planet, which men call
Saturnus, whose complexion
Is cold, and his condition
Causes malice and cruelte
To him, whose natiuite
Is set under his governance.
For all his works ben greuaunce
And enemy to man's hele
In what degree that he shall dele.
His clymate is in oryent
where that he is most violent.
Of the planettes by and by
How that they stand upon the sky
Fro point to point as thou might here
was Alysander made to lere.
But over this touchende his lore
Of thing, that they him taughten more
Upon the schools of clergy
Now harken the philosophy.
POST QVAM DICTVM est de septe^ planetis, quibus sigule septimane dies
singulariter attitulantur dicendum est iam de duo decim signis, per que.xij.
menses anni variis temporibus effectus varios assequu^tur.
He which departs day fro night
That one derke, and that other bright
Of seven days made a weke
A monthe of four wekes eke
He has ordained in his law.
Of mouths twelve, and eke forthdraw
He has also the long year.
And as he set of his powere
Accordaunt to the days seven
Planettes seven upon the heaven
As thou tofore have herd deuyse
To speak right in such a wise
To every monthe by him selue
Upon the heaven, of signs twelve
(...) has after his ordinall
A^^igned one in special
whereof so as I shall rehersen
(...) tides of the year diuersen.
But pleynly for to make it know
Now that the signs sit a row
(...) after other by degree
In substance and in properte
The Zodiake comprehends
(...) his cercle, and it appendeth.
(...) ^^IA HIC de primo signo, quod aries (...) mensis specialiter Marc^
appropria^^^^^. (...) in primo produxit adesse creata.
And as it seith in almageste
Of sterres twelve upon this be
^en set, whereof in his degree
The womb has two, the heed has three
The tail has seven, and in this wise
As thou might here me deuyse
Stant Aries, which hot and dry
Is of him self, and in party
He is the recepte and the house
Of mighty Mars the bataylous.
And ouermore eke as I find
The creature of all kind
Upon this sign first began
The world, when that hem de man
And of this constellacion
The very operacion
Avails, if a man therein
The purpose of his work begin.
For than he has of properte
Good speed and great felicite.
The twelve months of the year
Attitled under the powere
Of these twelve signs stand
whereof that thou shall understand
This Aries out of the twelve
Has March attitled for him selue
when every byrd shall chese his make
And every adder, and every snake
And every reptyle, which may move
His might assaieth for to prove
To crepen out ayeine the son
when vere his season has begone.
Secundum signu dicitur Taurus, cuius men sis est Aprilis. Quo prius occultas
inuenit herba vias.
Taurus the second after this
Of signs, which fygured is
Unto a boolle dry and cold
And as it is in books told
He is the hows appertinaunt
To Venus somdele discordaunt.
This boolle is eke with sterres set
Through which he has his horns knet
Unto the tail of Aries
So is he not there sterreles.
Upon his breast eke eyghten
He has, and eke as it is seen
Upon his tail stand other two
His month assigned eke also
Is Aueryl, which of showers
Ministers wey unto the flowers.
Tercium signum dicitur Gemini, cuius mensis Maius est. Quo volucru^ cantus
gaudet de floribus ortis,
The third sign is Gemini
which is figured redily
Liche to two twins of man kind
That naked stand: And as I find
They ben with sterres well bigo
The head has part of thilke t^o
That sh^^ upon the boolles tail
So be^ they both of a parayle.
But of the wo^^^e of Gemini
Ben five sterres not for thy.
And eke upon the ^^ete bentwey
So as these old (...) feye
That wise Ptholomeus wrote
His propremonthe well I wot
Assigned is the lusty May
wha^ every brydde upon his lay
Emonge the grene leaves s^^geth
And love of his poynture stingeth
After the laws of nature
The yongthe of every creature.
Quarium signum Cancer dicitur / cuius men sis Iumus est. Quo falcat pratis
pabula tonsor equis.
Cancer after the rule and space
Of signs halt the forth place.
Like to the crabbe he has semblaunce
And has unto his retimaunce
Xvi. sterres, whereof ten
So as these old wise men
Discriue, he hereth on him tofore
And in the middel two before
And.iiii. he has upon his end
Thus goes he sterred in his kende.
And of him self is moist and cold
And he is the propre house and hold
which apperteyneth to the moon
And does what longs him to done.
The month of June unto this sign
Thou shalt after the rule assygne.
Quintum signum Leo dicitur / cuius mensis Inlius est. Quo magis ad terras
expandit Lucifer ignis.
The fyfthe sign is Leo hot
whose kynbe is shape dry and hot
In whom the son has herbergage
And the semblaunce of his image
Is a lion, which in bayllye
Of sterres has his purpartye
The four, which as Cancer has
Upon his end Leo tath.
Upon his heed and than neste
He has eke four upon his breast.
And (...) upon his tail behind
In (...) books as I find.
His propre mouth is Iule by name:
In which men played ma^^ a game.
Septum signum Virgo dicitur, cuius mensis Augustus est. Quo nacuata prius
pubes replet horrea messis.
After Leo, Virgo the next
Of signs cleped is the sexte:
whereof the figure is a maid
And as the philosopher said
She is the wealth, and the rysynge
The lust, the joy, and the liking
Unto Mercury: and sothe to say
She is with sterres well be say
whereof Leo has lent her one
which set on hye her heed upon
Her womb has.v. her^ete also
Have other five: and ever mo
Touchende as of complexion
By kyndley disposition
Of dry and cold this maiden is.
And for to tellen over this
Her mouth, thou shalt understand
when every field has corn in hand
And many a man his back has plied
Unto to this sign is August applied.
Septimum signum Libra dicitur, cuius mensis September est. Vinea quo Bacchum
pressa liquore colit.
After Virgo to reken in even
Libra sit in the nombre of seven
which has figure and resemblaunce
Unto a man, which a balaunce
Bears in his hand, as for to weye
In book and as it may be seye:
Diverse sterres to him longs
whereof o^ heed he vnderfongeth
First three, and eke his womb has two,
And down beneth.viii. other mo.
This sign is hot and moist both
The which things be not loath
Unto Venus, so that alofte
She rests in his house full often
And eke Saturn often hyed
Is in the sign and magnifyed.
His propre month is said Septembre
which yeueth men cause to remember
If any sore be left behind
Of thing, which grieve may to kind.
De^au^ signu^ Scorpio dicitur / cuius me^si^ Octobris eft. Floribus exclusis
hyems qui ianitor extat.
Among the signs upon heyght
The sign, which is nombred eight
Is Scorpio, which as selon
Fygured is a Scorpion.
But for all that yet nethelesse
Is Scorpio not sterlesse.
For Libra grants him his end
Of.viii. sterres, where he wend
The which upon his head assysed
He bears, and eke there ben devised
Upon his womb sterres three
And.viii. upon his tail has he.
which of his kind is moist and cold
And vnbehouely many fold.
He harmeth Venus and empeyreth
But Mars unto his hows repeyreth
But ware when they togider dwellen.
His propre monthe is, as men tellen
Octobre, which brings the kalende
Of winter, that comes next suende.
Nonum signum sagittarius dicitur / cuius me^ s^^ s^^ nembris eft. Quo multum
bibulo linquit sua nomina vino.
The.ix. sign in Nouembre also
which follows after Scorpio
Is cleped Sagittarius
The whose figure is marked thus.
A monstre with a bow on hand
On whom that sundry sterres stand
Thilke.viii. of which I spoke tofore
The which upon the tail ben lore
Of Scorpio the head all fair
Be spreden of the sagittaire
And.viii. of other stonden even
Upon his womb, and other seven
There stonden upon his tail behind
And he is hot and dry of kind.
To Jupiter his hows is fre
But to Mercurye in his degree
(For they be not of one assent)
He worcheth great empeirement.
This sign has of his properte
A month, which of dewte
After the seson that befalls
The plough ox in winter stalleth.
And fire in to the halle he brings
And thylke drink, of which men sings
He torneth must in to the wine
Than is the larder of the swyne
That is Nouembre which I mean
when that the leef has lost his grene.
Decimum signum Capricornius dicitur / cuius mensis decembris est. Ipse diem
nauo noctem que giganti figurat.
The tenthe sign dry and cold
The which is Capricornus told
Unto a got has resemblance
For whose love, and whose aqueintance
within his house to soiourne
It lyketh well unto Saturn.
But to the Moon it lyketh naught
For no profyt is there wrought
This sign as of his proprete
Upon his heed has sterres three
And eke upon his womb two
And twey upon his tail also.
Decembre after the years forms
So as the books us enformes
with days short and nyghtes long
This ylke sign has vnderfonge.
Vndecimum signum Aquarius dicitur cuius mensis Ianuarius eft. Quo lanus vultum
duplu^ conuertit in annum.
Of tho that sytten upon the heaven
Of signs in the nombre enleuen
Aquarius has take his place
And stant well in Saturnus grace:
which dwells in his herbergage
But to the son he does outrage.
This sign is verayly resembled
Lyche to a man, which halte assembled
In either hand a water spout
whereof the stremes rennen out.
He is of kind moist and hot
And he that of the sterres wot
Says, that he has of ^terres two
Upon his heed, and have of tho
That Capricorn has on his end.
And as the books maken mind
That Ptholomeus made him selue
He has he on his womb twelve:
And two upon his end stand.
Thou shalt also this understand
The frosty cold Ianiuere
when comen is the new year
That Ianus with double face
In his thayre has take his place
And looks upon both sides
Some dele toward the winter tides
Some dele toward the year suende
That is the monthe belongende
Unto this sign, and of his dole
He yeueth the first primrole.
Duodecimum signum Piscis dicitur, cuius men sic Februarius eft. Quo plunie
torrens ^parum concitat amnes.
The.xij. which is last of all
Of signs, Piscis men it call,
The which, as tells the scripture
Bears of two fysshes the figure.
So is he cold and moist of kind.
And eke with sterres as I find
Be set in sundry wise, as thus
Two of his end Aquarius
Has lent, unto his heed, and two
This sign has of his own also
Upon his womb: and over this
Upon his end also there is
A nombre of twenty sterres bright
which is to seen a wonder sight
Toward this sign in to his house
Comth Jupiter the glorious
And Venus eke with him acordeth
To dwellen, as the book records.
The monthe unto this sign ordeigned
Is Februar, which is bereigned.
And with londflodes in his rage
At fordes lets the passage.
Now have thou herd the proprete
Of signs, but in his degree
Albumazare yet over this
Says, so as the earth parted is
In four: right so ben devised
The signs twelve, and stand assise^
That each of hem in his party
Has hi^ clymate to iustifye
whereof the first regiment
Toward the part of Oryent
From Antioche, and that country
Governed is of signs three:
That is Cancer, Virgo, Leo.
And toward thoccident also
From Armeny, as I am learned
Of Capricorn it stant governed
Of Piscis and Aquarius.
And after hem I find thus
Southwarde fro Alysander forth
Tho signs, which most ben worth
In governance of that Doaire
Libra they ben and Sagittaire
with Scorpio, which is conioynt
with hem to stand upon that point
Of Constantynople the cite
(So as these books tellen me)
The last of this division
Stant untoward septemtrion
where as by wey of porueance
Aries has the governance
Forth with Taurus and Gemini
Thus ben the signs properly
Divided, as it is rehearsed
whereof the lands ben diuersed.
Lo thus my son, as thou might here
was Alysaunder made to lere
Of hem, that weren for his lore.
But now to loken ouermore
Of other sterres how they fare
I think hereafter to declare
So as king Alysaunder in youth
Of him that such signs couth
Informed was tofore his eye
By night upon the sterres sye.
HIC tractat super doctrina Nectanabi dum ipse iuuenem Alexandrum instruxit de
illis precipue quindecim stellis / vna cum carum sapidibus et herbis, que ad
artis Magice naturalis operacionem specialius conueniunt.
Upon sundry creacion
Stant sundry operacion
Some worcheth this, some worcheth that
The fire is hot in his estate
And brenneth what he may atteyne.
The water may the fire restreyne
The which is cold and moist also
Of other thing it fares right so
Upon the earth among us here
And for to speak in this manner
Upon the heaven as men may find
The sterres ben of sundry kind
And worchen many sundry things
To us, that been her underlings.
Among the which forth withal
Nectanabus in special
which was an Astronomyen
And eke a great magycyen
And undertake has thylke emprise
To Alisandre in his apprise
As of magyke naturele
To know, enformeth him somdele
Of certain sterres what they mean
Of which he seyth there ben fyftene.
And sondrily to euerychone
A gras belongs and a stone:
whereof men worchen many a wonder
To set thing both up and under.

And Canis mayor in his like
The fifthe sterre is of magike
The whose kind is venerien
As says this astronomien.
His propre stone is said Berille
But for to worche and to fulfille
Thing, which to this science falls
There is an herb, which men calls
Saueyne, and that behooves need
To him, that woll his purpose speed.
Sexta stella vocatur canis minor, cuius lapis Achatis, et herba primula est.
The sixte sewende after this
By name canis minor is.
The which sterre is Mercuriall
By wey of kind, and forth withal
As it is wry ten in the carte
Complexion he takes of Mart
His stone and herb as seyth the schole
Ben Achates and Primerole
Septima stella vocatur Arial, cuius lapis g^^gonza, et herba celidonia est.
The seventh sterre in special
Of this science is Ariall
which sundry nature vnderfongeth.
The stone, which propre unto him lo^geth
Gorgonza properly it hight.

Has take his place in nombre of eight
which of his kind mote perform
The will of Mart and of Saturn.
To whom Lappacia the great

Duodecima stella vocatur Alpheta, cuius lapis Topasion, et herba rosameri.
Alpheta in the nombre set
And is the twelfte sterre yet
Of Scorpio, which is governed
And takth his kind as I am learned
And has his virtue in the stone
which cleped is Topasione.
His herb propre is rosemaryne
which shapen is for his couyne.

Of due constellation.
The calcidone unto him longs
which for his stone he vnderfongeth
Of maioran his herb is grounded.
Thus have I said how they ben founded
Of every sterre in special
which has his herb and stone withal
As Hermes in his books old
witness bears, of that I told.
Nota hic de auctoribus illis, qui ad Astronomy scientiam pre ceteris
studiosius intendentes libros super hoc distinctis nominibus co^posueru^t.
The science of Astronomye
which principal is of clergy
To deem between woe and well
In things that been naturele
They had a great travail on bond
That made it first ben understand
And they also, which ouermore
Her study set upon this lore
They weren gracious and wise
And worthy for to bear a prise.
And whom it lyketh for to wete
^f hem that this science write.
One of the first, which it wrote
Alter Noe, it was Nembrote
To his disciple Ichonyton
And made a book forth thereupon,
The which Megastre cleped was.
An other auctor in this cas
^s ^^^hel, the which men note
His book is Abbateneyth bote.
D^^e Ptolome is not the leest
which makes the book of Almagest.
And Altraganus does the same
whose book is Cathenus by name.
Gebus and Alpetragus eke
Of palmestry, which men seek
The books made, And over this
Full many a worthy clerk there is
That written upon this clergy
The books of Altemetry.
Planemetry and eke also,
which as belongs both two
So as they been naturiens
Unto these astronomyens
Men seyne that Abraham was one.
But whether that be wrote or none
That find I not, and Moses
Eke was an other: but Hermes
Above all other in his science
He had a great experience.
Through him was many a sterre assised
whose books yet ben auctorised.
I may not known all tho
That written in the time tho
Of this science, but I find
Of judgment by way of kind
That in one point they all accorden
Of sterres, which they recorden
That men may se upon the heaven.
There ben a thousand sterres even
And two and twenty to the sight
which ben of hem self so bright
That men may deem what they be
The nature and the proprete.
Now have thou hard in such awise
These noble philosophers wise
Enformden this young king
And made him have a knowelechinge
Of thing which first to the party
Belongs of philosophy
which Theorike cleped is
As thou tofore have herd er this.
But now to speak of the second
which Aristotle has also found
And techeth how to speak fair
which is a thing full necessayre
To counterpaise the balaunce
where lacks other suffisance.
Compositi pulcra sermones verba placere.
Principio poterunt vera quod fine placent
Herba lapis, sermo, tria sunt uirtute repleta.
Vis tu^ ex verbi pondere pulcra facit.
Hic tractat de secunda part philosophy, cuius nomen Rhetorica facu^dos
efficit. Loquitur etiam de eiusdem duabus speciebus, scilicet Gra^matica et
Logica, quarum doctrina Rhethor sua verba perornat.
Above al erthly creatures
The high maker of natures
The word to man has you alone
So that the speech of his person
Or for to lose, or for to win
The hertes thought, which is withinne
May show, what it would mean
And that is no where else seen
Of kind with none other be.
So should he be the more honest
To whom god yafe so worthy a yifte
And look well that he ne shyfte
His words to none wicked use.
For word, the teacher of vertuse
Is cleped in philosophy.
whereof thouchende this party
Is Rhetoric the science
Appropred to the reverence
Of words, that been reasonable.
And for this art shall be vaylable
with goodly words for to like
It has Grammar, it has Logyke
That seruen both unto the speech.
Grammar first has for to teache
To speak upon congruyte.
Logyke has eke in his degree
Between the truth and the falshede
The pleyne words for to shede:
So that nothing shall go beside
That he the right ne shall decyde
whereof full many a great debate
Reformed is to good astate
And peace sustained up alofte
with easy words and with soft
where strength should let it fall.
The philosophre among all
For thy commends this science
which has the reule of eloquence.
In stone and gras virtue there is
But yet the books tellen this
That word above all erthly things
Is virtuous in his doings
where so it be to yuell or good.
For it the words semen good
And been well spoke at man's ere.
when that there is no truth there
They done full often full great deceyte.
For when the word to the conceyte
Discordeth in so double a wise
Such Rhetoric is to despise
In every place, and for to dread.
For of Vlixes thus I read
As in the book of Troy is found
His eloquence, and his faconde
Of goodly words, which he told
Has made, that Anthenor him sold
The town, which he with treson wan.
word has begyled many a man.
with word the wild be is daunted.
with word the serpent is enchaunted.
Of words among the men of arms
Ben wounds heled with the charms.
where lacks other medycyne
word has under his discipline
Of sorsery the carectes.
The words ben of sundry sects
Of evil, and eke of good also.
The words maken of friend fo
And fo of friend, and peace of werre
And werre of peace, and out of herre
The word the worlds cause entryketh
And reconcileth who on him lyketh.
The word under the cope of heaven
Set every thing or odd or even.
with word the high god is pleased.
with word the words ben appesed.
The soft word the loud stylleth
where lacks good the word fulfylleth
To make amends for the wrong.
when words medlen with the song
It does plesaunce well the more.
But for to look upon this lore
How Tullius his Rhetorike
Compouneth, there a man may pyke
How that he shall his words set.
How he shall lose, how he shall knet
And in what wise he shall pronounce
His tale pleyne without frounce
whereof ensample if thou will seche
Take heed and read whilom the speech.
Nota de eloquentia Iulii in causa Catilme co^tra Syllanum, et alios tunc vrbis
Roman continentes.
Of Julius, and Cicero
which consul was of Rome tho
Of Cato eke, and Syllene
Behold the words hem between.
when the treason of Catiline
Discovered was, and the couine
Of hem, that were of his assent
was know and spoke in parliment
And asked how, and in what wise
Men should done him to Iuwyse
Syllanus first his tale told
To troth and as he was behold
The common profyt for to save
He said how treason should have
A cruel death. And thus they speak.
The Consul both and Cato eke
And saiden, that for such a wrong
There may no pain be to strong.
But Julius with words wise
His tale told all other wise
As be which would his death respite
And foundeth how he might excyte
The iuges through his eloquence
Fro death to torn the sentence
And set her hertes to pity.
Now tolden they, now told he
They speaken pleyne after the law,
But he the words of his saw
Colors in an other wey
Spekende and thus between the twey
To trete upon this judgment
Made each of hem his argument.
whereof the tales for to here
There may a man the schole lere
Of Rhetoric the eloquence
which is the second of science
Touchende to philosophy
whereof a man shall justify
His words in disputeson
And knytte upon conclusion
His argument in such a form
which may the pleyne truth inform
And the subtle cautele abate
which every true man shall debate.
Practica quecunque statu^ pars terria philosophy,
Ad regimen recte ducit in orb uiae,
Sed quanto mayor rex est, tanto magis ipsum
Ex schola concernit, quo sua regna regit.
Hic tractat de tertia part philosophy, que practica vocatur: cuius species
sunt tres, scilicet Et^ica, Economia, et Politica, quarum doctrina regia
magestas in suo regimine ad honoris magnificentiam per singula dirigitur.
The first, which is theoryke
And the second Rhetoryke
Sciences of philosophy
I have hem told as in party
So as the philosopher it told,
To Alysandre: and now I would
Tell of the third, what it is
The which practyke cleped is.
Practyke stont upon three things
Toward the governance of kings:
whereof the first Etyke is named
The whose science stant proclaimed
To teache of virtue thylke rule
How that a king him self shall rule
Of his moral condition
with worthy disposition.
Of good living in his person
which is the chief of his corone.
It makes a king also to learn
How he his body shall govern.
How he shall wake, how he shall sleep
How that he shall his hele keep.
In mete, in drink, in clothyng eke
There is no wisdom for to seek
As for the reule of his person
The which that this science all one
Ne techeth, as by wey of kind
That there is nothing left behind.
That other thing which to practyke
Belongs is Economyke
which techeth thylke honestee
Through which a king in his degree
His wife and child shall reule and gye
So forth withal the company
which in his household shall abide
And his estate on every side
In such manner for to lead
That he his household ne myslede.
Practike has yet the third apprise
which techeth how and in what wise
Through his purueide ordinance
A king shall set in governance
His realm: and that is Policy
which longs unto regalie
In time of werre, in time of pees
To worship and to good encrees
Of clerk, of knight, and of merchant
And so forth all the remenant
Of all the common people about
within borgh and eke without
Of hem that been artificers
which vsen crafts and mysters
those ^rte is cleped Mechanyke
And though they be not all like
yet netheles how so it fall
O law mote govern hem all
Or that they lose, or that they win
After the state that they ben inn.
Lo thus this worthy young king
was fully taught of every thing
which might give entendement.
Of good rule, and good regiment.
To such a worthy prince as he.
But of very necessite
The philosopher him has betake
Five points, which he has undertake
To keep and hold in obseruaunce
As for the worthy governance
which longs to his regaly
After the rule of policye.
Moribus ornatus regit hic, qui regna moderna
Certius expectat sceptra futura poli.
Et quia ueredica uirtus supereminet omnes,
Regis ab ore boni fabula nulla sona^.
Hic secundum policiam tractare intendi^ precipue super quinque regularu^
articulis, que ad principis regimen obseruande specialius existu^t / quarum
prima veritas nuncupatur, per quam veredicus sit ser^o regie ad omnes.
To every man belongs lore
But to no man belongs more
Than to a king, which has to lead
The people, for his kyngheed
He may hem both save and spylle
And for it stont upon his will
It sit him well to be auysed
And the virtues, which are assised
Unto a kings regiment
To take in his entendement.
whereof to tellen as they stand
Hereafterwarde now woll I fond.
Among the virtues one is chief
And that is troth, which is lyefe
To god, and eke to man also
And for it has been ever so
Taught Aristotle as he well couth
To Alysaunder how in his youth
He should of troth thilke grace
with all his holle heart enbrace
So that his word be true and pleyne
Toward the world: and so certain
That in him be no double speech.
For if men should truth ^eche
And find it not within a king
It were an vnsyttende thing.
The word is token of that within.
There shall a worthy king begin
To keep his tongue and to be true
So shall his price ben ever new.
Auyse him every man to fore
And be well ware, er he be swore.
For afterward it is to late
If that he would his word debate.
For as a king in special
Above all other is principal:
Of his power, so should he be
Most virtuous in his degree.
And that may well be signified
By his corone and specifyed.
The gold betoketh excellence
That men should done him reverence
As to her liege sovereign.
The stones, as the books said
Commended been in treble wise.
First they ben hard, and thylke assise
Betokens in a king constance.
So that there shall no varyance
Be found in his condition.
And also by description
The virtue, which is in the stones
A very sign is for the nones
Of that a king shall be honest
And hold trewely his behest
Of thing, which longs to kingheed.
The bright color, as I read
which is in the stones shynynge
Is in figure betokenynge
The cronyke of this worlds fame
which stante upon his good name.
The circle, which is round about
Is token of all the land about
which stant under his hierarchye
That he it shall well keep and guye.
And for that truth how so it fall
Is the virtue sovereign of all
That longs unto regyment
A tale, which is evident
Of truth in commendacion
Toward thyn enformacion
My son herafter thou shall here
Of a cronycke in this matter.
Hic narrat qualiter Darius filius Itapsis soldanus Persie a tribus suis
cubicularibus, quoru^ nomina Harpages / Monachas / et Zorobabel, dicta sunt
nomina questionis sigillatim interrogatie, vtrum rex aut mulier, aut vinum
maioris fortitudinis vim optineret / Ipsis vero varia opinione respondentibus,
Zorobabel vltimus asserit quod mulier sui amoris complacentia tam regis quam
vini potenciam excellit, Addidit insuper finali conclusioni dicens, quod
veritas super o^nia vincit. Cunis responsio ceteris landabilior acceptabatur.
As the cronycke it does reherce
A sultan whilome was of Perse
which Dares hight, and Itapsis
His fader was: and sothe it is
Of his lygnage as by discente
The regne of thilke empire he bent.
And as he was him self wise
The wise men be held in prise:
And sought hem out on every side
That toward him they should abide.
Among the which three there were
That must service unto him here
As they which in his chamber lighen
And all his counceylle herd and syghen.
Her names ben of strange note
Harpages was the first hot
And Monachas was the second
Zorobabel, as it is found
In the cronycke was the thrydde.
This Sultan what so him betyde
To hem be tryst most of all
whereof the case is so befalle.
This lord, which has conceytes deep
Upon a night when he has sleep
As he which has his wit disposed
Touchend a point hem has opposed.
The kings question was this
Of things three which strongest is
The wine, the woman, or the king
And that they should upon this thing
Of her answer auised be
He give hem fully days three
And has bihote hem by his feyth
That who the best reason seyth,
He shall receive a worthy mede.
Upon this thing they token head
And stoden in disputesion:
That by diverse opinion
Of arguments, that they have hold
Harpages first his tale told
And said, how that the strength of kings
Is mightiest of all things.
For king has power over man.
And man is he / which reason can
As he which is of his nature
The most noble creature
Of all tho that god has wrought
And by that skille it seems naught
He says, that any erthly thing
May be so mighty as a king.
A king may spille, a king may save
A king may make a lord a knave
And of a knave a lord also,
The power of a king stont so
That he the laws ouerpasseth.
what he will make less, he lasseth.
what he will make more, he moreth.
And as a gentle faucone soreth
He flees, that no man him reclameth.
But be alone all other tameth.
And stante him self of law fre.
Lo thus a kings might, says he,
(So as his reason can argue)
Is strengest, and of most value.
But Manachas says other wise
That wine is of the more mpryse
And that he shows by this way.
The wine full often takes away
The reason fro the man's heart.
The wine can make a creple sterte
And a deliver man vnwelde.
It makes a blind man to beheld
And a bright eyed seem derke.
It makes a leude man a clerk
And fro the clerk the clergy
It takes awey, and cowardy
It tourneth in to hardynesse
Of avarice it makes largess
The wine makes eke the good blood
In which the soul, which is good
Has chosen her a restinge place
while that the life her wolle enbrace.
And by this skylle Monathas
Answered has upon this cas
And seith, that wine by wey of kind
Is thing, which may the hertes bind
well more than the regalye.
Zorobabell for his party
Seid as him thought for the best
That women ben the mightyest.
The king and the vynour also
Of women comen both two.
And eke he said: how that manhede
Through strength unto the womanhed
Of love where he will or none
Obey shall, and thereupon
To show of women the maistry
A tale which he sigh with eye
As for ensample he told this.
Nota hic de vigore amorie, qui inter Cirum regem Persaru^ et Apemen Besazis
filiam ipsius regis co^cubina^ specta^te tota curia experiebatur.
How Apemen, of Besasis
which daughter was, in the paleis
Sittende upon his high deis
when he was hotest in his ire
Toward the great of his empire
Cyrus the king tiraunt she took
And only with her goodly look
She made him debonaire and meke
And by the chyn, and by the cheke
She loggeth him right as her list
That now she iapeth, and now she kissed,
And does with him what ever her likes
when that she loureth, than he syketh
And when she gladeth, he is glad,
And thus this king was ouerlad
with her, which his lemman was.
Among the men is no solas
If that there be no woman there
For but if that the woman were
This worlds joy were awey.
This is truth, that I you seye.
To knyghthode and to worlds fame
They make a man to dread shame
And honor for to be desired.
Through the beauty of hem is fyred
The darte, of which Cupyde throws
whereof the iolyfe pain grows
which all the world has underfoot.
A woman is the man's bote
His life, his ^eth, his woe, his well.
And this thing may be showed well
How that women ben good and kind
For in ensample thus I find.
Nota de fidelitate coniugis, qualiter Alcesta vxor Adineti / vt maritum suum
viuificaret seipsa^ morti spontance subegit.
when that the duke Admetus lay
Sick in his bed that every day
Men wayten, when he should dey
Alcest his wife goth for to prey
As she which would thonke deserve
with sacrifice unto Minerue
To wit answer of the goddess
How that her lord of his syckenesse,
whereof he was so woe beseyne
Recover might his hele ayene.
Lo thus she cryde, and thus she praide
Till at last a voice her said,
That if she would for his sake
The malady suffer and take
And dye her self, he should live.
Of this answer Aleest has give
Unto Mynerue great thonkynge
So that her death, and his living
She chese with all her hole intent
And thus accorded home she went.
In to the chamber when she came
Her housbande anon she name
In both her arms, and him kyst.
And spoke unto him, what her list.
And thereupon within a throw
The good wife was overthrow
And dyed, and he was holle in have.
So may a man by reason taste
How next after the god above
The troth of women and the love,
In whom that all grace is found
Is myghtyest upon this ground
And most behouely manyfolde.
Lo thus Zorobabell has told
The tale of his opinion
But for fynall conclusion
what strengest is of erthly things
The wine, the women, or the kings
He says, that truth above hem all
Is myghtyest, how ever it fall.
The truth how so it ever come
May for nothing ben overcome.
It may well suffer for a throw
But at last it shall be know.
The proverb is, who that is true
Him shall his while never rewe.
For how so that the cause wend
The truth is shameless at end.
But what thing that is troutheles
It may not well be shameless.
And shame hyndereth every wight.
So proves it, there is no might
without truth in no degree.
And thus for truth of his decre
^^robabel was most commended.
whereof the question was ended
and be received has his mede.
For truth, which to man's need
Is most behouelyche over all.
For thy was truth in special
The first point in observance
Be take unto the governance
Of Alysandre, as it is said:
For thereupon the ground is leyde
Of every kings regyment
(...) thing, which most convenient
I^ for to set a king in even
Both in this world, and eke in heaven.
(...) ne tangat regis corda:
(...) enim spoliis excoriatur humus.
(...) colit largum nolutans per saecula regem,
Dona tamen licius sunt moderanda modis.
Hic iractat de regie magestatis secu^da policia: (...) Aristoteles largitatem
vocat, cuius virtute (...) ^^lum propulsata anaricia, regis nomen ma^^ ^^cum
extollatur, sed et sui subdicionum diui^^^m ^^^undantia ^ocundiores efficiuntur.
Next after truth the second
In polycye as it is found
which serves to the worlds fame
In worship of a kings name
Largess it is, whose privilege
There may no avarice abrege.
The worlds good was first comune
But afterward upon fortune
was thilke common profyt cessed
For when the people stood encressed
And the lygnages woxen great
Anon for synguler beyete
Drough every man to his party
whereof come in the first envy
with great debate and werres strong
And last among the men so long
Till no man wist, who was who,
Ne which was friend, ne which so
Till at last in every land
within hem self the people fond
That it was good to make a king,
which might appesen all this thing
And give right to the lignages
In partynge of her heritages.
And eke of all her other good.
And thus above hem all stood
The king upon his regalye,
As he which has to iustifye
The worlds good fro couetyse.
So sit it well in all wise
A king between the more and less
To set his heart upon largess
Toward him self, and eke also
Toward his people: and if not so:
That is to said: if that he be
Toward him self large and fre,
And of his people take and pylle:
Largess by no wey of skylle
It may be said, but avarice
which in a king is a great vice.
Nota super hoc quod Aristot ad Alexandrum exemplificauit de exactionibus regis
Chaldeoru^.
A king behooves eke to fle
The vice of prodigalite
That he measure in his expense
So keep, that of indigence
He may be saufe: for who that needs
In all his work the wers he spedeth.
As Aristotle upon Caldee
Ensample of great auctorite
Unto king Alysaunder taught
Of thilke folk, that were vnsaught
Toward her king for his pyllage,
whereof he badde in his courage
That he unto three points entende
where that he would his good dispende.
First should be look how that it stood
That all were of his own good
The yeues, which he would give
So might he well the better live.
And eke he must taken bid
If there be cause of any need
which ought for to be defended
Er that his goods ben dispended.
He mote eke as it is befall
Among other things all
Se the decertes of his men
And after that they been of ken,
And of astate, and of merit
He shall hem largelych acquyte,
Or for the war, or for the pease
That none honor fall in discrease
which might torn in to diffame,
But that he keep his good name
So that he be not hold unkind.
For in cronike a tale I find
which speaks somdele of this matere
Herafterwarde as thou shalt here.
Hic secundu^ gesta Iulii exemplu^ ponit, qualiter rex suorum militum, quos
probos agnouerit, indige^tiam largitatis sue beneficiis releuare tenetur.
In Rome to pursue his right
There was a worthy pour knight
which came alone for to seyne
His cause, when the court was pleyne,
where Julius was in presence
And for him lacks of dispense
There was with him none advocate
To make plee for his astate.
But though him lack for to plede
Him lacks nothing of manheed.
He wist well his purse was pouer
But yet be thought his right recover,
And openly pouerte aleyed
To the emperor, and thus he said.
O Julius lord of the law
Behold my counseyll is withdraw
For lack of gold, to thine office
After the law of Justice
Help, that I had counseyll here
Upon the truth of my matere.
And Julius with that anon
Assigned him a worthy one.
But he himself no word ne spoke.
This knight was wroth, and fond a lake
In the emperor: and said thus.
O thou unkind Julius
when thou in thy battle were
Up in Aufrike, and I was there
My might for thy rescous I did
And put no man in my stead.
Thou wost what wounds there I had
But here I find the so bad
That the ne list to speak o word
Thine own mouth, or of thyn board
To give a floreyn me to help
How should I than me be yelpe
Fro this day forth of thy largess
when such a great unkindness
Is found in such a lord, as thou?
This Julius knew well mow
That all was soth, which he him told
And for he would not ben hold
Unkind, he took his cause on hand,
And as it were of gods sonde
He yaue him good enough to spend
For ever unto his lives end.
And thus should every worthy king
Take of his knights knowlegynge
when that he sygh they hadden need.
For every service axeth mede.
But other, which have not deserved
Through virtue, but of iapes served
A king shall not deserve grace
Though he be large in such a place.
Hic ponit exemplum de rege Antigono / qualiter dona regia secundum maius et
miuu^ / equa discrecione moderanda sunt.
It sytte well every king to have
Discretion, when men him crave
So that be may his gift wit
whereof I find a tale write
How Cinichus a power knight
A sum, which was over might
Prayed of his king Antigonus.
The king answered to him thus
And said, how such a yefte passes
His power estate: and than he lasseth
And asks but a litell penny
if that the king would yeuehym any
The king answered, it was to small
For him, which was a lord ryalle
To give a man so little thing.
It were vnworship in a king.
By this ensample a king may lere
That for to give is in manner.
For if a king his treasour lasseth
with out honor and tha^kelesse passes.
when he him self will so begile,
I not who shall complain his while
Ne who by right him shall releue.
But netheles this I believe
Tho help with his own land
Belongs every man his hand
To set upon necessite.
And eke his kings rialte
Mote every lyege man comfort
with good and body to supporte
when they se cause reasonable.
For who that is not entendable
To hold up right his kings name
Him ought for to be to blame.
Nota hic secundum Aristotelem qualiter princi^um prodigalitas paupertatem
inducit co^mune^.
Of policy and over more
To speak in this matter more
So as the philosophre told
A king after the reule is hold
To modifie, and to adresse
His yeftes upon such largess
That he mesure naught excede.
Sal. Sic aliis benefacito, vt tibi non nocias.
For if a king fall in to need
It causes often sundry things
which are ungoodly to the kings.
what man will not him self mesure
Men seen fulofte, that mesure
Him has forsake: and so does he
That uses prodigalite
which is the mother of pouerte
whereof the lands ben deserte
And namely when thilke vice
Above a king stant in office
And has with hold of his party
The covetous flaterye
which many a worthy king deceyueth
Er he the fallace perceyueth
Of hem, that seruen to the gloss.
For they that conne please and gloss
Ben as men tellen the notices
Unto the fostrynge of the vices
whereof full often netheles
A king is blamed gylteles.
Qualiter in principum curiis adulatores triplici grauitate offendunt.
A philosopher as thou shall here
Spoke to a king of this matere
And said him well how that flatours
Coulpable were of three errors.
One was toward the gods bye
That weren wroth of that they sye
The mischief which befall should
Of that the false flatour told
Toward the king. An other was.
when they by sleyght and by fallas
Of feyned words, make him wene
That black is white, and blew is grene
Touchende of his condition.
For when he does extorcion
with many an other vice mo
Men shall not find one of tho
To grutche or speak there again,
But holden up his oil, and seyne:
That all is well, what ever he does.
And thus of falls they maken soth
So that her kings eye is blent
And wot not how the world is went.
The third error is harm common
with which the people mote common
Of wrongs, that they bryngen inn.
And thus they werchen treble sin
That been flatours about a king.
There might be no werse thing
About a kings regalye
Than is the vice of flaterye.
And netheles it has been used
That it was never yet refused
As for to speak in court ryall.
For there it is most special
And may not long be forbore.
But when this vice of hem is bore
That should the virtues forth bring
And truth is turned to lesynge.
It is, as who seith against kind
whereof an old ensample I find.
Hic loquitur super eode^, et narrat, quod est Di^genes et Aristippus
philosophi a scholis Athen^, ad Cartaginem, vnde orti fuerunt, renertissent,
Aristippus Curie principis sui familiaris adhef^: Diogenes vero in quodam
mansuinculo suo studio vocane permansit: et contigit, quod cum ipse quoda^ die
ad finem orti sui super ripam herbas quas ele gerat, ad ofera lauasset,
Superuenit ex casu Aristippus, dixitque ei: O Diogenes, certe si principi tuo
placere scires, tu ad olera tua lauanda non indigeres. Cui ille respondit: O
Aristippe, Certe si tu olera tua lauare scires, te in vlandiciis et
adulationibus principi tuo seruire non oporteret.
Among these other tales wise
Of philosophers in this wise
I read how whylome two there were
And to the schole for to lere
Unto Athenes fro Cartage
Her friends when they were of age
Hem send: and there they stude^ long
Till they such lore have vnderfonge,
That in her time they surmounte
All other men: that to accounte
Of hem was tho the great fame.
The first of hem his right name
was Diogenes than hot
In whom was found no ryote.
His felawe Aristippus hight
which mochel couthe, and mochel might.
But at last sothe to seyne
They both turnen home ayene
Unto Cartage, and schole let.
This Diogenes no beyete
Of worlds good, or less or more
Ne sought for his long lore
But took him only for to dwell
At home: and as the books tell
His house was nygh to a ryuere
Beside a brygge as thou shalt here.
There dwells he, and takth his rest
So as it thought him for the best
To study in his philosophy
As he, which would so defye
The worlds pomp on every side.
But Aristippe his book a side
Has leyde: and to the court he went
where many a wyle, and many a went
with flatery and words soft
He cast and has compassed often
How he his prince might please.
And in this wife be gate him ease.
Of vein honor and worlds good.
The lands rule upon him stood.
The king of him was wondre glad.
And all was do, what thing he had
Gothe in the court, and eke without
with flatery be brought about
His purpos of the worlds work,
which was ayene the state of clerk.
So that philosophy he left
And to riches him self up left.
Lo thus had Aristyppe his will.
But Diogenes dwelte still
At home, and looked on his book
He sought not the worlds croke
For vein honor, ne for richesse,
But all his hertes business
He set to be virtuous.
And thus within his own house
He lyuch to the suffysaunce
Of his having, and fell perchance
This Diogene upon a day
And that was in the month of May
when that these herbs ben wholesome
He walks for to gether some
In his gardyn, of which his ioutes
He thought to have, and thus aboutes
when he has gadred what him lyketh
He set him than down and piketh
And wisshe his herbs in the flode
Upon the which his garden stood
Nigh to the bregge as Itolde ere
And happens while he sytteth there
Came Aristippus by the street
with many bors and routes great
And straught unto the bregge he rode
where that he boued and abode
For as he cast his eye nygh
His felawe Diogene he sigh
And what he deed he sigh also
whereof he said to him tho.
O Deogene god the speed
It were certes litel need
To sit here and wortes pyke
If thouthy prince coudest like
So as I can in my degree.
O ^ristippe (again quod he)
If that thou coudest so as I
Thy wortes pycke truly,
It were as little need or less
That thou so worldly woll compass
with flatery for to serve
whereof thou thynkest for to deserve
Thy princes thonke, and to purchase
How thou might stand in his grace
For getting of a little good.
If thou wolt take in to thy mode
Reason: thou might by reason deem
That so thy prince for to queme
Is not to reason accordaunt
But it is greatly discordaunt
Unto the schools of Athene.
Lo thus answerde Diogene
Again the clerks flateye
But yet men seyne thessamplerye
Of Aristyppe is well received
And thilke of Diogene is weyued.
Office in court, and gold in coffer
Is now, men seyn, the philosopher
which has the worship in the hall.
But flatery passes all
In chamber whom the court auaunceth.
For upon chylke lotte it chuanceth
To be beloved now a day.
Nota exemplum cuiusdam poet de Italia ou^ Dantes vocabatur.
I not if it be ye or nay.
How Dante the poet answerde
To a flattrour, the tale I herd
Upon a strife between hem two
He said him, there ben many mo.
Of thy servants than of mine.
For the poet of his couyne
Has none, that will him cloth and feed
But a flatour may rule and led
A king with all his land about.
So stant the wise man in dout
Of hem, that to folly drew.
For such is now the comen law
And as the commune voice it tells
where now that flaterie dwells
In every land under the lonne
There is full many a thing begone
which were better to be left
That has be showed now and efte.
But if a prince him would rule
Of the Romans after the reule
In thilke time as it was used
This vice should be refused
whereof the princis ben assoted.
But where the plain troth is noted
There may a prince well conceive
That he shall naught himself deceive
Of that he hereth words pleyne.
For him there naught by reason pleyne.
That warned is, er hem he woe
And that was fully proved so.
when Rome was the worlds chief
The sooth sayer tho was leefe
which would not the troth spare
But with his word, plain and bare
To the emperor his sothes told
As in cronicke it is withholde
Here afterward as thou shall here
Acordend unto this matere.
Hic eciam contra vicium adulationis ponit exemplum: et narrat, quod cum nuper
Romanorum imperator contra suos hosts victoria^ optmuisset, et cum palma
triumphi in vrbem redire debuisset, ne ipsum inanis glory altitudo
superextolleret, licitum suit pro illo die quod vnus quisque priora, que sue
condicionie agnosceret, in aures suas ap^cius exclamaret: vt sic gaudium cum
dolor com pesceret, et adulantum voces, si que fuerant, pro minimo computaret.
To se this old ensamplarye
That whilom was no flaterye
Toward the he princis, well I find
whereof so as it comthe to mind
My son a tale unto thin ere
(while that the worthy princes were
At Rome) I think for to tell.
For when the chances so byfelle
That any emperor as tho
Victory had upon his foo
And so fort came to Rome again
Of treble honor he was certain
whereof that he was magnified.
The first, as it is specyfied,
was, when he came thylke tide
The chart, in which he should ride
Four white stedes should it draw.
Of Jupiter by thylke law
The cote he should were also.
His prisoners eke shulden go
Endlonge the chare on either hand.
And all the noblesse of the land
Tofore and after with him come
Rydend, and broughten him to Rome
In token of his chyualrye.
And for none other flaterye.
And that was showed forth with all.
where he satte in his chare ryalle
Beside him was a rybaud set
which had his word so beset
To the emperor in all his glory
He said: take in to memory
For all this pomp, and all this pride
Let no justice gone a side
But know thy self, what so befalle
For men seen often time fall
Thing, which men wend syker stand.
Though thou victory have on hand
Fortune may not stand alwey:
The whele perchance anothere day
May turn, and thou over throw
There lasts no thing but a throw.
with these words and with mo
This ryhaulde, which sat with him tho
To the emperor his tale told.
And ouermore what ever he would
Or were it evil, or were it good
So plainly as the troth stood
He spares not, but speaks it out.
And so might every man about
The day of that solempnyte
His tale tell as well as he
To the emperor all openly.
And all was this the cause why
That while he stood in his noblesse
He should his vanite repress
with such words as he herd.
HIC PONIT EXEMPLVM super codem / et narrat / quod eodem die quo imperator
intonisatus in palacio suo regio ad conniniu^ in maiori leticia fedisset /
ministri sui sculptores procederant alta voce dicentes: O imperator dic nobis,
cuius form, et vbi tumbam sculpture tue faciemus: vt sic morte remorsus huius
vite blandicias obtemperaret.
Lo now how thylke time ferde
Toward so high a worthy lord.
For this I find eke of record
which the cronyke has auctorized
what emperor was intronized
The first day of his corone
where he was in his royal throne
And held his fest in the paleis
Sittende upon his hie deis
withal the lust that may be get
when he was gladest at his mete
And every mynstrell had pleide
And every dissour had said
what most was pleasant to his ere:
Than at last came in there
His masons, for they should crave
where that he would he begraue
And of what stone his sepulture
They shulden make, and what sculpture
He would ordeigne thereupon.
Tho was there flaterye none
The worthy prince to beiape
The king was otherwise shape
with good counsel: and otherwise.
They were hem self than wise
And vnderstoden well and knewen
when such soft wyndes blewen
Of flaterye in to her ear
They setten naught her hertes there
But when they herd words feyned
The pleyne troth it has disdeyned
Of hem that weren so discrete
Tho took the flaterer no heyete
Of him, that was his prince tho
And for to prouen it is so
A tale, which befell in deed
In a cronyke of Rome I read.
Hic inter alia gesta Cesaris narrat vnu^ exe^plum precipue co^tra illos, qui
cum in aspectu principis aliis sapienciores apparere vellent, quandoque tame^
similate sapiencie talia committunt, per que ceteris stulciores in fine
comprobantur,
Caesar upon his royal trone
where that he sat in his person
And was highest in all his pris.
A man, which would make him wise
Fell down knelende in his presence
And did him such a reverence
As though the high god it were.
Men hadden great marvel there
Of the worship, which he deed.
This man aros fro thylke stead
And forth with all the same tide
He goth him up, and by his side
He set him down, as peer and pere
And said: If thou that fyttest here
Art god, which all things might
Than have I worshypped a right
As to the god: and other wise
If thou be not of thylke assise
But art a man, such as am I
Than may I sit the fast by,
For we be both of o kind.
Caesar answerde, and said: O blind
Thou art a fool, it is well seen
Upon thy self. For if thou wene
I be a god, thou doste amys
^o sit, where thou see god is.
And if I be a man also
Thou have a great folly do
when thou to such one, as shall deye
The worship of thy god alweye
Have yeuen so unworthily.
Thus may I prove redely
Thou art not wise. And they that herd
How wisely that the king answerde
It was to hem a new lore
whereof they dreden him the more.
And brought nothing to his ere
But if it truth and reason were.
So ben there many in such a wise
That ^aynen words to be wise
And all is very flaterye
To him, which can it well aspye.
Nota qualiter isti circa principem adulatores ^^^nus a curia expelli quam ad
regie magestatis mune^a acceptari policia suadente, deberent.
The kind flaterour can not love
But for to bring him self above.
For how that ever his master fare
So that him self stand out of care
Him retcheth naught. And thus full often
Deceived been with words soft
The kings, that been innocent.
whereof as for chastement
The wise philosophre said:
what king that so his treasure laid
Upon such folk, he has the less
And yet ne does he no largess
But harmeth with his own hand
Him self, and eke his own land.
And that many a sundry weye.
whereof if that a man shall seye
As for to speak in general
where such thing falls over all
That any king him self misreule
The philosophre upon his reule
In special a cause set
which is and ever has be let
In governance about a king
Upon the meschiefe of the thing
And that, he seith, is flaterye:
whereof tofore as in party
what vice it is, I have declared.
For who that has his wit bewared
Upon a flatour to bileue
when that he weneth best achieue
His good world, it is most fro.
And for to prouen it is so
Ensamples there be many one
Of which if thou wolte know one
It is behouely for to here
what whylom fell in this matere.
Hic loquitur vlterius de consilio adulantu^ quo rum fabulis principis aures
organizate veritatis auditu^ capere nequeunt, Et narrat exemplu^ de rege Achab,
que pro eo / quod ipse propheci^^ fidelis Michee recusauit / blandicus / que
adulantis Zedechie adhesit, rex Syrie Benedab in campo bellator ipsu^ diuino
iudicio denictum interfecit.
Among the kings in the bible
I find a tale, and is credible,
Of him that whylom Achab hight
which had all Israel to right.
But who that could gloss soft
And flater, such he set alofte
In great estate, and made hem rich
But they that speken words liche
To truth, and would it not forbere
For hem was none estate to bear
The court of such took none head,
Till at last upon a need
That Benedab king of Surry
Of Israel a great party
which Ramoth Galaad was hot
Has sesed: and of that ryote
He took counseyle in sundry wise
But not of hem, that weren wise.
And netheles upon this cas
To strenghthen him, for Iosephas
which than was king of Iudee
He send for to come, as he
which through frendshyp and alyance
was next to him of acquaintance.
For Ioram son of Iosaphath
Achabs daughter wedded has
which hight fair Goodelye.
And thus came into Samary
King Iosaphat, and he found there
The king Achab: and when they were
To gether spekende of this thing,
This Iosaphat says to the king
How that he would gladly here
Some true prophet in this matere
That he his counsel might give
To what point it shall be dreue.
And in that time so befelle
There was such one in Israel
which set him all to flaterye
And he was cleped Sedechy:
And after him Achab has sent.
And he at his commandment
Tofore him came: and by a sleyght
He has upon his heed on heyght
Two large horns set of bras.
As he which all a flattrour was,
And goth rampende as a lion
And cast his horn up and down:
And bad men ben of good espcire
For as the horns persen the air
He says, withouten resistance
So wist be well of his science
That Benedab is dyscomfyte.
when S^dechy upon this plyte
Has told this tale unto his lord
Anon they were of his acorde
Prophets false many mo
To bear up oil, and al tho
Affermen that, which he has told:
whereof the king Achab was bold
And yaue hem yeftes all about.
But Iosaphat was in great doubt
And beine fantosme all that he herd.
Prayende Achab how so ferde
If there were any other man
The which of prophecy can
To here him speak er that they gone.
Quod Achab than, there is one
A brothel, which Myche as hight.
But he ne comth naught in my sight
For he has long in prisone leyen
Him lyked never yet to seyen
A goodly word to my pleasance.
And netheles at thine instance
He shall come out: and than he may
Say, as he said many a day.
For yet he said never well.
Tho Iosaphat began some dele
To gladen him in hope of truth.
And bade withouten any slouthe
That men him should fette anon.
And they that were for him gone
when that they comen where he was
They tolden unto Mycheas
The manner how that Sedechye
Declared has his prophecye.
And thereupon they prayen him fair
That he will say no contrary
whereof the king may be displeased.
For so shall every man be eased.
And he may help him self also.
Mycheas upon truth tho
His heart set, and to hem says:
All that belonged to his faith
(And of none other feyned thing)
That woll he tell unto the king
As far as god has give him grace.
Thus came this prophet in to place
where he the kings will herd.
And he thereto anon answerde,
And said unto him in this wise:
My liege lord for my service
which true has stand ever yet
Thou haste with prisone me acquit.
But for all that I shall not gloss
Of truth as far as I suppose.
And as touchende of thy battle
Thou shalt not of the sothe fail.
For if it like the to here
As I am taught in that matere
Thou might it understand sone.
But what is afterward to done
Auise the, for this I sye
I was tofore the trone on hye
where all the world me thought stood,
And there I herd and understood
The voice of god with words clear
Axende, and said in this manner:
In what thing may I best begyle
The king Achab, and for a while
Upon this point they speken fast.
Tho said a spirit at last
I undertake this emprise.
And god him axeth in what wise.
I shall (quoth he) deceive and lie
w^^h flaterende prophecy
In such mouths, as he leueth.
And be, which all thing acheueth
^ad him go forth, and do right so.
And over this I sygh also
The noble people of Israel
Dispers, as sheep upon an hylle
without a keeper vnarayed
And as they wenten about astrayed
I herd a voice unto hem seyne:
Goth home in to your house ayene
Til I for you have better ordained.
^uod Sedechi thou have feined
This tale, in angringe of the king
And in a wrath upon this thing
He smote Miche upon the cheke.
The king him has rebuked eke
And every man upon him cried.
Thus was he shente on every side
A yene and in to prisone ladde
For so the king him self had.
The troth might naught ben herd
But afterward as it has ferde
The deed proves his intent
Achab to the battle went
where Benedab for all his shield
Him slough, so that upon the field
His people goth about a straye.
But god, which all things may
So does, that they no mischief have.
Her king was deed / and they be save
And home ageyn in gods pees
They went, and all was found ses
That Sedechye has said tofore.
So sit it well a king therefore
To love them, that troth mean
For at last it will be seen
That flaterye is no thing worth.
But now to my matter forth
As for to speken over more
After the philosophers lore
The third point of policye
I think for to specifye.
Propter transgressos leges statuuntur in orb,
Vt viuant iusti regis honor viri.
Lex sine iusticie, populum sub principis vmbra
Deuiat, vt rectum nemo videbit iter.
Hic tractat de tercia principum legis policia, que iusticia nominata est cuius
condicio legibus in corupta vnicuique quod suum est equo pondere distribuit.
what is a land, where men be none?
what ben the men, which are allone
without a kings governance?
what is a king in his ligeaunce
where that there is no law in land?
what is to take law on hand
But if the Iuges ben true?
These old worlds with the new
who that will take in euydence
There may he se experience
what thing it is to keep law
Through which wrongs be withdraw
And rightwisnes stante commended
whereof the regnes ben amended.
For where the law may commune
The lords forth with the comune
Each has his propre deute.
And eke the kings rialte
Of both his worship vnderfongeth
To his estate as it belongs:
which of his high worthiness
Has to govern rightwisnesse,
As he which shall the law guide.
And netheles upon some side
His power stant above the law
To give both and to withdraw
The forset of a man's life.
But things, which are excessise
Again the law, he shall not do
For love, ne for hate also.
Imperatoriam magestatem non solum army sed etiam legibus oportet esse armatam.
The mightes of a king be great.
But yet a worthy king shall let
Of wrong to done, all that he might.
For he which shall the people right
It sit well to his regalye
That he him self first Iustifye
Toward god in his degree.
For his astate is else fre
Toward all other in his person
Save only to the god alone
which will him self a king chastise
where that none other may suffice.
So were it good to taken head
That first a king his own deed
Between the virtue and the vice
Redress, and than of his justice
To set in even the balance
Toward other in governance
That to the power, and to the rich
His laws myghten stonde^ lyche.
He shall except no person.
But for he may not all him one
In sundry places do justice
He shall of his ryall office
with wise consideration
Ordeyne his deputation
Of sube iuges, as ben learned
So that his people be governed
By hem, that true ben and wife.
For if the law of couetyse
Be set upon a iuges hand:
woe is the people of thylke land.
For wrong may not him selfen hyde.
But else on that other side
If law stand with the right
The people is glad, and stont upright.
where as the law is reasonable
The common people stant menable.
And if the law torn amys
The people also mystorned is.
Nota hic de iusticia Maximmi imperatoria / qui cum alicuius prouincie custodem
sibi constituere volebat / primo de sui nonumis fama proclamacione facta ipsius
condicionem diligencius inuestigabat.
And in ensample of this matere
Of Maxymyn a man may here
Of Rome which was emperor.
That when he made a governor
By weye of substitucion
Of prouynce or of region,
He would first enquire his name
And let it openly proclaim
what man he were, or evil or good.
And upon that his name stood
Enclyned to virtue or to vice
So would he set him in office:
Or else put him all aweye.
Thus held the law his right weye
which fond no let of couetyse
The world stood than upon the wise
As by ensample thou might read
And hold it in the mind I read.
Hic ponit exemplum de iudicibus incorruptis: et narrat qualiter Caius
Fabri^nis nuper Rome consul autum a Sampnitibus sibi oblatum renuit dicene /
quod nobilus est aurum possiden^es dominio subiugare / quam ex auri cupiditate
dominu libertatem amittere.
In a cronycke I find thus.
How that Cayus Fabrycius
which whilome was consul of Rome
By whom the laws yede and come.
when the Samuytes to him brought
A sum of gold, and him besought
To don hem favor in the law.
Toward the gold he began him draw
whereof in all men's look
Part up in his hand he took
which to his mouth in all haste
He put it for to smelle and just
And to his eye and to his ere.
But he ne found no comfort there.
And than began it to despise
And told unto hem in this wise:
I not what is with gold to thrive
when none of all my wits five
Find savor ne delight therein.
So is it but a nyce sin
Of gold to ben to couetouse.
But he is rich and gloriouse
which has in his subjection
Tho men, which in possession
Ben rich of gold, and by this skyll
For he may all day when he will
Or be hem lose or be hem loathe
Justice done upon hem both.
Lo thus he said, and with that word
He threw tofore hem on the board
The gold out of his hand anon.
And said hem, that he would none.
So that he kept his lyberte
To do Justice and equity.
without lucre of such richesse.
There ben now few of such I guess
For it was thylke times used
That every Judge was refused
which was not friend to common right,
But they that wolden stand up right
For truth only to do Justice
Preferred were in thylke office
Lo deem and Judge common law
which now men sayn is all withdraw.
^ To set a law and keep it naught
There is no comune profit sought.
But above al netheles
The law which is made for pees
Is good to keep for the best.
For that sets all men in rest.
Hic narrat de iusticia nuper Conradi imperato (...) cuius tempore alicuius
reuerencia person (...) se^ precum internencione quacunque vel au^ ^^empcione
legum statuta commutari seu redi ^^^^^tenus potuerunt.
The ryghtful emperor Conrade
To keep pees such law made
That none within the cite
In dysturbaunce of unity
Durst ones meuen a matere.
For in his time as thou might here
what point that was for law set
It should for no good be let
To what person that it were
And this brought in the common fere
why every man the law dradde
For there was none, which favor bad.
Nota exemplum de constantia iudicis, vbi narrat de Carmidotiro Rome nuper
consule, qui cum sui statuti legem nescius offendisset / Romani que super hoc
penam sibi remittere voluissent, ipse pro pria manu / vbi nullus alius in ipsum
vindex fuit / sui criminis vindictam executus est.
So as these old books said
I find write, how a romayne
which consul was of the pretoyre
whose name was Carmidotoire
He set a law for the pees
That none but he be wepenles
Shall came into the counseyle house.
And else as malicious
He shall ben of the law deed.
To that statute, and to that read
Accorden all, it shall be so
For certain cause, which was tho.
Now list what fill thereafter lone.
This Consul had for to done
And was in to the feldes ride.
And they him had long abide
That lords of the counseyle were,
And for him send, and he came there
with sword begyrde, and has foryete
Till he was in the counseyle sete.
was none of hem that made speech
Till he him self it would seche.
And fond out the defaut him self.
And than he said unto the twelfe
which of the senate weren wise.
I have deserved the iuyse
In haste that it were do.
And they him sayden all no
For well they wist it was no vice:
when he ne thought no malice
But onelyche of a little sloth
And thus they leften as for routh
To do justice upon his gylte
For that he should not be spylte.
And when he sygh the manners how
They would him save, he made anowe
with manful heart, and thus he said.
That Rome should never abrayde
His heirs, when he were of dawe
That her auncestre brake the law.
For thy er that they weren ware
Forthwith the same sword he bare
The statute of his law kept.
So that all Rome his death bewepte.
Nota quod falsi iudices mortis pena puuienbi sunt. Narrat enim qualiter
Cambices rex Per sarum quendam indicem coruptum excoriari vinu^ fecit, eiusque
pelle cathedram iudicialem operiri co^stituit. Ita quod filius suus super
patris pellem postea pro tribunali seffurus, iudicii equitatem eui dencius
memoraretur.
In other place also I read
where that a Judge his own deed
Ne wol naught venge of law broke
The king has him self wroke.
The great king, it which Cambises
was hot, a Judge lawles
He fond, and in to remembrance
He did upon him such vengeance.
Out of his skin he was beflayne
All quycke: and in that wise slain
So that his skyn was shape all mete
And nailed on the same sete
where that his son should sytte
Auise him if he would flytte
The law for the couetyse
There saw be ready his Iuise.
Thus in defalte of other Judge
The king mote otherwhile judge
To holden up the right law.
And for to speak of the old dawe
To take ensample of that was tho
I find a tale written also,
How that a worthy prince is hold
The laws of his land to hold.
First for the high gods sake
And eke for that him is betake
The people for to guide and led
which is the charge of his king head.
Hic ponit exemplum de principibus illis / non solum legem statuentes illam
conseruant / sed vt commune bonum adangeant, propriam facultate^ diminuu^t. Et
narrat, quod cum Atheu^ principe subditos suos in omni prospiritatis
habundantia diuites et vnanimes congruis legibus stare fecisse volens, ad
vtilitatem reipublice leges if las firmnis obserniari peregre profecissise
finxit, sed prive iuramentuus solemn a legiis suis sub hac forma exegit, quod
ipsi vsque in reditum suum seges suas nullatenus infringerent, quibus iuratis
peregrinationem suam in exilium absque reditu perpetuo delegaust,
In a cronyke I read thus
Of the ryghtfull Lycurgus
which of Athenes prince was
How be the law in every cas,
whereof he should his people rule
Has set upon so good a rule
In all this world that cite none
Of law was so well begone,
Forthwith the truth of governance
There was among hem no distaunce
But every man has his encrees.
There was without werre pees,
without envy love stood
Richesse upon the common good
And not upon the synguler
Ordained was, and the power
Of hem, that weren in estate
was saufe, whereof upon debate
There stood nothing, so that in rest
Might every man his heart rest.
And when this noble ryghtfull king
Sigh how it ferde of all this thing
whereof the people stood in ease
He which for ever would please
The high god, whose thonke be sought
A wonder thing than he bethought
And shope, if that it might be
How that his law in the cite
Might afterward for ever last.
And thereupon his wit he cast
what thing him were best to seyne
That he his purpose might atteyne.
A parliament and thus he set
His wisdom where that he be set
In audience of great and small
And in this wise he told his tale:
God wot, and so ye woten all
Here afterward how so it fall
yet in to now my will has be
To do justice and equity
In fordrynge of commune proffyte
Such has been ever my delight,
But of one thing I am be know
The whiles my will is that ye know.
The law / which I took on hand
was all togeder of gods sonde
And no thing of mine own wit,
So mote it need endure yet
And shall do longer, if ye will.
For I wol tell you the skyl.
The god Mercurius, and no man
He has me taught, all that I can
Of such laws as I made,
whereof that ye ben all glad
It was the god, and nothing I
which did all this: And now for thy
He has commanded of his grace
That I shall come in to a place
which is foren out in an isle
where I mote tarry for a while
with him to speak and he has bid.
For as he says, in thilke stead
He shall me such things tell,
That ever while the world shall dwell
Athenes shall the better fare.
B^t first er that I thither fare
For that I would that my law
Among you ne be withdraw
There whiles that I shall be out
For thy to setten out of doubt
B^^h you and me, thus wol I pray
That ye me would assure and say
with such an oath, as ye will take,
That each of you shall undertake
My laws for to keep and hold.
They sayden all, that they would.
And there upon they swore there oath
That fro that time, that he gothe
(...) he to hem be come again
They should his laws well and pleyne
In every point keep and fulfill.
Thus has Lycurgus his will:
And took his leave, and forth he went.
But list now well to what intent
Of rightwisnes be did so.
For after that he was ago
He shope him never to be found
So that Athenis, wyiche was bound
Never after should be releced
Ne thilke good law seced
which was for commune profit set.
And in this wise he has it knette.
He which the commune profit sought
The king his own estate ne rought
To do profit to the commune
He took of exyle the fortune
And left of prince thylke office
Only for love and for justice
Through which he thought, if that he might
For ever after his death, to right
The cite, which was him betake
whereof men ought ensample take
The good laws to auaunce
with hem which under governance
The laws have for to keep
For who that would take keep
Of hem that first laws found
Als far as lasts any bound
Of land, her names yet ben know.
And if it like the to know
Some of her names, how they stand
Now harken, and thou shall understood.
Hic ad eorum laudem, qui iustitie causa leges statuerunt aliquorum nomina
specialius co^memorat.
Of every benfite the merit
The god him self it wol acquyte.
And eke full often it falls so
The world it woll acquyte also
But that may not ben even lyche
The god he yeueth the heaven rich,
The world yefth only but a name
which stont upon the good fame
Of hem that done the good deed.
And in this wise double mede
Receyuen they, that done well here
whereof if that the list to here
After the fame as it is blow
There might thou well the soth know
How thilke honest business
Of hem, that first for ryghtwysenesse
Among the men the laws made
May never upon this earth fade
For ever while there is a tongue
Her name shall be read and song
And hold in the cronyke write
So that the men it shullen wit
To speaken good, as they well oughten
Of hem, that first the laws soughten
In fo^drynge of the worlds pees
Unto the Hebrews was Moses
The first: and to the Egypciens
Mercurius: and to Troiens
First was Numa Pompilius
To Athenes Licurgus
yaue first the law unto gregoys.
Foroneus has thylke voice
And Romulus of romans:
For such men that been vilayns
The law in such a wise ordeineth
That what man to the law pleyneth
Be so the judge stand vpryght
He shall be served of his right.
And so ferforth it is befall
That law is come among us all.
God leave it mote well been hold
As every king thereto is hold.
For thing, which is of kings set
with kings ought it not be let.
what king of law takes no keep
By law he may no royalme keep.
Do law away, what is a king?
where is the right of any thing
If that there be no law in land?
This ought a king well understand
As he which is to law swore
That if the law be forlore
withouten execucion,
It makth a land turn up so down
which is unto the king a sclaundre.
For thy unto king Alisaundre
The wise philosophre badde
That he him self first be ladde
Of law, and forth than over all
To do justice in general.
That all the wide land about
The justice of his law doubt:
And than shall be stand in rest.
For thereto law is one the best
Above all other erthly thing
To make a liege dread his king.
But how a king shall get him love
Toward the high god above
And eke among the men in earth
This next point, which is the ferthe
Of Aristotle's lore, it techeth
whereof who that the schole secheth
what policy that it is
The book reherseth after this.
Nil rationis habens, ubi uelle tyrannica regna
Stringit amor populi, transiet exul ibi:
Sed pietas, regnum quae conseruabit in aeuum
Non tantum populo, sed placet illa deo.
Hic tractat de quarta principum regiminis policia, que pietas dicta est, per
quam principes erga populum misericordes effecti, misericordiam altissimi
gratius consequuntur.
It needs not, that I delate
The price, which preysed is algate
And has been ever, and ever shall,
whereof to speak in special
It is the virtue of Pite
Through which the hye majesty
was stered, when his son alyght
And in pity the world to right
Took of the maid flesh and blood:
Pite was cause of thylke good
whereof that we ben all save.
well ought a man pite to have
And the virtue to set in price
when he him self, which is all wise
Has showed, why it shall be preysed.
Pite may not be counterpeysed
Of tyranny with no peyse,
For pity makth a king curteyse
Both in his word, and in his deed.
It sit well every lyege dread
His king, and to his best obey.
And right so by the same weye
It sit a king to be pitous
Toward his people and gracious
Upon the reule of governance,
So that he worche no vengeance
which may be cleped cruelte.
Justice, which does equite
Is dredful, for he no man spares.
But in the land where pite fares
The king may never fail of love
For pity through the grace above
So as the holy book affermed.
His reign in good estate confermed
Thapostel James in this wise
Seyth, what man should do Iuise
And has not pity forth with all
The dome of him, which demeth all
He may him self full sore dread
That him shall lack upon the need
To find pity, when he would.
For who that pity woll behold
It is a point of Christ's lore.
And for to loken ouermore
It is behouely, as we find
To reason and to law of kind.
Cassodore in his aprise tells
The reign is saufe, where pite dwells.
And Tullyus his tale auoweth
And says, what king to pite boweth
And with pite stont overcome /
He has that shield of grace nome
which the kings yeueth victory.
Of Alysaunder in his histoyre
(...) read, how he a worthy knight
Of ^odeyn wrath and not of right
For iuged has: and he appelleth.
And with that word the king quareleth
And says, None is above me.
That wot I well my lord (quod he)
Fro thy lorship appele I naught
But fro thy wrath in all my thought
To thy pity stant mine appele.
The king, which understood him well
Of pure pity yaue him grace.
And eke I read in other place
Thus said whilome Constantyne.
what emperor that is enclyne
To pity for to be servant
Of all the worlds remenaunt
He is worthy to ben a lord.
In old books of record
Thus find I write of ensamplaire
^^a^an the worthy debonaire
By whom that Rome stood governed.
Upon a time, as he was learned
Of that he was to familyer
He said unto that counceller,
That for to be an emperor
His will was not for vain honor,
Ne yet for reddour of justice
But if he might in his office
His lords and his people plese
Him thought it were a greatter ease
with love her hearts to him draw
Than with the dread of any law.
For when a thing is done for doubt
Full often it comth the wers about.
But where a king is pyetous
He is the more gracious
That mochel thrifte him shall be tide
which ellis should torn a side.
Qualiter Iudeus pedester cum paganos equi tante itenerauit prr desertum, et
ipsum de fide sua interrogauit.
To do pity, supporte, and grace
The philosophre upon a place
In his writenge of days old
A tale of great ensample told
Unto the king of Macedoyne,
How between Cayr and Babyloyne
when comen is the somer hete
It happens two men for to mete
As they should enter in a paas
where that the wilderness was,
And as they went forth spekende
Under the large wodes end,
That o man asks of that other,
what man art thou my liefe brother?
which is thy creance and thy feyth?
I am paynym, that other says.
And by the law, which I use
I shall not in my feyth refuse
To louen all men ylyche
The pour both and eke the rich.
when they be glad I shall be glad,
And sorry when they ben bestad.
So shall I live in unite
with every man in his degree.
For right as to my self I would
Right so toward al other should
Be gracious and debonaire.
Thus have I told the soft and fair
My faith, my law, and my creaunce.
And if the list for acquaintance
Now tell, what manner man thou art.
And he answerde upon his part
I am a jew, and by my law
I shall to no man be felawe
To keep him troth in word ne deed
But if he be without dread
A very jew right as am I.
For else I may trewly
Bereue him both life and good.
The paynim herd, and understood
And thought it was a wonder law.
And thus upon their sundry saw
Talkende both forth they went.
The day was hot, the son brent,
The paynim rode upon an ass
And of his catell more and less
with him a rich trusse he lad.
The jew which all untruth had
And went upon his fete beside
Bethought him how he might ride,
And with his words slye and wise
Unto the paynym in this wise
He said: O now it shall be seen
what thing it is, thou would mean.
For if thy law be certain
As thou have told, I dare well seyne
Thou wolt behold my distres
which am so full of werynesse
That I ne may uneath go,
And let me ride a mile or two.
So that I may my body ease.
The paynim would him not displease
Of that he spoke, but in pite
It list him for to know and se
The pleynt, which that other made
And for he would his heart glade
He light, and made him nothing strange
Thus was there made a new change.
The paynim goth, the jew alofte
was set, upon his ass soft.
So gone they forth carpende fast
On this, on that, till at last
The paynym might go no more
And prayed unto the jew therefore
To suffer him ride a little while.
The jew, which thought him to begyle
Anon rode forth the great pase
And to the paynym in this case
He said: Thou have do thy right
Of that thou had me behyght
To do succor upon my need
And that accords to the deed
As thou art to the law hold.
And in such wise, as I the told
I think also for my party
Upon the law of Iewerie
To worche and do my duete.
Thin ass shall go forth with me
with all thy good, which I have sesed
And that I wot thou art disesed
I am right glad, and not my spayde.
And when he has these words said
In all haste he rode away.
This paynim wot none other way
But on the ground he kneleth even
His hands up to the heaven,
And said: O hibe sothfastnes
That love all rightwysnesse
Unto thy dome lord I appele
Behold and deem my quarele
with vmble heart I the beseech
The mercy both and eke the wreche
I set all in thy judgment.
And thus upon his marrement
This paynym has made his preiere.
And than he rose with drery chere
And goth him forth, and in his gate
He cast his eye about algate
The jew if that he might se.
But for a time it might not be,
Till at last ayene the night
So as god would he went a right
As he, which held the high weye.
And than he syghe in a valeye
where that the jew lyggende was
All bloody deed upon the gras
which strangled was of a lion.
And as he looked up and down
He fond his ass fast by
Forth with his harneis redily
All hole and sound as he it left
when that the jew it him berefte.
whereof he thanked god knelende.
Lo thus a man may know at end
How the pitous, pity deserves.
For what man that to pity serves
As Aristotle it bears witness
God shall his fomen so redress
That they shall aye stand under foot.
Pity men seyne is thylke rote
whereof the virtues sprengen all.
what infortune that befall
In any land, lack of pity
Is cause of thilke aduersite.
And that alday may show at eye
who that the world discretely sye.
Good is that every man therefore
Take heed of that is said tofore.
For of this tale, and other inowe
These noble princes whylom drowe
Her evidence and her apprise,
As men may find in many wife
who that these old books read.
And though they ben in earth deed
Her good name may naught deye
For pite, which they would obey
To do the deeds of mercy.
And who this tale redily
Remembers, as Aristotle it told
He may the will of god behold
Upon the point as it was ended
whereof that pity stood commended
which is to charity felawe,
As they that kepen both o law.

Of pite for to speak pleyne
which is with mercy well beseyne
Full often he woll him selue pain
To keep an other fro the pain.
For char^^ the mother is
Of pite, which nothing amys
Can suffer, if he it may amend.
It sit to every man lyuende
To be pytous, but none so well
As to a king which on the whele
Fortune has, set abouen all.
For in a king, if so befalle
That his pitche ferme and stable
To all the land it is vaillable
Only through grace of his person.
For the pite of him alone
May all the large royalme save,
So sit it well a king to have
Pity. For this Valery told
And said: how that by days old
Codrus, which was in his degree
King of Athenes the cite
A werre he had ayeinst Dorrence
And for to take his euydence
what shall befalle of the battle
He thought he would him first counsel
with Apollo, in whom he tryste
Through whose answer thus he wyste
Of two points, that he might chese
Or that he would his body lose
And in battle him self deye:
Or else the second weye
To seen his people discomfite.
But he / which pite has perfyte
Upon the point of his believe
The people thought to releue,
And chese him self to be deed.
where is now such another heed
which would for the lymmes dye?
And netheles in sum party
It ought a kings heart stere
That he his lyege men forbere.
And eke toward his enemies
Full often he may deserve pryse
To take of pity remembrance
where that he might do vengeance.
For when a king has the victoire
And than he draw in to memoire
To do pity instead of wreche,
He may not fail of thilke speech
whereof ariste the worlds fame
To give a prince a worthy name.
HIC PONIT EXEMPLVM de victoriosi principis pietate erga aduersarios suos, Et
narrat / quod cum Pompeius Romanorum Imperator regem Armenie aduersarium suum
in bello victum cepisset / captumque vinculis alligatum Rome tenuisset
tyrannidis iracundie stimulo postponens, pietatis mansuetudinem operatus est:
dixit enim, quod nobilius est regem facere quam deponere. super quo dictum
regem absque ulla redemptione non solum a vinculis absoluit / sed ad sui regni
culmen gratuita uoluntate coronatum restituit.
I read how whylome that Pompey
To whom that Rome must obey
A war had in Iupartye
Against the king of Armenye
which of long time had him grieved
But at last it was acheued
That he this king discomfyte had
And forth with him to Rome ladde
As prisoner, where many a day
In sorry plyte and pour he lay.
The corone on his heed deposed
within walls fast enclosed.
And with full great humylite
He suffers his aduersite.
Pompeye sigh his patience
And took pite with conscience
So that upon his high deys
To fore all Rome in his paleys,
As he that would upon him rewe
Let give him his corone new
And his estate all full and plain
Restores of his reign again.
And said: it was more goodly thing
To make than undone a king
To him, which power had of both.
Thus they that weren both wroth
Accorden hem to fynall pees.
And yet justice nethelees
was kept, and in nothing offended.
whereof Pompeye is yet commended.
There may no king him self excuse
But if justice he keep and use,
which for to eschew cruelte
He mote attempre with pite.
Of cruelty the felonye
Engendered is of tyranny
Ayene the whose condition
God is him self the champion.
whose strenthe no man may withstonde.
For ever yet it has so stand
That god a tyrant over ladde.
But where pite the reign ladde
There might no fortune last
which was grievous, but at last
The god him self it has redressed.
Pity is thylke virtue blessed
which never let his master fall.
But cruelty though it so fall
That it may reign for a throw
God woll it shall be over throw
whereof ensamples ben ynowe
Of hem, that thylke merell drowe.
Hic loquitur contra illos, qui tirannica potestate principatum optinentes,
iniqiutatis sue malicia gloriantur, Et narrat in exemplum, qualiter Leontius
tirannus pium Iustintanum non solum and solio imperatorie magestatis
fraudulenter expulsit, sed vt ipse inhabilis ad regnit in aspectu plebis
efficiretur naso et labris abscisis, ipsum tirannice mutilauit: deus tamen, qui
super omnia pius est, Tyberio superueniente vna cum adiutorio Therbellis
Bulgarie regis Iustinianum interfecto Le ontio, ad imperiu^ restitui
misericorditer procurauit.
Of cruelte I read thus
when the tyrant Leoncyus
was to thempyre of Rome arrived
Fro which he has with strenth priued
The pietous Justinian
As he which was a cruel man
His nose of and his lips both
He cut, for he would him loathe
Unto the people, and make unable.
But he which all is merciable
The high god ordeineth so
That he within a time also
when he was strengest in his ire
was shouen out of his empire.
Tiberius the power had
And Rome after his will he ladde.
And for Leonce in such a wise
Ordeineth that he took Iuise
Of nose and lyppes both two
For that he did another so
which more worthy was than he.
Lo which a fall has cruelte
And pite was set up again.
For after that the books seyne
Therbellis king of Bulgarie
with help of his chivalry
Iustinyan has vnprisonned
And to thempire again coroned.
Hic loquitur vlterius de crudelitate Siculi tyranni, necnon et de Berillo
eiusdem consiliario / qui ad tormentum populi quendam taurit eneum tirannica
coniectura fabricari constituit / in quo tu^ ipse prior proprio crimine illud
exigente vsque ad sui interitus expirationem iudicialiter for quebatur.
In a cronyke I find also
Of Siculus, which was eke so
A cruel king like the tempest
The whom no pite might arest.
He was the first, as books seye
Upon the sea, which fond galeye
And let hem make for the werre
As he, which all was out of herre
Fro pite and misericorde.
For thereto couthe be not accord,
But whom he might sleyne, he slough
And thereof was he glad enough.
He had of council many one
Among the which there was one
By name, which Berillus hight
And he bethought him, how he might
Unto this tyrant do lykyng.
And of his own imagynyng
Let forge and make a bulle of bras,
And on the side cast there was
A door where a man may in
when he his pain shall begin
Through fire, which that me^ put under.
And all this did be for a wonder.
That when a man for pain cryde
The bulle of bras, which gapeth wide
It should seem, as though it were
A belowynge in a man's ere
And not the cryenge of a man.
But he, which all sleyghtes can
The devil, that lies in hell fast
Him that it cast has ouercast
That for a trespass, which he deed
He was put in the same stead.
And was him self the first of all
which was in to that pain fall
That he for other men ordeineth.
There was no man that him compleineth.
Of tyranny and cruelte
By this ensample a king may se
Him self, and eke his council both
How they ben to mankind loathe
And to the god abomynable.
Ensamples that been concordable
I find of other princes mo
As thou shalt here of time ago.
Nota hic de Diony sio tyranno, qui mire crudiu^ tatis seueritate etiam
hospites suos ad deuorandum equis fuis tribuit, cui Hercules tandem super
veniens victum impium impietate sua pari morte conclusit.
The great tyrant Dionyse
which man's life set of no prise
Unto his horse full often be yafe
The men, instead of corn and chafe,
So that the horse of thylke stood
Deuoureden the man's blood
Till fortune at last came
That Hercules him overcame.
And he right in the same wise
Of this tyrant took the Iuise
As he till other men has do
The same death he dyed also
That no pite him has socourde
Till he was of his horse deuourde.
Nota hic de consimili Lichaontis tirannia, qui tarnes hoim^ hominibus in suo
hospicio ad vescendum dedit, cuius formam condicioni simlem coequans ipm^
inlupum transformauit.
Of Lychaon also I find
How be again the law of king
His host slough, and in to mete
He made her bodies to ben ete
with other men within his hows.
But Jupiter the glorious
which was commened of this thing
Vengeance upon this cruelkinge
So took, that he fro man's form
In to a wolf he let transform.
And thus the cruelte was kyd
which of long time he had hyd.
A wolf he was than openly
The whose nature privily
He had in his condition.
And unto this conclusion
That tyranny is to despise
I find ensample in sundry wise
And namelyche of hem full often
The whom fortune has set alofte
Upon the werres for to win
But how so that the wrong begin
Of tyranny it may naught last
But such as they done at last
To other men, such on hem falls.
For ayene such pite calls
Vengeance to the god above.
For who that has no tender love
In saving of a man's life
He shall be found so gyltyfe
That when he would mercy crave
In time of need be shall none have.
Nota qualiter leo hominibus stratis percit.
Of the nature this I find
The fires lion in his kind
which goth rampende after his pray
If he a man find in his way
He will him sleyen, if he withstonde.
But if the man couthe understand
To fall anon tofore his face
In sign of mercy and of grace
The lion shall of his nature
Restreigne his Ire in such mesure
As though it were a best tamed
And torn aweye halfyng ashamed
That he the man shall nothing grieve.
How should than a prince acheue
The worlds grace, if that he would
Destroy a man, when he is yolde,
And stante upon his mercy all?
But for to speak in specialle
There have be such, and such there be
Tyrants, whose hertes no pity
May to no point of mercy plye
That they upon her tyranny
Ne gladen hem the men to slay.
And as the rages of the sea
Ben vnpitous in the tempeste:
Right so may no pite areste
Of cruelte the great vltrage
which the tyrant in his courage
Engendered has, whereof I find
A tale, which comth now to mind.
Hic loquitur precipu^ contra tyrannos illos, qui cum in bello vincere possu^t,
humani sanguini^ effusionem saturari nequeunt: et narrat in exemplum de quodam
Persarum rege, cuius nomen Spartachus erat, qui pre ceteris tunc in orient
bellicosus et victoriosus, quoscu^que gladio vincer^ poterat / absque psetate
interfici constituit. Seb tandem sub manu Thomiris Marsegittarum regine in
bello captus, quod a diu quesiuit, seueritatem pro seueritate finaliter
inuenit. Nam et ipsa quoddam vas de sanguine Persarum plenum ante se afferre
decreuit, in quo caput tyra^m vsque ad mor tem mergen^ dixit: O tyrannorum
crudelissime semper esn^iens sanguinem sitisti, ecce iam ad saturitatem
sanguinem bibe.
I read in old books thus
There was a duc, which Spartachus
Men clepe, and was a warrior,
A cruel man a conqueror
with strong power, the which he lad.
For this condition he had
That where him happens the victoire
His lust and all his most gloire
was for to slay, and not to save.
Of ransom would he no good have
For saving of a man's life,
But all gothe to the sword and knyfe
So leefe him was the man's blood.
And netheles yet thus it stood
So as fortune about went
He fell right heir, as by descent
To Pers, and was coroned king.
And when the worship of this thing
was fall: and he was king of Pers
If that they weren first diverse
The tyrannies, which he wrought
A thousant fold well more he sought
Than afterward to do malice
Tylle god vengeance ayene the vice
Has shape: For upon a tide
when he was hieste in his pride
In his rancour, and in his hete
Ayene the queen of Mersagete
which Thomiris that time hight
He made werre all that he might.
And she which would her land defend
Her own son ayene him send
which the defense has undertake
But he discomfite was and take.
And when this king him had in hand
He wol no mercy understand
But did him slay in his presence.
The tydynge of this violence
when it came to the mothers ear,
She send anon ay wide where
To such friends as she had
A great power till that she lad.
In sundry wise, and tho she cast
How she this king may ouercast.
And at last accorded was
That in the danger of a pas
Through which this tyrant should pas
She shope his power to compass
with strength of men, by such a wey
That he shall not escape awey.
And when she had thus ordained
She has her own body feyned
For fere as though she would flee
Out of her land. And when that he
Has herd, how that this lady fled
So fast after the chase he spedde
That he was found out of array.
For it betyd upon a day
In to the paas when he was fall
The cubusshementes to breaken all
And him beclipte on every side
That flee ne might be not aside.
So that there weren deed and take
Two hundred thousand for his sake
That weren with him of his hooste.
And thus was leyed the great booste
Of him, and of his tyranny.
It halpe no mercy for to cry
To him, which whylome did none.
For he unto the queen anon
was brought: and when that she him sye
This word she spoke, and said on hye:
O man, which out of man's kind
Reason of man have left behind
And lived worse than a best
whom pity might none areste
The man's blood to shede and spylle:
Thou had never yet thy fylle.
But now the last time is come
That thy malice is overcome
As thou till other men have do
Now shall be do to the right so.
Tho bad this lady that men should
A vessel bring, in which she would
Se the vengeance of his Iuise,
which she began anon deuyse
And took the princis, which he ladde
By whom his chief council he had,
And while hem lasts any breath
She made hem blede to the death
Into the vessel where it stood.
And when it was fulfylde of blood
She cast this tyrant therein
And said him: Lo thus might thou win The lusts of thine appetyte.
In blood was whylom thy delight
Now shalt thou drynken all thy fylle.
And thus onelyche of gods will
He which that would him self strange
To pite, fond mercy so strange,
That he without grace is lore.
So may it well show the more
That cruelte has no good end,
But pite how so that it wend
Makth that god is merciable
If there be cause reasonable
why that a king shall be pytous
But else if he be doubtous
To sleen in cause of ryghtwysenesse
It may be said no pytousnesse.
But it is pusyllanimyte
which every prince should flee.
For if pite mesure excede
Knyghthode may not alwey proceed
To do iustyse upon the right.
For it belongs to a knight
As gladly for to fight as rest
To set his lyege people in rest
when that the war upon hem falls.
For hem be mote, as it befalls
Of his knyghthode, as a lion
Be to the people a champion
without any pite feyned.
For if manhood be restreyned
Or be it pees, or be it war
Justice goth all out of herre
So that knyghthode is set behind.
Of Aristotle's lore I find
A king shall make good vysage
That no man know of his courage
But all honor and worthynesse.
For if a king shall upon guess
without ver^y cause dread
He may be lyche to that I read.
And though that be like a fable
Then saumple is good and reasonable
Hic loquitur secundum philosophum diceus, quod sicut non decet principes
tyrannica impetuositate esse crudeles, it a nec decet timorosa pufillanimitate
esse vecordes.
As it by old days fylle
I read whylom that an hylle
Up in the lands of Archade
And wonder dreadful noise it made.
For so it fyl that ylke day
This hylle on his chyldynge lay.
And when the throws on him come
His noise liche the day of dome
was ferefull in a man's thought
Of things, which that they se naught
But well they herden all about
The noise, of which they were in doubt
As they that wenden to be lore
Of thing, which than was vnbore.
The nere this hyl was upon chance
To take his deliverance
The more vnbuxomly he cryde.
And every man was fled a side
For dread, and left his own hows.
And at last it was a mows
The which was bore, and to noryce
By take: and tho they held hem nyce
For they withouten cause dradde.
Thus if a king his heart ladde
with every thing that he shall here
Full often he should change his chere
And upon fantasye dread
when that there is no cause of dread.
Nota hic secundum Horacium de magnanimo Iacide et pusillanimo Thersite.
Horace to his prince told
That him were lever, that he would
Upon knyghthode Achylles sewe
In time of war, than eschew
So as Thersites did at Troy.
Achilles al his hole joy
Set upon arms for to fight.
Thersites sought all that he might
Unarmed for to stand in rest.
But of the two it was the best
That Achilles upon the need
Has do, whereof his knyghtlyhede
Is yet commended oueralle.
King Solomon in special
Says: As there is a time of pees
So is a time netheles
Of werre: in which a prince algate
Shall for the common right debate
And for his own worship eke.
But it behooves not to seek
Only the werre for worship
But to the right of his lordship,
which he is hold to defend
Mote every worthy prince entende
Between the symplesse of pity
And the fool have of cruelte.
where stonte the very hardiness
There mote a king his heart adresse.
when it is time, to forsake
And when time is, also to take
The deedly werres upon hand
That he shall for no dread wonde
If ryghtwisenes be withal.
For god is mighty over all
To forther every man's truth
But it be through his own slouthe,
And namely the kings need
It may not fail for to speed.
For he stante one for hem all
So mote it well the better fall.
And well the more god favors
when he the comune right socoureth.
And for to se the soth in deed
Behold the bible, and thou might read
Of great ensamples many one
whereof that I will tellen one.
Hic dicit / quod princeps iusticie causa bellum nullo modo timere debet. Et
narrat qualiter dux Gedeon cum solis trecentis viris quinque reges scilicet
Madianitarum, Amalechitarum / Amoitanorum, Amoreorum et Iebuseorum, cum eorit
excercitu, qui ad nonaginta milia numeraius eft / gracia cooperante diuina,
victoriose in fugam conuertit.
Upon a time as it byfelle
Against Jude and Israelle
when sundry kings come were
In purpos to destroy there
The people / which god kept tho,
And stood in thylke days so
That Gedeon, which should led
The gods folk / took him to read
And send in all the land about
Till he assembled has a route
with.xxx. thousand of defense
To fight and make resistance
Again the which hem would assail.
And netheles that one battle
Of three / that weren enemies
was double more than was all his
whereof that Gedeon him drad
That he so little people had.
But he which all thing may help
where that there locketh man's help
To Gedeon his aungel sent
And bad / er that he forther went,
All openly that he do cry
That every man in his party
which would after his own will
In his delight abide stylle
At home in any manner wise
For purchase, or for couetyse,
For lust of love, or lack of heart
He should naught about sterte
But hold him stylle at home in pees.
whereof upon the morrow he lees
well.xx. thousand men and mo
The which after the cry ben go.
Thus was with him but only left
The thryde part, and yet god efte
His aungel send, and said this
To Gedeon: If it so is
That I thyn help shall undertake
Thou shall yet less people take
By whom my will is that thou speed.
For thy to morrow take good head
Unto the flood when ye be come
what man that has the water nome
Up in his hand, and lappeth so
To thy part chese out all tho
And him which weary is to swinke,
Upon his womb and lies to drink,
Forsake and put hem al aweye
For I am mighty all weye
where as me list my help to show
In good men, though they be few.
This Gedeon a wayteth well
Upon the morrow, and every dele
As god him bad, right so he deed.
And thus there left in that stead
with him three hundred, and no mo
The remenaunte was all ago.
whereof that Gedeon merueyleth
And thereon with god counceyleth
Pleynynge, as ferforth as he dare.
And god, which would he were ware
That he should speed upon his right
Has bid him go the same night
And take a man with him to here
what shall be spoke in this matere
Among the hethen enemies,
So may he be the more wise,
what afterward him shall befalle.
This Gedeon among all
Phara, to whom he tryst most
By night took toward thylke host
which lodged was in a valeye
To here what they wolden seye.
Upon his foot and as he ferde
Two sarazyns spekende he herd
Quod one, arede my sweuen aryght
which I met in my sleep to night.
Me thought I sygh a barley cake
which fro the hylle his wey has take
And com rollende down at ones,
And as it were for the nones
Forth in his course, so as it ran
The kings tente of Madyan,
Of Amaleche, of Amorie
Of A mon, and of Iebuseye
And many another tente mo,
with great joy as me thought tho
It threw to ground and over cast
And all his host so sore agaste
That I awoke for pure dread.
This sweuen can I well arede
Quod the other sarazen anon,
The barley cake is Gedeon
which fro the hylle done suddenly
Shall come, and set such a skrye
Upon the kings, and us both
That it shall to us all loathe.
For in such dread he shall us bring
That if we haden flight of wynge,
The weye one foot in despair
we shull love, and flee in the air.
For there shall nothing him withstonde
when Gedeon has understand
This tale, he thonketh god of all,
And priuelyche again he stalle
So that no life him has perceived.
And than he has fully conceived
That he shall speed: and thereupon
The night sewend he shope to gone
This multitude to assail.
Now shall thou here a great marvel
with what wisdom that he wrought.
The little people, which he brought
was none of hem that he ne has
A pot of earth, in which he tath
A light brennynge in a cresset,
And each of hem eke a trompet
Bare in his other hand beside.
And thus upon the nyghtes tide
Duc Gedeon when it was derke
Ordeyneth him unto his work,
And parted than his folk in three
And charge hem, that they ne flee.
And taught hem how they should askry
All in o voice par company.
And what word they should eke speak,
And how they should her pottes break
Echeone with other when they herd
That he him self first so ferde.
For when they came into the stead
He bad hem do right as he deed.
And thus stalkende forth a paas
This noble duc when time was
His pot to brake, and loud ascryde
And tho they break on every side.
The trompe was naught for to seek,
He blewe, and so they blewen eke
with such a noise among hem all
As though the heaven should fall.
The hylle unto her voice answerde.
This host in the valey it herd
And sigh how that the bylle a light
So what of herynge and of sight
They caught such a sodeyne fere
That none of hem be left there.
The tents holly they forsook
That they none other good ne took
But only with her body bare
They fled, as does the wild hare.
And ever upon the hylle they blewe
Till that they sygh time and knew
That they be fled upon the rage.
And when they wyste their advantage
They fill anon upon the chase.
Thus might thou se how gods grace
Unto the good men avails
But else often time it fails
To such as be not well disposed.
This tale needs not to be glosed
For it is openly showed
That god to him that been well thewed
Has give and granted the victoire
So that thensaumple of this histoire
Is good for every king to hold.
First in him self that he behold
if he be good of his living
And that the folk, which he shall bring
Be good also, for than he may
Be glad of many a merry day
In what that ever he has to done.
For he which sytte above the moon
And all thing may spylle and speed
In every cas, and every need
His good king so well adresseth
That all his foo men he represseth.
So that there may no man him dear.
And also well he can forbere
And suffer a wicked king to fall
In hands of his fomen all.
Hic dicit, quod vbi et quando causa et tempus requirunt, princeps illos sub
potestate sua / quos iusticie aduersarios agnouerit, occidere de iure te netur.
Et narrat in exemplum, qualiter pro eo, quod Saul regem Agag in bello deuicium
iuxta Samuelis consilium occidere noluit / ipse diuino iudicio non solum a
regno Israel prinatus / sed et heredes sui pro perpetuo exheredati sunt.
Now ferthermore if I shall seyn
Of my matere, and tourn ageyn
To speak of Justice and Pite
After the rule of ryalte.
This may a king well understand
Knyghthode mote be take on hand
when that it stont upon the need
He shall no rightful cause dread
No more of werre than of pees
If he will stand blameles.
For such a cause a king may have
Better it is to slay than save.
whereof thou might ensample find
The high maker of mankind
By Samuel to Saul badde
That he shall nothing ben adrad
Again king Agag for to fight.
For this the godhede him behyght
That Agag shall be overcome.
And when it is so ferforth come
That Saul has him discomfyte
The god had make no respyte
That he ne should him slay anon.
But Saul let it ouergone
And did not the gods best.
For Agag made a great beheste
Of ransom, which he would give
King Saul suffers him to live
And feyneth pite forth withal.
But he which sees and knows all The bye god, of that he feyneth
To Samuel upon him pleyneth
And send him word: for that he left
Of Agag that he ne berefte
The life, he shall not only dye
Him self, but fro his regalye
He shall be put for euermo
Naught he, but eke his heir also
That it shall never come ageyn.
(...) ^^^^at vlterius super eode^, qualiter David (...) extrem^s iusticie
causa vt Ioab occideretur, ab (...) ^lla remissione filio suo Salomoni iniunxit.
Thus might thou se the soth pleyne
That of to much, and of to lyte
Upon the princes stant the wit.
But ever it was a kings right
To do the deeds of a knight.
For in the hondes of a king
The death and life is all othynge
After the laws of justice.
To sleen it is a deedly vice,
But if a man the death deserve.
And if a king the life preserve
Of him, which ought for to dye
He seweth not the ensamplarie
which in the bible is euydent
How Dauyd in his testament,
when he no longer might leave
Unto his son in charge has give
That he Ioab shall slay algate.
And when Dauyd was gone his gate
The young wise Salomone
His fathers heste did anon,
And slew Ioab in such a wise
That they that herden the iuyse
Ever after dredden him the more
And god was eke well paid therefore
That be so would his heart plye
The laws for to iustifye.
And yet he kept forth withal
Pity, so as a prince shall
That he no tyranny wrought.
He fond the wysdom, which he sought
And was so rightful netheles
That all his life he stood in pees
That he no deadly werres had.
For every man his wysdom drad.
And as he was him self wise
Right so the worthy men of pryse
He has of his counseyle with hold
For that is every prince hold
To make of such his retenue
which wise ben: and remue
The fools. For there is nothing,
which may be better about a king
Than counseyle, which is the substance
Of all a kings governance.
Hic dicit, quod populum sibi commissum been regere super omnia principi
laudabilius est. Et narrat in exemplum, qualiter pro eo quod Solomon, vt
populum been regeret, ab altissimo sapientia^ specialius postulauit, omnia bona
pariter cum illa sibi habundancius aduenerunt.
In Solomon a man may se
what thing of most necessite
Unto a worthy king belongs.
when he his kingdom vnderfongeth
God had him chese what he would,
And said him, that he have should
what he would ask, as of o thing.
And he which was a new king
Forth thereupon his boon prayde
To god, and in this wise said:
O king by whom that I shall reign
Give me wisdom, that I my reygne
Forth with the people, which I have
To thyn honor may keep and save.
when Solomon his boon has taxed,
The god of that which he has axed
was right well paid, and grants soon
Not all only that he his boon
Shall have of that, but of richesse
Of hele, of pees, of hye noblesse
For with wisdom at his askynges
which stant above all other things.
Hic dicit secundum Salomonem, quod regie magestatis imperium ante omnia sano
co^silio dirigendum eft.
But what king will his reygne save
First him behooves for to have
After the god and his believe
Such counseyle, which is to believe
Full fylde of troth, and ryghtwysenes
But above all in his noblesse
Between the reddour and Pity
A king shall do such equite
And set the balaunce in even
So that the high god of heaven
And all the people of his nobleye
Lowenge unto his name seye.
For most above all erthly good
where that a king him self is good
It helps: for in other weye
If so be that a king forsweye
Quidquid delirant reges, plectuntur Achiui.
Full often er this it has be seyne
The comen people is ouerleyne
And has the kings sin abought
All though the people agylte naught.
Of that the king his god mysserueth
The people takth, that he deserves
Here in this world, but else where
I not how it shall stand there
For thy good is a king to triste
First to him self, as he ne wist
None other help but god allone,
So shall the rule of his person
within him self through providence
Ben of the better conscience.
And for to find ensample of this
A tale I read, and soth it is.
Hic de Lucio imperatore exemplum ponit, qualiter princepa sui nominis famam a
secretis consilariis sapienter inuestigare debet, et si quid in ea sinistrum
inuenerit, prouisa discretione ad dextera^ conuertat.
In a cronyke it tells thus
The king of Rome Lucyus
within his chamber upon a night
The steward of his house a knight
Forth with his chamberleyne also
To counseyle had both two
And stoden by the chymne
To gether spekende all three.
And happeth that the kings fool
Sat by the fire upon a stole
As he that with his babble playde
But yet he herd all that they said
And thereof took they no head.
The king hem axeth what to read
Of such matere as came to mouth.
And they him told, as they couth.
when all was spoke, of that they meant
The king with all his holle intent
Then at last hem axeth this
what king men tellen that he is:
Emonge the folk touching his name
Or it be prys or it be blame
Right after that they herden seyne
He had hem for to tell it pleyne,
That they no point of soth forbere
By thylke feyth, that they him bear.
The steward first upon this thing
Gafe his answer unto the king
And thought gloss in this matere
And said, als far as he can here
His name is good, and honorable.
Thus was the steward favorable
That he the troth pleyne ne told.
The king than axeth, as he should,
The chamberleyne of his auyse.
And he that was subtyle and wise
And somdele thought upon his feyth
Him told, how all the people seyth
That if his counseyle were true
They wist than well and knew
That of him self he should be
A worthy king in his degree.
And thus the counseyle he accuses
In party and the king excuses.
The fool, which herd of all this cas
what time as gods will was
Sigh, that they sayden not enough
And hem to scorn both lough.
And to the king he said tho
Sir king if that it were so
Of wisdom in thyn own mode
That thou thy self were good
Thy counceyl should not be bad.
The king thereof merueyle had
when that a fool so wisely spoke
And of him self fond out the lack
within his own conscience.
And thus the folis evidence
which was of gods grace enspyred
Makth that good counceil was desired.
He put awey the vicious
And took to him the virtuous.
The wrongful laws ben amended
The lands good is well dispended
The people was no more opressed
And thus stood every thing redressed.
For where a king is propre wise
And has such as him self is
Of his counceyl / it may not fail
That every thing ne shall avail.
The vices than gone awey
And every virtue bolte his wey
whereof the hye god is plesed
And all the lands folk esed.
For if the common people cry
And than a king list not to plye
To here, what the clamore would.
And other wise than he should
Disdayneth for to done hem grace,
It has be seen in many place
There has be fall great contraire
And that I find of ensamplaire.
Hic dicit quod seniores magis experti ad ^^^ne^^^e consilium admittendi pocius
existunt / Et narrat / qualiter pro eo quod Roboas Salomonis filius et here is
senium sermonibus renuncians, dicta inuenum preelegit / de duodecim tribus
Israel a domino suo december penitus amisit / et sic cu^ duabus ta^tu^modo illusus
postea regnauit
After the death of Salomone
when thilke wise king was gone
And Roboas in his person
Receive should the corone,
The people upon a parliament
Auysed were of one assent
And all unto the king they preyde
with comune voys and thus they said:
Our liege lord we the byseche
That thou receive our humble speech
And grant us, which that reason will
Or of thy grace / or of thy skyl,
Thy fader while he was alive
And might both grant and prive
Upon the works which he had
The common people streite lad
when he the temple made new.
Thing which men never before knew
He brought up than of his tallage
And all was under the visage
Of works, which he made tho.
But now it is befalle so
That all is made right, as he said
And he was rich when he deyd.
So that it is no manner need
If thou thereof wilt taken head
To pillen of the people more
which long time has be grieved sore.
And in this wise as we the seye
with tender heart we the preye,
That thou relesse thilke debt
which upon us thy fader set.
And if the like to done so
we ben thy men for euermo
To gone and comen at thyn heste.
The king, which herd this request
Says, that he will ben aduysed,
And has thereof a time assised
And in the while as he him thought
Upon this thing counceyl he sought.
And first the wise knights old
To whom that he his tale told
Counceyllen him in this manner,
That he with love, and with glad chere
Foryeue and grant all that is asked
Of that his fader had tasked.
For so he may his regne acheue
with thing which shall hem litell grieve.
The king hem herd, and over passes
And with this other his wit compasses
That young were, and nothing wise
And they these old men despise
And sayden: Sir it shall be shame
For ever unto thy worthy name
If thou ne keep not thy right
(while thou art in thy young might)
which that thyn old father gate
But say unto the people plate
That while thou lyuest in thy land
The leest finger of thyn hand
It shall be strenger over all
Than was thy fathers body all.
And thus also shall be thy tale
If he hem smote with rods small
with scorpions thou shall hem smite.
And where thy father took a lyte
Thou thynkest take mychell more
Thus shall thou make hem dread sore
The great heart of thy courage,
So for to hold hem in seruage.
This young king him has conformed
To done as he was last informed
which was to him his undoing.
For when it came to the speaking
He has the young counseyle hold
That he the same words told
Of all the people in audience.
And when they herden the sentence
Of his malice, and the manace
Anon tofore his own face
They have him utterly refused
And with full great reprove accused
So they began for to rave
That he him self was feign to save.
For as the wild wode rage
Of wyndes makes the sea savage
And that was calm brings to wawe,
So for defaut and grace of law
The people is stered all at ones
And forth they gone out of his wones
So that of the lygnages twelfe
Two tribus only by hem self
with him abyden, and no mo.
So were they for euermo
Of no return without espeire
Departed fro the rightful heir
Of Israel, with comen voice
A king upon her own choice
Among hem self a anon they make
And have her young lord forsake.
A power knight Ieroboas
They took, and left Roboas
which ryghtfull beyre was by dissent,
Lo thus the young cause went
For that the counseyle was not good
The reygne fro the ryghtfull blood
Ever afterward divided was.
So may it prouen by this cas
That young counseyl, which is to warm
Or men beware does often harm.
Old age for the counseyle serves
And lusty yongth his thonke deserves
Upon the traueyle which he does.
And both for to sey a fothe
By sundry cause for to have
If that he will his reign save
A king behooves every day
That one can, and that other may
Be so the king hem both rule
Or else all goth out of rule.
Nota questionem cuiusdam philosophi / vtrum regno conuenientius foret
principem cum malo consilio optare sapientem, quam cum sano consilio ipsum
eligere insipientem.
And upon this matere also
A question between the two
Thus written in book I fond.
where it be better for the land
A king him self to be wise
And so to bear his own pryse
And that his counseyle be not good.
Or otherwise if it so stood
A king if he be vicious
And his counseyle be virtuous
It is answerde in such a wise
That better it is that they be wise
By whom that the counseyle shall gone
For they ben many, and he is one
And rather shall an one man
with falls counseyle, for ought he can
From his wisdom be made to fall
Than he alone should hem all
Fro vices unto virtue change
For that is well the more strange.
For thy the land may well be glad
whose king with good counseyle is lad
which set him unto ryghtwysnes
So that his high worthynes
Between the reddour and pity,
Does mercy forth with equity.
A king is holden over all
To pity, but in special
To hem, where he is most behold
They should his pite most behold
That been the lieges of the land
For they ben ever under his hand
After the gods ordenaunce
To stand upon his governance.
^^^a ad huc precipne de principum erga suos (...) deb^ta ^ietate, legitur enim
qualiter An (...) Sci^^^ne exe^p^ificatus, dixit, quod mal^er v^^m de populo
sibi commisso virum saluare, c^^^^en^^ ex hostibus alienigenis in bello perdere.
Of the emperor Anthonius
I find, bow that he said thus:
How him were lever for to save
One of his liges, than to have
Of enemies an hundred deed.
And thus he learned as I read
Of Scipio, which had be
Consul of Rome, and thus to se
Diverse ensamples how they stand
A king which has the charge on ho^de
The common people to govern
If that he will, he may well learn.
Is none so good to the plesaunce
Of god, as is good governance.
And every governance is due
To pity thus I may argue
That pity is the foundemente
Of every kings regimente.
If it be medlyd with justice
They two remeuen all vice
And ben of virtue most vaylable
To make a kings royame stable.
Lo thus the four points tofore
In governance as they be bore
Of troth first and of largess
Of pity, forth with rightwisnesse
I have hem told, and over this
The first point, so as it is
Set of the rule of policye
whereof a king shall modefye
The flesshly lusts of nature,
Now think I tell of such mesure
That both kind shall be served
And eke the law of god observed.
Corporis et mentis rege^ decet omnis honestas,
Nominis vt famam nulla libido ruat.
Omne quod est liominis effeminat illa voluptas
Sit nisi magnanimi cordis vt obstat ei.
Hic tractat secundum Aristotelem de quinta principum policia, que castitatem
concernit, cuius honestas impudicicie molus obtemperans tam corporis quam anime
mundiciciam specialius preseruat.
The male is made for the femele
But where as one desires feel
That needs naught by weye of kind.
For when a man may ready find
His own wife, what should he seche
In strange places to beseech
To borowe another man's plough
when he has gear at home enough
Affayted at his own heste
And is to him well more honest
Than other thing, which is unknow.
For thy should every good man know
And think, how that in marriage
His troth plyte / lies in morgage
which if he break, it is falsehode
And that discordeth to manhood
And namely toward the great
whereof the books all trete
So as the phylosophre techeth
To Alysaunder, and him by techeth
The lore how that he shall mesure
His body: so that no mesure
Of flesshly lust he should excede.
And thus forth if I shall proceed
The fyfte point / as I said ere
Is Chastyte, which selde where
Comth now a days in to place.
And nethelesse but it be grace
Above all other in specialle
Is none that chaste may ben all.
But yet a kings high estate
which of his order as a prelate
Shall be anoynte and sanctified.
He mote be more magnyfied
For dignite of his corone
Than should another low person
which is not of high emprise.
Therefore a prince him should advise
Er that he fell in such ryote
And namely that he ne asso^e
To change for the womenhed
The worthiness of his manhed.
Nota de doctrina Aristotelis, qualiter priceps vt animi sui locunditatem
prouocet, mulieres formosas crebro aspicere debet: caveat tamen ne men's
voluptuosa torpescens ex carnis fragilitate in vicium dilabatur.
Of Aristotle I have well radde
How he to Alysaunder badde,
That for to gladden his courage
He should beholden the visage
Of women, when that they ben fair,
But yet he set an examplayre
His body so to guye and rule
That he ne pass mot the rule
whereof that he him self begyle.
For in the woman is no gyle
Of that a man him self by wapeth
when he is own wit beiapeth
I can the woman well excuse.
But what man will upon hem muse
After the folysshe Impression
Of his ymaginacion,
within him self the fire he blows
whereof the woman nothing knows
So may she nothing be to wit.
For if a man him self excite
To drenche, and will naught forbere.
The water shall no blame bear.
what may the gold though me^ coueit?
If that a man will love streyt
The woman has him nothing bound
If he his own heart wound
She may not let the folly,
And though so fyl of company
That he might any thing purchase
Yet makes a man the first chase.
The woman flees, and he purseweth
So that by wey of skyl it sueth
The man is cause bow so befalle
That he full often sith is fall,
where that he may not well arise.
And netheles full many wise
Befooled have hem self er this,
As now a days yet it is
Among the men and ever was
The strong is febleste in this caas.
It sit a man by wey of kind
To love, but it is not kind
A man for love his wit to lose.
For if the month of Iule shall frese
And that December shall be hot,
The year mistorneth well I wot.
To seen a man from his estate
Through his soty effemynate
And leave that a man shall do
It is as hose above the shoo
To man, which ought not to be used.
But yet the world has often accused
Full great princes of this deed
How they for love hem self mislede
whereof manhood stood behind
Of old ensamples as men find.
Hic ponit exe^plum, qualiter pro eo quod Sardanapallus Assiriorum princeps
muliebri oblectamento effeminatus sue co^cupiscentie torporem quasi ex
co^suetudine adhibebat, ab Arbacto rege medorum super hoc infidiante in sui
feruoris maiori voluptate subitis mutationibus extinctus eft.
These old gestes tellen thus
That whylome Sardanapallus,
which held all hole in his empire
The great kingdom of Assyre
was through the sloth of his courage
Fall in to the ylke fyry rage
Of love / which the men assoteth
whereof him self he so ryoteth,
And wexeth so ferforth womannysshe
That ageyn kind, as if a fysshe
Abide would upon the land
In women such a lust he fond
That he dwelte ever in chamber stylle
And only wrought after the will
Of women, so as he was bid,
That seldom when in other stead
If that he would wenden out,
To seen how that it stood about.
But there he kiste / and there he played,
They taughten him a lace to brayed
And weue a purs, and to enfyle
A perle: And fell thylke while
One Arbactus the prince of Mede
Sees the king in womanhede
was fall fro chivalry
And gate him help, and company
And wrought so, that at last
This king out of his reign he cast,
which was undone for ever mo.
And yet men speaken of him so
That it is shame for to bear
For thy to love is in manner.
Nota qualiter David amans mulieres propter hoc probitatem armorum non minus
excercint.
King David had many a love.
But netheles always above
Knyghthode he kept in such a wise
That for no flesshely couetyse
Of lust to lygge in ladys arms
He l^^te not the lust of arms.
For where a prince his lusts sueth
That he the war not pursues
when it is time to been armed,
His country stant full often harmed
when the enemies be wax bold
That they defente none behold
Full many a land has so be lore
As men may read often time before
Of hem that so her cases soughten
which after they full dear aboughten.
(...) ^^uitur qualiter regnum lasciuie volupta (...) de facili vincitur: Et
ponit exemplu^ (...) rege Persarum, qui cum Lidos mira pro (...) fiteninssimos,
sibique in bello aduersantes (...) ^^do vincere potuit / cum ipsis tandem pa^^
^^^^tatum dissimilans concordia^ finale^ stabi^^ (...), super quo Lydi postea
per aliquod tem (...) armis insoluti sub pacis tempore voluptatibus
^ntendebant. Quod Cyrus percipiens in eos armatus subito irruit, ipsos que inde
sensibiles vin^^ns suo imperio tributarios subiugauit.
To mochel ease is nothing worth
For that sets every vice forth
And every virtue put a back
whereof price turns in to lack.
As in cronylie I may rehearse
which tells, how the king of Perse
That Lyrus hight, a war had
Against the people, which he dradde.
Of a country, which Lydos hight.
But yet for ought that he do might
As in battle upon the war
He had of hem always the war.
And when he sigh, and wist it well
That he by strength wanne no dele.
Than at last he cast a wyle
This worthy people to begyle
And took with hem a feyned pees
which should lasten endelees
So as he said in words wise,
But he thought all in other wise.
For it betyd upon the caas
when that this people in rest was
They token eses many fold,
And worlds ese as it is told
By way of kind is the noryce
Of every lust, which touches vice.
Thus when they were in lusts fall
The wars been forgeten all.
was none, which would the worship
Of arms, but in ydelshyp
They putten business away
And took hem to dance and play.
But most above all other things
They token hem to the lykynges
Of flesshely lusts, that chastity
Received was in no degree,
But every man does what him list.
And when the king of Pers it wyste
That they unto folly entenden
with his power, when they leest wenden
More sodeinly than does the thonder
He came, for ever and put hem under.
And thus has lechery lore
The land, which had be tofore
The best of hem, that were tho.
Nota qualiter facta bellica luxus infortunat. Et narrat / quod cum rex Amolech
hebrtis sibi insultantibus resistere nequit / consilio Balaam mulieres regni
sui pulcherrimas in castro hebreorum misit / qui ab ipsis contaminati sunt.
And in the bible I find also
A tale like unto this thing
How Ameleche the paynym king
when that he might by no weye
Defend his land, and put awey
The worthy people of Israel.
This sarasyn, (...) it befelle
Through the counseyle of Balaam
A rout of fair women nam
That lusty were, and of young age
And bad hem go to the lynage
Of these hebrews: and forth they went
with eyes gray, and brows bent
And well arrayed euerychone.
And when they comen were anon
Emonge thebrews was none in sight
But catch who that catch might
And each of hem his lusts sought
which after they full dear abought.
For grace anon began to fail
That when they comen to battle
Than afterward in sorry plyte
They were take and discomfyte.
So that within a little throw
The might of hem was overthrow
That whylom were wont to stand,
Till Phynees the cause on hand
Has take, this vengeance last:
But than it cesed at last.
For god was paid, of that he deed
For where he fond upon a stead
A couple, which mysferred so
Throughout he smote hem both two
And let hem lygge in men's eye
whereof oll other, which hem sye
Ensampled hem upon the deed
And prayden unto the godhede
Her old sins to amend
And he which would his mercy send
Restored hem to new grace.
Thus may it show in sundry place
Of chastity how the clennesse
Accords to the worthynesse
Of men of arms over all.
But most of all in special
This virtue to a king belongs.
For upon his fortune it hongeth
Of that his land shall speed or spylle
For thy but if a king his will
Fro lusts of his flesh restreyne
Again him self he makes a treyne.
Into the which if that he slide
Him were better go beside.
For every man may understand
How for a time that it stand
It is a sorry lust to like
whose end makes a man to syke
And tourneth joys in to sorrow.
The bright son by the morrow
Beshyneth not the derke night
The lusty yongth of man's might
In age but it stand well
Mystorneth all the last whele.
Hic loquitur qualiter principum irregulata voluptas eos a semita recta
multotiens deniare co^pellit, Et narrat exemplum de Salomone, qui ex sue carnis
concupiscentia victus, mulierum blandime^tis in sui scandalum deos alienos
colere presumebat.
That every worthy prince is hold
within him self to behold
To se the state of his person
And think, how there be joys none
Upon this earth made to last:
And how the flesh shall at last
The lusts of his life forsake:
Him ought a great ensample take
Of Solomon, whose appetite
was holly set upon delight
To take of women the plesaunce,
So that upon his ignorance
The wide world meruayleth yet
That he, which all men's wit
In thilke time has ouerpassed
with flesshly lusts was so tassed
That he which led under the law
The people of god, him self withdraw
He has fro god in such a wise
That he worship and sacrifice
For sundry love in sundry stead
Unto the false gods deed.
This was the wise Ecclesiaste
The fame of whom shall ever last
That he the mighty god forsook
Ageyn the law when he took
His wives, and his concubynes
Of hem that were sarazyns,
For which he did idolatry.
For this I read of his soty
She of Sydoyne so him ladde
That he knelende his arms spradde
To astratchen with great humblesse
which of her land was the goddess.
And she that was of Moabyte
So ferforth made him to delight
Through lust, which al his wit deuoreth
That he Thamos her god honoreth.
An other Amonyte also
with love him has assoted so
Her god Moloche that with encence
He sacreth, and does reverence
In such a wise as she him bad.
Thus was the wysest ouerlad
with blind lusts, which he sought.
But he it afterward abought.
Nota hic qualiter Achias propheta in signum, (...) regnum post mortem
Salomonie ob eius ^^^catu^ a suo herede dimineretur, pallium suum in due decim
parts scidit, vnde december parts Ie^^ (...) filio Nabal, qui regnaturus postea
successit, (...) to de^tribuit.
For Achias solenites
which was prophet, er his deces,
while he was in his lusts all
Betokens what shall after fall.
For on a day, when that he met
Jeroboam the knight he grette
And had him, that he should abide
To here what him shall betyde.
And forth withal Achyas cast
His mantell of, and also fast
He cut it in to pieces twelfe
whereof two parties unto him self
He kept, and all the remenaunt
As god has set his covenant
He took unto Ieroboas
Of Nabal which the son was,
And of the kings court a knight
And said him, such is gods might.
As thou haste seen departed here
My mantell, right in such manner
After the death of Solomon
God has ordained thereupon
This reygne than he shall deuyde
which time eke thou shall abide,
And upon that division
The reygne as in proporcion
As thou have of my mantell take,
Thou shall receive I undertake.
And thus the son shall abye
The lusts and the lechery
Of him, which now his father is,
So for to taken head of this
It sit a king well to be chaste,
For else he may lightly wast
Him self, and eke his reygne both
And that ought every king to loathe.
O which a sin violent
whereof so wise a king was shent
That he vengeance of his person
was not enough to take alone,
But afterward, when he was passed
It has his heritage lassed,
As I more openly to fore
The tale told: And thus therefore
The philosopher upon this thing
write, and counseyled to a king,
That he the forfete of luxure
Shall tempre and rule of such mesure,
which he to kind suffisaunt
And eke to reason accordaunt.
So that the lusts ignorance
Because of no mysgouernaunce
Through which that he be overthrow
As he that will no reason know.
For but a man's wit he swerued
when kind is dulyche served
It ought of reason to suffyse.
For if it fall him otherwise
He may the lusts sore dread.
For of Anthony thus I read
which of Seuerus was the son
That he his life of common won
Yaue holly unto thilke vice,
And often time he was so nyce
whereof nature her has compleyned
Unto the god, which has disceyned
The warkes which Anthony wrought
Of lust, which he fulle sore abought.
For god his forfete has so wroke
That in cronyke it is yet spoke.
But for to take rememembraunce
Of special mysgouernaunce
Through couetyse and iniustyce
Forth with the remenaunt of vice,
And namelyche of lechery
I find write a great party
within a tale, as thou shall here
which is thensample of this matere.
Hic loquit he Tarquinio Rome nuper impatore / necno^ et de eiusde^ filio noie
Arrous / qui oim vic^oru^ varietate: repleti ta^ in hoies quam in mulieres in
numer scelera perpetrarunt.
So as these old gestes seyne
The proud tyrannysshe Romeyne
Tarquinius, which was than king
And wrought many a wrongful thing.
Of sons he had many one,
Among the which Arrous was one
Lyche to his father in maneres,
So that within a few years
with treason and with tyranny
They won of land a great party
And token head of no justice,
which dew was to her office
Upon the rule of governance,
But all that ever was pleasaunce
Unto the flesshes lust, they took.
And fill so, that they undertook
A werre, which was naught acheued
But often time it had hem grieved
Again a folk, which than hight
The Gabyens, and all by night
Thus Arrous when he was at home
In Rome a preuy place he nome
within a chaumber, and hete him self
And made him wounds.x. or twelfe
Upon the back, as it was seen.
And so forth with his hurtes grene
In all the haste that he may
He rode, and came that other day
Unto Gabye the cite
And in he went: and when that he
was know, anon the yates were she^,
The lords all upon him set
with draw swerdes upon bond.
And Arrous would hem not withsto^de,
And said I am here at your will
As lefe it is that ye me spylle
As if mine own father deed.
And forth within that same stead
He prayde hem that they would se
And told hem in what degree
His father, and his brethren both
which as he said weren wroth,
Him had beten and reuyled
And out of Rome for ever exyled,
And thus he made hem to believe
And said: if that he might acheue
His purpos, it shall well be yolde
By so that they him help would.
when that the lords had seen
How woefully he was besene
They took pite of his grieve.
But yet it was hem wonder leave
That Rome him had exyled so.
The Gabyens by counseyle tho
Upon the gods made him swear
That he to hem shall troth here
And strength hem with all his might.
And they also him has behyght
To helpen him in his quarele.
They shope than for his hele
That he was bathed and anoint
Till that he was in lusty point,
And what he would than he had
That he all holle the cite lad
Right as he would him self deuyse
And tha^ he thought him in what wise
He might his tyranny show,
And took to his counseyle a shrewe
whom to his father forth he sent.
And in his message he tho went
And prayed his father for to say
By his auyse and find a wey
How they the cite might win
while he stood so well therein.
And when the messanger was come
To Rome, and has in counseyle nome
The king: it fell perchance so
That they were in a gardeyne tho
This messager forth with the king.
And when he had told the thing
In what manner that it stood:
And that Tarquinus understood
By the message, how that it ferde,
Anon he took in hand a yerde
And in the gardeyne as they gone
The lylly croppes one and one,
where that they weren sprongen out
He smote of, as they stood about:
And said unto the messengere,
Lo this thing, which I do now here
Shall be instead of thyn answer.
And in this wise as I me bear
Thou shalt unto my son tell.
And he no longer would dwell
But took his leave, and goth withal
Unto his lord, and told him all,
How that his father had do.
when Arrous herd him tell so
Anon be wist what it meant,
And thereto set all his intent
Till he through fraud and treachery
The princes heedes of Gaby
Has smyten of, and all was won,
His father came tofore the son
In to the town with the Romeyns
And took and slew the citezeyns
without reason or pite,
That he ne spares no degree.
And for the speed of his conquest
He let do make a rich feste
with a solemn sacrifice
In Phoebus temple, And in this wise
when the Romeynes assembled were
In presence of hem all there
Upon the auter when all was dyght
And that the fyres were a light
From under the auter suddenly
An hydous serpent openly
Came out, and has devoured all
The sacrifice, and eke withal
The fyres queynt: and forth anon
So as be came, so is he gone
In to the deep ground ayeyne,
And every man began to seyne:
A lord, what may this signifye?
And thereupon they pray and cry
To Phoebus, that they mighten know
The cause: and he the same throw
with ghastly voice, that all it herd
The Romans in this wise answerde
And said, how for the wyckednes
Of pride, and of vnryghtwysenes
That Tarquyne and his son has do
The sacrifice is wasted so
which might not ben acceptable
Upon such sin abhomynable.
And over that yet he hem wysseth
And says, which of hem first kysseth
His mother, he shall take wreche
Upon the wrong: and of that speech
They ben within her hertes glade
Though they outward no se^bla^ce made
There was a knight, which Brutus hight
And he with all the haste he might
To ground fill, and there he kyste
But none of hem the cause wyste
But wend that he had spourned
Perchance, and so was ouertourned.
But Brutus all an other meant
For he knew well in his intent
How therthe of every man's kind
Is mother: but they weren blind
And syghe not so far as he.
But when they leften the cite
And comen home to Rome ageyn
Than every man, which was Romeyne
And mother has, to her he bend
And kyst / and each of hem thus wend
To be the first upon the chance
Of Terquyne for to do vengeance
So as they herden Phoebus seyne.
But every time has his certain,
So must it needs than abide
Till afterward upon a tide
Hic narrat, quod cum Tarquinius in obsidione ciuitatis Ardee, vt eam
destrueret intentus fuit, Arrous filius eius Romam secreto adiens in domo
collatini hospitatus est, vbi de nocte illam castissimam dommam Lucreciam
imaginata fraud vi oppressit, vnde illa pre dolor mortuo, ipse cu^ Tarquinio
patre suo, tota clamanie Roma / imperm^ exilium delegati sunt.
Tarquinus made unskillfully
A werre, which was fast by
Ageyn a town with walls strong
which Ardea was cleped long
And cast a sege there about
That there may no man passen out.
So it befelle upon a night
Arrous, which had his souper dight
Aparte of the chyualrye
with him to suppe in company
Has bid: and when they comen were
And set at supper there
Among her other words glade
Arrous a great speaking made,
who had tho the best wise
Of Rome, and thus began a strife,
For Arrous says, he has the best.
So ianglen they withouten rest
Till at last one Collaryne
A worthy knight, and was cosyne
To Arrous, said him in this wise,
It is, quoth he, of none emprise
To speak a word, but of the deed
whereof it is to taken head.
Anon for thy this same tide
Lepe on thy horse, and let us ride,
So may we know both two
Unawarely what our wives do,
And that shall be a true assay.
This Arrous says not ones nay,
On horseback anon they lepte
In such manner and nothing slepte
Rydende forth till that they come
All pryuely within Rome
In strange place and down they light,
And take a chamber out of sight.
They be disguysed for a throw
So that no life should hem know.
And to the paleys first they sought
To se what thing these ladies wrought
Of which Arrous made a vaunt
And they bir sygh of glad semblaunt
All full of myrthes and of bordes.
But among all other words
She spoke not of her husbonde.
And when they had all understand
Of thilke place what hem list,
They gone hem forth that none it wist.
Beside thilke yate of bras
Collaces which cleped was,
where Collatyn has his dwelling
There founden they at home sitting
Lucrece his wife all enuyronned
with women, which were abandoned
To werche, and she wrought eke withal
And bad hem haste, and said it shall
Be for mine husbondes were
which with his sheld and with his spear
Lies at syege in great disese,
And if it should him not displese
Now would god, I had him here.
For certes till that I may here
Some good tydynge of his estate
My heart is ever upon debate.
For so as all men witness
He is of such an hardynesse
That he can not him self spare,
And that is all my most care,
when they the walls should assail.
But if my wysshes might avail
I would it were a groundeles pyt
By so the siege were vnknyt,
And I my husbonde sye.
with that the water in her eye
Arose, that she ne might it stop,
And as men seen the dew bedroppe
The leaves, and the flowers eke:
Right so upon her white cheke
The woeful salt teres fell.
when Collatyne has herd her tell
The meaning of her true heart,
Anon with that to her he sterte
And said: Lo my good dear
Now is he come to you here
That ye most louen as ye seyne.
And she with goodly chere again
Beclypt him in her arms small.
And the color, which erste was pale
To beauty than was restored,
So that it might not be mored.
The kings son, which was nygh
And of this lady herd and sygh
The things, as they ben befalle,
The reason of his wits all
Has lost: for love upon his part
Came than, and of his fyry darte
with such a wound him has through smite
That he must needs feel and wit
Of thilke blind malady
To which no cure of surgery
Can help, but yet netheles
At thylke time he held his pees
That he no countenance made
But openly with words glade,
So as he could in his manner
He spoke, and made frendely chere
Till it was time for to go.
And Collatyne with him also
His leave took, so that by night,
with all the baste that they might,
They ryden to the syege ageyn.
But Arous was so woe bysein
with thoughts, which upon him run
That he all by the broad son
To bed goth, not for to rest
But for to think upon the best,
And the fairest forth with all
That ever be sigh, or ever shall
So as him thought in his courage
where he portreyed her image.
First the fetures of her face
In which nature had all grace
Of womanlye beauty besette,
So that it might not be bette.
And how her yelowe here was tressed
And her atyre so well adressed.
And how she wept, all this he thought.
And how she spoke, and how she wrought
That he foryeten has no dele
But all it lyketh him so well
^^at in the word nor in deed
H^ lacked naught of womanhede.
And thus this tyrannyss be knight
was soupled, but not half aryght
For he none other head took
But that he might by sum croke
All though it were again her will,
The lusts of his flessh fulfylle,
which love was not reasonable.
For where honor is remeuable
It ought well to ben aduysed.
But he which has his lust assysed
^ith medlid love and tyranny
Has found upon his trecherye
A weye, which he thinks to hold,
And says: fortune unto the bold
Is favorable for to help.
And thus within him self to yelpe
As he which was a wild man
Upon his treason he began.
And up he sterte, and forth he went
On horsbacke, but his entente
There knew no wight, and he name
The next way, till he came
Unto Collocea the gate
Of Rome, and it was somdele late
Right even upon the son set.
And he which had shape his net
Her innocence to betrappe,
And as it should tho myshappe
As privily as ever he might
He rode, and of his horse alyght
Tofore Collatynes Inn
And all frendelyche goth him in,
As he that was cosyn of house.
And she, which is the good spouse
Lucrece, when that she him syghe
with goodly chere drew him nyghe
As she, which all honor supposes
And him, so as she dare, opposes
How it stood of her husbonde.
And he tho did her understand
with tales feyned in this wise
Right as he would him self deuyse.
whereof he might her heart glad
That she the better chere made.
when she the glad words herd
How that her husbonde ferde.
And thus the truth was deceived
with slye treson, which was received
To her, which mente all good.
For as the festes than stood
His souper was right well arrayed
But yet he has no word assayed
To speak of love in no degree.
But with covert subtylite
His frendely speches he affayteth
And as the tygre his time a wayteth
In hope for to catch his pray.
when that the bordes were aweye
And they have souped in the halle
He says, that sleep is on him fall
And prayth, he mote go to bed.
And she with all haste spedde
So as her thought it was to done
That every thing was ready sone.
She brought him to his chamber tho
And took her leave, and forth is go
In to her own chamber by,
And she that wend certeynly
Have had a friend, and had a fo
whereof fill after mochel woe.
This tyrant though he lie soft
Out of his bed aroos full often
And goes about, and leyed his ere
To harken, till that all were
To bed gone, and slepten fast.
And than upon him self he cast
A mantel, and his sword all naked
He took in hand, and she vnwaked
A bed lay: but what she met
God wot, for he the door vnshette
So privily, that none it herd,
The soft paas and forth he ferde
Into the bed, where that she slepte,
All sodeynlye and in he crepte.
And her in both his arms took,
with that this worthy wife awoke
which through tendresse of womanhed
Her voice has lost for pure dread
That one word speak she ne dare.
And eke he bade her to beware.
For if she made noise or cry
He said, his sword lay fast bye
To slay her, and her folk about.
And thus he brought her heart in doubt
That like a lamb, when it is cesed
In wolves mouth, so was disesed
Lucrece, which he naked fond
whereof she swouned in his hand
And, as who says, lay deed oppressed.
And be which all him had adressed
To lust, took than what him list
And goth his weye, that none it wist
In to his own chamber ageyn,
And cleped up his chamberleyn
And made him ready for to ride.
And thus this lecherous pride
To horse lepte, and forth he rode.
And she which in her bed abode
when that she wist he was agone
She cleped after light anon
And up aroos long er the day
And cast aweye her fresshe array,
As she which has the world forsake
And took upon the clothes black.
And ever upon continuinge
Right as men se a well spring,
with eyes full of woeful teeres
Her here hanging about her eeres
She wept, and no man wist why.
But yet among full pitouslye
She prayed, that they nolden dretche
Her husbonde for to fetch,
Forthwith her fader eke also.
Thus be they comen both two
And Brutus came with Collatyne
which to Lucrece was cosyne,
And in they wenten all three
To chamber / where they might se
The woofullest upon this molde,
which wept, as she to water should.
The chamber door anon was stoke
Er they have ought unto her spoke.
They se her clothes all disgysed
And how she has her self despised
Her here hanging vnkemte about.
But nethelesse she began to lowte
And knele unto her husbonde.
And he would feign have understand
The cause, why she fared so.
with soft words asked tho /
what may you be my good sweet?
And she, which thought her self unmeet
And the least worth of women all
Her woeful chere let down fall
For shame, and could uneaths look,
And they thereof good head took
And prayden her in all way
That she ne spare for to say
Unto her friends, what her ayleth.
why she so sore her self bewayleth
And what the soth would mean.
And she which has her sorrow grene
Her woe to tell then assayed /
But tender shame her word delayed,
That sundry times as she mente
To speak, upon the point she stente.
And they her beden ever in one
To tell forth / and there upon
when that she sygh she must need
Her tale bitwene shame and dread
She told, not without pain.
And he which would her woe restreyne
Her husbond, a sorry man
Comfort her all that he can
And swore, and eke her fader both
That they with her be not wroth
Of that is do against her will,
And prayden her to be stylle
For they to her have all foryeue.
But she which thought not to leave
Of hem will no foryeuenesse,
And said: of thilke wickedness
which was to her body wrought
All were it so she might it naught
Never afterward the world ne shall
Reprouen her: and forthwithall,
Or any man thereof be ware,
A naked sword, the which she bare
within her mantell privily,
Between her bonds suddenly
She took, and through her heart it thronge
And fill to ground, and ever among,
when that she fill, so as she might
Her clothes with her hand she right
That no man downewarde fro the knee
Should any thing of her se.
Thus lay this wife honestly
A^though she dyed woefully.
Tho was no sorrow for to seek.
Her housbande and her father eke
A ^woune upon the body fell.
There may no man's tongue tell
In which anguysshe that they were.
But Brutus, which was with hem there
^^warde him self his heart kept
And to Lucrece anon be lepte,
The bloody sword and pulls out
And swore the gods al about,
That he thereof shall do vengeance.
And ^he tho made a countenance
Her dedly eye and at last
I^ thonkynge as it were up cast,
And so beheld him in the wise
while ^he to look may suffyse.
And Brutus with a manly heart
Her husbonde has made up sterte
Forth with her father eke also
In all haste and said hem tho
That they anon without let
A bear for the body fette.
Lucrece and thereupon bledend
He leyde, and so forth out cryend
He goth unto the market place
Of Rome: and in a little space
Through cry the cite was assembled
And every man's heart trembled
when they the soth herd of the c^s,
And there upon the counseyle was
Take, of the great and of the small.
And Brutus told hem all the tale.
And thus came in to remembrance
Of sin the continuance
which Arrous had do tofore.
And eke long time er he was bore
Of that his father had do
The wrong came in to place tho
So that the comen clamor told
The new shame of sins old.
And all the town began to cry:
Awey awey the tyranny
Of lechery and couetyse.
And at last in such a wise
The father in the same while
Forth with the son they exile
And taken better governance.
But yet an other remembrance
That ryghtwysenes and lechery
Accorden not in company
with him that has the law on hand
That may a man well understand
As by a tale thou shalt wit
Of old ensample as it is write.
Hic ponit exemplum super eodem, qualiter Linius Virginius dux exercitus
Romanorum vnicam filiam pul^herrimam habens cum quodam nobili viro nomine
Ilicio, vt ipsam in vxore^ duceret finaliter concordauit. Sed interim Appius
Claudius Imperator virginis formositatem, vt eam violaret concupiscens
occasiones / quibus matrimonii impedire, ipsam que ad sui vsum apprehendere
posset, subdola conspiratione fieri coniectauit, et cum propositum sui
desiderii producti^ fa^sis testibus in Iudicio, Imperator habere debuisset:
pater tunc ibide^ presens extracio gladio filie sue pectus mortali vulnere per
medium tra^fodit, dicens malo michi de filia mea virgine^ habere mortuam, quam
in sui scandalum meretricem seruare vinentem.
At Rome when Appius
whose other name was Claudius
was governor of the cite
There fill a wonder thing to se
Touchend a gentyl maid, as thus:
whom Lyuius Virgnius
Begeten had upon his wife
Men sayden, that so fair a life
As she, was not in all the town
This fame which goth up and down
To Claudius came in his ere
whereof his thought anon was there
which all his heart has set a fire
That he began the flower desire
which longs unto maydenhede
And send, if that he might speed
The blind lusts of his will.
But that thing he might not fulfylle
For she stood upon marriage
A worthy knight of great lignage
(Ilycius which than hight)
Accorded in her faders sight
was, that he should his daughter wed.
But er the cause were fully spedde
Her fader, which in Romanye
The ledinge of the chyualrye
In governance has undertake
Upon a werre, which was take
Gothe out with all the strength he had
Of men of arms which he lad.
So was the marriage left
And stood upon accord till efte.
The king, which herd tell of this
How that this maid ordained is
To marriage, thought a another
And had thilke time a brother
which Marcus Claudius was hot,
And was a man of such riote
Right as the king him self was,
They two together upon this caas
In counceyle founden out the weye
That Marcus Claudius shall seye
How she by weye of couenaunte
To his service apurtenaunte
was holle, and to none other man.
And there upon he says he can
In every point witness take
So that she shall it not forsake.
when that they had shape so
After the law which was tho
while that her fader was absente
She was somoned and assente
To come in prsence of the king,
And stood in answer of this thing.
Her friends wysten all well
That it was falshede every dele
And comen to the king, and sayden
Upon the comune law and prayden
So as this noble worthy knight
Her father for the common right
In thylke time, as was befall
Lay for the profit of them all
Upon the wild feldes armed
That he ne should not ben harmed
Ne shamed, while that he were out.
And thus they preyden al about
For all the clamor that he herd
The king upon his lust answerde
And yaue hem only days two
Of respyte: for he wend tho
That in so short a time appear
Her fader might in no manner.
But as thereof he was deceived
For Lyuyus had all conceived
The purpos of the king tofore,
So that to Rome ayene therefore
In all have he came rydende
And left upon the field lyggende
His boost, till that he came again.
And thus this worthy capiteyne
Appeared ready at his day.
where all that ever reasone may
By law in audyence he does
So that his daughter upon soth
Of that Marcus her had accused
He has tofore the court excused.
The king, which saw his purpose fail
And that no slight might avail
Incombred of his lusts blind
The law tourneth out of kind,
And half in wrath as though it were
In presence of hem all there
Deceived of concupiscence
yaue for his brother the sentence:
And bad him, that he should cese
This maid, and make him well at ese.
But all within his own intent
He wist how that the cause went.
Of that his brother has the wit
He was him self for to wit.
But thus this maiden had wrong
which was upon the king alonge
But again him was none apele
And that the father wist well.
whereof upon the tyranny
That for the lust of lechery
His daughter should be disceyued
And that Ilicius was weyued
Untruly fro the marriage:
Right as a lion in his rage
which of no dread set account
And not what pite should amount,
A naked sword he pulled out
The which among all the rout
He threst through his daughter side,
And all aloude thus he cryde:
Lo take her there thou wrongful king
For me is lever upon this thing
To be the father of a maid
Though she be deed, than if men said
That in her life she were shamed
And I thereof were evil named.
Tho bad the king men should areste
His body, but of thilke heste
Like to the chaced wild bore
The bounds when he feleth sore
To throw, and goth forth his wey:
In such a wise for to sey
This worthy knight with swerd in ho^d
His wey made, and they him wonde
That none of hem his strokes kept,
And thus upon his horse he lepte
And with his sword droppyng al blood
which within his daughter stood,
He came there as the power was
Of Rome, and told hem all the cas:
And said hem: that they might lere
Upon the wrong of this matere
That better it were to redress
At home the great vnrightwysenesse,
Than for to war in strange place
And lose at home her own grace.
For thus stant every man's life
In ieopardye for his wife
And for his daughter, if they be
Passing an other of beauty.
Of this marvel which they sye
So apparaunt before her eye
Of that the king has him mysbore
Her oaths they have all swore
That they will stand by the right.
And thus of one accord upright
To Rome at ones home again
They torn, and shortly for to said
This tyranny came to mouth
And every man says, what he couth,
So that the preuy treachery
which set was upon lechery
Came openly to man's ere,
And that brought in the comen fere
That every man the peril dradde
Of him, that so hem ouerlad.
For they or that were worse fall
Through comen counseyle of hem all
They have her wrongful king deposed.
And hem, in whom it was supposed
The counceyle stood of his le^ynge
By law unto the dome they bring,
where they receyuen the penance
That longs to such governance.
And thus the unchaste was chastised
whereof they might ben aduysed
That should afterward govern
And by this evidence learn
How it is good a king eschew
The lust of vice, and virtue sewe.
Hic inter alia castitatis regimen concernentia loquitur / quomodo matrimonium
/ cuius status sacramentum quasi continentiam equiperans etia^ honest
delectationis regimine moderari decet, Et narrat in exe^ptu^ qualiter pro eo
quod illi septe^ viri / qui Sarre Raguelis filie magis propter concupiscentiam
quam propter matrimonium voluptuose nupserunt, vnus post alium omnes prima
nocte a demone Asmodeo sigillatim ingulati interierunt.
To make an end in this party
which touches to the policy
Of chastity in special.
As for conclusion fynall,
That every lust is to eschew
By great ensample I may argewe.
How in rages a town of Mede
There was a maid, and as I read
Sara she hight, and Raguelle
Her father was: and so befelle
Of body both and of visage
was none so fair of the lignage
To seche among hem all, as she,
whereof the rich of the cite
Of lusty folk, that couden love
Assoted were upon her love
And axen her for to wedde.
One was which at last spedde
But that was more for liking
To have his lust, than for wedding,
As he within his heart cast
which him repents at last.
For so it fell the first night
when he was to the bed ^yght
As he / which nothing god besecheth
But all only his lusts fecheth.
A bed er he was fully warm
And would have take her in his arm
Asmode, which was a fend of hell
And serves as the books tell
To tempte a man in such a wise
was ready there, and thilke emprise
which he has set upon delight
He vengeth than in such a plyte
That be his neck has writh a two.
This young wife was sorry tho
which wist nothing what it meant.
And nethelesse yet thus it went
Not only for this first man
But after right as he began
Six other of her husbondes
Asmode has take in to his hondes
So that they all a bed deyde
when they her hand toward her leyd,
Naught for the law of marriage
But for that ilke fyry rage
In which that they the law excede.
For who that would take heed
what after fill in this matere
There might be well the soth here
when she was wedded to Thoby,
And Raphael in company
Has taught him, how to be honest.
Asmode wan naught at thylke feste
And yet Thoby his will had,
For he his lust so goddely ladde
That both law and kind is served
whereof he has him self preserved
That he fill not in the sentence,
Of which an open evidence
Of this ensample a man may se
That when liking in the degree
Of marriage may forsweye,
well ought him than in other weye
Of lust to be the better aduysed.
For god the law has assysed
As well to reason as to kind,
But he the beasts would bind
Only to laws of nature,
But to the man's creature
God gave him rason forth withal
whereof that he nature shall
Upon the causes modifye
That he shall do no lechery.
And yet he shall his lusts have
So ben the laws both save
And every thing put out of sclaunder,
As whylom to king Alysaunder
The wise philosopher taught
when he his first lore caught,
Not only upon chastity
But upon all honest.
whereof a king him self may taste
How true, how large, how just, how chaste
Him ought of reason for to be
Forth with the virtue of pite.
Through which he may great tho^ke deserve
Toward his god, that he preserve
Him, and his people in all welthe
Of pees, richesse, honor, and health
Here in this world, and else eke.
My son as we tofore speak,
In shryfte, so as thou me seydest
And for thyn ese as thou me preydest
Thy love throws for to lysse
That I the would tell and wysse
The form of Aristotle's lore
I have it seyde, and somdele more
Of other ensamples, to assaye
If I thy pains might alay
Through any thing, which I can say.
Do weye my father, I you pray
Of that ye have unto me told
I thank you a thousand fold.
The tales sounden in min ere
But yet my heart is else where,
I may my self not restreyne
That I name ever in loves pain.
Such lore could I never get
which might make me foryete
O point, but if so were I slepte
That I my tides ay ne kept
To think on love, and on his law
That heart can I not withdraw.
For thy my good fader dear
Leave, and speak of my matere
Louehend of love as we begone
If that there be ought over run
Or ought foryete, or left behind
which falls unto loves kind
whereof it needs to be shryne
Now asks, so that while I live
I might amend, that is amys.
My good dear son yis
Thy ^hryfte for to make plain
The^e is yet more for to layne
Of love, which is unadvised.
But for thou shall ben well aduysed
Unto thy shryfte as it bylongeth
A point, which upon love bongeth
And is the last of all tho,
I will the tell, and than ho.

Q^^ fauet ad uiciu^ uetus haec modo regula co^fert:
^e^noue contra qui doce^ordo placet.
^^us amor dudum non dum sua lumina caepit
Quo Venus impositum deuia fallititer.
THe mighty god, which vnbegonne
Stout of him self, and has begone
Al other things at his will:
The heaven him list to fulfylle
Of all joy, where as he
Sit entronysed in his see,
And has his angels him to serve,
(Such as him lyketh to preserve:)
So that they mow naught forsweye,
But Lucyfer he put aweye
with all the route apostasyed
Of hem that been to him alyed,
which out of heaven in to hell
From angels in to fendes fell:
where that there nys no joy of light,
But more derke than any night;
The pain shall ben endelesse:
And yet of fyres netheles
There is plente; but they ben blake,
whereof no sight may be take.
Thus when the things ben byfalle,
That Lucyfers court was fall
where deedly pride hem has conveyed:
Anon forthwith it was purneyed
Through him which all things may.
He made Adam the syxte day,
In paradyse and to his make
Him lyketh Eve also to make;
And had hem crece and multiplye,
For of the man's progenye
which of the woman shall be bore,
The nombre of angels, which was lore
when they out of the bliss fell,
He thought to restore and fille
In heaven thylke holy place
which stood the void upon his grace,
But (as it is well wist and know)
Adam and Eve but a throw
(So as it should of hem betyde)
In Paradyse at thylke tide
Ne dwelten, and the cause why
write in the book of Genesye
(As who says) all men have herd,
How Raphael the fyry sword
In bond ^oke, and drove hem out
To gete^er lives fode about
Upon this woeful earth here.
Me^odre says to this matere
(As he by reuelacion
It had upon a vision;
How that Adam and Eve also
Virgins comen both two
In to the world, and were ashamed:
Till that nature has hem reclaimed
To love, and taught hem thylke lore
That first they kyste, and over more
They done, that is to kind due:
whereof they hadden fair issue.
A son was the first of all,
And Caym by name they him call:
Abel was after the second.
And (in the geste as it is found)
Nature so the cause ladde,
Two daughters eke dame Eve had:
The first cleped Calmana
was, and that other Delbora.
Thus was mankind to begin.
For thy that time it was no sin
The suster to take the brother
when that there was of chois non other.
To Caym was Calmana betake,
And Delbora has Abel take:
In whom was get natheles
Of worlds folk the first encres.
Men sein that need has no law.
And so it was by thylke dawe:
And last unto the second age,
Till that the great water rage
Of Noe (which was said the flood)
The world, which than in sin stood,
Has dreinte, out take lives eight.
Tho was mankind of little weight.
Sem, Came, Iaphet, of these three
That been the sons of Noe,
The world of man's nation
In to multiplication
was restored new again
So ferforth (as these books seyne)
That of hem three, and her issue
There was so large a retinue
Of nacyons seventy and two:
In sundry place each one of tho
The wide world have enhabyted.
But (as nature hem has excyted)
They took than little head
The brother of the suster head
To wedde wives, till it came
In to the time of Abraham
when the third age was bygonne;
The need tho was oueronne /
For there was people enough in land.
Than at first it came to bond
That systerhode of marriage
was turned in to cosynage:
So that after the right line
The cosyn weddeth the cosyne.
For Abraham er that be deyed
This charge upon his servant leyed,
To him and in this wise spoke
That he his son Isaac
Do wedde for no worlds good
But only to his own blood.
whereof the servant (as he had)
when he was deed, his son has ladde
To Bathuel, where he Rebecke
Has wedded with the white neck:
For she (he wist well and sygh)
was to the child cosyne nyghe.
And thus (as Abraham has taught)
when Isaac was god bytaught
His son Jacob did also.
And of Laban the daughters two,
which was his eme, he took to wise;
And gate upon hem in his life,
Of her first which hight Lie
Syx sons of his progenye:
And of Rachel two sons eke.
The remenaunt was for to seek,
That is to seyn of four mo*
whereof he gate on Bala two,
And of Zelpha he had eke twey.
And these twelve (as I the seye)
Through prouydence of god him self,
Ben said the Patriarchs twelfe:
Of whom as afterward befell
The tribus twelfe of Israel
Engendered were and ben the same
That of hebrwes tho hadden name.
which of Libred in alyaunce
For ever kepten thylke vsaunce
Most commonly till Christ was bore,
But afterward it was forlore
Among us that been baptized:
For of the law canonyzed
The pope has bode to the men
That none shall wedden of his kyn
Ne the second ne the thryd.
But though that holy church bid
So to restreyne marriage,
There ben yet upon loves rage
Full many of such now a day
That taken where they take may.
"For love, which is vnbeseyn
"Of all reason (as men sayn)
Through sotye, and through nycete
Of his voluptuosite,
He spares no condycion
Of kynne / ne yet relegion;
But as a cock among the hens,
Or as a stalon in the fennes
which goth among all the stood;
Rig^t so can he no more good /
But takes what thing comth next to ho^de.
My son thou shall understood
That such delight is for to blame.
For thy if thou have ben the same
^o love in any such manner,
Tell forth thereof, and shryue the here?
My fader nay (god wot the sothe)
My feyre is not in such a both:
So wild a man yet was I never
That of my kynne or leave or lever
^e lust love in such a wise.
And eke I not for what empryse
I should assote upon a nonne;
For though I had her love won,
It might into no price amounte;
So thereof set I none acounte.
ye may well ask of this and that;
But sothely (for to tell plat)
In all this world there is but one
The which my heart has over gone:
I am toward all other fre.
Full well my son now I se
Thy word stonte ever upon o place.
But yet thereof thou have a grace
That thou the might so well excuse
Of love, such as sum men use,
So as I spoke of now tofore.
For all such time of love is lore,
And like unto the bitter sweet,
For though it think a man first sweet,
He shall well felen at last
That it is sour, and may not last.
For as a morcel enuenomed:
So has such love his lust mistymed.
And great ensamples many one
A man may find thereupon.
Hic loquitur contra illos / quos Venus full de siderii feruore inflamma^e, ita
incestuosos efferit, vt neque propriis sororibus parcunt. Et narrat ex emplum
qualiter pro eo quod Gain Caligula tres sorores suas virgins coitu illicito
opressit; deus tanti sceleris peccatu^ non ferens, ipsum non solum ab impio,
sed a vita iusticia vindicem priuauit / Narrat eciam aliud exemplum super eode^
qualiter Amon filius David fatui amoris concupiscencia preuentus / sororem suam
Thamar a sue virginitatis pudicicia inuita^ deflorauit / propter quod et ipse a
fraire suo Absolon postea inte^ fectus, peccatu^ fue mortis precio inuitus
redemit.
At Rome first if we begin,
There shall I find how of this syn
An emperor was for to blame
Gaius Caligula by name,
which of his own susters three
Byreste the virgynyte.
And when he had hem so forleyn,
(As he which was all vyleyn)
He did hem out of land exyle.
But afterward within a while
God has by refte him in his y^e
His life, and eke his large empire.
And thus for lykinge of a throw
For ever his lust was overthrow.
Of this soty also I find,
Amon his suster ageyn kind
(which hight Thamar) he forleye,
But he that lust another day
Abought, when that Absolon
His own brother (there upon)
Of that be had his suster shente,
Took of that sin vengemente,
And slough him with his own hand.
And thus unkind, unkind fond.
Hic narrat qualiter Lot^ duas filias fu^^ ip^^^ co^s^encientibus carnali
copula cognouit, duas quod ex eis filios sci^^^z Moab and Amo^ progeniut:
quorum postea generatio prana et exusperans contra populu^ dei in terra saltim
promissionis vario granamine quam s^piu^ insultabat.
And for to se more of this thing,
The bible makth a knowlegynge
(whereof thou might take evidence)
Upon the sothe experyence
when Lothes wife was ouergone
And shape unto the salt stone,
(As it is spoke unto this day)
By both his daughters than he lay:
with child he made hem both great,
Till that nature hem would let
And so the cause about ladde
That each of hem a son had.
Moab the first, and the second
Amon; of which (as it is fond)
Came afterward to great encres
Two nations: and netheles
"For that the stocks were not good
"The branches myghten not ben good.
For of the false Moabytes
Forth with the strength of Amonytes,
Of that they were first mysget,
The people of god was often vpset
In Israel and in Iudee:
(As in the bible a man may se.)
Lo thus my son (as I the say)
Thou might thy self be besay
Of that thou have of other herd.
For ever yet it has so ferde
Of loves lust, if so befall
That it in other place fall
Than it is of the law set.
He which his love has so besette
Mote afterward repent him sore.
"And every man is others lore.
"Of that befyll in time er this
"The present time (which now is)
"May ben informed, how it stood;
"And take that him thynkth good,
"And leave that, which is naught so.
But for to look of time ago
How lust of love excedeth law,
It ought for to be withdraw:
For every man it should bread,
And namelyche in his syhrede,
which tourneth often to vengeance,
whereof a tale in remembrance
(which is a long process to here)
I think for to tellen here.
Omnibus est co^munis amor^ sed immoderatos
Quae facit excessus, non reputatur amans.
Sors tamen vnde Venus attractat corda videre
Quae rationis erunt, non ratione sinit.
Hic loquitur adhur contra incestuosos aniantu^ coitus / Et narrat mirabile
exemplum de magno rege Antiocho, qui vxore mortua propriam filia^ violauit; et
quia filie matrimonium penes alios impedire voluit, tale ab eo exiit edictum,
quod si quis eam in vxorem peterit, nisi quoddam problema questionis, quam ipse
rex proposuerat / veraciter solueret, capitali sentencia puniretur, super quo
veniens tandem discretus inuenis princepe Tyri Appolius questionem soluit / Nec
tamen filiam habere potuit / sed rex indignatus ipsum propter hoc in mortis
odium recoliegit. Vnde Appolinus a facie regis fugiens quam plura, prout
inferius intitula^tur, propter amore^ pericula possus est.
Of a cronyke in days gone
The which is cleped Panteone,
In loves cause I read thus.
How that the great Antiochus,
Of whom that Antioche took
His first name (as says the book):
was coupled to a noble queen,
And had a daughter hem between.
But such fortune came to hand,
"That death (which no king may withsto^d,
"But every life it mote obey)
This worthy queen took awey.
The king which made mochel moan,
Tho stood (as who says) all him one
without wife: but netheles
His daughter, whche was pereles
Of bewte, dwelt about him stylle.
"But when a man has wealth at will
"The flesh is freel, and falls often,
And that this maid tender and soft
which in her fathers chamber dwelte,
within a time wist and felt.
For liking of concupiscence
without insyght of conscience
The fader so with lusts blente,
That he cast all his holle entente
His own daughter for to spylle.
The king has leyser at his will,
with strength and when he time seye
The young maiden he forleye.
And she was tender, and full of dread,
She couth not her maydenhede
Defend; and thus she has forlore
The flower, which she has long bore.
It helps not all though she weep;
For they that should her body keep
Of women, were absent as than.
And thus this maiden goes to man:
The wild fader thus deuoureth
His own flessh, which none socoureth.
And that was cause of mochel care.
But after this unkind fare
Out of the chamber goes the king.
And she lay still, and of this thing
within her self such sorrow made:
There was no wight, that might her glad
For fere of thylke horrible vice.
with that came in the noryce
which fro chyldhode her had kept,
And asks, if she had slepte,
And why her chere was vnglad.
But she, which has been ouerlad
Of that she might not be wreke,
For shame couth vnnethis speak:
(...) nethelesse mercy she prayed
with weeping eye, and thus she said.
Alas my suster well away
That ever I sygh this ylke day.
Thing which my body first begat
In to this world, onelych that
My worlds worship has berefte.
with that she swouneth now and efte,
And ever wissheth after death,
So that welny her lacks breath.
That other (which her words herd)
In comfortynge of her answerde,
To let her faders foul desire
She wist no recoueryre.
"when thing is do, there is no bote:
"So suffren they that suffren mote.
There was none other, which it wist.
Thus has this king all that him list
Of his lykinge and his plesaunce:
And last in such a contynuance,
And such delight he took there in
Him thought that it was no syn:
And she durst him no thing withseye.
"But feign, which goes every weye
"To sundry reigns all about:
The great beute tells out
Of such a maid of bye parage:
So that for love of marriage
The worthy princes come and fend;
As they, which all honor wend,
And knew no thing, how that it stood.
The fader when he understood
That they his daughter thus besought;
with all his wit he cast and sought
How that he might find a let;
And such a statute then he set,
And in this wise his law taxes:
That what man his daughter axeth,
But if he couth his questyon
Assoyle upon suggestyon
Of certain things, that befelle,
The which he would unto him tell,
He should in certain lose his head.
And thus there were many deed /
Her heedes stondinge on the gate,
Till at last long and late
For lack of answer in this wise,
The remenaunte, that weren wise,
Eschewden to make assay.
De aduentu Appolini in Antiochiam / vbi ipse filiam regis Antiochi in vxorem
postulauit.
Till it befyl upon a day
Appollynus the prince of Tire
which has to love a great desire:
(As he which in his high mode
was lykinge of his hot blood,
A young, a fresshe, a lusty knight:)
As he lay musing on a night
Of the tydinges, which he herd,
He thought assaye how that it ferde.
He was with worthy company
Arrayed, and with good nauye
To ship he goes; the wind him drives,
And sayleth, till that he aryueth
Saufe in the port of Antyoche.
He londeth, and goes to approach
The kings court, and his presence.
Of every natural science
which any clerk him couth teache,
Him couthe enough: and in his speech
Of words he was eloquente.
And when he sygh the king present,
He prays, he mote his daughter have.
The king again began to crave;
And told him the condycyon,
How first unto his questyon
He mote answer, and fail naught:
Or with his beed it shall be bought.
And he him asks, what it was.
Question regis Antiochi: scelere vehor, materna carne vescor, quero patrem meum
matris me virum, vxoris me filium.
The king declares him the caas
with stern word and stordy chere,
To him and said in this manner.
with felony I am up bore:
I ete, and have it not forlore,
My moders flessh; whose husbond
My fader for to seche I fond,
which is the son eke of my wife:
Hereof I am inquisytyfe.
And who that can my tale save
Al quyte he shall my daughter have:
Of his answer and if he fail
He shall be deed withouten fail.
For thy my son (quod the king)
Be well aduysed of this thing
which has thy life in ieopartye.
Appollynus for his party
when he that questyon had herd;
Unto the king he has answerde,
And has reherced one and one
The points, and said thereupon.
The question, which thou have spoke
(If thou will, that it be vnloke)
It touches all the pryuyte
Between thyn own child and the,
And stonte all holle upon you two.
The king was wondre sorry tho;
And thought, if that he said it out
Then were he shamed all about.
with sly words and with fell,
He says: My son I shall the tell.
Though that thou be of little wit
It is no great marvel as yet:
Thyn age may it not suffyse.
But look well thou naught despise
Thyn own life. for of my grace
Of thrytty days full a space
I grant the, to ben aduysed.
And thus with leave and time assysed
This young prince forth he went;
And understood well what it mente
within his heart (as he was lered)
That for to make him afered
The king his time has so delayed.
whereof he drad and was amayed
Of treson that he deye should,
For he the king his southe told.
And suddenly the nyghtes tide
(That more would he naught abide)
Al pryuely his barge he hente,
And home again to Tire he went.
And in his own wit he said;
For dread if he the king bewrayed,
He knew so well the kings heart,
That death ne should he naught asterte,
The king him would so purse we.
But he that would his death eschew,
And knew all this tofore the hand:
Forsake he thought his own land,
That there would he not abide.
For well he knew that on some side
This tyrant of his felonye
By some manner of trecherye
To grieve his body will not leave.
De fuga Appollini per mare a regno suo.
For thy withouten taking leave
As priuelyche as they might
He goes him to the sea by night:
Her ships that been with whete laden
Her takyl ready tho they maden,
And haleth sail, and forth they fare.
But for to tellen of the care
That they of Tire began tho
when that they wist he was ago,
It is a pity for to here.
They losten lust, they losten chere;
They took upon hem such penance:
There was no song, there was no dau^ce:
But every myrthe and melody,
To hem was then a malady:
For unlust of that adventure
There was no man which took tonsure:
In deedly clothes they hem clothe:
The bathes and the stews both
They shyt in by every wey:
There was no life which lust pley,
Ne take of any joy keep.
But for her lyege lord to weep:
And every wight says (as he couth;)
Alas the lusty flower of youth
Our prince, our heed, our governor
Through whom we stonden in honor,
without the commune assent
That suddenly is fro us went.
Such was the clamor of hem all.
Qualiter Thaliartus miles vt Appolinum (...) ^^caret, ab Antiocho in Tirum
missus, (...) n^n inuento Antiochiam rediit.
But se we now what is befalle
Upon the first tale plain,
And turn we thereto again.
Antiochus the great sire
which full of rancour and of ire
His heart hereth (so as ye herd)
Of that this prince of Tire answerde:
He had a fellow bacheler
which was his preuy counseyler,
And Thaliart by name he hight;
The king a strong poison him dight
within a box, and gold thereto;
In all haste and bad him go
Straight unto Tire, and for no cost
Ne spare, till he had lost
The prince, which he would spylle.
And when the king has said his will,
This Taliart in a galeye
with all the haste he took his wey.
The wind is good, they seyleth blyue
Till he took land upon the ryue
Of Tire; and forth with all anon
Into the borough began to gone,
And took his inn and bode a throw.
But for he would naught be know,
Disguysed than he goth him out.
He sygh the weeping all about:
And axeth, what the cause was.
And they him told all the cas,
How suddenly the prince is go.
And when he sygh, that it was so,
And that his labor was in vein,
Anon he tourneth home again.
And to the king when he came nygh
He told of that he herd and sygh,
How that the prince of Tire is fled:
So was be come again vnsped.
The king was sorry for a while:
But when he sygh, that with no wyle
He might acheue his cruelte;
He stynt his wrath, and let him be.
Qualiter Appolinus in portu Tharsis applicuit; vbi in hospicio cuiusdam magni
viri nomine Strangulionis hospitatus est.
But over this now for to tell
Of adventures that befelle
Unto this prince, of which I told.
He has his right course forth hold
By stone and nedell, till he came
To Tharse; and there his land be nam.
A bourgeys rich of gold and fee
was thylke time in that cite
which cleped was Stranguillio,
His wife was Dionisie also.
This young prince (as says the book)
with him his herbergage took.
And it befyll that cite so
Before time, and than also,
Through strong famyn, which be^ lad,
was none, that any whete had.
Appolynus, when that he herd
The mischefe how the cite ferde;
All frelyche of his own gift
His whete among hem for to shyfte
(The which by ship he had brought)
He yaue, and took of hem right naught.
But sithen first this world began
was never yet to such a man
More joy made, than they him made.
For they were all of him so glade;
That they for ever in remembrance
Made a figure in resemblaunce
Of him, and in a common place
They set it up: so that his face
Might every manner man behold,:
So as the city was behold,
It was of ^aton over gylte.
Thus has he naught his yefte spylte.
Qualiter Hellicanus ciuis Tyri Tharsim ^entens Appollinum de insidiis
Anthiochi prenunciauit.
Upon a time with a route
This lord to pley goes him out,
And in his way of Tire he met
A man, which on his knees him grette,
And Hellican by name he hight:
which prayde his lord to have insight
Upon him self: and said him thus,
How that the great Antiochus
Awayteth, if that he might him spylle.
That other thought / and held him stylle,
And thanked him of his warning:
And bad him tell no tydynge
when he to Tire came home again,
That he in Tharse him had seyne.
Qualiter Appollinus portum Tharsis relinquens, cum ipse per mare nauigio
securiorem quesiuit, superueniente tempestate nauis cum omnibpreter ipsum solum

"Fortune has ever be muable,
"And may no while stand stable:
"For now it hyeth, now it loweth;
"Now stant upright, now overthrows;
"Now full of bliss, and now of bale.
As in the tellyng of my tale
Here afterward a man may lere:
which is great routh for to here.
This lord, which would done his best,
within him self has little rest;
And thought he would his place change
And seek a country more strange.
Of Tharsyens his leave anon
He took, and is to ship ygone.
His course he name with sail up draw:
where as fortune does the law,
And shows (as I shall rehearse)
How she was to this lord diverse,
The which upon the sea she ferketh.
The wind aroos, the wether derketh,
It blewe, and made such tempeste,
None anchor may the ship arest,
which has to broken al his gere.
The shipmen stood in such a fere,
was none that might him self bestere,
But ever awayte upon the lere
when that they shulde^ drenche at ones,
There was enough within the wones
Of wepinge / and of sorrow tho.
The young king makes mochel woe
So for to se the ship travail:
But all that might him naught avail.
The mast to brake, the sail to roof,
The ship upon the wawes droofe,
Till that they se the lands cost.
Tho made a vow the least and most,
Be so they mighten come a loud.
But (he which has the se on hand)
Neptunus would naught accord:
But all to brake cable and cord
Er they to land might approach;
The ship to claue upon a roche,
And all goth down in to the deep.
But he that all thing may keep
Unto this lord was mercyable,
And brought him save upon a table
which to the land him has vpbore:
The remenaunt was all forlore.
Thereof he made mochel moan.
Qualiter Appolinus nudus super litus iaciabatur / vbi quidam piscator ipsum
suo collobio vestiens ad vrbem Pentapolim direxit.
Thus was this young lord alone
All naked in a pour plyte.
His color, which was whylom white,
was than of water fade and pale:
And eke he was so sore a cale,
That he wist of him self no bote:
It help him no thing for to mote
To get a geyn that he has lore,
But she which has his death forlore,
Fortune (though she will not yelpe)
All suddenly has sent him help
when him thought all grace aweye.
There came a fyssher in the weye,
And sigh a man there naked stand:
And when that he has understand
The cause, he has of him great routh,
And only of his pouer troth:
Of such clothes as he had
with great pite this lord he cladde.
And he him thonketh as he should;
And says him, that it shall be yolde
If ever he get his state again:
And prayth, that he would him seyne
If nygh were any town for him.
He said ye, Pentopolym,
where both king and queen dwellen*
when he this tale herd tellen
He gladdeth him; and began beseech
That be the wey him would teache.
And he him taught: and forth he went,
And prayde god with good intent
To send him joy after his sorrow.
It was naught passed yet mydmorowe.
Qualiter Appollino Pentapolim adueniente (...) ^^gnas^ per vrbem public

Than afterward his wey he nam,
where soon upon the none he came.
He ^te such as he might get.
And forth anon when he had ete
He goth to se the town about;
And came there as he fond a rout
Of young lusty men withal.
And (as it should tho befalle)
That day was set of such assyse
That they should in the lands gyse
(As was herd of the people seye)
Her commune game than pleye.
And cried was, that they should come
Unto the game all and some
Of hem that been deliver and wight,
To do such maistry as they might.
They made hem naked (as they should)
For so that ilke game would;
And it was the custom, and use
Among hem, was no refuse.
The flower of all the town was there,
And of the court also there were;
And that was in a large place
Right even before the kings face
which Arthescates than hight:
The pley was pleyed rig^^ in his sight.
And who most worthy was of deed
Receive he should a certain mede,
And in the cite ber^ a price.
Appolynus, which ware and wise
Of every game couth an end,
He thought assay, how so it wend:
Qualiter Appollinus ludum gignasil vint^^^, in aula regis ad cenam honorifice

And fill among hem into game.
And there he wanne him such a name,
So as the king him self accounts
That he all other men surmounteth,
And bare the price above hem all.
The king bad, that in to his halle
At souper time he should be brought.
And he came than (and left it naught)
without company alone.

Of visage, and of lymmes both,
If that he had what to clothe.
At souper time netheles
The king amyddes all the pres
Let clepe him up among hem all,
And bad his marshall of his hall
To setten him in such degree
That he upon him might se.
The king was sone set and served.
And he which had his prise deserved,
After the kings own word,
was made begin a myddel board,
That both king and queen him sye.
He set, and cast about his eye,
And saw the lords in estate;
And with him self wexe in debate
Thynkende what he had lore:
And such a sorrow he took therefore,
That he sat ever stylle, and thought,
As he which of no mete rought.
Qualiter Appollinus in cena recumbens, nihil comedit, sed doloroso vultu,
submisso capite, maxim ingemescebat, qui tandem a filia regis confortatus
Citheram plectens cunctis audie^tibus / citherando vltra modum complacuit.
The king beheld his heaviness:
And of his great gentylnesse
His daughter, which was fair and good,
And at the board before him stood,
(As it was thylke time usage):
He bad to go on his message,
And fond for to make him glade.
And she did as her fader bade:
And goth to him the soft paas;
And asks whens, and what he was;
And praith he should his thought I leave.
He says, madame by your leave
My name is hot Appolynus;
And of my riches it is thus,
Upon the sea I have it lore;
The contre, where as I was bore,
where that my land is, and my rent,
I left at Tire; when that I went
The worship there, of which I ought,
Unto the god I there betought.
And thus togider as they two speak
The teeris ran down by his cheke.
The king (which thereof took good keep)
Had great pite to se him weep;
And for his daughter send ageyn,
And prayed her fair, and began to sayn
That she no longer would dretche,
But that she would anon forth fetch
Her harp, and done all that she can
To glad with that sorry man.
And she (to done her faders hest)
Her harp fet, and in the feste
Upon a chair (which they fette)
Her self next to this man she set.
with harp both and eke with mouth
To him she did, all that she couth
To make him chere; and ever he sigheth:
And she him asks, how him lyketh.
Madame certes well, he said.
But if ye the mesure played,
which (if you list) I shall you lere,
It were a glad thing for to here.
A leave sir, tho quod she,
Now take the harp, and let me se
Of what mesure that ye mean.
Tho prayth the king, tho prayth the queen
Forth with the lords all arewe
That he sum myrthe would show.
He takth the harp, and in his wise
He tempreth, and of such assyse
Synginge he harpeth forth with all,
That as a voice celestial
Hem thought it sowned in her ere
As though that it an angel were:
They gladen of his melodye.
But most of all the company
The kings daughter (which it herd;
And thought eke of that he answerde,
when that it was of her apposed)
within her heart has well supposed
That he is of great gentylnesse.
His deeds ben thereof witness
Forthwith the wisdom of his lore:
It needs not to seche more:
He might not have such manner
Of gentyl blood but if he were.
when he has harped all his fylle
(The kings hest to fulfylle;)
A weye goth disshe, a way goth cup,
Down goth the board, the cloth was up,
They risen, and gone out of halle.
Qualitur Appollinus cum rege pro filia sua erudienda retentus est.
The king his chamberleyn let call,
And bad, that he by all weye
A chamber for this man purueye
which nighe his own chamber be.
It shall be do my lord quod he.
Appollynus (of whom I mean)
Tho took his leave of king and queen,
And of the worthy maid also.
which prayed unto her fader tho,
That she might of the young man
Of tho sciences, which he can,
His lore have. And in this wise
The king her grants her apprise
So that him self thereto assent.
Thus was accorded er they went
That he with all that ever he may
This young fair fresse he may
Of that he couth should inform.
And full assented in this form
They token leave as for that night.
Qualiter filia regis Appollinum ornato apparatu vestiri fecit. Et ipse ad

And when it was on morrow right
Unto this young man of Tire,
Of clothes, and of good attire,
with gold and silver to dispende
This worthy young lady send:
And thus she made him well at ease.
And be with all that he can plese
Her serves well and fair again:
He taught her, till she was certain
Of harp, cytole, and of ryote
with many a tewne, and many a note
Upon musyke, upon measure;
And of her harp the temprure
He taught her eke, (as he well couth.)
"But (as men seyne, that frele is youth)
with leyser and contynuaunce
This maid fill upon a chance
That love has made him a quarele
Again her yongth fresshe and frele:
That (inaugre where she would or naught)
She mote with all her hertes thought
Lo love and to his law obey.
And that she shall full sore obey:
For she wot never what it is.
But ever among she feleth this,
Touching upon this man of Tire
Her heart is hot as any fire,
And otherwhyle it is a cale;
Now is she reed, now is she pale
Right after the condition
Of her imagination.
But ever (among her thoughts all)
She thought (what so may befall,
Or that she laugh or that she weep)
She would her good name keep
For fere of womannysshe shame.
But (what in ernest what in game)
She stant for love in such a plyte
That she has lost all appetyte
Of mete and drink, of nyghtes rest,
As she that note what is the best;
But for to think all her fylle
She held her often times stylle
within her chamber, and goth not out.
The king was of her life in doubt
which wist nothing what it meant.
Qualiter tres filu principu^ filia^ regis sigillat^m in vxorem suis
supplicationibus postularent.
But fill a time, as he out went
To walk, of princes sons three
There came, and fill to his knee;
And each of hem in sundry wise
Besought, and profereth his service,
So that he might his daughter have.
The king (which would her honor save)
Says, she is sick; and of that speech
Tho was no time to beseech:
But each of hem to make a bylle
He had, and write his own will,
His name, his father, and his good:
And when she wist how that it stood,
And had her bylles ouerseyne,
They shulden have answer again.
Of this counseyle they weren glad:
And written (as the king hem had)
And every man his own book
Into the kings hand betoke.
And he it to his daughter send;
And pray de her for to make an end,
And write again her own hand
Right as she in her heart fond.
Qualiter filia regis omnibus aliis relictis Appollinum in maritum preelegit.
The bylles weren well received.
But she has all her loves weyued:
And thought tho was time and space
To put her in her faders grace:
And wrote again, and thus she said.
"The shame, which is in a maid,
"with speech dare not be vnloke,
"But in writynge it may be spoke.
So write I to you fader thus;
But if I have Appollynus,
Of all this world (what so betyde)
I will non other man abide.
And certes if I of him fail,
I wot right well without fail
ye shall for me be doughterles.
This letter came, and there was prese
Tofore the king / there as he stood.
And when that he it understood
He yaue hem answer by and by:
But that was done so privily
That none of others counseyle wiste.
They took her leave, and where hem list
They went forth upon their wey.
Qualiter rex et regina in maritagium filie sue cum Appolino consencierunt.
The king ne would naught bewrey
The counceyl for no manner hye;
But suffers till be time sye.
And when that he to chamber is com
He has unto counceyl nome
This man of Tire, and let him se
The letter, and all the priuyte
The which his daughter to him sent.
And he his kne to ground bente,
And thonketh him and her also.
And er they went then a two
with good heart, and with good courage
Of full love and full marriage
The king and he be hole accorded.
And after, when it was recorded
Unto the daughter, how it stood,
The yefte of all this worlds good
Ne should have made her half so blithe.
And forth with all the king als swith
(For he woll have her good assent)
Has for the queen her mother sent.
The queen is come: and when she herd
Of this matter how that it ferde,
She sigh debate, she sigh disese
But if she would her daughter plese:
And is thereto assented full.
(which is a deed wonderful.)
For no man knew the soth cas
(But he him self) what man he was;
And nethelesse (so as hem thought)
His deeds to the soth wrought,
That he was come of gentyl blood;
Him lacks naught but worlds good.
And as thereof is no dispeyre:
For she shall be her faders heir;
And he was able to govern.
Thus will they not the love werne
Of him and her in no wise;
But all accorded they deuyse
The day and time of marriage.
"where love is lord of the courage
"Him thinks long, er that he speed.
But at last unto the deed
Qualiter Appolinus filie regis nupsit / et prima noci^ cum ea concubiens ipsam
inpregnauit.
The time is come; and (in her wise)
with great offrynge and sacryfyce
They wedde, and make a great feste;
And every thing was right honest
within house, and eke without:
It was so done, that all about
Of great worship, and great noblesse,
There cried many a man largess
Unto the lords high and loud.
The knights, that be young and proud,
They Just first, and after dance:
The day is go, the nights chance
Has derked all the bright son,
This lord (which has his love won)
Is go to bed with his wife:
where as they led a lusty life,
And that was after somdele seen.
For (as they pleyden hem between)
They get a child between hem two,
To whom fyl after mochel woe.
Qualiter ambassiatores a Tyro in quadam naui Pentapolim venientes mortem regis

Now have I told of the spousayles*
But for to speak of the meruayles
which afterward to hem befelle,
It is a wonder for to tell,
It fell a day they ryden out
The king, and queen, and all the route
To pleyen hem upon the stronde:
where as they seen toward the land
A ship saylynge of great arraye.
To know what it mean may
Til it be come they abide.
Than se they stand on every side
Endlonge the ships board to show
Of penounceals a rich rewe.
They asken, whens the ship is come:
Fro Tire anon answerde some.
And over this they sayden more:
The cause why they comen fore
was for to seche, and for to find
Appollynus, which is of kind
Her lyege lord* and he appears.
And of the tale (which he hereth)
He was right glad: for they him told
That for vengeance (as god it would)
Antiochus (as men may wit)
with thonder and lyghtning is forsmite:
His daughter has the same chance.
So ben they both in o balaunce.
For thy our lyege lord we seye
In name of all the land, and preye,
That left all other thing to done,
It like you to come sone
And se your own lyege men
with other that been of your ken,
That lyuen in longing and desire
Till ye be com again to Tire.
This tale after the king it had,
Pentapolyn all ouersprad:
There was no joy for to seche.
For every man it had in speech,
And sayden all of one accord:
A worthy king shall ben our lord:
That thought us first an beuynes
Is shape us now to great gladness.
Thus goth the tydynge over all.
Qualiter Appolino cu^ vxore sua imprlgnata (...) ve^sus Tirum nauigantibus,

But need he mote, that need shall.
Appolynus his leave took,
^o god and all the land betoke
with all the people long and broad:
That he no longer there abode*
The king and queen sorrow made:
But yet somdele they were glade
O^ such thing, as they herd tho.
And thus between the well and woe
To ship he goth, his wife with child
The which was ever meke and mylde,
And would not depart him fro:
(Such love was between hem two.)
Lichorida for her office
was take, which was a norice,
To wend with this young wife:
To whom was shape a woeful life.
within a time (as it betyd,)
when they were in the sea amyd,
Out of the north they se a cloud,
The storm arose, the wyndes loud
They blewen many a dredefull blaste,
The welken was all ouercaste,
The derke night the son has under,
There was a great tempest of thonder,
The moon, and eke the sterres both
In black clouds they hem clothe,
whereof their bright look they hyde,
This young lady wept and cryde,
To whom no comfort might avail,
Of child she began travail
where she lay in a caban close.
Her woeful lord fro her arose,
And that was long or any morrow,
So that in anguysshe and in sorrow
She was delivered all by night,
And deyde in every man's sight.
But nethelesse for all this woe
A maid child was bore tho.
Qualiter Appolinus mortem vxoris sue planxit
Appolynus when he this knew,
For sorrow a swoune he ouerthrewe
That no man wist in him no life.
And when he woke, be said: a wife,
My joy, my lust, and my desire,
My wealth, and my recouerire,
why shall I live, and thou shall dye?
Ha thou fortune I the defye,
Now have thou do to me thy werst.

That forth with her I might pass?
My pains were well the less.
In such weeping, and such cry

A thousand sithes he her kyste.

A sorrow, to his sorrow lyche.
was ever among upon the lyche.
He fill swounynge, as he that thought
His own death, which he sought
Unto the gods all above
with many a pitous word of love.
But such words as tho were,
Herd never no man's ear,
But only thilke, which he said.
The master shypman came and prayde
with other such, as ben therein,
And said; that he may nothing wyn
Again the death; but they him read
He be well ware, and take heed.
"The sea by wey of his nature
"Receive may no creature,
"within him self (as for to hold)
"The which is deed. For thy they would
(As they counseylen all about)
The deed body casten out.
For better it is (they sayden all)
That it of her so befalle,
Than if they shulden all spylle.
Qualiter suadentibus nautis corpus vxoris sue mortue in quadam cista plumbo et

The king (which understood her will,
And knew her counsel that was true)
Began again his sorrow new
with pytous heart, and thus to seye;
It is all reason that ye preye.
I am (quoth be) but one alone:
So would I not for my person,
There fell such aduersite.
But when it may no better be,
Does than thus upon my word.
Let make a coffre strong of board
That it be fyrme with leed and pytche.
Anon was made a coffer such
All ready brought unto his hand.
And when he saw, and ready fond
This coffre made, and well englued:
The deed body was besewed
In cloth of gold, and leyde therein.
And for he would unto her wyn
Upon some cost a sepulture:
Under her heed (in adventure)
Of gold he leyde sommes great,
And of jewels strong beyete
Forth with a letter, and said thus.
Copia littere capiti vxoris sue supposite.
I king of Tire Appolynus
Does all men for to wit
That here and se this letter write:
That helpeles without read
Here lies a kings daughter deed,
And who that happeth her to find
For charity take in his mind,
And do so, that she be begraue
with this treasour, which he shall have.
Thus when the letter was full spoke,
They have anon the coffre stoke,
And bounden it with iron fast,
That it may with the wawes last,
And stoppen it by such a weye
That it shall be within dreye,
So that no water might it grieve.
And thus in hope, and good believe
Of that the corpse shall well aryue,
They cast it over board as blyue.
Qualiter Appolinus, vxoris sue corpore in mare proiecto, Tyrum relinquens

The ship forth on the wawes went.
The prince has changed his intent,
And says; he will not come at Tire
As than, but all his desire
Is first to saylen unto Tharse.
The wyndy storm began to scarce,
The son aryst, the weder clereth,
The shypman, which behind stereth,
when that he saw the wyndes saught,
Toward Tharse his course he straught.
Qualiter corpus predicte defuncte super litus apud Ephesim quidam medicus

But now to my matere ageyn,
(To tell as old books seyne,)
This deed corpse (of which ye know)
with wind and was forth throw
Now here, now there; till at last
At Ephesym the sea vpcast
The coffre, and all that was therein.
Of great marvel now begin
May here, who that sytteth still.
"That god will save may not spyll.
Right as the corpse was throw a land,
There came walking upon the stronde
A worthy clerk, and surgyen,
And eke a great physicien,
Of all the land the wysest one,
which hight master Cerimone.
There were of his dysciples some.
This master is to the coffer come,
He peyseth there was somewhat in:
And had hem here it to his ynne,
And goes him self forth with all.
"All that shall fall, fall shall.
They comen home, and tarry naught:
This coffer in to his chamber is brought.
which that they find fast stoke:
But they with craft it have vnloke.
They loken in: where as they found
A body deed, which was y wound
In cloth of gold (as I said ere:)
The ^resour eke they founden there
Forthwith the letter, which they read.
And tho they token better head.
Unsown was the body soune.
As he that knew, what was to done,
This noble clerk with all haste
Began the veins for to taste;
And saw her age was of youth:
And with the crafts, which he couthe,
He sought and fond a sign of life.
with that this worthy kings wife
Honestlye they token out,
And maden fyres all about,
They leyed her on a couche soft;
And with a shete warmed often
Her cold breast began to beat /
Her derte also to flacke and beat;
This maysten has her every ioynte
with certain oil and balsam anoynte;
And put a lycour in her mouth,
which is to few clerks couthe:
So that she covers at last.
And first her eyes up she cast;
And when she more of strength caught,
Her arms both forth she straught,
Held up her hand, and pytouslye
She spoke, and said, where am I?
where is my lord, what world is this?
As she that wot not how it is.
But Cerymon the worthy leche
Answerde anon upon her speech,
And said: madame ye ben here
where ye be save, as ye shall here
Here afterward; for thy as now
My counceyl is comfort you.
For trysteth well (without fail)
There is no thing, which shall you fail
That ought of reason to be do.
Thus passen they a day or two.
Qualiter vxor Appolini sanata / domum religionis peciit / vbi sacro velamine

They speak of naught (as for an end)
Till she began somdele amend,
And wist her self, what she mente.
Tho (for to know her hole entente)
This master asks all the caas,
How she came there, and what she was.
How I came here, wot I naught
Quod she: but well I am bethought
Of other things all about
Fro point to point, and told him out
As ferforthly as she it wyste.
And he her told how in a chyste
The sea her threw upon the land,
And what tresour with her he fond,
which was all ready at her will,
As he that shope him to fulfylle
with all his might, what thing he should.
She thonketh him, that he so would;
And all her heart she discloseth,
And says him well that she supposes
Her lord be dreynt, her child also.
So saw she naught but all woe.
whereof as to the world no more
Ne will she torn, and prays therefore
That in some temple of the cite
To keep and hold her chastyte
She might among the women dwell.
when he this tale herd tell
He was right glad; and made her known
That he a daughter of his owen
Has, which he will unto her give
To serve, while they both live
Instead of that, which she has lost:
Al only at his own cost,
She shall be rendered forth with her.
She says, grant mercy leave sir,
God quyte it you, there I ne may.
And thus they drive forth the day
Till time came, that she was hole.
And tho they took her counseyle hole
To shape upon good governance,
And made a worthy purueance
Again day, when they be veiled.
And thus when that they were counseiled,
In black clothes they them cloth
The daughter and the lady both,
And yolde hem to religion.
The feste, and the profession,
After the rule of that degree
was made with great solempnite
where as Diane is sanctified.
Thus stant this lady justified
In order where she thinks to dwell.

But now ageynwarde for to tell
In what plyte that her lord stood in.
He sayleth, till that he may win The haven of Tharse (as I said ere.)
And when he was arrived there
Tho was it through the cite know;
Men might se within a throw
(As who says) all the town at ones
They come again him for the nones
To yeuen him the reverence,
So glad they were of his presence.
And though he were in his courage
Disesed, yet with glad vysage
He made hem chere; and to his inn
where he whylom soiourned in,
He goth him straught, and was received.
And wha^ the prees of people is weyued
He takes his boost unto him tho,
And says: My friend Strangulio
Lo thus, and thus it is befalle.
And thou thy self art one of all
Forthwith thy wife, which I most tryst.
For thy (if it you both list)
My daughter Thayse by your leave
I think shall with you bileue
As for a time: and thus I pray
That she be kept by all way:
And when she has of age more,
That she be set to books lore.
And this auowe to god I make,
That I shall never for her sake
My berde for no liking shave
Till it befalle, that I have
In couenable time of age
Besette her unto marriage
Thus they accord, and all is well.
And for to resten him somdele,
As for a while he there soiourneth;
And than he takes his leave, and tourneth
To ship, and goth him home to Tire:
where every man with great desire
Awayteth upon his coming.
But when the ship came in saylynge,
And perceyuen that it is he;
was never yet in no cite
Such joy made, as they tho made:
His heart also began to glade
Of that he sees his people glad.
Lo thus fortune his hap has ladde,
In sundry wise he was trauayled.
But how so ever he be assailed
His latter end shall be good.

And for to speak how that it stood
Of Thaise his daughter, where she dwells.
In Tharse (as the cronyke tells)
She was well kept, she was well looked,
She was well taught, she was well boked;
So well she sped her in her youth
That she of eury wisdom couth^
That for to seche in every land
So wise an other no man fond,
Ne so well taught at man's eye.
"But woe worth ever false envy.
For it befyll that time so

"But fame (which will ever run)
Came all day to her mothers care,
And says; where ever her daughter were
with Thaise set in any place,
The common voice, the common grace
was all upon that other maid,
And of her daughter no man said.

Her thought a thousand year till when
She might be of Thayse wreke
Of that she herd folk so speak.
And fill that ilke same tide
That deed was true Lichoryde
which had be servant to Thaise,
So that she was the wors at ease.
For she has than no seruyse
But only through this Dionyse
which was her deedly ennemy.
Through pure treason and envy
She that of all sorrow can
Tho spoke unto her bondeman
which cleped was Theophilus,
And made him swear in counseyl thus;
That he such time as she him set
Shall come Thayse for to fette,
And led her out of all sight
where that no man her help might,
Upon the stronde nygh the sea,
And there he shall this maiden slay.
This chorles heart is in a trance
As he which drad him of vengeance
when time comes an other day:
But yet durst he not say nay;
But swore, and said he should fulfill
Her bestes at her own will.

And to the bordeler her he sold.
And that he by her body would
Take advantage, let do cry
That what man would his lechery
Attempt upon her maydenhede
Lay down the gold, and he should speed.
And thus when he has cried it out
In sight of all the people about:
Qualiter Leoninus Thaisi ad lupanar destinauit, vbi dei gratia preuenta,
ipsius virginitatem nullus violare potuit.
He ladde her to the bordell tho.
No wonder though she were woe.
Clos in a chamber by her self
Each after other ten or twelfe
Of young men in to her went.
But such a grace god her sent;
That for the sorrow, which she made,
was none of hem, which power hade
To done her any vilany.
This Leonyn let ever aspye,
And wayteth after great beyete:
But all for naught: she was forlete,
That no man would there come.
when he thereof has head nome,
And knew, that she was yet a maid;
Unto his own man he said,
That he with strength again her leave,
Tho should her maydenhode bereue.
This man goth in but so it ferde
when be her woeful pleyntes herd,
And he thereof has take keep;
Him list better for to weep
Than do ought else to the game.
And thus she kept her self fro shame.
And kneled down to the earth and prayde
Unto this man, and thus she said:
If so be, that thy master would
That I his good encrees should,
It may not fall by this wey,
But suffer me to go my weye
Out of this house, where I am in,
And I shall make him for to win
In some place else of the town,
Be so it be of religiowne
where that honest women dwele.
And thus thou might thy master tell
That when I have a chamber there;
Let him do cry ay wide where
what lord, that has his daughter dear,
And is in will that she shall lere
Of such a schole that is true:
I shall her teache of things new
which that none other woman can
In all this land, and the this man
Her tale has herd, he goth ageyn,
And told unto his master pleyn,
That she has seyde, and thereupon
when that he saw beyete none
At the bordell because of her;
He had his man go and spir
A place, where she might abide:
That he may win upon some side
By that she can: but at leest
Thus was she saufe of this tempest.
Qualiter Thaisis a lupanari virgo liberata, inter sacras mulieres hospicium
habens, scie^tias, quibus edocta fuit, nobiles regni puellas ibidem edocebat.
He has her fro the bordell take:
But that was not for gods sake;
But for the lucre, as she him told.
Now comen (tho, that comen would)
Of women in her lusty youth
To here and se, what thing she couth.
She can the wisdom of a clerk,
She can of any lusty work,
which to a gentle woman longs:
And some of hem she vnderfongeth
To the cytole, and to the harp:
And whom it lyketh for to carpe
Proverbs and demaundes slye,
An other such they never sye
which that science so well taught,
whereof she great gifts caught
That she to Lyonyn has won.
And thus her name is so begone
Of sundry things, that she techeth;
That all the land to her secheth
Of young women, for to lere.
Qualiter Theophilus ad Dionisiam mane rediens affirmauit se Thaisim occidisse
super quo Dionisia vn^ cum Strangulione marito suo dolorem in publico
confingentes, exequias et sepulturam honorifice, quantum ad extra subdola
coniectatione fieri constituerunt.
Now let we this maiden here:
And speak of Dionyse again,
And of Theophyle the vyleyne,
(Of which I spoke of now tofore
when Thayse should have be forlore)
This false chorle to his lady
when he came home, all privily
He says: Madame sleyne I have
This maid Thayse, and is begraue
In preuy place, as ye me head:
For thy madame takes head
And keep counseyle, how so it stand.
This fend (which has this understood)
was glad, and weneth it be soth.
Now se hereafter how she does.
She wepeth, she cries, she co^pleyneth:
And of syckenes (which she feyneth)
She says, that Thaise suddenly
By night is deed, as she and I
To gether lain nygh my lord.
She was a woman of record,
And all is leued, that she seyth.
And for to give a more feith,
Her husbonde, and eke she both
In black clothes they hem cloth,
And make a great enterement.
And for the people shall be blent,
Of Thayse as for the remembrance
^^ter the ryall old vsaunce
A tomb of laton noble and rich
with an image unto her lyche
^^gg^nge above thereupon
They made, and set it up anon.
Her ^^itaphe of good assyse
was write about: and in this wise
It spoke, O ye that this behold,
L^ here lies she, the which was hold
The fairest, and the flower of all,
whose name Thaysis men call.
The king of Tire Appolynus
Her father was, now lies she thus.
^ourtene year she was of age
^handeth her took to his viage.
Qu^liter Appolinus in regno suo apud Tyra^ (...) parliamentum fieri constituit.
Thus was this false treason hyd,
which afterward was wide kyd,
As by the tale a man shall here,)
But (to declare my matere)
To Tire I think turn again,
And tell, (as the cronykes seyne,)
when that the king was comen home,
And has left in the salt foam
His wife (which he may not foryete;)
For he some comfort would get
He let sommone a parliament,
To which the lords weren assent,
And of the time he has been out,
He sees the things all about:
And told hem eke how he has fare
while he was out of land fare;
And prayde hem all to abide,
For he would at same tide
Do shape for his wives mind,
As he that would not be unkind.
Solemn was that ilke office,
And rich was the sacrifice,
The feast ryally was hold:
And thereto was he well behold.
For such a wife as he had one
In thylke days was there none.
Qualiter Appolinus post parliamentu^ Thasim pro Thaise filia sua querenda
adiit, qua ibide^ non inuenta abinde nauigio recessit.
wha^ this was done, the^ he him thought
Upon his daughter; and besought
Such of his lords, as he would,
That they with him to Tharse should
To set his daughter Thaise there;
And they anon all ready were.
To ship they gone; and forth they went
Till they the haven of Tharse bent,
They land; and fail of that they seche
By couerture and sleyght of speech.
This false man Strangulio
And Dionyse his wife also,
(That he the better trow might)
They ladde him to have a sight,
where that her tomb was arrayed:
The less yet he was myspayde.
And netheles (so as he durst)
He curses, and seyth all the worst
Unto fortune, as to the blind,
which can no syker wey find;
For him she neweth ever among
And medleth sorrow with his song.
But sithe it may no better be
He thonketh god, and forth goth he
Saylynge toward Tire again.
But suddenly the wind and reyne
Began upon the sea debate,
So that he suffer mote algate
Qualiter nauis Appollini ventis agitata potum urbis Mitelene in die quo festa

The law, which Neptune ordeineth.
whereof full often time he pleyneth,
And held him well the more esmayed
Of that he has tofore assayed.
So that for pure sorrow and care
Of that he sees this world so fare,
The rest he leueth of his caban;
That (for the counceyl of no man)
Again therein he nolde come:
But has beneth his place nome,
where he wepinge allone lay,
There as be saw no light of day.
And thus tofore the wynd they drive,
Till long and lat they arryue
with great distress (as it was seen)
Upon this town of Mytelene,
which was a noble cite tho.
And happens thylke time so
The lords both, and the commune
The high festes of Neptune
Upon the stronde at ryuage.
(As it was custom and usage
Solempnelych they be sight.
when they this strange vessel sygh
Com in / and has his sail aualed,
The town thereof has spoke and taled.
Qualiter Atenagoras vrbis Mitelene princeps nauim Appolini inuestigans, ipsu^

The lord, which of that cite was,
whose name is Atenagoras,
was there; and said, he would se
what ship it is, and who they be
That been therein: and after soune,
(when that he sigh it was to done)
His barge was for him arrayed,
And he goes forth, and has assayed.
He fond the ship of great array:
But what thing it a mownte may,
He sygh they maden heavy chere,
But well him thinks by the manner
That they ben worthy men of blood;
And asks of hem, how it stood.
And they him tellen all the caas,
How that her lord fordryue was,
And which a sorrow that he made,
Of which there may no man him glad.
He prays that he her lord may se.
But they him told it may not be;
For he lies in so derke a place
That there may no wight se his face.
But for all that (though hem be loathe)
He fond the ladder, and down he goes
And to him spoke, but none answer
Again of him ne might he bear
For ought that he can do er seyne,
And thus he goes him up ageyn.
Qualiter precepto principis, vt Appolinum consolaretur, Thaisis cum cithera
sua ad ipsum in obscuro nauis, vbi iacebat, producta est.
Tho was there spoke in many wise
Amongst hem, that weren wise,
Now this, now that; but at last
The wisdom of the town thus cast
That young Thayse was assent.
For if there be amendment
To glad with this woeful king,
She can so much of every thing
That she shall glad him anon.
A messager for her is gone,
And she came with her harp in hand
And said hem, that she would fond
By all the weyes, that she can,
To glad with this sorry man.
But what he was, she wist naught.
But all the ship her has besought
That she her wit on him dispende
In aunter if he might amend:
And sayn; it shall be well aquyte.
when she has vnderstonden it
She goes her down, there as he lay;
where that she harpeth many a lay,
And like an aungel song with all.
But he no more than the wall
Took head of any thing he herd.
And when she saw that he so ferde,
She falls with him unto words,
And tells him of sundry bordes,
And asks him demaundes strange.
whereof she made his heart change:
And to her speech his ere he leyde,
And has marvel, of that she said.
For in proverb, and in problem
She spoke; and had he should deem
In many a subtyle question.
But he for no suggestion
which toward him she could stere,
He would not one word answer.
But (as a mad man) at last
His heed weeping awey he cast,
And half in wrath he had her go.
But yet she would not do so,
And in the derke forth she gothe
Till she him touches and he wroth,
And after her with his hand
He smote, and thus wha^ she him fond
Disesed, courteisly she said;
E^oy my lord, I am a maid:
And if ye wist, what I am,
And out of what lynage I came,
Ye would not be so saluage.
with that he sobreth his courage,
(...) sicut deus destinauit paterfilia^ inuen (...).
And put awey his heavy chere.
(...) of hem two a man may lere
what is to be so sybbe of blood.
(...) wist of other how it stood,
And yet the father at last
His heart upon this maid cast,
A has her loves kyndely:
And yet he wist never why;
(...) all was know or that they went.
yor god wot her hole intent
Her hertes both anon discloseth.
This king unto this maid opposes,
And asks first, what is her name,
And where she learned all this game,
And of what kyn she was come.
And she that has his words nome,
Answers, and says: my name is Thayse
That was sometime well at ayse.
In Charse I was forthdrawe and fed:
There I learned, till I was spedde
Of that I can my father eke
I not where that I should him seek:
He was a king men told me.
My mother dreynt in the sea.
Fro point to point all she him told
That she has long in heart hold,
And never durst make her moan
But only to this lord allone;
To whom her heart can not hele
Turn it to woe, turn it to well,
Turn it to good, turn it to harm.
And he tho took her in his arm:
But such a joy as he tho made
was never seen thus ben they glade
That sorry hadden be toforne.
Fro this day fortune has sworn
To set him upward on the whele.
"So goth the world, now woe, now well.
Qualiter Athenagoras Appolinum de naui in hospicium honorifice recollegit, et

This king has found new grace,
So that out of his derke place,
He goth him up in to the light;
And with him came that sweet wight
His daughter Thayse and forth anon
They both into the caban gone,
which was ordained for the king;
And there he did of all his thing,
And was arrayed ryally:
And out he came all openly,
where Athenagoras be fond
which was lord of all the land.
He prays the king to come and se
His castle both, and his cite.
And thus they gone forthall in fere
This king, this lord, this maiden dear.
This lord tho made hem rich feste
with every thing, which was honest,
To plese with this worthy king:
There lacks hem no manner thing.
But yet for all his noble array
wyueles he was unto that day,
As he that yet was of young age.
So fyl there in to his courage
"The lusty woo, the glad pain
"Of love, which no man restrain
"Yet never might as now tofore.
This lord thinks all this world lore
But if the king will done him grace.
He wayteth time, he wayteth place,
Him thought his heart would to break
Till he may to this maid speak,
And to her fader eke also
For marriage, and it fyl so,
That all was done, right as he thought,
His purpos to an end he brought;
She wedded him as for her lord,
Thus ben they all of one accord.
Qualter Appolinus vna cum filia et eius marito nauim ingredie^tes a Mitilena

wha^ al was done right as they would,
The king unto his son told
Of Tharse thylke trayterye;
And said, how in his company
His daughter and him seluen eke
Shall go vengeance for to seek.
The ships were ready soune.
And when they saw it was to done,
without let of any went
with sail up draw forth they went
Toward Tharse upon the tide.
But he that wot, what shall betyde,
The hye god, which would him keep;
when that this king was fast a sleep
By nyghtes time he has him bid
To sail unto another stead,
To Ephesym he bad him draw
And (as it was that time law)
He shall do there his sacryfyce:
And eke he bad in all wise
That in the temple amongst all
His fortune, as it is befalle
Touching his daughter, and his wife,
He shall be know upon his life.
The king of this auision
Has great ymaginacion
what thing it signifye may.
And nethelesse when it was day
He bad cast anchor, and abode.
And while that he on anchor rode,
The wind, that was tofore strange,
Upon the point began to change,
And torneth thither, as it should.
Tho knew he well, that god it would:
And bad the master make him yare,
Tofore the wind for he would fare
To Ephesym; and so he deed.
And when he came in to the stead
where as he should land, he londeth;
with all the haste he may and fondeth
To shapen him in such a wise,
That he may by the morrow arise
And done after the maundement
Of him, which has him thider sent.
And in the wise that he thought
Upon the morrow so he wrought.
His daughter, and his son he nome,
And forth to the temple he come
with a great route in company,
His yeftes for to sacryfye.
The cytezeins tho herden seye
Of such a king, that came to pray
Unto Dyane the goddess:
And left all other business,
They comen thither for to se
The king and the solempnyte.

with worthy knights enuyroned
The king him self has abandoned
To the temple in good entente.
The door is up, and in he went,
where as with great devotion
Of holy contemplacion
within his heart he made his shryfte.
And after that a rich yefte
He offreth with great reverence.
And there in open audyence
Of hem that stoden all about,
He told hem, and declares out
His hap, such as him is befalle
There was no thing foryete of all.
His wife (as it was gods grace)
which was professed in the place
As she that was abbess there;
Unto his tale has leyed her ere,
She knew the voys, and the vysage:
For pure joy as in a rage
She straught to him all at ones,
And fyl a swoune upon the stones /
whereof the temple flore was paued.
She was anon with water laued
Till she came to her self again;
And than she began to seyne:
A blessed be the high sonde
That I may se my husbonde
which whylom he, and I were one.
The king with that knew her anon,
And took her in his arm, and kyst:
And all the town this sone it wist.
Tho was there joy manyfolde:
For every man this tale has told
As for miracle, and weren glade.
But never man such joy made
As does the king which has his wife.
And when men herd how that her life
was saved, and by whom it was,
They wondered all of such a cas:
Through all the land arose the speech
Of master Cerimon the leche,
And of the cure which he deed.
The king him self tho has head
(...) seek the queen forth with him
(...) ^he the town of Ephesym
(...) leave, and go where as they be:
(...) never man of his degree
Has do to hem so mychell good.
And he his profit understood,
And grants with hem for to wend.
And thus they maden there an end:
And token leave, and gone to ship
(...) had the hole felaushyp.
Qualiter Arcelinus vna cum vxore et filia (...) ^^^l^e^^t.
This king (which now has his desire)
Says he woll hold his course to Tire.
They hadden wind at will tho,
with topsayle cool, and forth they go:
And stryken never till they come
To Lyre where as they have nome,
And ^^nden hem with mochell bliss;
There was many a mouth to kiss,
Each one welcometh other home.
But when the queen to land come
And Thayse her daughter by her side,
The which joy was thylke tide
There may no man's tunge tell:
They seyden all, here comes the well
Of all womannysshe grace.
The king has take his royal place,
The queen is in to chamber go.
There was great fest arrayed tho:
when time was they gone to mete.
All old sorrows ben foryete,
And gladen hem with joys new,
The discolored pale hew
Is now become a ruddy cheke,
There was no mirth for to seek:
Qualiter Appolinus Athenagord cu^ Thase vxore sua super Tyrum coronari fecit.
But every man has what he would.
The king (as he well could and should)
Makth to his people right good chere.
And after sone (as thou shall here)
A parliament he had sommoned,
where he his daughter has coroned
Forth with the lord of Mitelene,
That one is king, that other queen.
And thus the fathers ordinance
This land has set in governance:
And said, that he would wend
To Tharse, for to make an end
Of that his daughter was betrayed.
whereof were all men well paid,
And said, how it was for to done.
The ships weren ready sone.
Qualiter Appolinus a Tyro per mare versus Tharsim iter arripiens, vindictam
co^tra Stra^gulionem et Dionisiam vxorem suam pro inuiria, qua^ ipsi ta^si

A strong power with him he took.
Upon the sky he cast his look
And sygh the wind was couenable:
They hale up ancre with the cable,
They seyle on hye, the stere on hand,
They seylen, till they come a land
At Tharse nygh to the cite.
And when they wysten it was he,
The town has done him reverence.
He tells hem the violence
which the traitor Strangulio
And Dionise him had do
Touching his daughter, (as ye herd.)
And when they wist, how it ferde,
As he which pees and love sought,
Unto the town this he besought
To done him right in judgment.
Anon they weren both assente,
with strength of men and comen sone.
And (as hem thought it was to done)
Atteyne they weren by the law,
And demed so honged and draw
And brent, and with wind to blow,
That all the world it might know.
And upon this condition
The dome in execucion
was put anon without fail.
And every man has great marvel
which herd tellen of this chance;
And thonked gods purueaunce
which does mercy forth with justice.
Slain is the mordrer, and the mordrice
Through very troth of rightwysnesse:
And through mercy save is simplesse
Of her, whom mercy preserves.
"Thus has he well, that well deserves.
Qualiter Artestrate Pe^tapolim rege mortuo, ipsi de regno epistolas super hoc

when all this thing is done and ended,
This king (which loved was and frended)
A letter has, which came to him
By ship fro Pentapolym;
In which the land has to him writ
That he would understand and wit
How in good mind and in good pees
Deed is the king Artestrates:
whereof they all of one accord
Him prayden (as her lyege lord)
That be the letter wol receive
And come, his reygne to receive
which god has give him, and fortune:
And thus besought the commune
Forthwith the great lords all.
This king sighe how it is befalle:
Fro Tharse and in prosperity
He took his leave of that cite
And goes him in to ship ayene.
The wind was good, these was pleyne,
Hem needs not a ryffe to slake
Till they Pentapolym have take.
The loud which herd of that tydinge,
was wonder glad of his cominge,
He rests him a day or two;
And took his counceyl to him tho
And set a time of parliament;
where all the land of one assente
Forthwith his wife have him croned,
where all good him was forsoned.
Lo what it is to be well grounded.
For he has first his love founded
Honestly as for to wedde,
Honestly his love he spedde,
And had children with his wife,
And as him list he led his life.
And in ensaumple his life was write
That all lovers mighten wit
How at last it shall be seen
Of love what they wolden mean.
For se now on that other side
Antiochus with all his pride
which set his love unkindly,
His end had suddenly
Set ageyn kind upon vengeance,
And for his lust has his penance.
Lo thus my son might thou ler^
what is to love in good manner,
And what to love in other wise.
"The mede aryseth of the service,
Fortune though she be not stable,
yet at sometime is favorable
To hem, that been of love true.
But certes it is for to rewe
To se love ageyn kind fall:
For that makth sore a man to fall,
(As thou might of tofore read.)
For thy my son I would the read
To let all other love a weye,
But if it be through such aweye
As love and reason would accord.
For else if that thou discord
And take lust as does a best,
Thy love may naught ben honest.
For (by no skyl that I find)
Such lust is naught of loves kind.
Confessio amantis / vnde pro finali conclusione consilium confessoris impetrat.
My fader how so that it stand
Your tale is herd, and understand.
As thing, which worthy is to here
Of great ensaumple and great matere
whereof my fader god you quyte.
But in this point my self acquyte
I may right well, that never yet
I was assoted in my wit
But only in that worthy place,
where all lust and all grace
Is set, if that Danger ne were
But that is all my most fere.
I not what ye fortune acoumpte.
But what thing Danger may amou^te
I wot well: for I have assayed.
For when mine heart is best arrayed
And I have all my wit through sought
Of love to beseech her ought
For all that ever I syke may
I am concluded with a nay.
That o syllable has over throw
A thousand words on a row
Of such as I best speak can
Thus am I but a leude man.
But fader, for ye ben a clerk
Of love, and this matere is derke
And I can ever longer the less,
(But yet I may not let it pass)
Your hole counceyl I beseech
That ye me by some weye teache,
what is my best, as for an end.
My son unto the troth wend
Now woll I for the love of the
And let all other tryfles be.
Hic super amoris causa finita confessione, (...) Genius ea / que sibi
salubrius expedi (...) consilio finaliter iniungit.
The more that the need is bye
The more it needs to be slye
To him which has the need on hand
I have well herd and understand
My son, all that thou have me seyed:
And eke of that thou have me prayed
Now at this time that I shall
As for conclusion final
Counceyl upon thy need set,
So think I finally to knette
Thy cause, there it is to broke
And make an end of that is spoke.
For I behight the that gift:
First when thou come under my shryft
That though I toward Venus were
Yet spoke I such words there
That for the presthode, which I have
Mine order, and mine estate to save
I said, I would of mine office
To virtue more than to vice
Enclyne, and teache the my lore.
For thy to speken ouermore
Of love, which the may avail.
Take love, where it may avail.
For as of this, which thou art in
By that thou see it is a sin,
And sin may no price deserve,
whithoute price and who shall serve
I note what proffyt might avail.
This follows it, if thou travail
where thou no proffyt have ne price,
Thou art toward thy self unwise
And sith thou might lust atteyne,
Of every lust the end is pain.
And every pain is good to flee,
So is it wonder thing to se,
why such a thing shall be desired
The more that a stock is fyred
The rather in to asshe it torneth.
The foot, which in the weye sporneth
Full often his head has overthrow
Thus love is blind, and can not know
where that he goes, till he be fall.
For thy but if it so befalle
with good counceyle that he be ladde
Him ought for to ben a drad.
For counceyl passes all thing
To him, which thinks to ben a king
And every man for his party
A kingdom has to iustifye.
That is to seyn his own dome.
If he misrule that kingdom
He leseth him self, that is more
Than if he lost ship and ore
And all the worlds good with all.
For what man that in special
Has not him self he has not else.
No more the perles than the shells
Al is to him of o value
Though he had all his retynewe
The wide world right as he would
when he his heart has not with hold
Toward him self, al is in vain
And thus my son I would seyne
As I said er, that thou arise
Er that thou fall in such awyse
That thou ne might thy self recover
For love which that blind was ever
Makth all his servants blind also,
My son and if thou have been so
Yet is it time to withdraw
And set thyn heart under that law
The which of reason is governed
And not of will: and to be learned
Ensaumple thou have many one
Of now and eke of time a gone,
That every lust is but a while
And who that will him self begyle
He may the rather be disceyued.
My son now thou have conceived
Somewhat of that I would mean
Here afterward it shall be seen
If that thou leave upon my lore.
For I can do to the no more
But teache the, the right weye
Now chese, if thou wylt live or deye.
Hic loquitur de controuersia, que in ter confessorem et amantem in fine
confessionis versabatur
My fader so as I have herd
Your tale, but it were answerde
I were mochel for to blame.
My woe to you is but a game,
That feleth not of that I feel.
The feeling of a man's hele
May not be lykened to the heart,
I naught though I would a sterte
And ye be fre from all the pain
Of love, whereof I me pleyne,
It is right easy to command.
The heart / which fre goes on the lau^de
Not of an ox what him eyleth,
It falls often a man merueyleth
Of that he sees another fare.
But if he knew him self the fare
And felt it, as it is in soth,
He should do right as he does
Or else wors in his degree.
For well I wot and so do ye
That love has ever yet ben used,
So mote I need ben excused.
But fader if ye would thus
Unto Cupyde and to Venus
Be friendly toward my quarele
So that my heart were in hele
Of love, which is in my breast
I wot well than a better priest
was never made to my behoue,
But all the while that I houe
In none certain between the two,
I not where I to well or woe
Shall torn: that is all my dread,
So that I not what is to read.
But for fynall conclusion
I think a supplicacion
with plain words and express
write unto Venus the goddess,
The which I pray you to bear
And bring again a good answer.
Tho was between my priest and me
Debate, and great perplexite.
My reason understood him well
And knew it was soth every dele
That he has said, but not for thy
My will has no thing set there by
For towchinge of so wise a port
It is unto love no disporte.
Yet might never man behold
Reason, where love was withholde.
They be not of o governance.
And thus we fellen in distaunce
My priest and I, but I spoke fair
And through my words debonayre
Than at last we accorden
So that he says, he will accorden
To speak, and stand on my side
To Venus both and to Cupyde,
And bad me write, what I would.
And said me truly that he should
My letter here un to the queen.
And I sat down upon the grene
Fulfilled of loves fantasy
And with the teres of mine eye
Instead of ynke, I began to write
The words, which I wol endite.
Unto Cupyde and to Venus
And in my letter I said thus.
Hic tractat formam cuiusdam supplicatio nis, quam ex part amantis per manus
Genii sa cerdotis sui, Venus sibi porrectam acceptabat.
The woeful pain of loves maladye
Ageine the which may no phisike avail
My heart has so be wapped with sotye
That where so that I rest or travail
I find it ever ready to assail
My reason, which can not him defend
The seche I help whereof I might amend
First to nature if that I me complain
There find I bow that every creature
So^time a year has love in his demayne
So that the little wrenne in his mesure
Have of kind love under his cure
And I but one desire, which I mys
So but I, has every kind his blys
The reason of my wit it ouerpasseth
Of that nature techeth me the weye
To love, and yet no certain she compasses
How shall I speed and thus between the twey
I stand, and not if I shall live or deye
For though reason ageyn my will debate
(...) ^ay not flee, that I ne love algate.
Upon my self this ilke tale come
How whilom Pan, which is the god of kind
^^th love wrestled, and is ouercom
For ever I wrestle, and ever I am behind
That I no strength in all my heart find
whereof that I may stonden any throw
So for my wit with love is overthrow
who^ needs help, he mot his help crave
Or helples he shall his need spylle
Pleinly throughout my wits al I have
But none of hem can help after my will
And also well I might sit stylle
As pray unto my lady of any help
Thus wot I not whereof my self to yelp
Unto the great Jove and if I bid
To do me grace of thilke sweet tonne
which under key, in his seller^ (...)
Lies couched, that fortune is overcome
But of the bitter cup I have bego^^^
I not how often, and thus I find no game
For ever I ask, and ever it is the same.
I se the world stand ever upon change
Now wi^des loud, now the weder soft
I may seek the great moan chaune
And thing which now is low is eft alofte
The dredful werres in to pes full often
They torn, and ever is Danger in o place
which will change his will to do me grace
But upon this the great clerk Ouyde
Of love wha^ he makth his remembrance
He says: there is the blind god Cupide
The which has love under governance
And in hand with many a fiery lance
He wondeth often, where he wol not hele
And that somdele is cause of my quarele
Ouyd eke says, that love to parforme
Sta^t in the bo^d of Venus the goddess,
But wha^ she takth cou^ceil with Saturn
There is no grace, and in that time I guess
Began my love, of which mine heuinesse
Is now and ever shall, but if I speed
So wot I not my self what is to read.
For thy to you Cupyde and Venus both
with all my hertes obeysaunce I pray
If ye were at first time wroth
when I began to love, I you say
Now stynte, and do this fortune away
So that Danger which stont of retynew
with my lady, his place may remewe
O thou Cupyde god of loves law
That with thy dart bre^ning have set a fire
My heart, do that wound bewithdraw
Or give me salve, such as I desire
For service in thy court withouten hire
To me, which ever has kept thin best
May never be to loves law honest,
O thou gentel Venus loves quen^
without gilte thou do on me thy wrech
Thou wot^^t my pein is over alich grene
For love, and yet I may i^ not ^reche
Thus would I for my last word beseech
That thou ^y love acquit, as I deserve
Or else do me plainly for to sterue.
Hic loquitur, qualiter Venus accepta amantis supplicacione, indilate ad
singula respondit.
when I this supplycacion
with good delyberacion
In such a wise as ye now wit
Had after mine entente write
Unto Cupyde and to Venus
This priest, which hight Ge^^yus
It took on bond to present,
On my message and forth he went
To Venus, for to wit her will
And I bod in the place stylle
And was there but a little while
Not full the mountaunce of a mile
when I beheld, and suddenly
I sigh where Venus stood me by.
So as I might, under a tree
To ground I fell upon knee
And preyed her for to do me grace,
She cast her chere upon my face
And as it were baluynge a game
She asks me, what was my name.
Madame I said, Johan Gower.
Now Johan, quod she, in my power
Thou must as of thy love stand
For I thy bylle have understand
In which to Cupyde and to me
Somdele thou have compleyned the
And somdele to nature also,
But that shall stand among you two,
For thereof have I not to done,
For nature is under the moon
Maystresse of every lives kind.
But if so be that she may find
Some holy man, that will withdraw
Her kyndely lust again her law,
But selde when it falls so
For few men there ben of tho.
But of these other enough there be
which of her own nycite
Ageyn nature and her office
Delyten hem in sundry vice
whereof that she full often has pleyned
And eke my court it has disdeyned
And ever shall: for it receives
None such, that kind so disceyueth.
For all onelyche of gentle love
My court stont, all courts above
And takes naught into retynewe
But thing, which is to kind dew
For else it shall be refused
whereof I hold the excused.
For it is many days gone
That thou among hem were one
which of my court have be withholde
So that the more I am behold
Of thy disease to commune
And to remewe that fortune
which many days has the grieved.
But if my counsel may be leued
Thou shall be eased or thou go
Of thilke vnsely ioly woe,
whereof thou say thyn heart is fyred.
But as of that thou have desired
After the sentence of thy bylle,
Thou must thereof done at my will
And I thereof me woll advise:
For be thou hole, it shall suffyse
My medicine is not to seek
The which is wholesome to the seek
Not all perchance as ye it would
But so as ye by reason should,
Accordaunt unto loves kind.
For in the plyte, which I the find
So as my court it has awarded
Thou shall be duly rewarded.
And if thou would more crave
It is no right that thou it have.
Qui cupit id, que habere nequit, sua tempora perdit,
Est vbi non posse velle, salute carer.
Non aestatis opus gelidis hirsuta capillos
Cum calor abcessit aequiparabit hyems.
Sicut habet maius non dat naturae decembri
Nec poterit compar floribus esse lutum.
Sic neque decrepita senum iuuenile voluptas
Floret in obsequium, quod Venus ipsa petit.
Conueniens ignur foret, vt quoth cana senectus
Attigit, vlterius corpora casta colant.
Hic co^tra quoscu^que viros inueteratos amoris co^cupiscentia^ affectantes
loquitur Venus, huiusque amantis confessi supplicationem quasi deridens, ipsum
pro eo quod senescit, debilis est, multis exhortationibus insufficientem
redarguit.
Venus which stant without law
In none certain, but as men draw
Of Ragman upon the chance
She leyth no peyse in the balance,
But as her lyketh for to weye
The true man full often awey
She put, which has her grace bid
And set an untrue in his stead.
Lo thus blyndly the world she demeth
In loves cause as to me seems,
I not what other men would seyn,
But I algate am so beseyne
and stand as one amongst all
w^^che am out of her grace fall,
^^^edeth take no witness
(...) she, which said is the goddess
(...) whether part of love it wend
Has set me for a fynall end
The point whereto that I shall hold.
F^^ when she has me well behold
^aluynge of scorn she said thus:
Thou wost well that I am Venus
which all only my lusts seche.
(...) well I wot though thou beseech
My love, lusts ben there none
which I may take in thy person.
For loves lust and locks hoar
I^ chamber accorden neuermore.
And though thou feyne a young courage
I^ shows well by thy vysage
That old grysell is no sole
There ben full many years stole,
^^to the, and such other mo
That outward feynen youth so
And ben within of poor assay.
My heart would, and I ne may
Is naught beloved now a days,
E^ thou make any such assayes
To love, and faylle upon thy fete
Better is to make a beau retrete.
For though thou myghtest love atteyne
Yet were it but an ydell pain
when thou art not suffisaunte,
To hold love his couenaunte,
For thy take home thy heart ageyn
That thou traueyle not in veyn
whereof my court may be dysceyued.
I wot, and have it well conceived
How that thy will is good enough.
But more behooves to the plough
whereof the lacks as I trow
So sit it well, that thou beknowe
Thy feeble estate er thou begin
Thing, where thou might none end win.
what bargeyn should a man assaye
when that him lacks for to pay?
My son if that thou well bethought
This touches the, foryete it naught,
The thing is turned in to was
The which was whylome grene gras
Is wethered hey, as time now
For thy my counceyl is that thou
Remember well, how thou art old.
Qualiter super derisoriam Veneris exhortacionem contristatus amans quasi
mortuus in te^ram coruit, vbi vt sibi videbatur, Cupidinem cum innumera
multitudine nuper amantum varus turmis assistenciam conspiciebat.
when Venus has her tale told
That I bethought was all about
And wist well withouten doubt
That there was no recouerire
And as a man the blase of fire
with water quenches, so ferde I,
A cold me caught suddenly
For sorrow that my heart made
My dedely face pale and fade
Becam, and swoune I fyl to ground.
And as I lay the same stounde
Ne fully quycke, ne fully deed
Me thought I saw tofore mine heed
Cupyde with his bow bente
And like unto a parliament
which were ordained for the nones
with him came all the world attones
Of gentyl folk, that whylome were
Lovers, I saw hem all there
Forth with Cupyde in sundry rowtes.
Mine eye I cast all aboutes
To know among hem who was who
I sygh where lusty yongth tho
As he which was a capteyn,
Before all other upon the pleyne
Stood with his rout well begone.
Her deeds kempt, and thereupon
Garlondes, not of one color,
Some of the lefe, some of the flower.
And some of great perles were.
The new guyse of Beme was there
with sundry things well devised
I se, whereof they be queyntysed
It was all lust, that they with ferde.
There was no song that I ne herd
which unto love was touching.
Of Pan, and all that was liking
As in pypynge of melody
was herd in thilke company
So loud, that on every side
It thought that all the heaven cryde
In such accord, and such a sown
Of humbarde, and of clariowne,
with cornemuse, and shalmele,
That it was half a man's hele
So glad a noise for to here.
And as me thought in this manner
All fresshe I sigh hem spring and dance
And do to love her entendaunce
After the lust of yongthes best
There was enough of joy and fest.
For ever among they laugh and pley
And put Care out of the weye
That he with hem ne sat ne stood.
And over this I understood
So as mine ere might areche
The most matere of her speech
De nominibus illorum nuper amantu^ qui tune amanti spasmato aliqui inuenes,
aliqui senes apparnerunt. Senes autem precipue tam erga deu^ quam deam amoris
pro sanitate amantis recupara^da multiplicatis precibus misericorditer
inflabant.
It was of knyghtode and of arms.
And what it is to lygge in arms
with love, when it is acheued
There was Tristram, which was beloved
with hele I sold: and Lancelot
Stood with Gonnor: and Galahot
with his lady: and as me thought
I saw where Jason with him brought
His love, which Creusa hight.
And Hercules, which mochell might,
was there, bearing his great mace.
And most of all in thilke place
He payneth him to make chere
with Iolen, which was him dear.
Theseus though he were untrue
To love, as all women knew,
Yet was he there netheles
with Phedra, which to love he ches,
Of greece eke there was Thelamon
which fro the king Laomedon
At Troy his daughter rest away.
Eseonen, as for his preye
which take was, when Jason came
Fro Colchos, and the cite nam
In vengeance of the first hate
That made hem after to debate
when Pryamus the new town
Has made, and in a vysiowne
Me thought that I sygh also
Hector forth with his brethren two
Him self stood with Penthasilee
And next to him I might se
where Paris stood with fair Helayne
which was his joy sovereign.
And Troylus stood with Creseyde
But ever among though he playde
By semblant he was heavy chered.
For Dyomede, as him was lered
Claymeth to be his partynere.
And thus full many a bachelere
A thousand mo than I can seyne
with yongth I sigh there well beseyne
Forth with her loves glad and blyth.
And some I sygh, which often sithe
Compleynen hem in otherwise.
Among the which I saw Narcyse,
And Pyrramus, that sorry were.
The worthy greek also was there
Achilles, which for love deyed.
Agamemnon eke as men seyed
And Menelay the king also
I sygh, with many an other mo
which hadden be fortuned sore
In loves cause: And ouermore
Of women in the same caas
with hem I sigh where Dido was
Forsake which was with Aene.
And Philis eke I might se
whom Demephon desceyued had.
And Ariadne her sorrow lad
For Theseus her sister took
And her unkindly forsook.
I sigh there eke among the prees
Compleyninge upon Hercules
His first love Deianyre
which set him afterward a fire.
Medea was there eke, and pleyneth
Upon Jason, for that he feyneth
^^^hout cause and took a new
The said, fie on all untrue.
I sygh there Deidamie
which had lost the company
Of ^^hilles, when Dyomede
(...) ^roye him set upon the need.
Among these other upon the grene
(...) also the woeful queen
^^^patras, which in a grave
(...) ^^rpentes has her self bygraue
A^^q^^cke, and so she was to tore
^or sorrow of that she had lore
A^tony, which her love has be.
And forth with her I sygh Thy she
(...) be on these harp swerdes point
(...) love deyed in sorry point.
(...) as my nere it might know
(...) ^ayde, woe worth all slow.
The pleint of Proigne and Philomene
(...) herd I what it would mean,
(...) Thereus of his untruth
^ndyd hem both, and that was routhe.
And next to hem I saw Canace
^hiche for Machayr her faders grace
^^th lost, and deyed in woeful plyte.
And as I sigh in my spyrite
The thought among other thus
The daughter of king Priamus
Pol^^ena, whom Pyrrus slough
was there, and made sorrow enough:
As she which deyed gyltles
For love, and yet was loueles.
And for to take the disporte
I saw there some of other port,
And that was Circes, and Calypse
That couthen do the moon clypse,
Of men and change the lyknesse,
Of artmagik sorceresse
They held in hand many one
To love, whether they would or none.
But above all that there were
Of women I saw four there
whose name I herd most commended.
By hem the court stood all amended.
For where they comen in presence
Men deden hem the reverence
As though they had been goddesses
Of all the world, or empresses.
And as me thought, an ere I leyde
And herd, how that these other said,
Lo these ben the four wives
whose feyth was proved in her lives
For in ensaumple of all good
with marriage so they stood
That fame, which no great thing hides
Yet in cronycke of hem abides.
Penolope that one was hot
whom many a knight has loved hot
while that her lord Vlyxes lay
Full many a year and many a day
Upon the great syege of Troy:
But she, which has no worlds joy
But only of her husbonde
while that her lord was out of land
So well she kept her womanhede
That all the world thereof took head
And namlyche of hem in Greece.
That other woman was Lucrece
wife to the Romayn Collatyne.
And she constreyned of Tarquyne
To thing, which was against her will
She would not her seluen still
But deyed only for dread of shame
In kepinge of her good name
As she which was one of the best.
The third wife was hot Alceste
which when Admetus should dye
Upon his great maladye
She prayed unto the gods so
That she resceyueth all the woe
And deyed her self, to give him life
Se where this were a noble wife.
The fourth wife, which I there sigh
I herd of hem that were nyghe
How she was cleped Alceone
which Ceix her lord allone
And to no mo her body kept
And wha^ she sygh him dre^che, she lepte
Into the wawes, where he swam
And there a se foul she becam
And with her wings she him besprad
For love that she to him had.
Lo these four weren tho
which I sigh as me thought tho
Among the great company
which love had for to gye.
But yongthe, which in special
Of loves court was marchal,
So besy was upon his lay
That he none head, where he lay
Has take, And than as I beheld
We thoughc I sigh upon the field
where Elde came a softte paas
Toward Venus, there as she was
with him great company he ladde
But not so feel as yougth had.
The most part were of great age
And that was seen in her vysage
And not for thy so as they might
They made hem yongely to the sight
But yet I herd no pypes there
To make mirth in man's ere
But the musyke I might know
For old men, which sowned low
with harp, and lute, and with cytole
The houe dance, and the carole
In such a wise as love has bid
A soft paas they dance and trede,
And with the women otherwhyle
with sobre chere among they smyle.
For laughter was there non on hye.
And netheles full well I fie
That they the more queynte it made
For love, in whom they weren glad
And there me thought I might se
The king Dauyd with Bersabe
And Solomon was not without
Passing an hundredth in a route
Of wives and of concubynes,
^ewes eke and sarazyns
To him I sight all intendaunt,
I not where he were suffy saunte.
But netheles for all his wit
He was attached with that writ
which love with his hand enseleth
From whom non erthly man appeleth
And over this, as for no wonder
with his lion, which he put under
with Dalida Sampson I knew
whose love his strength all ouerthrewe.
I saw there Arystotle also
whom that the queen of Greece also
Has brydeled, that in thilke time
She made him such a sylogesyme
That he foryate all his logyke
There was none art of his practyke
Through which it might ben excluded
That he ne was fully concluded
To love, and did his obeisance.
And eke Virgile of acquaintance
I sygh, where he the maiden prayed
which was the daughter, as men said
Of the emperor whylom of Rome.
Sorts and Plato with him come
So did O uyde the poet,
I thought than how love is sweet
which has so wise men reclamed
And was my self the less ashamed
Or for to lose or for to win
In the meschyef that I was in.
And thus I lay in hope of grace.
And when they comen to the place
where Venus stood, and I was fall
This old men with one voice all
To Venus prayden for my sake.
And she that might not forsake
So great a clamor, as was there
Let pity come in to her ere
And forth with all unto Cupyde
She prays, that he upon his side
Me would through his grace send
Some comfort, that I might amend
Upon the caas, which is befall.
And thus for me they prayden all
Of hem that weren old about
And eke some of the young route
And of gentylles and pure troth
I herd hem tell, it was great routhe
That I withouten help so ferde
And thus me thought I lay and herd
Hic tractat, qualiter Cupido amantis senectute confracti viscera perscrutans,
ignita sue co^cupisce^tie tela ab eo penitus extraxit, que^ Venus postea absque
calore percipiens / vacuum reliquit, Et sic tande^ prouisa senectus ratione^
inuocans, homine^ interiorem perprins amore infatuatum mentis sanitati before
restaurauit.
Cupyde which may hurt and hele
In loves cause, as for my hele
Upon the point which him was preyd
Came with Venus, where I was leyde
Swounend upon the grene gras
And as me thought anon there was
On every side so great prees
That every life began to prees
I wot not well how many score
Such as I spoke of now tofore
Lovers, that comen to behold
But most of hem that were old
They stoden there at thylke tide
To se what end shall be tide
Upon the cure of my soty.
Tho might I here great party
Spekende, and each his own aduys
Has told, one that, another this.
But among all this I herd
They weren woe, that I so ferde
And sayden that for no ryote
An old man should not assote.
For as they tolden redyly
There is in him no cause why,
But if he would him self be nyce,
So were he well the more nyce.
And thus desputen some of tho
And some sayden no thing so
But that the wild loves rage
In man's life forbereth none age
while there is oil for to fire
The lamp is lightly set a fire
And is full herd er it be queynte
But only if he be some seynte
which god preserves of his grace.
And thus me thought in sundry place
Of hem that walken up and down
There was diverse opynion.
And so for a while it last
Till that Cupyde to the last
Forthwith his mother full aduysed
Has determined and devised
Unto what point he wol descend
And all this time I was lyggende
Upon the ground tofore his eyes,
And they that my disese syen
Supposen naught I should live
But he, which would than give
His grace, so as it may be
This blind god, which may not se
Has groped, till that he me fond.
And as he put forth his hand
Upon my body, where I lay
Me thought a fyry launcegaye
which whilom through my heart he cast
He pulls out, and also fast
As this was do, Cupyde nam
His wey, I not where he becam
And so did all the remenaunt
which unto him was entendaunt
Of hem that in a vysyon
I had a reuelacion
So as I told now tofore.
But Venus went naught therefore
Ne Genius / which thylke time
Aboden both fast bime,
And she which may the hertes bind
In loves cause, and eke unbind,
Er I out of my trance aroos,
Venus which held a box cloos,
And would not I should deye,
Took out, more cold then any keye,
An oyntement: and in such point
She has my wounded heart anoynte,
My temples, and my reins also.
And forth with all she took me tho
A wonder myrrour for to hold,
In which she had me to behold
And take heed, of that I seye.
wherein anon my hertes eye
I cast, and saw my color fade,
Mine eyes dym, and all vnglade,
My chekes thynne, and all my face
with elde I might se deface,
So ryueled, and so woe beseyn
That there was no thingeful ne pleyn.
I saw also mine hearts hoar,
My will was tho to se no more
On which for there was no pleasaunce.
And then into my remembrance
I drew mine old days passed
And as reason it has compassed.
Quod status hominis mensibus anni equiperatur.
I made a lykenes of my selue
Unto the sundry months twelve
whereof the year in his estate
Is made, and stant upon debate,
That like to other none accords
For who the times well records,
And than at March if he begin
when that the lusty year comth in
Till that Auguste be passed and Septe^bre
The mighty yongth he may remember
In which the year has his deduite
Of grass, of lefe, of flower, of fruit
Of corn, and eke the wyny grape
And afterward the time is shape
To frost, to snow, to wind, to reyne
Till efte that March be come again.
The winter woll no summer know
The grene lefe is overthrow,
The clothed earth is than bare
Dispoyled is the summer fare,
That erst was hete, is than chele,
And thus thynkende thoughts feel
I was out of my swowne affraide,
whereof I sygh my wits strayde
And began to clepe hem home again.
And when reason it herd seyne,
That loves rage was aweye,
He came to me the right weye:
And has remeued the sotye
Of thilke unwise fantasye,
whereof that I was wont to plain,
So that of thylke fyry pain
I was made sobre, and hole enough.
Venus beheld me than, and lough
And axeth, as it were in game,
what love was? and I for shame,
Ne wist, what I should answer
And netheles I began to swear.
That by my troth, I knew him naught
So far it was out of my thought,
Right as it had never be.
My good son, tho quoth she,
Now at this time I leave it well
So goth the fortune of my whele.
For thy my counseyle is thou leave.
Madame, I said, by your leave
Ye wyten well, and so wot I
That I am vnbehouely
Your court, fro this day, for to serve.
And for I may no thonke deserve.
And also for I am refused
I pray you to ben excused.
And n^theles as for to last
while that my wits with me last
Touchende my confession
I axe an absolucion
Of Genius, er that I go.
The priest anon was ready tho
And said: Son as of thy shryfte
Thou have full pardon, and foryefte,
Foryete it thou, and so will I.
My holy father grant mercy
Quod I to him, and to the queen
I fill on knees upon the grene,
And took my leave for to wend.
But she that would make an end
As thereto, which I was most able
A pair of bedes black as sable
She took, and hynge my neck about.
Upon the gaudees all without
was write of gold, pur reposer
Lo thus she said, John^ Gower
Now thou art at last cast
Thus have I for thyn ease cast
That thou of love no more seche.
But my will is, that thou beseech
And pray hereafter for the pees,
And that thou make a pleyne relees
To love, which takes little head
Of old men upon the need,
when that the lusts ben awey,
For thy to the nys but o wey
In which let reason be thy guide.
For he may sone him self mysgyde,
That sees not the peril tofore.
My son be well ware therefore,
And keep the sentence of my lore,
And tarry thou my court no more:
But go there virtue moral dwells.
There ben thy books, as men tells
which of long time thou haste write.
For this I do the well to wit
If thou thyn hele will purchase,
Thou might not make suit and chase
where that the game is not prouable,
It were a thing unreasonable
A man to be so ouersaye.
For thy take heed of that I say.
For in the law of my commune
we be naught shape to commune
Thy self and I never after this.
Now have I seyde all that there is
Of love, as for thy fynall end
^dewe, for I mote fro the wend.
And great well Chaucer, when ye mete
As my discyple and my poet.
^or in the flowers of his youth
In sundry wise, as he well couth
(...) ^^ces, and of songs glade,
The which he for my sake made,
(...) ^onde fulfilled is over all
whereof to him in special
Above all other I am most hold.
For thy now in his days old
^hou shall him tell this message,
That ^e upon his latter age
To ^ette an end of all his work,
As he which is mine own clerk
To make his testament of love,
As thou have done thy shryfte above
So that my court it may record.
^radame I can me well accord
(...) I, to tell as ye me bydde.
(...) with that word it so betydde
(...) of sight all suddenly
Enclosed in a sterred sky,
Venus, which is the queen of love,
was take in to her place above,
More wist I not where she becam.
And thus my leave of her I nam.
And forth with all that same tide
Her priest, which would not abide
C^^me be lefe or me be loathe
Out of my sight forth be goth.
And I was left withouten help,
So wist I not whereof to yelpe
But that only I had lore
My time, and was sorry therefore.
And thus bewhaped in my thought
when all was turned in to naught
I stood amassed for a while,
And in my self I began to smyle,
Thynkende upon the bedes blake
And how they were me betake
For that I should bid and pray.
And when I saw none other way
But only that I was refused,
Unto the life, which I had used
I thought never torn again.
And in this wise soth to seyne
Homwarde a soft pas I went
where that with all mine hole intent
Upon the point, that I am shryue
I think bydde, while I live.
Parce precor Christ, populus quo gaudeat iste
Anglia ne triste subeat rex sum refiste
Corrige quosque status fragiles absolve reatus:
Vnde deo gratus vigeat locus iste beatus.
He which within days seven
This large world, forth with the heaven
Of his eternal prouydence
Has made, and thilke intelligence
In man's soul reasonable
Has shape to be perdurable:
whereof the man of his feture
Above all erthly creature
After the soul is immortal,
To thilke lord in special,
As he which is of all things,
The creator, and of the kings
Has the fortunes upon hand,
His grace and mercy for to fond
Upon my bare knees I pray
That he this land in syker way
will set upon good governance.
For if men take in remembrance
what is to live in unite,
There is no state in his degree
That ne ought to desire pes
without which it is no les
To seche and look in to the last
There may no worlds joy last.
First for to look the clergy,
Hem ought well to iustifye
Thing, which belongs to their cure,
As for to pray, and to procure
Our pees, toward the heaven above,
And eke to set rest and love
Among us on this earth here.
For if they wrought in this manner
After the rule of charity,
I hope that men shulden se
This land amend: and over this
To seche and look how that is
Touchende of the chiualrye
which for to look in some party
Is worthy for to be commended
And in some part to be amended,
That of her large retenue
The land is full of mayntenue,
which causes that the common right.
In few countries stont upright.
Extorcion, contecke, rauyne
with hold ben of that couyne.
All day men here great compleynt
Of the disease, of the constreynt,
whereof the people is sore oppressed
God grant it mote be redressed.
For of knyghthode thordre would
That they defend and keep should
The common right, and the fraunchise
Of holy church in all wise:
So that no wicked man it dear,
And thereof serves shield and spear.
But for it goth now other way
Our grace goth the more aweye.
And for to loken ouermore
whereof the people pleynen sore
Toward the laws of our land
Me^ sein, that troth has broke his bo^d
And with brocage is gone aweye,
So that no man se the weye
where, for to find ryghtwysenesse.
And if men seek sykernesse
Upon the lucre of marchandye
Compassement and trecherye
Of synguler profit to win
Men said is cause of mochel sin,
And namely of diuysion,
which many a noble worthy town
Fro wealth, and fro prosperity
Has brought to great aduersite.
So were it good to be all one
For mochell grace thereupon
Unto the citees should fall,
which might avail to us all.
If these estates amended were
So that the virtues stoden there,
And that the vices were aweye
Me thinks I durst than seye
This lands grace should arise.
But yet to look in otherwise
There is astate, as ye shall here,
Above all other on earth here,
which has the land in his balaunce,
To him belongs the lygeaunce
Of clerk, of knight, of man of law
Under his hand is all forth draw
The merchant and the laborer,
So stant it all in his power
Or for to spylle, or for to save,
But though that he such power have
And that his myghtes ben so large,
He has hem naught withoute^ charge,
To which that every king is swore.
So were it good, that he therefore
First unto ryghtwysenes entende,
whereof that he him self amend
Toward his god, and leave vice,
which is the chief of his office.
And after all the remenaunt
He shall upon his covenant
Govern, and led in such a wise,
So that there be no tyrannyse,
whereof that he his people grieve:
Or else may he naught acheue
That longs to his regalye.
For if a king will iustifye
His land, and hem that been within,
First at him self he mote begin
To keep and rule his own estate,
That in him self be no debate
Toward his god: for otherwise
There may none erthly king suffyse
Of his kyngedome the folk to lead,
But he the king of heaven dread.
For what king set him upon pride,
And takth his lust on every side,
And will not go the right weyt,
Though god his grace cast aweye
No wonder is, for at last
He shall well wit, it may not last
The pomp which he secheth here.
But what king that with humble chere
After the law of god escheweth
The vices, and the virtues seweth:
His grace shall be suffysaunt
To govern all the remenaunt
which longs to his duete.
So that in his prosperyte
The people shall not be oppressed
whereof his name shall be blessed
For ever: and be memoryalle.

And now to speak as in fynalle
To ^chende that I undertook
In english for to make a book
which stant between ernest and game,
I have it made, as thylke same
which ask for to be excused,
An^ that my book be not refused
Of ^^red men, when they it se
For lack of curyosyte.
For thylke scole of eloquence
Belongs not to my science
Upon the form of Rhetorike
My words for to peynte and pyke
As Tullius sometime wrote,
^ut this I know, and this I wot,
That I have done my true pain
^^to rude words, and with pleyne
In all that ever I couthe and might,
This book to write, as I behyght.
So as sikenes it suffer would,
And also for my days old
That I am feeble and impotente
I wot not how the world is went.
So pray I to my lords all
Now in min age / how so befalle
That I mot stonden in their grace.
For though me lack to purchase
Her worthy thonke, as by deserte*
Yet the symplesse of my pouerte
Desires for to do plesaunce
To hem, under whose governance
I hope syker to abide.
But now upon my last tide
That I this book have made and writ
My muse does me for to wit
And says, it shall be for my best
Fro this day forth to take rest,
That I no more of love make,
which many a heart has overtake
And ouertorned as the blind
Fro reason in to law of kind.
where as the wisdom goes aweye
And can not se the right weye,
How to govern his own estate:
But every day stante in debate
within him self, and can not leave.
And thus for thy my fynal leave
I take now for evermore
without making any more
Of love, and of his dedely bele,
which no physicien can hele.
For his nature is so diverse
That it has ever some trauers
Or of to much / or of to lyte,
That plainly may no man delight,
But if him fail or that or this,
But thylke love which that is
within a man's heart affirmed
And stante of charity confirmed:
Such love is goodly for to have,
Such love may the body save,
Such love may the soul amend,
The high god such love us send
Forthwith the remenaunt of grace,
So that above in thilke place
where rests love / and all pees
Our joy may be endelees.
AMEN. Thus ends De confessione Amantis.
