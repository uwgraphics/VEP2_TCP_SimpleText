The court of sapyence



Here begins the proheme of this present book.
THe laborous and the most meruaylous works
Of sapyence sith first reigned nature
My purpose is to tell as written clerks
And specially her most notable cure
In my first book I will preche and depure
It is so pleasant unto each person
That it a book shall occupye alone
Soon after this I shall wisdom descryue
Her blessed household / and her dwelling place
And than return unto her acts blyue
And she them wrought by time / process and space
All this matter she taught me of her grace
I spoke with her / as ye may here and read
For in my dreme I met her in a mede
O clyo lady most facundyous
O rauysshynge delight of eloquence
O gylted gods gaye and glorious
Enspyred with the percynge influence
Of delycate heavenly complacence
Within my mouth let dystyll of thy shoures
And forge my tongue to glad mine audytoures
Mine ignorance whom clouded has eclyppes
With thy pure bemes illumynyne all about
Thy blessed brethe let retleyre in my lyppes
And with the dew of heaven thou them degoute
So that my mouth may blow and encense out
The redolent dulcour aromatyke
Of thy depured lusty rethoryke
I know my self most naked in allactes
My common vulgar eke most interupte
And I conuersaunte and borne in the parts
Where my natyfe langage is most corrupt
And with most sundry tongues myxte and rupte
O lady mine wherefore I the beseech
My muse amend / dress / forge / mynysshe and each
For to all makers here I me excuse
That I ne can delycately endyte
Rude is the speech of force / which I must use
Such unfortunate my natyfe birth may wit
But O ye lords which have your delight
In terms gaye / and ben most eloquent
This book to you no pleasaunce may present
But netheles as tasted bytternesse
All sweet thing makes be more precious
So shall my book extend the goodlynesse
Of other auctoures which ben glorious
And make their writing delycyous
I simple shall extol their soueraynte
And my rudenes shall show their subtylyte
Gower chaucers erthly gods two
Of thyrste of eloquent delycacye
With all your successors few or moo
Fragraunt in speech / expert in poetrye
You ne yet them in no point I envy
Exyled as far I am from your glory
As night from day / or death from vyctorye
I you honor / bliss / love / and gloryfye
And to whose presence my book shall attain
His hastyle dome I pray him modefye
And not detraye / ne have it in dysdayne
For I purpose no making for to dystayne
Meke heart / good tongue / and spyryte pacyent
Who has these three / my book I him present
And as him list let him detraye or add
For sith I am constrained for to write
By my sovereign / and have a matter glad
And can not please paynte enourne ne endyte
Let ignorance and chyldhode have the wit
I ask no more / but god of his mercy
My book conferme from sclaunder and envy
Explicit prohenium.
ALl besy swymmynge in the stormy flode
Of fruyteles worldly medytacyon
To purpose late no thing seemed so good
As to tell youth has domynacyon
And for to put in sequestracyon
Each other thing that him should cause unrest
And thus to bed I went with thought my gest
The chesplayer / or he a man have drawn
Has only thought to make good purueyaunce
For king or queen / aulfyn / knight / or pawn
Echone of these he has in his remembrance
So each estate and worldly governance
In one escheker in my mind I saw
But I ne wist what draught was best to draw
First my desire was to have drawn my king
At hertes lust in sure prosperyte
But in the che^^e I had espied (...)
The king to purpose may not pass his see
To make him way / or some pawn drawn be
Than both to guide the king and pawnes eke
And all other my wits were to seek
I thought how by moral phylosophye
The chesse was found / and set in dyuersyte
Of draught for a myrrour of polocye
The which virtue departed is in three
First must man con himself rule in degree
Efte his household / and than in vnyuerse
Cite and reygne / these ben the three diverse
Arystotell in his poletyke book
The first of these says hight monestyca
The second part / who has lust to look
Of polycy hight yconomica
The third party is cleped poletica
But of all these sith I had never scole
To play at chesse I me thought but a fool
For in this board escheker of my mind
As I first put a man or to draw a draught
First come the world with dame fortune unkind
And said eschecke / and so strongly they faught
Against me that all my men were caught
With their escheckes so touch they each estate
That or I wist / suddenly I was mate
Than came reason / and thus to me she said
With moble fortune / and falls worldlynesse
O fool of foles / have thou thy wit assayd
With envy man to country them at chesse
Thou may not find a point of sykernesse
For in their draught all deceyte is include
Go forth quod she / a fool I the conclude
Than was I woo / and prayed a bone
To teache me way unto dame sapyence
That she might learn me some dyscrecyone
For well I know my propre neclygence
Mine ignorance / mine insuffycence
Far from all help / for which I began to weep
Whiles at the last I fell upon a sleep
Thus brought on sleep / my spyryte forth began pass
And brought I was me thought in a place deserte
In wyldernes / but I nyst where I was
In much derkenes / in caves / in much couerte
With wild beestes in devouring expert
Now wood / now water / now hill / now valaye
Now wind / now rain / I knew no way
The wild wolves after me sewen fast
I would flee them / but well flee I ne might
And of a way I was ware at the last
Thorny and strayte encomerous to the sight
Thither I went / I was ware of a light
But forth I thronge with thorns all to rent
And thanked god of light which he had sent
Out from a mede most heavenly unto look
About which ran a lusty river sweet
A lady came / and two with her she took
I ran to her / and lowly began her great
The waters name asked I / she said quyete
And sone she said / my name is sapyence
Intellygence this hight / and this science
Unto all virtues we ben ladies three
Both in office / and degree dyfferent
It is my part to know dyuynyte
My sister here has knowledge dylygent
Of creatures in heaven and earth content
And dame science of things temporal
Has knowledge pure / thus may you know us all
Of us all three I am the most sovereign
And if the list me descryue and dyffyne
I am the true propre knowledge certain
Of erthly thing / and eke of thing dyuyne
Aye fresshe and grene / and lusty is heart mine
Though I seem young / full old my years been
For sapyence in old folk is aye seen
The deserte place of fere / through which thou come
Is dredefull worldly occupacyon
Sone leave that place and dwell with me at home
Thou shalt have wit / lust / delectacyon
Grace / help / life / hele / and eterne salvation
Now will I rest that trauayled have all day
For my labor is brought all unto play
Glad was I tho / and on knee fell a down
Held up mine hands / and said I would full feign
Her servant be with all subgeccyowne
But lady mine maystres / and hole sovereign
Quod I tell me your labor and your pain
That ye so long have had / I will said she
Give audyence the gladder shalt thou be
A doutfull prince most mighty and most dygne
(...) excellent and most vyctoryous
Having a sone and four daughters benygne
And a servant which with affectuous
Love and desire he cherysshed in his house
A commandment gave his servant in certain
The which he brake / and death should be his pain
Four tourmentours the king cleped to him
Badde one him to put in prison sour
An other should quycke fley him lyth and lym
The third kill him / the fourth should hy^ devour
The four daughters herd tell of this rumoure
Whose names ben mercy / troth / right / and peace
But mercy thought her faders Ire to ceas
She looked down in to the prison deep
Her loved servant saw she sitting there
For whom her heart began both blede and weep
Dystyllynge teres dysteyned all her chere
She began unlace her tressed sonnysshe here
Naked her breast / and for compassyoun
Before her fader on knees fell a down
O merciful / and o most mercyable
King of kings / and fader of pity
Whose mighty mercy is immesurable
O prince eterne / O benygne lord quod she
To whom mercy is given of properte
Of thy servant that lies in prison bound
Have thou mercy or death mine heart will wound
I am sovereign above thy works all
I am the pure auaunt of thy godhede
I am thy child / thy ge^me celestyall
The mynyster of all thy godlyhede
The substance that all mankind does feed
I am the treasour of thy deite
O prince of peace my bone now grant thou me
Se how I sytte dyssheuelde on knee
My crystal eyes / se how their teres rain
My rosy lyppes / se how they perced be
The bemed chere eke of my chekes twain
Se how the tery river does dystayne
My swannysshe throat with syghes in dystraynte
My breast forbette / se fader all is faynte
And if thou will grant me yon prysonere
And give me leave to lose him out of pain
All this dystresse / and all this mine heavy chere
To gladness thou might me restore again
Thy high vengeance / why should you not restrain
And show mercy sith he is penytent
With that came troth / and asked what it meant
To troth than spoke her fader reverent
And said a servant which I loved best
On pain of death I gave a commandment
Which for to keep in him was all my trest
But he it brake / and as a proud traitor kest
Me to supplaunt / and I made my behest
For his trespass he should dye at the lest
My daughter mercy prays with voice pyteous
I would forgive / and on him have pity
For sith my mercy is most copyous
I must it show / thus argues she to me
Nay nay quod troth / fader it may not be
Thou must of force observe thyn own statute
And thy promise fulfill for every fute
Think that I am thy daughter veryte
That of all troth does execucyon
Withouten whom thyn eterne deite
Were vnyat with imperfeccyon
Thy will is law / thy promise is reason
And sith thy will / and thy promise also
Was he should dye thou may not go therfro
For thy godlyhede put out all varyaunce
Stable thy sentence / and thy Just Judgment
Let execute in deed the same penance
That was forbroken of thy commandment
Than said mercy / unworthy is that assent
For sauns doubt every reasonable creature
Without mercy may not live ne endure
Know ye not well that I am sempyterne
Quod mercy tho / how may ye me refrain
I am lady above the heaven superne
Though ye in earth be pryncesse and sovereign
My mighty grace is never void ne vain
Ergo I must releue servant penytent
Save fro the death assoyle this argument
Right sensyble and preygnaunt for your part
Is that strong argument quod veryte
But to dyspute / mercy is not mine art
Neither in herne ne in hole / troth longs to me
And permanent I am as well as ye
And sith of force my fader must be true
From his behest / how may ye him remewe
And if ye think he break not his behest
For to permute with mercy his vengeance
For one is god / than would ye at the lest
In his godhede include both ignorance
And hastynesse and exyle purueyaunce
And prescyence / and ask eke might I sone
Why hight he that / that better were undone
Than said mercy / whereto was mercy wrought
But if mercy had execucyon
Whereto on me was all my faders thought
And all his Joy in my creacyon
Was I not made for restoracyon
Of heavenly bliss / and for necessyte
That both angel and man must have of me
And if so were that I were adnychylate
The heavenly court may not restored be
My faders realm were vain and vacuate
A poor household it were withouten me
Why should I not than have a soueraynte
And complement of my petycyon
Than answered troth / for ye ask no reason
Though ye all day argue for your purpose
Troth shall deliver at her own volunte
My lyberte in no point will I lose
I am my faders child / as well as ye
And ryghtwysenes I wot will hold with me
And with that word troth for her sister went
Dame ryghtwysenes which was anon present
On goodly wise / but ferefull to behold
Come ryghtwysenes all bemed full of light
For she ne spared for hot / ne for cold
For high for low / for to fulfill all right
My systers strive quod she with voice on hight
I will dyscusse / and their contencyon
As right asks / bring to conclusyon
To his servant I think / what trust and grace
My fader had and eke charity
And in earth for him he made a place
Of lust / delight / and of all lyberte
Each erthly thing eke unto his soueraynte
He had enclyne / and be obedyent
Whiles he truly fulfylleth his commandment
What thing in earth he could or might deuyse
For hertes rest and lives sustenaunce
On him began laugh in all goodly wise
And at his lust made him obeysaunce
Exyled from him was unhappy chance
Aduersyte might never his steps sewe
To his servant whiles he was servant true
And if so were he brake his commandment
My fader made a constytucyon
That prysoned and all quycke fleyne and rent
Deed and devoured should be punycyon
For his trespass and his transgressyon
That both pure lote and fere this Just precepte
Should him excyt that it were truly kept
Notwithstanding the promise and statute
The trust / the loue^ the bounte and kyndenesse
Yone frey le servant subgecte to seruytute
Save to conspyre with all vngentylnesse
And of ye Just mau^dement made full Just tra^sgresse
Wherefore of right me thinks he must be deed
Let be quod peace / that is a cruel deed
And with that word peace came in to the place
Whose person was patron of portature
Her rosy lyppes with chere full of grace
Offered kissing unto each creature
Phoebus himself with all his bemed cure
May not be like the light of her vysage
So pure perfyte was that heavenly image
And on this wise she began her tongue affyle
And said to troth / O right how may this mean
Is your purpose peace for to exyle
And to make mercy neuermore be seen
And to ordeyne death for to reygne as queen
This would no more / but for to depryue express
My faders realm / and his sovereign richesse
Sith every realm that has dyuysyon
Within himself must needs be desolate
And we ben four for one conclusyon
For to sustain the realm and his estate
Among us four / why should than be debate
And sith that law will rather lessen pain
That it extend / let peace and mercy reygne
My faders realm debate suffers no while
It is of rest and of tranquyllyte
Because of which he writes in his style
The prince of peace / the auctour of pity
King of mercy / and lord of all bounte
Thus need of force must peace reygne and prevail
Thief strife and debate perysshe in all battle
The chief auaunt and commendacyon
Of this high realm is for it is of pees
Than whereto make ye dysputacyon
Contraryous ben your debate / and rees
With strife I will not dwell withouten lees
And if debate me from this realm dysseuer
The land of peace destroyed is for ever
But sith so is / there is a trespass done
Unto mercy let yield the trespassour
It is her office to redress it soon
For trespass is to mercy a myrrour
And right as sweet has his apryce by sour
So by trespass mercy has all her might
Without trespass mercy has lack of light
What should be syke / but if that sykenes were
What needs salve / but if there were a sore
What needs drink there thyrste has no powere
What should mercy / but trespass go before
But trespass by mercy were little store
Without trespass none execucyon
May mercy have / ne yet perfeccyon
But sister troth / ye may reygne as a pryncesse
Without falshode / and have your soueraynte
Without Iniure / and so may ryghtwysenesse
Eke without war I peace may always be
But mercy kyndely has no properte
Withouten trespass / of which she has her might
Right as the son the moon gives all their light
Therefore I read as for conclusyon
That we obey mercy with one accord
And that we leave all our dyscencyon
For little things as clerks bear record
With peace grows and great thing with dyscorde
Wyteth away / therefore let pacyfye
Our lust to one / and fall we to mercy
Let be quod troth to you I nyll assent
No more will I ywys / quod ryghtwysenes
And with that word / troth to her fader went
And thus she said / O ground of stedfastnes
O permanent / O very troth endeles
Hold thy behest / and supporte veryte
For ryghtwysenes accords unto me
These words says ryghtwysenes / and kneleth down
And said fader sith it is mine office
To give condygne remuneracyoun
To evil / and good / to each virtue and vice
And not to spare for prayer ne for price
And I shall thy godhede gloryfye
That troth asks / I must need Iustyfye
The foresaid caas reserving in my mind
How soon thy servant lust to the offend
And how he was cruel / falls / and unkind
To thy behest I must of right attend
And need of force to Judgment condescende
Wherefore I give sentence dyffynytyue
In form foresaid that pain to death him drive
Of this process to have the true intent
I will thou wete quod sapyence to me
This mighty king is god omnipotent
In one god regnaunt / and persons three
His sone is christ / his daughters in degree
Ben virtues four annexte to his godhede
His servant is old Adam as I read
Return we now to our matter again
All though darted with asper maladye
Mercy fell down she might no longer feign
As a swouned / or in a lytergye
Peace seeing that stood on extasye
And at the last with pyteous voice and mylde
She said alas / peace is for aye exylde
O mercy god / for my sister mercy
Lyenge in a swoune dyenge for lack of brethe
For troth untrue / and vnryghtwysenes
Against us has given sentence of death
I will not rest / but go through holte and hethe
Exyled away return will I never
Fare well fader / fare well thy realm for ever
Fare well mercy fare well thy pyteous grace
So well away that vengeance shall prevail
Fare well the bemed light of heuens place
Unto mankind thou may no more avail
The pure derkenes of hell the does assail
O light in vain the clyppes has the incluse
Man was thy lord / now man is thy refuse
O seraphyn give thyn armonye
O cherubyn thy glory do away
O ye trones let be all your melodye
Your Ierarchye dysteyned is for aye
Your maystres se in what arraye
She lies in swoune / and (...) with debate
Fare well / fare well poor household desolate
O sovereign mighty domynacyons
O virtues / and ye potestates
O pryncypates with all your heavenly sownes
Archaungell / angel / with thryes three estates
Your spouse dame peace ouerset is with debates
Now may ye weep / and Ierarchyes three
Your ordres nine may not restored be
Fare well ye all / dame mercy lies in swoun
For sothefastnes accused has mankind
And ryghtwysenes that should do all reasoun
Has dampened him as cruel and unkind
Mercy and peace for them no grace may find
Notwithstanding Judgment may have no suit
Because of peace / but it be execute
Woo worth debate / that never may have peace
Woo worth penance that asks no pity
Woo worth vengeance / that mercy may not ceas
Woo worth that Judgment that has none equity
Woo worth that troth that has no charity
Woo worth that Judge that may no gylte save
And woo worth right that may no favor have
Fare well saturn / Jove / mars / and phoebus bright
Fare well venus / and fare well mercurye
Fare well thou shynynge lady of the night
I was your guide / but now away goo I
O cruel mars / thy temrestes fury
Now may thou show / and Iupyter thyn Ire
Now may thou rain with darts full of fire
I was the reyne / that held you all together
I brydled you / and set you in accord
But now I go ywys I wore never wheder
Wherefore of force ye must fall to dyscorde
O thou sovereign of all battle the lord
Now may thou send comete thy messengere
To sygnefye that battle / nygheth nere
When Flora rydeth / and cold away is gone
With Iupyter / than may thou mete at lust
And June in some sign of the aquylone
Engendre fire / and make herbs combust
Enfecte the air / and so together Just
One with other hot / cold moist and dry
Contraryous strife for the vyctorye
Now may ye fight / and make both wind and reyne
And erratyke aye in your course be
For peace is gone / that your Ire did refrain
And stabled you in all tranquyllyte
Fare well ye all with all your broad country
Fare well fader / thy realm may never encreas
And with that word euanysshed dame peace
The faders bliss / the sovereign Joy and chief
Of all the heaven the brother to mercy
This woofull caas seeing / and this myschefe
For me ywys did send full hastily
O sapyence he said full pytously
With some counseyle help now in this need
Through perced / mine heart begins to blede
For peace is gone / and mercy lies in swoun
Withouten comfort so welawaye the while
Eke desolate is this heavenly regyoun
But mercy reygne / and peace come from exyle
O sapyence help now to reconcyle
My sister peace / and mercy to comfort
And to this fine with counseyle me supporte
O master mine / O sovereign mighty lord
Hard is this caas quod I withouten leas
High is that help / that may bring to accord
Mercy and troth / dame ryghtwysenes and peace
Mercy would save her man / and vengeance seas
Troth will not so ne yet dame ryghtwysenes
And for this strife peace is to wyldernes
Echone of them will no way be remeued
From her intent it is incomerous
Them to accord / how should it be contreued
Sith two for two stand aye contraryous
This sole caas is wonders studyous
For this accord who so that shall fulfill
Must need of force perform their aller will
But sapyence who may best please them all*
And give echone their full desire express
I mean the wretch / that lies in prison thrall
Mercy to have / and his gylte to redress
And not to offend dame troth and ryghtwysenesse
And revoke peace / who shall this do quod he
In one godhede sith we be persons three
My fader is aye full of lasting might
And all wisdom appropred is to me
Of all goodness the blessed heavenly light
The holy ghoost has to his properte
Thus might wisdom and goodness that both three
Aye of one will / may this accord make
But of us three who shall the trewse take
My wits hole I gadred unto me
And finally as for conclusyon
O master mine / I said it lies in the
Of this accord the execucyon
And on three wise I prove it by reason
Wherefore of force to make this accord
Dyspose thy self / be both subgecte and lord
Thy fader is so ferefull well thou woost
That peace and mercy dare not compromytte
In him as Judge / and eke the holy ghost
In whom all grace goodness and troth is knytte
Dame troth and right for Judge will not admytte
For well they wot that he is mercyes friend
Wherefore thy self of this must make an end
Yone wretch desired not thy faders might
Ne yet the goodness of the holy ghoost
For thy wisdom he cast with the to fight
And smote thy shield amyd the heavenly host
For which thy self must answer well thou woost
Not thy fader / ne yet the thryde person
The help of this thus lies in the alone
These systers four who that shall pacyfye
Must be the sone of man / and take mankind
And for man's gylte / gyltes suffer to dye
And raunson man that think I in my mind
Sith but to one sone the Trynyte may find
Which sone thou art / that by necessyte
This solemn act lies finally in the
Than said my self / O lady sapyence
O good beldame or ye ferder proceed
Vouchesauf to tell your noble reverence
Why might wisdom and goodness as I read
To three persons which are in one godhede
Appropred ben / are they not peregall
And coeterne / and consubstancyall
Yes sone ywys quod sapyence to me
They ben all three in goodness might and wit
Egall and like / of one substance they be
But yet ywys thou clepest them a right
When that thou say the fader full of might
The sone of wit / the spyryte of goodness
This will a cause that is in kind express
A fader is thou wotest a name of age
Of impotence and of debylyte
A sone a name is of youth / and courage
Of inscyence and instabylyte
A spyryte is a name of cruelte
Of hight and pride / this may thou propre find
And eke comune if thou will se in kind
Wherefore the fader in the Trynyte
We clepe mighty the sone full of wit
The good spyryte / this is of proprete
To avoid the vice / that in kind is knytte
But of them all sone mine I will thou wit
In might with grace more excellent is none
Echone has all / and all three is but one
Return we sone mine to our matere
My sovereign lord the brother of mercy
Said sapyence / I se it now so clear
That this accord in me is finally
But hard it is to take mankind and dye
Nevertheless mercy to recomforte
And save mankind / such death nere but dysporte
With full effect he concluded in his heart
Of all mankind to make redempcyon
Give death for life / give Joy for pains smerte
Leave soueraynte / and make subgeccyon
The aungelles eke had such compassyon
Of man's death / that right in special
To help mankind / they cast them all
Unto counseyle the holy spyrytes went
The Ierarchyes with their heavenly collage
To pray for man / it was their hole intent
That he might come to his old heritage
Out from the carybde / and the smoky cage
Of seruytude / the which him had incluse
Four thousand year / he might it not refuse
The Ierarchye next to the Trynyte
With heavenly voice pytous / and delycate
Kneled a down / and said O god we be
As thou well wost to the immedyate
As assessours we ben to thyn estate
Cubyculers also of thy godhede
To our prayer / O mighty god take heed
The to behold is our sovereign solace
Our life / our lust / and aye lasting bliss
The high glory that shyneth in thy face
The wit of kind may not (...) ywys
And sith that man so like unto the is
And fourmed was unto thyn own likeness
Out of this bliss / why lies he in derkenesse
What honor is / what worthynesse
To thy godhede to suffer thyn image
Devoured be / and drenched in derkenesse
For whom thou made light to be heritage
And sith our bliss is hole in thy vysage
O welawaye why should of it the shapnesse
The to dystayne always in derkenesse
Wherefore we pray / O prince full of grace
Thou have pity of man thy creature
His bonds strong / vouchesaue to unlace
Let not thy shappe so long derkenes endure
Give some reward unto thyn own honor
For now is time of mercy and of peace
And time is comen that all vengeance should ceas

Incipit Inuocatio secunde Ierarchie
Than kneled down the second Ierarchye
And humbly said O sovereign lord of all
We be y made thy might to magnefye
And to observe thy law imperyall
As worthy lords that in general
With besy cure supporten thyn empire
And with knyghthode obeyen thy desire
Hens from us all the proud prince of derkenes
As captyue took lords of each estate
Than man was made through the heavenly goodness
For to restore this kingdom desolate
But welawaye whereto was man create
Sith that the lion of all cruelte
In his derke lake of him has so eraynte
Our worthy lordshyppes / and our manners old
O mighty god / how long void shall they be
Thyn heirs eke / how long shall death withholde
Sith thou art life / why has death soueraynte
If thou be king to thyn honor thou se
So bind the fend / and take man by conquest
Unto thy bliss / and set thy reygne in rest
Four thousand year is suffysaunt
For to punysshe old Adam for a taste
And welawaye / hell is exuberaunt
With his of sprynges / and our realm stondeth waste
Now rewe on man thou that all mercy haste
For now is time of mercy and of peace
And time come that all vengeance should seas
Explicit supplicatio secunde Ierarchie
Incipit supplicatio tercie Ierarchie
Tharchaungell than with their Ierarchye
Kneled down / and said with voice benygne
O god thou wost we be always redye
To thy godhede to give loving condygne
To what prouynce / and as thou list assygne
Us in thy realm / as true and dylygent
Offycyalles we do thy commandment
Thy messengers we be ready always
And in thy realm to what place we be sent
We can not find / but peace is gone away
And mercy lies with weeping all be shent
For troth and right to her will not assent
To save manky^de our realm which should restore
Where so we goo / debate is us before
Our enemies eke of us have vyctorye
While thy children continue in dyscorde
And but mankind be brought to thy glory
Thou may never them four bring to accord
On thyn old mercy / O good god record
And sith each thing to the possible is
Pease thy children / and bring mankind to blys
The faders heart by kind should be pyteous
Of his children / and wayle for their absence
Wherefore I pray / O prince vyctoryous
Send for dame peace / bring her to thy presence
And to mankind grant a plain indulgence
For now is time of mercy and of peace
And time is come that all vengeance should ceas

That rote of right / that well of goodlynesse
That noble king / that master glorious
That sovereign sire / and most vyctoryous
Beheld his realm all wasted with ruin
And in himself to pity began enclyne
He held also how pytously complained
His heavenly court of his reygne desolate
And how mercy with teres was dystayned
And peace his child exyled for debate
And how mankind was so incarcerate
That by no way he might his realm restore
Than began his heart for pity wax all sore
Unto mercy / he began his head to held
Which was in point through weeping for to spyll
Than through darted his heart began to yield
And drops small of pity to dystyll
His blessed sone than knew his faders will
Felt yren hot / and thought time for to smite
And up he rose with all lust and delight
He kneled down and said fader of might
I am thy sone / in whom all wisdom is
And well I wot / thou farest not aryght
For children thyn ben at debate ywys
Give me this cause / O sovereign lord of blys
I shall reward echone with their intent
And man again to thy bliss represent
Sweet swetest sone / quod that good fader tho
Of thy behest I am entyerly glade
Do what the list to bring man out of woo
But it forthynketh me / that I man made
I mean the godhede / that such gladness hade
For to make man / in the must take mankind
And penance bear his hands to unbind
With humble heart to do thy will
With love and lust / with sad and hole desire
I am ready / and what thou will I will
Thy pure pleasaunce I may not but desire
I will pursewe the right of thyn empire
Quod that good sone with spyryte vylygent
And up he rose / and to his sister went
He took her up / and goodly began her kiss
Enbraced her unto his heart / and said
O swerte mercy / O pryncesse of all bliss
O sister mine / O goodly yongly maid
With salt teres / why be ye thus arayde
I am that wight that shall your sorrow ceas
And save mankind / and bring again dame peace
Cast up your eyes behold I am your brother
Your life / your lust / your love / your champyon
And for your sake my self shall / and none other
Become a man / and suffer passion
To help mankind / and with double renoun
Bring him to you / and save which was thrall
That mortal is / I shall make immortal
Thus shall I do your heart to recomforte
Your soueraynte eke for to magnefye
Full manfully I shall my pain comporte
And think on you as on mine own lady
To fight in arms / and obtain vyctory
Give troth and right their own desire at full
And every gylte / you at lust to adnull
Reuyue began that goodly lady tho
The brothers speech was salve to all her sore
She thanked him / as cure of all her woo
She kyssed him sweet / she loved him more and more
O prince she said / which shall my right restore
What may I do your thank for to deserve
That ready ben for me to live and sterue
O sweet most sweet brother / and all my knight
O very cause of all mine hertes rest
To give reward / where shall I gader might
To your kyndnesse / I not how I may best
Thank you for this / but O prince worthyest
Me as your own / command aye as ye list
Thus all was well / and either other kyst
The Trynyte to counseyle went anon
Concluded in haste / a messenger should go
Unto the maid the daughter of Syon
To salewe her / and for to say her to
The sone of god to bring man out of woo
Mother and maid she should bear and conceive
Which message done she goodly began receive
She thanked god with heart lust and desire
And on each point submytte her to his will
The holy ghoost was ready to enspyre
His sweet breath her breast with bliss began fill
The sone of god full preuely and still
Within her womb took incarnacyon
And borne he was for man's salvation
He knew the cause of his four systers strife
And how by sentence man should punysshed be
First in the prison of this present life
Rent with vnhele / slain with aduersyte
Dye at the last / and with all cruelte
Suffer worms devour / him in his grave
Hard was this pain / and each man should it have
This to redress himself in prison was
Beten with scourges / and rent upon a rode
Suffered the death / and caused no trespass
A monument his corpse fomynge of blood
Devoured / than he rose and yode
Himself to hell / and losed man anon
Had him to bliss unto his faders trone
He took with him to bliss and made her queen
His sweet mother the blessed maid Marye
To pray for man / and mankind to sustene
And unto her commanded dame mercy
Which for her child she took full thankfully
And said she would for man be advocate
If troth and right with man would debate
And unto mercy goodly thus she said
O fair sister / to you now have I brought
With double honor man for whom ye prayed
And your desire in each thing have I wrought
So ryghtwysely and truly have bought
Him with my blood that troth and right certain
Have all their lust / and no cause to complain
If man unkind resort unto his gylte
Against the kyndenes which I have done
And troth and right will deem him to be spylte
Yet your desire ye shall obtain right soon
For my mother shall come and ask a bone
And say / sweet sone think on thy passion
And save the right of thy redempcyon
Think how of man I came / and am thy mother
And thou my lord / my maker / and my child
Eke thou art man / and man is eke thy full brother
And him best loves thy mother mylde
If man therefore offend with works wild
Think thou him bought / and be no longer wroth
That ones was lefe / let neuermore be loathe
For man to dye / and efte him for to lose
Inconsonaunt it were to all reason
What in earth or heaven yet would suppose
That so solemn and hye redempcyon
As is thy death / should in conclusyon
Be vain and void / such raunson precious
Must in effect be always fructuous
Double title thou have of properte
In every man / for thou his maker is
His savior / and all good has of the
If he dysplease offend and do amys
Or would sorsake thy lordshyp or thy bliss
Yet is he thyn / thou made him / thou him bought
Him to forsake thy title will it naught
The more ywys that thou have done for man
The more fervent on him should be thy thought
The chief auaunt is how thou gate and wan
Him with battle / and from his foos brought
Eke love is more sweet / that it dear is bought
All these in one if thou in mind reuolue
Thy love from man no thing shall mow dyssolue
Yet to mercy more strange the to excyte
O blessed sone / se how I sytte on kne
Behold these breasts small with all delight
That gave the souke the milk of chastyte
Behold the womb of which thou borne would be
Behold the hondes that on my lap the laid
Behold thy spouse / thy mother / and thy maid
And for all this have mercy sone of man
For next thy self I derest have them bought
For well thou woost / the sword of sorrow ran
Out through mine heart / wha^ you on rode was brought
And I the saw with wounds all besought
Sith thus in pain I had my part with the
Part of my will for man sone grant thou me
Thus shall my mother say / if man offend
O sister mine / your lust for to sustene
Eke my self his trespass for to amend
My wounds wide shall hold both new and grene
Dystyllynge blood full fresshe they shall be seen
If with mankind my fader will debate
When he them sees / he mow no longer hate
Therefore be glad / O sister mine mercy
Have here your man / do with him what ye list
She kneled down / took him full thankfully
Enbraced him / and after sith him kyst
That tongue can tell uneath her spyryte wist
For pure gladness / in what place for to abide
Her perfyte bliss perced the heaven wide
Forth than he went unto dame veryte
And said sister / be ye not yet content
Yes brother mine quod she in all degree
For troth it is that man was neclygent
More than I ask eke is his punysshement
Than went he forth unto dame ryghtwysenesse
Asked the same / which answered thus I guess
O sweet brother / man is for his trespass
More punysshed than I my self desire
I am content debate away shall pass
And with that word peace fervent as the fire
Was present tho / for staunched was all ire
Mercy and troth met at their own list
And right and peace together hertely kyst
To which kissing / O mighty prince of peace
Bring us all / as thou starfe on a rood
And grant me grace / or of making ceas
To thy pleasaunce some matter that is good
For to compyle to help me from the flood
Of fruyteles worldly medytacyon
And find a way to my salvation

That is the wholesome perfect nutryment
To every thing / that is in earth content
To corn / herb / tree / plant / and each thing living

And denseth him / and is of high renoun

Our from the earth like from the mydde of all
And of the sons light celestyall
In to the heaven he makes refleccyon
The natures four he passes in renoun
Of water thus to speak in general
There may none find a goodly properte
But in him self thus River has them all
In paradyse he had his soueraynte
Both out and in / to run with lyberte
From sulphur veins / and from metal ure

Gave price / and pass the nine ordres echone
O cherubyn they said / come here to us
Here with what tune thou should saying sauctus
The throstell coke upon the Cedre grene
The nyghtyngale upon the blosme thorn
The noble swan with white feathers and clean
The gentle lark fleing among the corn
Ne ceased not to sing from even to morn
With all other fowls of peasaunce

Each other fowls in kind there had his bliss

Debate no strife / dyscorde / ne yet dystaunce
Among them might not engendered be
Echone other supporte in degree
The proud Pecok his tayll began to whele
On which the sparkynge son so puerly brent
That to the sight he seemed every dele
An Archaungell down from the heaven sent
All heavenly colors in heaven were content

Dame sapyence led me a little beside
Unto a cumly Castle shynynge bright
Full of all solace delight lust / and pride
In whose circuit with wantes large and wide
Of parfyte bliss y set were toures seven
The light of which / astyed up to heaven
The dyke of it y fourmed with delight
Fulfilled was with water of comete
The marbyll stone / the Alabaster white
By geometry so frendely began mete
That such one as in head body and fete
With precious stones illumyned at deuyse
Was never seen / it passed paradyse
Upon a roche it was grounded and set
And every buttras full of ymagery
Each pynacle coner / toure and touret
With gold and perle and stones curyously
Depaynted was and poudred lustely
And on the yate illumyned with all bliss
With gold letters thus y write ywys
This is the way to virtue / and to grace
To conning / knowledge wit / and all wisdom
This is the way unto the heavenly place
There scorn ne thyrst sin vice / ne evil may come
This is the way to that solemn kyngedome
Where rest peace bliss / and comfort seceth never
Come in who will / and right welcome for ever
Seven ladies bright down from the heaven
Came to the yate with many ladies mo
Servants to them / whose name will I neuene
Faith hope tofore with charity go
Prudence / the wise dame / fortytude also
With temporaunce and ryghtwysenes ywys
Met sapyence / and hertely began to kys
With faith was Clemens and vyrgynyte
Dame contynence and dame devotion
Dame lowlynesse / the dame eke chastyte
On whose head was there garlandes of renoun
One for vyrgyns and their relygyon
One for spoused people that lyuen clean
The third for wedowes / if they pure contene
With hope was gladness and contrycyon
Dame dyscyplyne / and eke dame sapyence

With ladies seven her sewynge in a route
Dame sapyence they followed full humbly
Ryst her with bliss / and lowely began to lowte
Echone other enbraced all about
Glad of that metynge full of grace
What should I say / it was an heavenly place
There was gramer ground of science all
And Dyaletyke full of pure knowing
Dame Rethoryke science Imperyall
Dame Arsmetryk science in proporcyonynge
Geometry that mesureth every thing
The lady musyke and Astronomye
The ladies seven sewed theologye
Than from the dongeon great within the place
A solemn town which styed up to heaven
Phylosophye the lady full of grace
With ladies come as after I shall neuen
To sapyence the way she took full even
And said welcome sister and sovereign
They kyssed sweet / of other both were feign
Phylosophye is who lust to dyffyne
Knowledge of erthely and eke heavenly thing
Y joined with sad study and fine
Of governance honest and good living
It is also the probable conning
Of worldely thing / and goodly thing ywys
As much as to man passyble is
She is cleped also the art of arts
And eke of death the medytacyon
Her being eke I set in two parts
In pure science and oppynacyon
Science thing techeth by certain reason
Oppynacyon is in certaynte
When thing by reason may not proved be
And if the son be more in quantyte
Than is the earth / how much eke is the heaven
Of what matter / and if he stable be
Or yet moble / this can not science neuen
If that the moon be moysty / holowe or even
This know we not by propre pure reason
But this we have by oppynacyon
This sovereign lady dame phylosophye
Within her self all arts does contene
Nature and kind / virtue and polycye
How they y taught eke execute should been
In her wysdom she has groundly and clean
Wherefore to her annexed ben systers three
Which ladies ben of all sovereign bounte
The first sister is cleped natural
Whom folk of grace clepyn dame phisyca
The second hight the good pryncesse moral
Whom they of greece eke clepyn dame Ethyca

Phylosophye has these in especyall
The first does teache the cause of every thing
Her propre kind / her kyndely properte
And in the second is trust of living
Knowledge of virtues and honest
When kind and virtues may than known be
The third sister comes with her reasoun
Of evil and good making discrypcyoun
Millesius one of the sages seven
In greece first drew / as in the craft of kind
By his reason the causes of the heaven
And of each the nature began he find
Than come plato a worthy clerk of kind
For natural art sought out geomatrye
Arsmetryke / musyke and astronomye
Dame Ethyca pryncesse of polycye
Good Socrates first founder of governance
To know virtue and con live honestly
And four ladies he sought full of pleasaunce
To serve dame Ethyke with obeysaunce
Whose names ben prudence and ryghtwysenesse
Dame fortytude and temporaunce I guess
Than fond plato the lady racyonall
Which when that kind and virtue known been
Techeth each man by reason special
To understand the subtle strength and chene
Of kind and virtue what they would and mean
Than sought he out dame Dyaletyca
To serve her with dame Rethorica
In these three systers grounded may we find
Dyuynyte / if we look well ywys
For each dyuyne other speaks of kind
As in the noble book of Genesis
Or of manners as in proverbs
Or of logyk / for whom dyuynes all
The Cantycle taken in special
Some said that phylosophye called reesoun
Has ladies two subject in special
The first hight Inspectyue whose eye aboun
Dyserneth thing which is celestyall

Of these four ladies must I specially

Of them no more wherefore now will I write
Dame Actual has other ladies three
As dame moral / and dame dyspensatyue
Dame Cyuyle hight the third full of bounte
The first dysposeth to each man of live
Manner of leuynge / the second is actyue
Which began her houshode reule without dystau^ce
The third of cytees has in governance
We entered in this yate full of bliss
Unto the first court full of heavenly light
Which dame science had in keeping ywys
Which house and ward loyal lusty and bright
Ellumyned fresshe / and painted to the sight

Man / be / herb / tree / there may you know them all
Scripture there taught how man should govern him
And what his is in body / and in blood
And what matter he in lies / or yet in him
why this is evil / and why that thing is good
why this is tame / and why that be is wood
All polycy in earth / and all knowledge
Dame science there had in that herbergage
There was all natural phylosophye
And in a goodly parlour see I sit
The phylsopher with his company
Tretynge of kind / and what longs to it

These had delight to serve dame science
And to have knowledge in phylosophye

They wake / they work / they study besyly
Whiles that they ben with dame science expert

Of what degree was every Ierarchye
Of what office / and of what obseruaunce
And why the first eke hight ypyphanye
There was depaynted with all pure pleasaunce
Of Lucyfer and his unhappy chance
Of the spyrytes which that with him fell
There might men see and of the pain of hell
Our wits five when they begin to fail
As in each inuysyble creature
Intellygence must give us than counsel
By her we have parfyte knowleges and pure
When eke / nose / ere / mouth / eke is unsure
And we by them may get no pure science

And many mo within a parlour pure
Of clerks which that were contemplatyue

A lady fair enourned fresshe and bryghte

A Crest above her right hand had a spear
The other side a shield of Crystal clear
Her head was ferfull and eke monstrous

Of colors there delycyous and stout

Her example was in a monycorde
On instrument quadraunt long holowe within

And it is to know she taught them on their hand
By which they wot the ground of all singing

Astronomye that lady full of grace
Began first dyuyne what thing ye world should be
What thing heaven is / his course and his place
His paleys eke / his parties in degree
His form / his spear / and eke his properte
His sight / his course / his mouynge at the best
With all other parties most and lest
His hemyspery / and his clercles five
Their properte / and how they cleped been
The zodyake also she began descryue
The son his course and his effect clean
His magnytude / his nature well besene
The moon her course / her diverse fourmes eke
And their Eclypses / there was nothing to seek
She taught also how sundry sterres hight
And in what time they go their cercules all
Eke how ye son ye moan gives all their light
Which Lucina we clepe in rs;pecyall
And how that fire out from heaven does fall
Like as the sterres fill it is seen
The cause of this / and what it may mean
And to each sterre that cleped is a sign
By sight of which thing to come men may guess
A propre name she began to assygne
As Arctur / vrsa / the more eke and the less
Thus diverse names began she for to dress
As Tryones / Boetes / Yades
Aricturus. Oryon / and plyades
As Lucyfer / Cometes / vesperus
Their names old she told full craftily
The planetes seven she neuened unto us
Saturn / Jove / mars / phoebus / and mercurye
The moon venus / and what they sygnyfye
Their influence / and their qualyte
With cyrcumstaunce of pure solempnyte
Twelve fygures than she told right well arrayed
The Ram / the bull / and the gemelles to
The crabbe / the lion / and the streyt maid
The balaunce tharcher / and the Scorpio
The got / the water sire / and the fysshe also
The planetes seven as they to this attain
Such each time dysposed soth to said
And how each figure had his properte
A propre name / thus began she constrewe
The gentyles eke how that they blinded be
That lust / honor with worship fresshe and new
The planetes seven / as parfyte gods true
They rytes old / and their ydolatrye
She began reherce / as techeth poeterye
And how they clepe the ra^me the first sign
For that in mars beginning of the year
The son in him makes his course dygne
And they worship him on their manner
By cause of Jove whom in their temples clear
It they depaynte a rams head they make
With horns two for Iubyters sake
He come an ox / and took Europa they said
Wherefore the bole they worship of their grace
Castor pollux eke whau they deed were laid
Among the sterres they demed have a place
Whom they clepen the gemelles with solace
For Hercules eke slough the great lion
Him for that sign they worship with renoun
O mysbyleue merueylous for to neuene
O cursed blyndenes of these gentyles all
Which demyn fysshe / and bestyall be in heaven
For gloryfyed regnaunt perpetual
As Rame / bore / crabbe / and bear in special
Hounde / lion / swan / the egle eke in fere
Whom they worship for Jove's chyfe squyre
She told also of battle destyne
And how in sterres some men have such believe
That in their birth right by necessyte
Ordained is all that him shall please or grieve
This old error our doctors done repreue
Socrates the same with Arystotyll says
Notwithstondynge they were not of our faith
Or if a man were in this natyuyte
Constryeued to his sundry arts all
Them for to do right by necessyte
Why should good men have laud in special
Or myslyuers to punysshement be thrall
Good Isodre makes this reason
In dampnynge of this false oppynyon
Astronomye the Egyptes first did find
Astrologye / and her queynt obseruaunce
Folk of Calde first sought and brought to mind
Whom Abraham taught the egyptes with pleasau^ce
As wryteh Josephus withouten doutaunce
But greeks said this craft first was found
By one Athlant / and of him had his ground
And with this lady was sire Tholome
Johan de hispayn / and mysaleth also
With other auctours in degree
That drew of her / whose names let I go
Thus in sterres I will cease and ho
And by the order of the arts seven
Styre folk to leave the world / and draw to heaven
Eplicit de Astronomia.
Incipit Tractatus de fide.
Dame faith than led us unto her dwelling place
Unto a toure solemn and glorious
Full of all lust / comfort / virtue and grace
Depaynted fresshe with colors precious
And in a parlour full solacyous
Thappostles all were set with pure delight
And of our truth the artycles they write
They had believe in god fader of might
Maker of heaven and (...)
Of vysyble and inuysyble wight
And in his son christ full of bliss
Before the world / which was always ywys
I get not made and consubstancyall
To his fader / of whom fourmed is all
He came from heaven / and in the maid marye
By inspyracyon of the holy ghost
Mankind he took / and borne he was for to dye
To win man soul out from the fendes host
And under Pylate set with Jews boost
Bounden and beat / crowned and crucyfyed
With watery wounds Innocent he dyed
For he was graven man out from hell he brought
And rose the third day unto the live again
Styed to heaven / his faders trone he sought
From whens as king / he shall come yet certain
Both quyke and deed to deem / to life or pain
The good to bliss / the evil to punysshement
Heaven earth hell shall suake in that judgment
And in the holy ghoost believe they bad
In holy church baptysme communyon
Of saints eke to hold ferme and sad
Of all treaspas to have remyssyon
And for to trow the resureccyon
Of people deed / and in life lasting
Unto the which almighty god us bring
The artycles with oth^^ points all
That longs to the holy trynyte
Dame faith her self began tell in special
Which in English not reherced be
Such thing as should be pryuate and occult
I read we leave / and take quicumque vult
There was to faith doing all reverence
The holy sinner Mary magdalene
Which by dame faith has geten indnlgence
Of all her sin and was assoyled clean
Good martha eke by her grace began optene
And brought to live her brother lazarus
So was the sone also of Regulus
There was the daughter eke of Canane
Which by her was brought fro the fendes bond
All other eke / that of any infyrmyte
Thrughe faith was cured / with her see I stand
Blind dome and deef lepreous foot and hand
Whom faych has heled / and brought unto grace
With all honor obeyed her in that place
There was also the holy confessors
That preched faith while they were on live
Doctors martyrs and glorious auctours
Writing of faith / and her merit blyue
And on this wise / they began her descryue
And said that faith is ground of all goodness
Withouten whom life has no sykernes
Unto good she gives strength and comfort
And who troweth not he falls impotente
The shield of faith who lust to comporte
All thing ouercometh as unto reverence
His three enemies with their yrous pretense
Against him shall never more prevail
Ask and believe thyn asking shall not fail
She is ay / for as the clerks says
There is but one god lord perpetual
Pryncypally / of whom preche his faith
Eke hole she is of her artycles all
True without error outher great or small
Lively and quyke to do every quyke deed
For else she were but as a body deed
There was the lady clennesse well arrayed
Devotion and dame vyrgynyte
Dame contynence and chastyte the maid
Dame loulynesse and dame stabylyte
Enlumyned fresshe echone in their degree
These seruen faith / and as they couthe deuyse
With bliss they song / and said upon this wise
It better is to trow in god above
Than in mankind or in many other thing
Who troweth in him / for he can keep and love
Their lust fulfill / and grant them their asking
And in his gospel eke a worthy king
He said him self in me / who lust believe
Though he be deed ywys yet shall he leave
O cursed folk with your ydolatrye
Which in false gods setten your delight
Blind dome / and deef is all your mametrye
Of stock and stone / men may such karue and thwyte
Leave them for false with sour and despyte
In our one god cast anchor and believe
Though ye were deed / he can make you leave
(...) your gods be deed
They have a time / and he is sempyterne
They are but earth / and brought low as led
He regneth god above the heaven superne
Blyssed be he / for he no grace will werne
To them that will in him beset their believe
And though they dye ywys yet shall they live
