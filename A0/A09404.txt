The silver Age, or, The World turned backward. To a pleasant new Court tune.

MY Lady Pecunia
is a fair creature,
All clothed in silver,
according to nature:
She flies most freely,
none does await her,
To wash off her pinions
by counterfeit water.
Oh this is a silver age,
Oh this is a changing age.
The Lord and the Lady,
the Beggar the Knight,
For Lady Pecunia
cares not a Doi^:
Redeemed from prison,
she takes delight,
To go to the Prodigal
spender aright.
Oh this is a silver age,
Oh this is a wasting age.
Our lusty brave gallants
now walks among clownes
With their full pockets
well stored with crowns,
To give to poor people
the rents of their grounds,
Where alms of brass forthings
are changed to pounds.
Oh this is a silver age,
Oh this is a bountiful age.
The Merchant refuses
is gain by adventure,
The Citizen leaves
to lend by Indenture.
Young gallants grow careless
their titles to enter,
But put their whole livings
to the stretch of the tenter.
Oh this is a silver age,
Oh this is a liberal age.
Rich mizers have turned
their gold to good cheer,
And bids the poor beggar
most kindly draw nears:
And with the fat gluttons,
they spend away sheere,
What greediness gained
by fraud in ten years.
Oh this is a silver age,
Oh this is a spending age.
He that has riches
locked up in his chest*
With too man^ crosses
himself he has breast.
To raise up the devil,
His mind to molest,
But coniur'd by conscience,
in quiet does r^st.
Oh this is a silver age,
Oh this is a mending age.
Young women grow weary
of walking the street,
They scarce in a Tavern,
will set in their feet,
Their husbands they fear not,
with whom they do meet,
And like to good Angels
they never do fleet,
Oh this is a silver age,
Oh this is a virtuous age.
The bawd and the pander
are turned to grace,
And for a full pocket
they hold it but base.
A wench that is painted,
comes not into place,
For fear lest the beadle
her shoulders uncase.
Oh this is a silver age,
Oh this an honest age.
The Tapster still living
by foame and by froth,
The ^^oc^er that eats
most like to the moath,
Are no^ turned honest
and virtuous both:
One penny ill gotten
to take they are loath
Oh this is a silver age,
Oh this is an honest age.
The second part. To the same tune.

CArmen and Porters
are now no more dogged,
Nor the old watermen
rough and so hogged,
The Thames lately frozen,
with w^nt have them clogged
Now money comes trouling,
for which they have iogged.
Oh this is a silver age,
Oh this is a bettered age.
Baylifes and Serieants
all pitiful be,
And to the poor debtors
lends money most free.
And wait in the Tavern,
until they agree,
Not taking one penny
in lieu of their fee.
Oh this is a silver age,
Oh this is a favorable age.
The honest true Hostler
repenting his sins,
Now cares for money,
no more then for pine,
The size of his prouander
justly begins,
As bring Lady conscience
^o ^ll ou^ good Innes.
Oh this is a silver age,
Oh this is a m^nding age.
Old frau^ and false ^eal^ng
(...) changed their ^^tty,
At Aldermans houses
for Porter stands pity:
With gentle charity,
smiling most pretty,
To give to poor people,
the love of the City.
Oh this is a silver age,
Oh this is a merciful age.
The wise and the husband,
unquiet before:
To win the old breeches,
will quarrel no more:
For fear of the Beggar
that stands at the door.
For quiet true concord,
brings plentiful store.
Oh this is a silver age,
Oh this is a friendly age.
Now Lady Pecunia,
grows out of regard,
and turned from the Chamber,
into the cold yard:
And from all true good men,
she well may be spared,
When such an age changed,
yet never was heard.
Oh this is a silver age,
Oh this is a wondering age.
FINIS.
