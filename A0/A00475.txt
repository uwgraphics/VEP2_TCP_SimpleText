A most notable example of an ungracious Son, who in the pride of his heart
denied his own Father, and how God for hi^ offense, turned his meat into
loathsome Toades.
To the Tune of Lord Darley.


IN searching famous Chronicles,
it was my chance to read
A worthy Story strange and true,
whereto I took good heed:
Betwixt a Farmer and his Son,
this rare example stands,
Which well may move the hardest hearts
to weep and wring their hands.
The Farmer in the Country lived,
whose substance did excel;
He sent therefore his eldest Son,
in Paris for to dwell,
Where he became a Merchant man,
and Traffic great he used,
So that he was exceeding rich,
till he himself abused.
For having now the World at will,
his mind was wholly bent
To gaming, wine, and wantonness,
till all his goods were spent.
Yea, such excessive Riotousnesse
by him was showed forth,
That he was three times more in debt
then all his wealth was worth.
At length his credit clean was cracked,
and he in Prison cast,
And every man against him then
did set his action fast.
There lay he locked in Irons strong,
for ever and for aye,
Unable while his life did last,
his grievous debt to pay.
And living in this woeful case,
his eyes with tears he spent:
The lewdness of his former life,
too late he did repent:
And being void of all relief,
of help and comfort quite;
Unto his father at the last,
he thus began to write.
Bow down a while your deedfull ears,
my loving Father dear:
And grant I pray in gracious sort,
my piteous plaint to hear.
Forgive the foul offenses all
of your unthrifty Son;
Which through the lewdness of his life,
has now himself undone.
O my good Father, take remorse
on this my extreme need,
And succor his distressed state,
whose heart for woe does bleed.
In direful dungeon here I lie,
my feet in setters fast:
Whom my most cruel Creditors
in Prison so have cast.
Let pity therefore pierce your breast,
and mercy move your mind:
And to release my misery,
some shift, sweet Father find.
My chiefest cheer is bread full brown,
the boords my softest bed:
And flinty stones my pillowes serve
to rest my troubled head.
The second Part,
to the same Tune.


MY garments all are worn to rags,
my body starues with cold:
An^ crawling Vermin eats my flesh,
most grievous to behold.
Dear Father come, therefore with speed,
and red me out of thrall,
And let me not in Prison dye,
since for your help I call.
The good old man no sooner had
perused this written scrowle,
that trickling tears along his cheeks
most plenteously did roll.
Alas, my Son, my Son, quoth he,
in whom I ioyed most,
Thou shall not long in Prison be,
whateuer it me cost.
Two hundred heads of welfead Beasts,
he changed into gold:
Four hundred quarters of good Corn,
for silver eke he sold.
^ut all the same could not suffice,
this heinous fact to pay,
Till at the last constrained he was
to sell his Land away.
Then was his Son released quite,
his debt discharged clean,
(...) he likewise as well to live,
^s he before had been.
^^en went his loving Father home,
who for to help his Son
(...) sold his Living quite away,
(...) eke himself undone.
(...) that he lived poor and bare
(...) in such extreme need,
^ut many times he wanted food,
^is hungry Corpse to feed.
His Son mean time in wealth did swim
whose substance now was such.
That sure within the City then,
few men were found so rich.
But as his goods did still increase,
and riches in did slide:
So more and more his hardened heart
did swell in hateful pride:
But it fell out upon a time,
when ten years woe was past,
Unto his Sun he did repair
for some relief at last.
And being come unto his house
in very poor array:
It chanced so that with his Son.
great States should dine that day.
The poor old man with hat in hand
did then the Porter pray,
To show his Son that at the gate
his Father there did stay.
Whereat this proud disdainefull wretch,
with taunting speeches said,
That long ago his Fathers bones
within the Grave were laid:
What rascal then is that quoth he,
that staineth so my state?
I charge thee Porter presently
to drive him from my gate.
Which answer, when the old man heard
he was in mind dismayed:
He wept, he waild, he wrong his hands,
and thus at length he said:
O cursed wretch, and most unkind,
and worker of my woe,
Thou monster of humanity,
and eke thy Fathers Foe:
Have I been careful of thy case,
maintaining still thy state,
And do thou now so doggedly,
enforce me from thy gate:
And have I wronged thy brethren (...)
from thrall to set thee free:
And brought my self to beggars sta^^
and all to succor thee?
Woe worth the time when first of a^
thy body I espied,
Which has in hardness of thy hear^
thy Fathers face denied.
But now behold how God that time;
did show a wonder great;
Even where his Son with all his frie^^^
were settled down to meat.
For when the fairest Pie was cut,
a strange and dreadful case,
Most ugly Toades came crawling ou^
and leaped at his face.
Then did this wretch his fault conf^^^^
and for his father sent.
And for his great ingratitude,
full sore he did repent.
All virtuous Children learn by thi^
obedient hearts to show.
And honor still your Parents dear,
for God commanded so:
And think how he did turn his m^^^^
to poisoned Toads indeed,
Which did his Fathers face deny,
because he stood in need.
FINIS.
