Ane Meditatioun upon the 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 VERSIS OF THE 1^. CHAP. of ye
first buke of the Chronicles of ye Kingis. SET DOVN BE THE MAY CHRISTIAN
King and sincere professor of the treuth JAMES THE SEXT KING OF SCOTTIS.
1. CHRON. CHAP. 15. VERSE. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. The Text. SO David, and the
elderis of Israel, and the Captains of thowsandis wont to bring up ye arc of
the covenant of the Lord from the house of Obed Edom with joy.

26 And because that God helps the Levites that bare ye arc of ye covenant of
the Lord, they offered seuin bullockes and seuin rams.

27 And David had on him ane linning garment, as all the Levites that bare the
arc, and the Singeris and Chenaniah that had the chief charge of ye Singeris:
and upon David (was) ane linning Ephod.

28 Thus all Israel brought up the arc of ye Lordis covenant with showting and
sound of trumpettis and with cymbables, making ane sound with yioles and with
harpes.

29 And quhen ye arc of ye covenant of the Lord came into the city of David,
Michol the daughter of Saull looked out at ane window, and saw King David
dancing and playing, and scho despysit him in her heart.


The Meditatioun.
AS of lait quhen greitest appearance of perrill was by one foreign and godles
floit I took occasioun by ane text selected for the purpose to exhort ow to
remane constant, resting assured of ane happy deliverance: So now by the greit
mercies of God, my speeches having taking ane evident effect, and could do no
les of my cairfull dewtie then out of this place cited, teach ow quhat restis
on our part to be done. Nocht of any opimoun I have of my ability to instruct
ow, bot that th^r brulleries of mine may after my deith remaue to the
posterity as ane certane testimony of my vpricht and anefauld meaning in this
so greit and veichtie ane cause. Now I cum to ye matter. David that godly King
hes no sooner obtened victory over Goddis and his enimeis the Phil^stines, b^t
his first actioun that followis is with concurrence of his haill estaitis to
translate the arc of the Lordis covenant to his house in greit triumph and
gladness, accompaneit with the sound of musical instrumentis. And being so
brought to ye Kingis house he him self dancis and reioycis befoir it: quhilk
thing Micholl the daughter of Saul and his wife perceauing, sho contemned and
lichtlied her husband in her mind. This is the sowme.

The Method.
FOR better understanding quhairof their heidis ar to be oppinnit up in ordour,
and applyit. And first quhat caussis mouit David to do this wark. Secundlie
quhat persa* is concurrit with David in doing of this wark. Thridlie quhat was
ye actioun it self, and form of doing vsit in the samen. Ferdlie the person
of Michol. And fyttlie her actioun.

The first part.
^eale in David and exper^ence of Goddis kyndnes towardis hi^ mouis David to
ho^^^^ God.
AS to the first part. The causis moving David, passing all vtheris, I note two:
Ane internal, the other external. The internal was ane fervent and zealous
mind in David fully disposed to promoue the glory of God that had callit him
to be King as he sayis him self, The zeal of thy house it eatis me up. Psalm.
69.9. bot mair largely expressed in the 132 Psalm. composit at the same time
quhylles this wark was in doing. The external was ane notable victory newly
obtenit be the power of God over and against ye Philistinis auld and pernicious
enemeis to the pepill of God erpressit in the last part of the 14 chap.
preceding. Be this victory or cause erternall, ye internal cause and zeal in
David is so doubly inflammed, that all thingis set aside, in this wark
allanerlie he will be occupyit. Their ar the two weichtie caussis moving him.
Quhatrof we may learn first that ye chief wertew quhilk should be in ane
christian Prince, The Kirk ever troublie be men be ane joyful end.
Thridlie that the Kirk of God never want it enemeis and notable victories over
them, to assure them at all times of the constant kyndnes of God towardis them,
euin quhen as be the croce, as ane bitter medecin, he cures their
infirmities, saisfeth them from gross sins, and exercises their faith: For
we find planelie in the scriptures that na sooner God chuisit himself Israel
to be his pepill, hot als soon, and ever thairefter als lang as they remaned
his, the Devil so inuyit their prosperity as he houndit out his instrumentis
the natiounis at all times to trouble and weir against them, it to the comfort
of his Kirk afflicted and wrake of the afflicteris in the end. This first was
practiced by Pharao in Egypt: and after their delyuerance then by the
Ammonites, and sune by the Philistinis continually thairefter quhill the
rising of the monarcheis, quho every ane exercit them s^lfis in ye saine
labor. Bot to note heir the rage of all prophaue princes and natiounis
quhilkis exercit their cruelty upon the Kirk of God were superfluous and
cedious in respect of that quhilk I set down in my former meditatioun.
Quhairfoir I unlie go fordware them in this, As this was the continual
behavior of ye natiounis towardis Israel, So it was may specially in the
time of David, and amangis the rest at this time heir cited, at quhat time
having newly inwaidit Israel, and being doung bak, they wald it counene agane
in greit multitudes to weir against the pepill of God. And not content to
defend their awin country as the Israelites did, wald neidis cum out of ye
samin to persew them and so spread themselfis in the valley. Bot David by Goddis
directioun bringis forth the pepill against them, quho fechtis and according to
Boddis promeis ouercummis them, only by the hand of God, and nocht by their
power, as the place it self may planelie proportis. So the Kirk of God may be
troublit bot in troubill it can not perish: And the end of their troubill, is
the very wrak and destructioun of Goddis enemeis.

The secund part.
Three rankis of personis co^currit with David in this wark.
NOW followis secundlie the personis quho did concur with David in this actioun.
The Spirit noitis thrie rankis of them. In the first ar ye Elderis of Israel:
In the nixt ar the captanes over thowsandis: In the third ar the Preistis and
Leuitis: of quhom summarlie I will speik. Their Elderis were rewlaris under David
in the kingdom, and as his handis in all partis of the country ministering
justice and judgment to the Kingis subiectis: Their Elderis were of two sortis,
magistratis in wallit townis, quho in the portis of the cities executed
judgment, and cheifis in trybis and fatheris of famileis quho in the country
did judge and minister judgment as the scripture proportis. Their were not
unlike to two of the estaitis of our kingdom, the Barroun and the Burges. The
Captanes over thowsandis were godly and valiant men, quho under the King did
rewle in time of weir: had the custody of ye Kingis person: and faucht his
battailis: Their were necessair officiaris for David quha was appointit be God in
his time (as we are teachit of Goddis awin speiking be Nathan to David) to fecht
Goddis battaillis, to subdew the enemeis of his Kirk and to procure he that
doing ane peaceabill kingdom for Solomon his sone quho suldin peace, as figure
of Christ the prince of peace, beild the Lordis tempill. Their ar spokin of heir
to teach ws first that their calling is lawful: Nixt in their calling they
should be earnest to honor God: And thridlie that their captanis cheillie were
lawfully callit and lawfully walkit thairin, as we have plane declaratioun
out of David's awin inouth expressed weill in ye haill 101 Psalm, seeing nane
were admit^it in his service or household, bot sik as vnfeineitlie feared God,
and without all questioun godly and zealous David wald never have committit
the gaird of his person, nor ye fechting of Goddis battaillis to ye enemeis of
God or men of weir of quhois godliness and wertew he never had pruife: See then
their namis and praise 1. Chron. 11.26. The third rank of Preistis and Levites
ar set down in ye same chapt. ver. 4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11. So men of all estaitis
were present in this godly wark. This is to be markie weill of Princes, and all
thois of any hie calling or degrie that mellis to do in Goddis cause: David dois
nathing in matteris apperteining to God without ye presence and special
concurrence of Goddis Ministeris apponitit to be spiritual rewlleris in his
Kirk: and in the first hunt to conuoy the same Arc to Jerusalem finding their
absence and want of their counsel hurtful: now in this chaptour, ver. 12.13.
he sayis to them, e ar ye chief fatheris of the Levites, sanctify our self and
our brethren, and bring up the Arc of ye Lord God of Israel unto the place
that I have prepared for it. For because e were nocht their at the first, ye Lord
our God maid ane brek a mang ws: For we socht him not after dew or dour. And
this far for ye secund part concerning personis.

The third part.
The Arc is transportit with joy to Jerusalem.
THE sowme of this joyful conuoy may be digestit in thrie actiounis quhilkis ar
their: The transporting of ye Arc, the harmony of musical instrumentis, and
Dau^dd^s dancing and rejoicing befoir it. He buildit ane tabernacle for ye Arc
in mont Sion, and transportit it thairunto, to signify his thankfulness for the
money victories God had put in his handis: And this transporting was the
occasioun of all this solempnitie and rejoicing that followit thairupon. The
significatioun of ye Arc of the cou^nent.
As to the Arc it self, we know it was buildit be Moses at the command of God
in ye wilderness of Sinay. This Arc was maid of Schittim wood quhilk admittis
no corruptioun: It was of may cumlie shaip and form: Two cubits and ane
half in lenth, ane cubit and ane half in hicht, and ane cubit and ane half in
breid, ouerlayed within and without with pure beatin gold, and was not only
ane figure of Jesus Christ our perfect Savior, in quhom all the promeissis of
God ar ea and Amen. 2. Cor. 1.20. and in quhom as ane sure Arc all abundance
of Goddis blissingis ar placit, that out of his fulness we may all receive grace
upon grace. John. chap. 1.16. Seeing he is maid unto ws of God, wisdom,
richteousnes, sanctificatioun, and redemptioun. 1. Cor. 1.30. Bot also ane sure
pledge of Goddis continual presence in Christ with his pepill, to blis them
with all manner of blissingis. And to signify this purpois mair particularlit,
within ye Arc. was placit the tables of ye covenant and law writtin be God,
(for quhilk cause also it was callit ye Arc of ye covenant) Romans 10.4. to
teach them in Christ promisit ye perfectioun of ye haill law to be found for
all that believe in him. Abone ye Arc was ane cover or lid called ye mercisait,
and abone ye lid ye figuris of two Cherubines, covering with their wingis ye
mercisait, out betuirt ye quhilk two the living God did lovingly speik to ye
instructioun and comfort of his pepill, to assure them that all Goddis
merciful dealingis with man, Heb. 1.14. John, 1.41.
ather in communicating his knawledge to them: ather in sending his Angellis
ministering spirits for their comfort had the ground and fundatioun in Christ
Jesus allanerlie. This Arc then being ane sure sacrament of God dis favor
towardis them and ane covenant of Jesus Christ, quhatrin corporally Goddis
merciful promeissis did inhear. Followis ye third part ye form of doing vsit
thairin be their personis. Generally ye actioun was to bring up ye Arc of the
covenant of ye Lord from ye house of Obed Edom with joy, and to be placit in ye
tabernacle beildit for it be ye King in mont Sion: The form of doing vsit be
every person is. The Preistis offer bullockis and rams because that God
blissit ye wark. The King cled in ane linning garment dancis and playis before
ye Arc. Chenaniah ye chief of ye Singeris with his fellowis praisis God with
psalmis, and all ye estaitis in Israel bringis ye Arc of ye covenant with
showting, sound of cornet, trumpet, cymbales, violes and harpis, and places it
in ye city of David. Breiflie then David upon his victories will transport to
his house ye samin, to testify heirby his cair to retene Goddis favor towardis
him and his pepill: Nocht thinking it aneuch to have anis or twyis pruife their
of: bot also to procure ane continuance by pe centinuance of this holy Arc:
Esteming this ye worthiest trophee or triumph he culd make or erect for his not
abill victories. Ane triumph in deid far surpassing ye Egyptiack Pyramids, ye
grecian tropheis, or it ye Roman triumphall chariottis. As to ye harmony and
musical instrumentis that accompanyit this holy Arc, I trust no man is
ignorant of ye custom that was amangis ye Iewis in praising God with all kind
of instrumentis, as David's Psalms innumerabill times beiris witness. Bot in
case sum wald demand quhairfoir ye Kirk of God should mair extraordinarlie
rejoice at ane time the^ (...) other, seeing we are assured that all Goddis
actiounis tow^^dis ws ar for our weill, ather spirituallie or corporally,
sup^^^is we can nocht at every time comprehend it? I answer that althocht I
must confess that sentence to be may orthodoxe, it must I also confess that
quhensoeuer it sall please God to manifest by outward signs to ye world, as at
ane time mair then at ane other ye greit lufe he beiris to his Kirk be sum
notable wark for their delyuerance, We are then of dewtie bund in ye hiest
degrie to praise God asweill for ye conseruing of ye waik anis amangest ws, as
for stopping of ye mouths and dashing of ye proud wickit without ws, to make
the glory of his name als far as in ws lyis to rescund. The monyfald exemplis
of ye Saintis of God throch the haill scriptures prouis this mair nor
evidently, besides the exemplis of the prayeris of sindrie of ye godly, quho
for ye glory of his name mair nor for their particulare weill hes prayit him
to give public testimony of his lufe towardis them. So did Moses, Joshua,
David, Elias, Elizeus, and innumerabill vtheris of the prophetis and seruandis
of God. As to the dancing of David: Dancing, playing and siclyke actiounis we
know ar of them selfis indifferent, and guide or evil according to their use,
and intentioun of ye vser. And thairfoir being vsit at this time with ane
cumlie zeal for the furthsetting of Goddis glory at not only to be borne
with and ercusit, bot euin may heichlie to be praisit and commendit, althotht
that Michol dispraisit the samin. Mairouer it is to be markit that David in
this doing did nathing without the special motioun of ye Spirit of God as ane
extraordinar wark, quhilk so fully possessit his soull at this present that
foretfull as it were of ye actiounis of his body he gaif his haill person over
to be gouernit as it pleasit him, always seiking in all, ye honor and glory
of his God without respect to him self. And this far for ye third part. Christ
is the ground of all (...) re^ligioun
The ground of all true and ancient religioun and the body of the haill
service of God that bringis saluatioun, to be situat in Jesus Christ only, as
is planelie set down Act. 4.12. John. 14.6.1. Cor. 2.11.1. John. 1.7. Nixt that
they quhilk will be saif be this Arc must beir this Arc in their heart be
faith, 10. and in their actioums conforming their haill doing in their calling
to his will. 7.21.22.23. Thridlie that they quha ar sincerely ioynit with
Christ rejoice in ye beiring of Christ and comptis it their hiest joy to be
occupyit continually in his beiring.

The ferd part.
Micholis hypocrisy.
AS to the person of Michol, sho was Saul's daughter, and David's wife: ane woman
appeirandlie evil brocht up by ane may wickit father: quhilk ye Spirit of
God will signify by calling her Saul's daughter, as sho was in hypocrisy his
daughter in deid, asweill as by nature: it sho was ioynit with the body of ye
Kirk visible, quhilk is signifyit be ye style geuin her, quhen sho was callit
David's wife. And so sho was outwardly ane person ioynit by marriage in
society with ye Kirk, it in effect ane lurking hypocrite within ye bowellis of
ye same. Such kind of folkis (hypocritis I mean) ar ane malum necessarium
inseparably and continually ioynit with the true Kirk never to be siftit
quhill ye master of ye harvest cum with the fan in his hand.

The fyft part.
Micholis doing.
HER doingis ar: Being quiet in her ludgeing all ye time of her husbandis greit
and public rejoicing with the pepill nocht cumming out, for nocht being abill
as appeirit to counterfite fynelie aneuch ane dissimulat joyful countenance.
And thairfoir keiking out at ane window sho spyis her husband dancing befoir
the Arc, incontinent interpreitis sho this indifferent actioun in malam
partem, as nocht being tuichit with ane true feiling of the cause of his joy,
and so dispysis sho his doing in her mind as only proceeding of ane lascivious
wantounes. Ane marvelous case: Scho that of befoir of natural lufe to her
husband did preserve him althocht to her awin greit perrill from the handis of
her awin father Saul, can not now abide to see him use aricht that indifferent
actioun, quhilk sho her self (I dout not) did often through licentionsnes abuise.
Be this we may note the nature of the hypocrites, and interior enemeis of the
Kirk, quha althocht in their particularis not concerning religioun their will
be nane in shaw mair freindlie to the godly nor they: it how soon matteris of
religioun or concerning ye honor of God cummis in hand, O then ar they no
langer abill to contene or brydill their passiounis, even as heir Micholl
defendit her husband, euin in the particulares betwixt him and her awin father,
bot his dancing befoir the Arc, to the honor of God, culd sho na wise abide.
Now this far being said for the methodick oppinning up of the text.

The applicatioun of all.
The applicatioun of the purpose to (...).
IT restis only to examine how pertiuentlie this place dois appertene to ws and
our present estait. And first as to ye personis, the pepill of God and ye
natiounis their enemeis togidder with chair prydefull persute of David and
Goddis may not avill deliverance. Is their not now ane sinceir professioun of
ye treuth amangest ws in this I Will oppugnit by ye natiounis about, haiteris of
ye holy word. And do we not also as Israel profes ane only God, rewlit by
his pure word allmerlie on ye other part. Ar they nocht as Philistinis adoreris
of legionis of Goddis, and rewlit by ye foolish traditiounes of men: Have they
not as ye Philistinis been continually ye perseweris, and we as Israel ye
defenderis of our native soill and patrie: Nixt have they not now at ye last
euin like ye Philistinis cummed out of their awin soilles to persew ws and
spread them selfis to that effect upon ye greit valley of our seas
presumptuouslie threatening ye destructioun and wrak of ws? Bot thridlie hes
nocht our victory been far mair notabill then that of Israel: And hes not ye
ane been als weill wrocht by ye hand of God as ye other? For as God by blawing
in the toppis of ye trees with his michtie wind put ye Philistinis to flicht,
hes he not euin in like manner by brangling with his michtie wind their timmer
castellis scattred and shakin them a sunder to ye wrak of ane greit part and
confusioun of the haill: Now that we may resembill Israel als weill in ye rest
of this actioun, quhat triumph restis ws to make for ye crouning of this
blissit comedy: Cum to bring amangst ws the Ark with all rejoicing. Quhat is
ye Arc of Christianis under grace bot ye Lord Jesus Christ quhom with joy we
bring amangest ws, quhen as receiving with sincerity and glaidnes ye new
Testament in the blude of Christ our Savior, in our heart we believe his
promeissis, and in word and deid we beir witness thairto befoir ye haill world,
and walkis so in ye licht as it becummis ye sons of the same. This is ye
worthiest triumph of our victory that we can make. And althocht their will
doutlessie be money Micholis amangest ws, let ws rejoice and praise God for the
discovery of them, assuring our self they were never of ws accompting all them
to be against ws that ather reioysts at ye prosperity of our enemeis, or
reioysis not with ws at our miraculous delyuerance. For all they that gatheris
not with ws they scatter. And let ws also diligently and warlie try out these
traftie Micholis. For it is in that respect that Christ recommendis unto ws the
wisdom of Serpentis, not thairby to deceive and betraise vtheris, (no: God
forbid) bot to arm ws against ye deceit and treasoun of hypocritis that gois a
bout to trap ws. And leist that their greit benefits quhilk God hes bestowit
upon ws be turnit be our unthankfulness in ane greater curs in serving for
testimonies at ye latter day against ws to ye procuring of our doubill stripis.
Let ws now to conlude bring in ye Arc amangest ws in two respectis befoir
mentionit. Seeing we have alreddy received the Gospel, first by constant
remaning at ye purity of ye treuth, quhilk is our may certane covenant of
saluatioun in ye onlis meritis of our Savior: And nixt let ws so reform our
defylit lives as becumis regenerat Christianis, to ye greit glory of our God,
ye utter defeacing of our adversaries ye wickit, and our vuspeikabill comfort
both herr and ellis for ever.

AMEN.

THE natiounis bandit against the Lord of micht,

Both sea and land beset us every quhair.
Braggis threatened us ane ruinous decay
Quhat came of that? the ischew did declair
The wyndis begouth to toss them heir and their
The Seas begouth in foming waves to swell
The number that escapt, it fell them fair
The rest were swallowed up in golfis of Hell
But how were all their thingis miraculous done
God lewch at them out of his heavenly throne.
