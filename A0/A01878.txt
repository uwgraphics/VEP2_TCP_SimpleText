A New Ballade intytuled / Good Fellows must go learn to Dance.


GOod fellows must go learn to dance,
the brydeall is full nere a:
There is a brall come out of France,
the tryxt ye hard this year a.
For I must leap and thou must hoppe,
and we must turn all three a:
The fourth must bounce it like a top,
and so we shall a gree a.
I pray thee Mynstrell make no stop,
for we will merye be a.
The Brydegrome would give twenty pound,
the marriage day were paste a:
ye know whiles lovers are unbound,
the knotte is slyper fast a.
A better man may come in place,
and take the Bryde away a.
God send our wilkin better grace.
our pretty Tom does say a.
God Vycar axe the banes apace,
and haste the marriage day a.
A band of belles in Bauderycke wise,
would deck us in our kind a:
A shurte after the Moryce guyse,
to flounce it in the wind a.
A wyffler for to make the way,
and may brought in with all a:
Is brauer then the Sun I say, (.)

and passes round or brall a.
For we will tripe so trick and gaye.
that we will pass them all a.
Draw to dauncinge neighbors all
good fellowshyppe is best a:
It skylles not if we take a fall,
in honoringe this feste a.

The Bryde will thank us for our glee,
the world will us behold a:
O where shall all this dauncinge be,
in Kent or at cotsolde a.
Our Lord does know then axe not me,
and so my tale is told a*


ADewe sweet heart, a dew
Sith we must part,
To lose the love of you,
It greues my heart.
Once again come kiss me
sith I so long must mys thee
(...)inge heart shall wyshe thee,
To ease me of my smarte.
And though I now do leave thee,
It will I not deceive thee,
But come again and wedde thee,
Even for thy just desarte.
Sir Launcelotte comes again sir,
So men do say:
Tom toss will sail to Spain sir,
By Tyborne away.
Subtoll sin will have her.
Though wyttie Watte do crave her,
yet cuttinge clown shall save her,
Unless he lose his pray.
And though ye be so wyle ye,
And she do look so hyle ye:
At length she will begyle ye,
And (...)span ^he best ye may.
(...)s so coye sir,
She (...) be sold,
W(...)s her joy sir,
T(...) told:
Ra(...) will not blade it,
Jack(...)r will not swade it,
The Py^lbowes are not made it,
Thereof ye may be bold.
Although ye now have cought her,
ye will repent here after,
For farther ye have sought her,
Then I have thought ye would.
Finis.
