Mon heur viendra. Imprinted at London by Henry Middelton, for Rafe Newbery,
dwelling in Fleetestreat a little above the Conduit. 1575.



To the right Honorable and virtuous Lady, Anne Countess of Oxenford. Geffray
Fenton desires long and Honorable life.
SInce the first creation of men, every one perticularly has found so many
calamities and travels of life, that it has been a perpetual industry in all
to search wherein rested this true and assured contentment, which we call
felicity. Some referred it to the prosperity of riches, and with others it
was established altogether in virtue. Whereof as the one, being but the
possessions of fortune and therefore both uncertain and miserable, brings with
it his proper confusion: So, the other aspiring to immortality, has no
subjection to frailty or infirmity, and therefore justifying it self by his
own nature, is worthily adjudged that felicity which the world so much
desires. What man is possessed with a spirit of virtue, in the same man is
truly expressed the similitude and action of be atitude, the one holding such
community with the other, that as virtue is the forge whereon this sovereign
good is wrought, so, felicity is the effect and stipend of the same, and they
both no other thing then the very heaven and residence of God, wherein the
soul is fourmed and created. No man feels a perfect taste of felicity, if
with all he embrace not virtue, no more then the savor of meat is pleasant to
the sick whose senses suffer imperfection, infirmity, or error: nor any
stands destitute of beatitude, whose mind communicates with desires and
mocio^s of virtue, as to those whose faith is unfeigned and incorrupt, is
assured the estate of eternity and perpetual Patrimony. This virtue, besides
that it is originally administered by divine influence and grace, has also his
natural means subsisting to his perfection and stabilitie, which the ancient
followers of Philosophy and wisdom, have referred to the study and science
of good things, as coollers best apt and convenient to blase the true coat and
figure of virtue. Sciences say they, prepare men's minds to virtue, and all our
thoughts and mocions, being made foul by our first corruption, are yet
repurged by the qualety of Science and knowledge, as the dross and scumme of
metal is mortified by the industry of workers to whom the profession
appertains: Infinite are the commodities of knowledge and science, which
shining in their perticularities as well in the works of many wise me^, as in
their life and examples, it agrees not now to recompt the^: Only, there are
few who in study and knowledge find out notable rules to govern the body,
and excellent doctrines to qualify the mind, with autentike counsels besides,
to exercise the residue of the man in the necessary consideration of his
mortality and frailenes. Science traueleth to the favor of posterity, and is
the assured protector of men's acts and monuments against forgetfulness and
envy. It is the pillor of prosperity, and infallible retrait and refuge in
adversity: It fashioneth the rudenes and ignorance of youth, and restrains
the crabbednes of age to modesty and civility. It inuents councels to the
accomplishme^t of our affairs, and ministers to our minds stabilitie and
resolution of courage. Yea Science and knowledge are the very seminary or
seeds out of which do bud all our flourishing blossoms of virtue, and wherein
our sprites are made hable to judge of high and hard things, and so raised to
those holy desires of well doing, wherein all good men reapose their
sovereign contentment.

These happy fruits of Science and learning raise Noble personages into
merit and dignity, and sets a work excellent wits to record the reputation
of their greatness and virtues, dividing the doings of their life some into
warnings to avoid harms and miseries, and some into precepts the better to
establish examples and draw to imitation. And as above all others of our time,
your honor has been always right worthily noted a diligent follower of those
Arts and studies which best serve to the declaracion and glory of true virtue
and piety: So at the contemplation of the same, I am bold to bring forth
(under the protection of your Ladyship (this treatise containing moral
discourse sorted with Philosophy, and some texts of Divinity: Not that I hold
it worthy your view and judgment, but (according to good meanning,) to use it
as an interpreter of the devotion and service wherein I am vowed to your
Ladyship and your honorable house and parents. And where, in the intentions of
the writers in these days this is a lamentable error, that they consider not
those customs and good doctrines agreeing with holy virtues and commandments
of the law of God, but think it is a great testimony of their singularity
and excellency to publish under fourmes of speech, matter either merely vain
in it self, or at least unfruitful to the use and instruction of life. I
thought good by the experience of their writings, not to be so curious to set
out this work with elegancie of phrase and Retoricke, as to exhibit precepts
to live well, joining to that small eloquence of words I have used, a diligence
withal to dress and institute conversation and manners; the same being the
direct line that leads to virtue, which (without this) is but the figure and
image of that it ought to be. Wherein having respect to modesty, I am far
here from meaning to challenge the labors of others, and much less seek to
obtrude upon mine own any dignity or merit, but refer me and my travels to
the opinion of your Ladyship, whom I humbly be seech, as touching the order and
parts of Art in the Book, to judge them with that property of favor which
is wont to conster nothing to blame: and for the textes and precepts whether
moral, civil, or of divinity, your Ladyship, in all the works you shall read,
can not find better doctrine, then in the life of your honorable Father, in
whose manner and actions is fulfilled a more full example of virtue, then in all
the rules and similitudes which my pen can deliver. And as stones of rare and
precious price express their luster better in gold then in any other metal,
so, good and well qualefied discourses are holden so much the more noble and
dear, by how much are worthy and excellent the persons to whom they are
presented, the dignity of the one supporting and amplifying the nobility of
the other. And as trees transplanted or removed out of their natural stock
into a better, become both more fair and goodly to behold, and yield a fruit
more pleasing the taste: In like sort, a work of learning drawn out of his
proper Author and recommended to some noble and virtuous personages, becomes so
much the better received, and with a fruit more liked, by how much it is
incorporate in the virtues and name of an excellent patron. In which respect,
knowing that there shines in your Ladyship a virtue of learning and judgment,
as does the pearl in the gold, and that your mind is divinely inclined to the
co^templation of virtuous studies, I beseech you let this be admitted amongst
the public momuments of your virtue, though far unworthy of your noble
desire, yet, being covered with the wings of your authority and name, it may
be holden so much the more perfect and plawsible, by how much it is an imp
grafted in the soil of your greatness, and enritched with the gold of your
name and virtues, Referring the faults rather to the infirmity of my skill and
knowledge, then to my desire and will which is wholly dedicated to the service
of your right honorable Father and his house.

At my chamber in the Black Friars in London the fourth of February. 1575.
Your honors humbly to dispose and command. Geffray Fenton.

FINIS.
To the Governor Angulo, declaring many good doctrines, with other
consolations to such as are Widowers.
THe fourth of January, I received your letters, which standing albeit more
upon variety of words then necessity of matter, yet they well expressed your
settled grauetie, and no less resembled our ancient friendship. Amongst
other things bearing praise to your behavior, I am glad you have forsaken the
wars, and given over the regiment of Nanarre, for that I hold those people
hard to reclaim, and not easy to govern: And in this common absence of ours,
albeit we could not conveniently communicate in the state and parts of our
private conversation, yet, for that you were employed out of the realm, I
remained always in desire to know how you kept society with fortune,
because such are the checkes and mutations which she bringes generally upon
the people of the world, that she neither dissembleth with the stranger, and
much less pardons such as be natural. For which cause Cicero writing to his
friend Attiquus, restrayneth one friend to wish to an other more then these
three things, Three desires amongst friends
to enjoy health, to possess honor, and not to suffer necessity, the same
well expressing a Christian modesty, and truly agreeing with human reason:
For, to him that has sufficiency to furnish ye use and necessity of his
life, what remains to be required more? who enjoys continual health,
lacks nothing to make up the full felicity of his worldly delites: and what
can that man have lost in this world who never lost the reputation of honor?
Therefore, neither I for you, nor you to me, are bound to desire more one for
an other, then to have health for the solace of our transitory time: to enjoy
a compotent measure of wealth for the administration of our life: and to be
raised to honor by the which we may retain reputation: For, as all other
things are passed to us by fortune, not to honor us, but to affront us, So,
sir, I wish you this moderation, to rest contented with that which God has
bestowed of you, and give him often recompense of humble thanks for taking you
out of so many dangers: for, as much do we owe to God for the dangers from
which he delivers us, as for the great wealth and dignities whereunto he has
always raised us.

The property of Gods love toward us.
God is so good and loves us with so sweet affection, that always he requires
us, continually he does us good, never ceasseth to visit us, and seldom
spares to advertise us: yea, he handles us not as our offenses deserve, but
as his mercy wills: evil should it stand with us sniners if, with the rod
of sin, God should do present justice, seeing that such is the horrer and
infamy of sin, that if imediatly with the fact, God would put us to
punishments, our souls would be carried forthwith into the bottomes of hell.

As it is suffered in the high and hidden secrets of God, to dissemble some
things, to pardon others, and correct the rest: so let us remember that God
uses no small mercy to him whom he chastises in this world, since that, to
whom he gives no affliction, it seems he is of him much forgotten: Therefore
when God administreth to us diseases, sorrows, deaths, and infelicities, they
be not things wherewith he chastises us, but necessary matters by the which
he visits our frail condition: wherein his intention is not to loase us, but
to admonish us: not to make us stumble, but to hold us from falling: not to
poison us, but to purge us: not to make us slide into sin, but to call us to
amendment of behavior: so that with this full measure of bounty and mercy,
he gives us not only that which we ask, but prepares us more to that which he
would we should demand of him: this gives me occasion to smile that our power
being little, our selves so small a thing, and our knowledge so slender, yet we
think and conster to great importance all our enterprises, when in deed, that
which in our opinion we hold most profitable, takes sometime a contrary
habit, and becomes most hurtful and against us.

By means whereof, the Lord, with good reason using his wonderful mercy,
takes from us those occasions wherewith we may offend him, and leads us in the
exercise of such things as stand us in most steed to serve him.

God deals in one sort with the Christian sinner, and in an other manner with
the just man: to the sinner, he pardons his offense, and from the just, he
takes away the occasions to sin: by which, we find that we stand more
deeply bound to him which suffers us not to fall, then to him that lendes us
his hand to help us up again. This much (sir) to instruct you in patience for
the loss of so good a wife, whose death, if you lament in the office of a good
husband, I have not ben without my sorrow, according to the duty of a faithful
friend: And albeit there is no doubt but your wife was a right worthy member of
a noble house, and therewithal plentifully replenished with every condition
appertayninge to the virtue and modesty of a woman, yet since in her creation
she brought with her a subjection to death, I think your wisdom is too
great, to make that grievous to you, which nature ordeyneth common to all: yea
if in your wife were fully filled a full example of all perfection, That, that
is common to all, ought not to be intolerable to one.
you can not in better sort express your zeal, then to suffer God to have his
will without grudge: And if you reioysed in the use of so happy a wife whilst
she lived, let your gladness still continue, for that you hope she is now
happily laid up with God, with whom this is one familiar property, that the
more honest we be, the less while we live, for that being dear to him he does
the sooner draw us to his kingdom. I know that in your wife, God had
expressed a spirit of great meekness to you, made her very acceptable to her
neighbors, most plawsible to your parents, and very pitiful to the poor,
wherein by how much she was agreeable to all and her nature hurtful to none,
by so much have you to hope that she is already in the way to her salvation.
But seeing she is dead, and now set in the place of Gods eternal appointment,
and since in the world is no power eftsoon to raise her, let her rest at quiet
in the joys of Paradise, and resort you hereafter to a resolute patience.
Become imediatly careful for your life, and leave of those funeralles, and
vain ceremonies for the dead, seeing that if God has fulfilled his will to
call her to him, it is to place her in his tabernacle of eternal rest, and
leaving you still in the world, he does it to none other end but to give you
time of amendment: For where God promises to man long and many days, it is
under this warning, that he give order to the correction of his life. Many
times have I spoken, and written, that the sound and noise of Belles, does not
so much benefit the dead, as do good to those that live, for that as the dead,
being without sense are also void of nature and ability to resume remorse,
so to such as live the Belles give warning of death, as those that are already
departed, yea they pronounce that we shall all be buried, as such as are
already put in the grave, and no more remembrance remain of us then of them
that lie covered with claye: which makes me still maintain, that albeit to
the dead the Belles are merly unprofitable, yet, to the living, they serve as
officers to somon us to the fatal banquet. They call us to prepare our
reckoning, and make us ready to appear before our sovereign judge to hear
our sentence: yea they put us in remembrance of the last hour of our miserable
life, and then as I know none that wish to have been Emperors, so there is no
doubt but many desire to have lived in the state of poor heardsmen: But now to
persuade with you somewhat familiarlie, as well to witness my good will, as to
warn your frailty, I wish you to use patience, not so much to express your
grauetie, as to solace the heaviness of your mind: and by so much have you
need to call for aid to the spirit of God, by how much the greatness of your
loss seems to exceed the resistance of flesh and blood: consider that to
render retribucion is a duty of nature, and a debt to be paid either in
youth, in age, or at other season, and that not in the hand and discretion of
man, but at the will and good pleasure of God, with whom we have no power to
contend, for that the things which he commands ought to be accomplished,
and what he wills, is well worthy to be approved, being impossible that he
should exact any unjust thing, he that is even the self supreme and
sovereign justice. Be it (sir) that you are sorry for her death, of whom can
you redemaund your loss but of death, against whom there is neither
prescription nor authority: It is he in whom is wrought the very effect and
stipend of sin, and it is he that is the fearful tirant over the world,
Death the very effect and stipend of sin.
who yeeldes no compassion to the tears of men, takes no care of their sighs,
scorns at their complaints, and plays with their afflictions: he makes
great kings fall as low as the ground: he deuides their principallities,
destroys their heirs: he confoundes the proud and mighty, and rayseth the
humble and meek: he neither pardons old men, nor pitieth the young sort:
yea he has authority to call all men to reckoning, and no man to demand
reason of him. The Philosopher Secundus, being asked what death was, Answered
that it was an eternal sleep, a terror of riches, a desire of the miserable,
What death is.
a separation of friends, a voyage uncertain, a robber of men, a beginning of
those that live, and an end of such as die. Death has this absolute liberty
to enter where he list without knocking at the gate: condemn whom he will and
not hear them speak, and carry away what he thinks good, without that even
the highest authority either can or dare resist him. Yea, we must be pleased
with what he leaves us, and not complain of that he takes from us.

I doubt not but it is grievous to you to feel the want of so dear a wife,
as well for the solace of your person, as direction of your house and children:
but seeing the chances of mortal creatures do show that al men are subject to
the law of nature and fortune, All men subject to the law of nature and
fortune.
and that of necessity this must pass so: put on a good countenance to the
world, and shake of all inward heaviness of mind, seeing ye care of things
impossible is vain and only proper to weak men: you know also that in this
troublesome life, many mo in number are the things that amaze us, then those
that hurt us: And therefore to weep much, to sigh often, to sorrow always, to
wear attire of dule, to flee society of friends, to retire into desolate and
private places, and to delight in solitarines, be, in one of your grauetie,
matters more to be rebuked, then affected, seeing, that as too great joy
estrangeth the heart into the like, so, for the most part much parplexitie and
sorrow, bring with them the effect of despair: You ought not for the death of
your wife, to be negligent in the administration of your house, careless in ye
state of your health, forgetful to entertain the reputation of your honor,
nor unmindful to direct your revenue: For the passions and afflictions of the
heart, Passions of the mind cured with the longnesse of time.
are never cured by new grieves, but with the longnesse of time. One of the
greatest travels that we suffer in this transitory race, is, that sorrows and
grieves enter our hearts suddenly, which afterward we cannot expel but with
great time and virtue: And therefore we ought not at the first to urge a
troubled mind to forget his pain, but rather to persuade to moderate it: for
that at the beginning the mind receives more comfort in debating the harm,
then in speaking of the remedy: And therefore to a mind afflicted with green
sorrows, the best remedy is to defer them, until by time they be more apt
to receive consolation: For as tract of time carries with it a law of
forgetfulness of things past, so to a heart grieved, The remedy of a heart
grieved.
ye true and sovereign plasters, are, temperance, time, and forgetfulness: So
that, neither because you are a widower, nor in respect of your passions, you
ought to commit to negligence the order of your person nor the nouriture of
your children: for as it is no small fully to weep for the dead whom we have
no power to recover, so it can not but be a great madness to be careless of
them that live standing in the way of perdicion: withal, no man is bound to
raise up again such as are dead, but every one is tied to this duty, to give
succors to them that live. I hope (sir) you will not lay before you ye example
of your neighbor and friend Roderico, who as soon as he was in the state of a
widower, put the cool on his head, eat not upon any table cloth, was not
served in vessel of silver, took not his seat in a chair, was not seen to
look out of a window, in two months did not wash his face, and in a whole
year did not lie out of his clothes: All which I allege to you not so much
to condemn Roderico for his folly past, as to put you in remembrance that to
continue in ceremonies, is to offend god, and abuse the reputation of a wise
man. One of the greatest benefits that a man can have in this life, is, to be
thankful to Gods providence and not to attribute any thing to fortune. The
resolute man is neither changed by a froward fortune, nor raised into
presumption by any prosperity, but stands as a tree well rooted which albeit
is shaken with diverse winds, yet none can make it fall: And be it that
adversity make some mutation in goods, yet it ought not to exchange the
person, and much less have power over our wisdom: For the shamefast and
noble mind loses much more in loasing that he deserves, then if he lost all the goods he was possessed of: by which reason I account that no loss which
falls in transitory goods, if, with the loss of them, he recover his shame
and wisdom: for let not that man think he has found little, which has
found himself: it is a thing to be wondered at, and no less worthy of
slander that for the loss of any thing of right mean value, men omit no
pain nor cost to recover it: but if they loase shame, patience, continency,
yea and conscience too, they will neither be sorry for losing them nor make
great search to recover them. Oh corrupt nature of ours, which cares not how
we fail, and makes less reckoning to go the right way, and that which worse
is, after we have followed error, and fallen from a fair path into a foul
puddle, we will not only not search to find our selves, but (according to our
full wickedness) we will not see nor confess that we are lost. All things in
this world (what vile and base estimation so ever they bear) we do not only
make care and cost to keep them, but also seek out others to join with us
for their safety, except our selves: who not only forbear to watch and keep
our selves, but also we search others to help to loase us. I wish you for end,
that you give over to be private, and enter into the discharge of the requests
and legacies of your wife: so shall you express a dearer remembrance of her,
then with all the funeral ceremonies you can use: for as she keeps now no
reckoning whether you are served upon a table, at in a chair, or use your
other observations of dignity, so, you can not yield a more worthy recompense
to the affection she bare you, then to visit hospitalles, and haunt sermons,
and rather express the office of a true Christian, then mourn in the habit
of a pitiful wydower.

From Logronio the xj. of August. 1523.
To Sir Peter Giron, banished into Oran, comforting such as live in exile.
IT is written in the wonderful visions of the prophet Daniel, that two Angels
disputing before God, the one mayntained that it was not meet to put the
Hebrews in liberty, least they were converted to the Persians, and the other
proved it necessary to give them license, to the end they might do Sacrifice
and reedifie the temple of Jerusalem: by which may be inferred, that, that
which amongst the wicked is called stubburnes, with ye good sort is named
zeal. This I write to bring into discourse the contents of your Fathers Letter
and yours, in which I find such contraritie, that it is hard to Judge which
is greater, either the sorrow of the Father, or the constant mind of the
Son: the Father expressed great heaviness seeing his Son sent into Exile,
using the nature of a pitiful Father, and the Son (according to the
property of a noble mind) bears this disgrace without grudge or grief: if
this banishement had pleased your Father, and you likewise had declared signs
of disdain and dispight, he had abused the dignity of a father, and you
transgressed the law of a valiant Knight: but seeing you both perfourm yt which
you ought, you have no reason to distrust of yt which you desire: For my part,
to satisfy the duty I owe to the one, and exercise the good will I bear to
the other, I thought it agreeing with your estate, and my profession, to
recommend unto you these Particular instructions, which if you find Tedius to
read, you shall at least feel wholesome to observe, specially containing
points of Consolation in your present banishement: Now is the time wherein you
are to call into exercise your Ancient wisdom to govern you, your settled
discretion to minister consolation, and your valiant mind to entertain the
reputation of your honor by some worthy enterprise which three things if you
omit, you shall be holden a banished man even in your own City, where putting
them in execution being exiled, you shall be sure to increase ye renown of a
valiant knight. It is a verteous disposition to yield compassion to ye
afflicted, but nature most of all does challenge it of those, The bond of a
friend.
who proving an estate of necessity, have found comfort in others. And albeit
one friend can owe no more to another, then to remedy his necessities, and
comfort his adversities: yet the words of a friend do give life to the heart of
his friend, if to the same be joined effects of true affection: and as
prosperity and adversity have such society by kind, that the one follows
the other as the shadow does the man, Prosperit and adversity have society
together by nature.
so also such perplexities as are fastened within a heart are hardly fogotten
but with ye passions of another mind ye languisheth, according to this example:
At ye death of ye only son of Diomedes ye Greek (and upon whom depended ye
possibility of succession) there appeared to this mourning father many
affections of many his noble friends: amongst ye press of others that came to
visit and comfort his sorrows, there resorted a pore woman demanding justice:
Diomedes, seeing her weep, and as it were accompany him in his sorrowful
moodes, and his other friends to deliver only reasons of consolation without
tears, told them ye albeit his ears had received ye impression of their
words, yet none had made passage into his heart but the sorrowful compassion of
that simple woman, in whom I have received (says he) so much the more comfort,
by how much I see her heart suffers ye self same sorrows which by effect I
feel. According to the conformity of this answer (sir) you may judge my
disposition, and therwithal take occasion to give faith to my words, and
believe ye affection of my heart: for by ye faith of a friend I swear unto you,
that as I have always followed you with an unfeigned zeal, so your present
misfortune stands in such compassion with me, that if to my want were joined
wealth, and with my will were matched convenient liberty, you should know that
though I am innocent of your fault, yet I would be partner of your pain: or if
as you stand in full power to distribute and dispose your goods, you had also ye
faculty to impart your perplexities, ye world should be judge whether my
frendshp stretch to affect your goods, or to communicate with your fortune and
calamity: And as I cannot but confess that you have always expressed toward
me one perpetual nobility and bou^tie of mind, so I hope you will not deny but
I have retributed that recompense which belongs to ye power of so poor a
friend: But as I know you have this property in nature to keep in continual
memory the good turns you receive of others, so, if I forget the benifites
which you have bestowed of me, let my profession suffer indignity by the which
I hold ye countenance of my reputation: and so will I wade no further in
protestation, since great offers are used amongst staungers, and good deeds
ought to be familiar with true meaning friends: I know this banishement may
breed you some conceyt by the opinion which this court may have of you, and I
doubt not but as much the Joy of your enemies will dispight you, as the
displeasure of your friends will grieve you, for that (in a chance of
calamity) most men are more sorry for ye their enemies can say, then for the
martyrdom they endure. Plutarke in his Apothegmes, recites of a famous
Captain and Lover of the Lacedemoniens, to whom a certain Reader of the
Atheniens, making his complaint, that the men at Arms in his Camp reproched
the^ of Athens, answered that as the thing that is well kept is hardely lost,
and that nothing prouokes the thief sooner then necligence, so, if ye
Atheniens had tied care and Circumspection to their words and Actions, they
had neither fallen into ye Mouths of the Lacedemonie^s, nor feared their
malice: Job says Factus sum mihi met ipsi grauis, meaning that the
misaduentures and disgraces which happen to us for the most part, our selves
do search them: For as the power of fortune is to do more harm in one hour,
then good in many Hundredth years, so when the change falls, it blindes our
eyes that we cannot deserne it, and binds our hands that we cannot help it,
Men are the instruments of our own mishapes.
making us Instruments even against our selves in the execution of our proper
mishap: But for your part (Sir) if you had either followed my direction, or
joined your self to the advice of the Constable your dear uncle, the
ignorance and rashness of your hoate youth, had not carried you thus far to
your own ruin, yea, you had prevented that which now with pain you suffer.
The vengeance which you sought to take ought not to be grounded upon so small
occasion, seeing oftentimes reason demaundes execution of a thing, which time
will not suffer to be done, by which mean are spoiled many particular causes,
not for that they were not just, but because they were not followed in season,
for as convenient is the observation of time and place to prosecute a
business, as in due season to throw the seed into the earth to the end to
have a good harvest: therefore in your quarrel or pretense of action to ye
Dukedom of Medina Sidonia, much better had it become the virtue of a noble
Gentleman, and far more surety to your title, to have demanded it in
Parliament by justice, then to recomme^d your self to the Bishop of Camore: I
have often told you that tyrants commit their trial to Arms, Tirantes use
trial by arms, but the just sort refer their causes to the arbitrament of
the Laws.
and the just sort refer their causes to the arbytrement of the Laws: Even
so, when I saw you join your self to ye good Bishop, I felt great conjecture
of the ill success of your cause, in which I doubted not but he would raise
occasion to undo you, that erst made no conscience to put in peril the whole
Realm, disobey the king, deceive his confederates and dissemble even with his
own opinion. For where in one man do meet incertaintie of affection, and
malice of nature, there is no other hope in that man, then distrust, Perjury,
words, and revenge: I put you in remembrance of all these, more to reprehende
you then to comfort you, and with all to reduce to your knowledge, that if you
suffer any present affliction, think it is for no offense presently committed,
but for the falt that then you did: for as every offense has his punishment,
so God being bound to no time uses to visit our old insolences, even whom we
account our selves most innocent: More (...) is it to your wise friends, to
suffer your banishment obeying the Prince, then to see you Duke of Medina with
the displeasure of his Majesty: and far better shall you express that which
is looked for of you, if simply you attribute to the infirmity of your
discretion, that which in good equity cannot but carry the very nature and
habit of a great falt. Oh how well does it become the reputation of a valiant
knight to deserve to be holden gracious in the sight of his prince, and with
good and true services, to enterteine the estate and favor he has of him,
expressing always this true effect and example of ready obedience, that if
either in the court, the Kingdom, or any dominion of the Prince, there move
any faction, trouble, quarrel, tumult or mutiny: he may with liberty be
heard speak, and give occasion to be employed: but not of himself to practice
secreat confederacy, nor yet without Authority to intrude himself into the
council or managing of affairs of estate: For the business of kingdoms
conteyne in them many secret difficulties, more dangerous to be reformed, then
easy to weeld, which we see daily in sundry commonweals evil governed, and
worse reformed, for that, for the most part, the popular sort is ready to
revolt, and very hard to be appeased: great pain had Catiline to reform Rome,
Socrates Athens, Ptolome Pentapolis, Promotheus Egypt, and Plato the Siciliens:
But in the end of all these enterprises, where some of these noble men escaped
death, the rest suffered banishement, and their comonweales notwithstanding in
more broyle then before: But now to the matter of your exile, and the remedies
proper to men in your fortune, In which if I satisfy not your passion, I doubt
not but the law of our friendship will lead you to judge well of my reasons,
assuring you that I had rather succor you then comfort you. For banished men.
Weying (Sir) with your present condition being banished in Afrika, the
consideration that you are of the free Country of Spain, I doubt not but the
remembrance of the pleasures you have passed in Spain, will make this exchange
more painful to you being now restrained in Afrika, for the love of our
country is so natural to us and we so partial in our proper affections, that
albeit fortune make us forsake our native country, yet nature will never
suffer us to for get it: yea so great a vehemency has the love which most men
bear to their natural clymates, yt they will rather endure any injury against
their persons, then to hear their countries evil spoken of the same
parcialitie proceeding for that men do not acknowledge that they are of the
earth, live in the earth, and must return to the earth: when there is nothing
belonging to them, but ye which they carry with them to their grave, Socrates
instructed his disciples not to atribute to themselves any particular place or
country: for (says he) albeit ye eternal providence gives us peculiar means
to cloth us, and private houses to defend ye injury and passions of the air,
yet nature has left to us all in common the universal earth, which since, by
ye ambicion of men has been divided into Cantles. Plutarke, in his book of
exile reports that Hercules the Thebain, being asked by the Sidoniens of what
country he was, answered: I am neither of Thebes, Athens, nor Licaonia, but
naturally of the whole country of Greece: Socrates seems to be of the same
opinion to ye great Sacrificator Architus, by whom being asked of what place he
was, he answered: that he was borne in ye world, and a natural heir of all the
world: Plutarke rehearses also that in the I Will of Cobde in Greece, was a
Lineage of Grecians called Agites, descended of ye notable Greek Captain
called Agis the good: amongst these Agites this law was specially observed,
that none durst call himself natural of the I Will, unless he had done some
valiant act, meaning ye it is the country that ought to be commended for
bringing forth such men, and not the people to be praised to be either of this
or that Region. So that (Sir) for my part, joining my self to the manner of
these Island men, me thinks I have greater reason to esteem you a valiant
Affrikan Captain, then a verteous Spanishe knight, seeing that ye honor which
you lost in Spain, you have recovered in Affrika: yea, if you confer the
vanities which you used in Spain, with the exercise you follow now in Affrika,
you shall find that banishment, better then ease, does lead you to judge of
the precious value and estimation of time, yea, it will minister this
discretion to you that if you feel any passion, it will appear to you more by
opinion, then by reason. In Spain you were noted to be a painful follower of
the pleasures of the field, a pleasant deviser with Ladies, a sweet
companion at sumtuous Banquites, given over to the disorders of the Court, to
go to bed at midnight and rise at mid day, all which though they be delights
of a young courtier, yet they are no exercises of a valiant knight, for the
titles, and virtuous renownes of our Ancestors, were not gotten by enterprises
of Hawking and Hunting, but with serving their kings in the dangers of wars:
The exercise which we are told you follow now in Orane, as to be sturring
early, to break your fast standing and whilst your Armor is in lacing, to
be ready with the foremost to distress the Turks, to acquaint your ear with
the Music of the tromppet, to be painful to march, and discreet to follow,
and in all enterprises, to give example of courage to your Soldiers: out of
these differences you may gather whether it is more agreeable to your renown,
and profitable to your estate, to be esteemed a valiant Captain, or an Amorous
Courtier: besides, in Spain you could but recyte the deeds of others, and now
the whole court is in discourse of the dangers you escape. Writers of
histories are tied to the factes of particular men, and to express in their
Cronicles that in such a time, such a thing was done, in such a season, such an
enterprise performed: but it belonges to the honor of a good knight not only
to say I was a leader in such a war, but also to bear upon his body the signs
of the perilles he had past: So that in consideration of the Success of this
Banishement, I see not but it is a Fortune necessary, Happy is the punishment
by the which we are passed into greater perfection.
and an Estate working glory to your House, and geeues no occasion of greeffe
to your person: For right Blessed is that Marterdome by whose Pains we are
passed into greater perfection: The Consul Siluanus holding part with the
SILLANS, in full Senate reproched Marius scornefully that he was to ambicious
of honor, being so base of lineage: To whom Marius answered, I confess
(says he) that thou art more aunciently descended then I, euenso I cannot deny
but that I am betrer man then thou, because, where thy house is not furnished
but with painted Armories which thou have inherited of thy Auncesters, thou
may see in mine many streaming ensigns which I have woonne with the peril
of my life: Then think your self happy, for that in Spain you were no
better then Siluanus, but in Affrika you are equal in Prowes with Marius, with
whom, in place of painted Armories where with you were wont to hang your
house in Spain, you shall now return not only with ensigns besprent with
blood, but also expressing your triumphs over ye common enemy of Christian
faith. There has been in the Ages past many great Personages, who no less
desirous of renown, then willing to win it by virtue, did not only not grudge
when they were Banished by Authority, but also of themselves and for
themselves made a willing choice of exile, following the opinion and example of
the right worthy Captain Alcibiades, who in his Familiar device was wont to
say, that few men in their naturalitie or simple nature become verteous: but
the most sort following the passions of nature slide into many vices, according
to the experience of a tree far brought and new replanted, which bringes
forth fruit of far more sweet and precious taste then others: euenso more
glory and renown do follow Noble men and minds resolute in strange and
far regions, then in their proper natural countries: yea, they had rather
die poor abroad, then return home laden with wealth, and light with honor.
Was not king Pirrhus borne in a village of Athens, and afterward was called
Pirrhus the Epirote for that he vanquished that people? was not the good Scipio
bredde up in a town of Campania, to whom after was added the Surname of
Affricanus as subduing those Regions? Octauius Augustus wss nourished in
village of Belistre, and after was raised to the title of Octauius Germanicus,
because he triumphed over the Almaines, and the good Titus was found in a poor
village of Campania, and after was called Titus Palestinus, for prevailing over
ye Palestines: infinite is the number of such as have sought fame in foreign
regions, but more immortal and perpetual is ye memory of the enterprises which
by the greatness of their courage they achieved: For as no Fortune can resist
him to whom nature has given magnanimity of mind: No fortune can resist him
to whom nature has given magnanimity of mind.
so whether at home or abroad, who is more wretched then he that esteems
himself unhappy by the reputation of his courage. Many and many were the
personages in the world past, who springing of base and dark place, of small
renown, and less wealth, have, with the Fortune of their Banishment in
countries, far removed, euolted their lineage, brought honor to their
countries, reputation to their posterity, and riches to themselves. The
valiant Themistocles and great captain Phalaris, with great ignominy to their
persons and spoil of their goods, were banished out of Athens, and chased out
of al Greece: yet such equity of meede followed their just virtues, that by ye
grace and favor of king Ptolome in Alexandria, they returned home with no
less fame and honor to their country, they laden with riches to the
increase of their family: yea, Themistocles, used oftentimes to say familiarly
to his wife and children, Perieramus omnino nisi perijssemus, as who say, if
they had not been passed into the perplexities of banishment, they had utterly
perished: for fortune oftentimes plays with banished men as does the distiller
of waters with his glasses or earthen pottes, whom he takes down, not to
break or leave them, but to fill them and set them up: with this example, we
may apply ye misfortune of Joseph ye son of Jacob, in whose fall was wrought
the mean to ye Jsraelites, that afterward he was made Lord over the whole
country of Egypt, and helper of ye Hebrews: That which sometimes seems to a
man heavy and sorrowful, becomes oftentimes ye mean of his comfort and
gladness, and the same that in ye beginning seems to work his disgrace,
breeds at last the very effect of his desired fortune: even as to him that
thinks himself in ye right path, it happens ye he is out of the way, as
others suposing themselves to be miss led and gone astray, are notwithstanding
in the high way to their felicity: Camilla for a disgrace happening to him in
Rome, was banished into Campania, where his virtues and service in the wars
of that country succeeded so happily with him, that he returned to Rome not
as an offender, but in great triumph as Emperor: The just and noble Emperor
Traian, being banished out of Italy and withdrawn to the City of Agrepina,
was addopted Heir of the empire there by the Emperor Nerua, his uncle, who
communicated with him ye ensigns of the Imperial estate: by which change and
chance of fortune, Traian would often say to his familiars, yt the ba^ishment
which Domitian judged him to, was his only solicitor to the Empire. All these
histories together with the examples as well of such as chused banishment to
win true renown, as of others ye fell into exile by falt and sentence, I
have reduced (sir) to your memory, to ye end that by their wisdom you should
take comfort, and in their courage follow the example of their enterprises: for
as the doings of others are but warninges to us to direct well our estates: so
it cannot be but vain to represent unto you the banishments they suffered, if
you express not in your fortune the resolute mind which led them to the
throane of their estimation: if you show the true value and constancy of mind
duly aperteining to a christian knight, you may with the opportunity of the
wars now against ye Turk; deserve to return to Spain with as great honor:
as Camilla was received into Rome: it behooves you in that war of Affrique, to
be liberal, secret, courageous, and modest, so shall all such as are sorry for
the falt you have made here, be recompensed with gladness in ye effects of your
worthy behavior there. Say with Diogenes, that as they banishe you out of
Spain, so you banish them out of Affrique, so, shall they in short time
return to compassion for that they make you to suffer, and you in ye mean
while bear with patience the injury you suppose is done to you: Men not
accustomed to adversity have least rule over their passions.
For men not accustomed to adversity have least rule over their passions, and
such as never felt but prosperity, can little judge of the worthiness of
patience: I pray you use this modesty in ye letters you write hither, that
neither the King may perceive that you are grieved with his sentence, nor your
ennimies understand your evil lyking to that place: For no less will they
rejoice to hear you abhorred there, then they were ready to procure your
banishement from your friends and country here.

Such (Sir) as suffer exile, Priueledges of banished men.
have many notable priueledges which being incident to men, in ye estate, it is
necessary you know some, to ye end you may take benifit of ye best: it is a
prorogatiue to men exiled, ye they stand in grace of pity with every one, and
seldom maliced of any, for that in common experience men most naturally bear
grudge to such as live in wealth, and pity such as are far removed from
their comfort. Banished men during the time of their restraint are exempted
from all importunities of such as borrow money, since no man needs to doubt
but the man exiled has for the most part, want of money, and plenty of
perplexities: such as are banished have liberty to borrow of others without
either blushing or blot of conscience, for that their goods are co^fisked, and
they far from ye succor of their friends, they are the men that most stand
need of the compassion of the world.

It is suffered to the banished man, to write into his country that he is
sick, when he enjoys health, that he is in sorrow for his house, though he
feel no remembrance thereof, and that he is poor, when he has full plenty,
and al to ye end the prince should the sooner pardon his falt, and his friends
the more readily succor his wantes.

The banished man, with out breach of honor, may be suffered to break promise,
being sufficient to acknowledge the favors done to him, and to offer, when he
is restored recompense according to the bounty of a gentleman: the banished
man (without stain to his honor) has liberty to live in mean countenance
for that amongst good men his case is pitied, and with the wise no other port
expected then according to the rate and measure of his fortune.

The banished man is not subject to the terrors of law and justice, for ye
being far from his adversaries, he may sleep with out fear, and rise with out
care: he is free from the variable customs and complexions of his wife, from
the grief of ye ill demeanor of his children, and from ye distrust of his
servants, ye same being such a comfort peculiar only to exiles, yt many would
be glad to exchange their free condition, for the felicities of such
Banishement.

The banished man stands exempt from all impostes and tributes, as in whose
estate is sufficient grief without necessity of other Affliction.

The Banished man being far from his friends, lives not in care of their
calamities, and is not called to be a partner of their Quarrelles, which
liberty many seek for, who Answer for many, follow many, and spend much of
many, not of frank will, but to perform the duty they have professed. Many
more are the prorogatiues of exile, which you may boldly challenge and enjoy in
Affrika, and we by no right can demand in Spain: And yet I doubt not, but
more dear should be to you the kings Pardon to return home, then all these
goodly privileges which to your great comfort you enjoy in Affrika: For the
Puddle water in our own country carries a more sweet taste, then the most
pleasant fountain in any foreign Region: Let this be your Solace for the time
to serve and hope in God, to the end he may lead the mind of the Prince to
consent to your liberty, wherein there shall want no furtherance, which either
the Authority of your friends, or my continual council, may bring to pass.

To Don FREDERIQVE of Portingall Archbishop of Sarragoce, and Viceroy of
Catheliogne, wherein the Author recommends to him a Letter of ye Emperor M.
Aurelius.
IN the self same year wherein the Prophet Jeremie bewailed in Jerusalem the
Captivity of his people led into Babylon, Reigned in Bithinia the cruel
king Dracon, a man of deep policy in affairs of estate, and no less valiant
to bear and resist the rigoures of fortune, but withal so seueare in his
commandments, that it may be doubted whether the laws he instituted
contained more cruelty to his subjects, then commodity to his kingdoms: For
amongst other statutes or straight politiques, he ordained this law, A Law to
punish unthankfulness by death.
ye one neighbor having received of another any good turn, and afterward was
found unthankful either to requite or confess it, such one was punished
with death: for as this is a property anexed to the good nature, to forget the
benefits he does himself, and keep in continual memory ye graces he has
received of others: so to ad impunity to ingratitude, is to corrupt ye world,
even as in other offenses, to restrain justice, is to support sin and suffer
insolency, which is ye greatest error that can happen in government. This I
say sir to put my self in remembrance of the manifold benefits I have
received by you, whereunto, having no power of recompense, at least if I should
forbear to acknowledge them, I cannot avoid the merit of Dracons Law: For there
can be no such injury offered to a free mind and a bashful face, then to be
called unthankful, since such reproaches sink most deeply into the
reputation of honor: so that, though my power be small, and my possibility
less, yet I will so honor the remembrance of your benefits, yt in my will
shall be found no blame of ingratitude, nor in my life, any suspicion of honest
friendship.

At our last being together, you made me swear to grant to that you
demanded, without either liberty of excuse, or being made privy to what you
would ask, wherein as your Lordship was somewhat to oportunate, so I was not
enough distreete, for that greater is ye reason to examine a demand, then to
consent to fulfill it. But touching your request to pen for you some Letters of
M. Aurelius, I know not how I shall satisfy your desire, unless you refourme
your demand: for that of his morrall writings, I have none, but either those
which are already published, or such as he left imperfect: and for others,
which, in the rage of his youth, he wrote to his Amarus friends, as I have
already published some by ye persuasions of my private friends, so, albeit at
that time their opportunities enforced my will, yet it behooves me now not to
abuse the duty of my profession: wherein, as well by ye habit of religion, as my
faculty of a divine, I crave to be excused from writing such vanities, since,
besides the offense to my gravity, the example cannot but bring hurt to ye
chaste minds of young princes and great Ladies. But because as near as I can, I
will be thankful to your request, and leave you satisfied of my good meaning,
I have sent you the Translation of one of his Letters, wherein you may judge
with what fidelity he entertained his friends, since he used such charity
and compassion to his Enemies.

I cannot deny the glory I have obtained by this battle, and much less hide
ye perplexity I feel for thy present misfortune, M. Aurelius to Popilion
captain of the parts.
for noble minds are bound to show no less compassion to such as are
subdued, then to express joy and gladness with those that are victors: Thou
being chief of ye Partheus: did show great courage to resist, and in me the
leader of the Romans was found no want of force to fight, notwithstanding
though thou lost the battle, and I remain possessed of the victory, God
gives victories not to such as fight most, but where he loves best.
yet as I know you wilt not acknowledge this chance to happen by any want of
stomach in thee, so, it belonges to my gravity, not to atribute it altogether
to ye greatness of my virtue, since God does always minister victories not to
such as do their duties best, but to those that he loves most: for ye effect
of al things depending upon god, man can have no power command the destenie of
a battle, seeing he is not hable to stay ye course of the least planet in
heaven. Darius against Alexander, Pompeius against Ceasar, and Hanniball
against Scipio, had, above al equality, far greater armies then their enemies:
by which thou have reason to conclude with me, yt against ye anger of ye
sovereign god, cannot prevail most huge and mighty hosts: I marvel (
Popilion) yt being great in birth, valiant of stomach, welthie in goods, and
mighty in estate and dignity, why thou bear with such sorrow ye loss of
this battle, seeing ye in no worldly thing fortune is more incertaine and
variable, Fortune is most variable in the action of war
the^ in ye action of war. It is told me thou withdrawest to solitary
corners, and sekest out shaded places, thou eschewest the conversation of men,
and complaynest of ye gods, which extreme perplexities since you were not wont
to suffer in others, much less ought thou to give place to them in thy
self: so, that ye valiant man loses no reputation, for ye fortune fails
him, but is ye less esteemed if he want discressio^ to bear her mutability.

To assemble great Armies, is the office of princes, to levy huge treasures,
belonges to sovereign magistrates, to strike the ennimie is the part of a
courageous Captain, but to suffer infirmities, and dissemble mishaps, is a
property duly annexed to noble and resolute minds: So that one of the
greatest virtues that worldly men can express in their common behavior of
this life, is neither to rise proud by prosperity, Fortune has a free will to
com and go when she list.
nor fall into despair by adversity: For fortune having a freewil to come and
go when she list, ye wise man ought not to be sorry to lose her, nor rejoice to
hold her: such as in their misery show heavy cou^tena^ce, do well prove yt they
made account to be always in prosperity, which is a great folly to think,
and no less simplicity to hope for: seeing ye gifts and graces of fortune
have no other thing more certain in the^, the^ to be for ye most part in all
things most uncertain, according to ye success of ye day wherein you gave me
battle: For there thou orderedst thy camp according to a wise captain, made
choice of the place, in great policy, and tokest the advantage of the son,
as a leader of long experience: in consideration of which things, thou have
cause to complain against thy fortune which favored not thy virtue, and not
blame thy discression wherein can be found no error: Consider that in wise
and grave men, it is an office, that if they cannot do that they will, at least
they yield to time and are content with that they may: And as the verteous and
valiant mind ought not to grieve for not obteyning that which he would, but
because he desired that which be ought not: so, Popilion, I wish thee take
heed, that the Honor which so many times thou have won with the hazard of
thy valiant person in enterprises of War, He bears his misery best that
hydes it most.
be not lost at this present for want of bearing well thy Fortune, Assuring
thee that he bears his misery best that hides it most: and as of al voluble
things there is nothing more light then Renown, so in cases of war and
hazard, it is not enough for the valiant man to do what he may, but also he
is bound to attempt nothing but what he ought: For as well the consideration,
as ye execution of a fact, belongs duly to a discreet minde^ I hear thou
wanderest here and there in great uncertainty of mind, fearing that if thou
be taken of my Soldiers, thou shall be evil entreated of me, which if no man
have told thee, it is against reason thou believe it of thy self, because to
us princes of Rome, it is familiar to show our liberality to such as yield to
us, and with others that are our prisoners to communicate in great clemency:
we raise armies against camps prowdely furnished, and cities strongly walled,
but to captains in thy condition, we hold it more honorable to minster
comfort, then to ad increase of affliction: for as it suffiseth the valiant
Captain to fight against the adversary that resistes him, and dissemble with
him yt flies, so ye wise man ought to require no more of his enemy, the^ yt he
acknowledge yt he stands in fear of him: for if he fear him it is a good
argument that he may be in surety of him, because to daunted and timerus
hearts, is seldom left courage to renew an enterprise: and therefore a man takes
a greater revenge when he puts his enemy to flight, then if he take his life
from him: for the sword dispatcheth a man in a day, but fear and remorse
torment the mind continually: and better were it to suffer without fear that
which we expect in grief and sorrow, then by fear, to be always in
martyrdom: It is better to suffer that we fear then by fear, to be alvvayes
in martyrdom.
it is right terrible to flesh and blood to die of a sword, but to be in
perpetual sorrow and disquiet of mind, is the very fury and torments of hell.

If thou eschewest my presence in fear that I will not use pity to thee, thou
art abused in the opinion of my disposition, and do wrong to the reputation
and experience of my actions past: for, I never refused to show mercy to him
that asked it, and much less deceived the expectation of him that put his
trust in me: the doubt and fear that thus travel thy mind, ought not to be
so much of my person, as of the custom of fortune, who uses not to unloose
her sharp Arrows with better will against any, then such as think to be in
most security of her, her nature being such as not to meddle with those that
she finds prepared the better to assure them, but follows the fearful and
negligent, to the end to deceive them: yea, she preuayles even over the
counsels and actions of men, and being exempt to make reckoning to any, her
prerogative is to require account of all men: I assure thee oh Popilion, that
more do I fear the reuolucion of fortune at this hour, then I doubted her
before the battle: For she delites not so much to keep under the vanquished, as
to bridle and check the victors: And worse does she mean when she smiles the
fairest, then when she frowns most. But now to speak on thy behalf, I tell
thee, that without danger thou may resort to my presence, since in thy
estate is no cause of suspicion, and in my heart no malice to thy person, for in
deed that can not be called true victory, which bringes not with it some
clemency: And therefore he can not be named victorious, in whom rests intent
of rigor and cruelty: For Alexander, Julius Augustus, Titus, and Traianus
woonne more renoume by the clemency they used to their enemies, then by all
the victories they obtained in strange regions: to obtain a victory is a
thing natural and humane, but to give pardon and life, is the gift and
blessing of God, by which it comes to pass, that men esteem not so much the
greatness of the immortal God for the punishments he does, as for the mercy
he uses: notwithstanding as I can not deny but that great is the value and
estimation which we Roman Princes make of a victory woonne by battle, so also,
I assure thee, we hold it more honorable to pardon such as offend us, then to
chastise those that resist our power: therefore, if thou flee from my presence,
as fearing ye justice which I have executed upon the Romans, thou ought to
take security and courage even in that which makes thee ieolouse and
doubtful: For so much greater ought to be the clemency, by how much the
offender is in fault: and therefore as there is no offense which can not be
either forgiven or favored, So right worthily may that pardon be called
honorable and famous, which is given to an injury malicious and manifest,
since al other common and light wrongs, with greater reason we may say we
dissemble them, then that we pardon them.

The thing ye most draws me, to enter friendship with thee, is, for that in our
last capitulations, and truce, thou perfourmedst all that was concluded for the
peace, and yet in the battle, expressedst the parts of a valiant Captain,
the same giving me cause to believe, that as in the wars I found thee a just
enemy, so in time of peace thou would prove to me an assured friend.
Alexander never repented the pardon he gave to Dyomedes the tyrant, nor M.
Antho. the favor he showed to the great orator Cicero, neither shall I have
cause (I hope) to forthinke the respit I give to thy ^ife: for the noble mind,
albeit he may have occasion to be sorry for the unthankfulness of his friend, yet
has he no license to repent him of the good turns he does for him: And
therefore in the case of liberality, or clemency, by how much the person is
unworthy that receives the benefit, by so much more is he to be commended that
bestows it: For, that only may be said is given, when he that gives, gives
without respect: So that, That is frank gift which is given without respect.
he that gives in hope of recompense, deserves not to be called liberal, but to
pretend vsery: Thou know well that in the time of the battle, and when the
encounter was most hot, I offered thee nothing worthy of reproach, even so thou
have now to judge, that if in the fury of war, thou foundest me faithful
and merciful, I have now no reason to exercise rigor holding thee within the
precinct of my house: So that, if thou saw mercy in me at the instant when thy
hands were busy to spill my blood, think not that my clemency shall fail
thee, calling thee to the communion and fellowship of my table. The prisoners of
thy camp can assure thee of my dealing, amongst whom, the hurt are cured at
my charges, and the dead, buried according to the place of soldiers, wherein
if I exercised this care upon such as sought to spoil me, think there is
far greater plenty of grace to thee that comes to serve me: And so leaving
thee in the hands of thine own counsel, I wish thee those felicities, which
thy honorable heart desires.

To the Duke of ALVA, containing an exposition of a text of the Apostle, with
other antiquities.
TOgether with your letter (right excellent Duke) I have received your
particular remembrances, wherein albeit I find it strange, that you should
require advise of me, you, on whom the mighty Caesar reapposeth most for the
counsel of his affairs: yet, since it pleases you thus to exercise your
humility, and publish science in me, it belongs to my duty rather to put my
imperfection to your judgment, then to leave your desire unsatisfied: And
albeit, in the consideration of your demand, I find some perplexetie to
answer, for that your honor seems to solicit me in one thing, and your
conscience in an other: yet, I hope so to debate your difficulties, That man is
happy that has good desires.
that in your conscience shall remayn no doubt, nor your reputation subject to
stain or burden: For sweet is the felicity of that mind whose desires are
innocent, and the works of their life just.

A Knight of the Gentiles and careless of the health of his soul, delites
more in the greatness and antiquity of his race, then in the virtue whereof his
nobility took beginning, which is found contrary in the inclination and
action of the true Christian Knight: True nobility depends of virtue and al
other things are to of fortune.
For he esteems true nobility to depend of virtue, and all other things to be
of fortune: And therefore, to be a good Knight, and to a true Christian, accord
well together in the law of Jesus Christ: because to the good and true Knight,
it belongs to use courage in the effect of war, to be just in his word,
liberal of his purse, patient in adversities, and to show clemency, where he
has cause and power of revenge: all which are expressly commanded in the
divine law, and are the most true and glittering ensigns of a good christian
knight.

Saint Paul ministers this advise to his disciple Timothe, labora vt bonus
miles, willing him to travel as a good Knight, not in the toils of a laborer,
fisher, myller, or mariner, but in the labors of a good Christian Knight, in
whom it is to be esteemed no less greatness of heart to resist vices, then to
fight against enemies: And where he bids him bring forth ye exercise of a good
Knight, he means that the goodness of a Christian knight consists not in
pomp and great magnificence, but in the tranquillity and innocence of a good
conscience: for he that walloweth in the wealth of Cressus, and sleeps not in
the bosom and quietness of Abraham, holds no more then if he were Lord of a
goodly vessel replenished with corrupt and poisoned liccour: to have rich
tapistery, massiue plate, many great horses, with other preparations to sports
and pleasures, be things rather to keep our names in honor, then to
minister sauetie to our souls, and yet as I can not deem them to be
instruments to entertayne our reputation, so, with all I can not allow that
they are the very effects of our damnation: For we are bound to seek God in
humility and faith, and not to limit his power, nor debate what he ought to
determine of our estate: And as I must confess that (for the further value and
reputation of Knights and great Lords) their houses are replenished, with
children and youth of right honest sort: so I could wish that in their
negligent or corrupt education, were suffered no liberty to insolency or vice,
which then they best perform, when in themselves is expressed no example of
leude behavior: For in the virtue of the master, is wrought the effect and
example of reformation in the servant, even as the temperance of the Father is
much to instruct his son in his due humility and obedience: So that who
suffers in his servant lies, swearing, Much is in the Father, to make his
children reformed.
blasphemy, whoredoms, or other dissolute or idle disposition, albeit he be a
Knight, yet he can not worthily be called a good Knight: For that the houses of
good Knights ought to be as schools of instruction to youth, and not tauernes
to profess epicuritie: he that keeps many hawks and hounds, prepares rich
and costly banquets, holds a house of general repair, and receives the
unthrifty and banished, and he that follows the delites of the world, and
forgets his office to god, such one in his behavior bears reason to be called
a gentle Knight, for that to such belong those ornaments and enseignes, more
then to ge^tlemen following Christianity. But acoording to the advice of the
Apostle, such one aspireth to be a good Knight, who strives to be a good
Christian, The law of Christ gives no liberty to do evil.
for that by the law of Jesus Christ, none has liberty to exercise any vice.

Touching the other doubt in your letter, I know not how to give you any
general rule that has been observed in all regions, for that, according to
the diversity of nations, men have always used difference of customs:
Licurgus the law-reader of the Lacedemoniens held such in most honor, whose
beardes were most hoarie, and heads most white with age: Promotheus ordained
amongst the Egiptians, that to the people of justice was transferred most
honor: And king Dridanius was wont to say to the Scicilians, that to the
priests of the temple most honor was due: Bryas king of the Argiues gave most
honor to the Philosophers that read in schools: Numa Pompilius amongst the
Romans was of opinion that he was worthy of most reputation, to whom had
happened the victory of any famous battle: But Anaxarchus the Philosopher
ordained amongst the Phenitiens, that in a commonweal such should be most
honored, who, in time of peace, intertayned the state in tranquillity, and in
the fury of war, was found a wise and valiant protector of their limittes:
In all which, albeit there was just merit of honor and reputation, yet, in
common experience and reason of things we can not but confess more desert of
worthiness and virtue in such, whose wisdom and discreation makes them hable
to dissemble and suffer: For, to be discreet in prosperity, and patient in
adversity, is the true mocion and effect of a valiant and virtuous mind. If
you weigh these things with the nature and property of the present time, you
will conclude with me (I doubt not) but that the imperfection of your demand,
takes away necessity in me to make answer: For in these days what is more
familiar with ye most sort, then to scoff at the reverence and dignity of old
age: to disobey magistrates, despise justice, scorn the Clergy, laugh at the
want of Captains, persecute the wise sort, and betray such as follow virtue
and simplicity of life: So that in an age thus hardened, and time so
unthankful, that man takes upon him no small enterprise, who strives to be
virtuous, since virtue is a thing that prepares us to immortality, Virtue
prepares us to imortalitie
and makes us equal with the heavens: In times past, he that knew most, was
esteemed best: but now, who is most rich, is raised to most honor: So that
the condition of this age is, to esteem men so much the more, by how much they
wallowe in wealth, and to measure their reputation, not with the dignity of
their virtues, but according to the faculty and fullness of their richesse:
For worldly men are so infected with corruption, and their nature so subject to
reuolucion and change, that in cases of promotion, high office and dignity are
rather bought with money, then deserved by virtue. In times past, there was no
man areared to honor but he that deserve it: but now who are called but such
as search it with money. In the former ages, men of science were searched for
in far countries, but now though they knock at our gates, they are not
suffered to enter, no, our corruption and customs draw us to other delites. In
that golden world, there was no senate, or counsel established, where was not
resident some excellent Philosopher: and now where have we any palace, which
is not replenished with scoffers and inue^ters of vanity: such was the
felicity of those days, that he that was virtuous, had liberty to control
the wicked, where now, there is no more common subjection then that the good
sort are reproved by the vile abiects and skomme of al people: In that most
happy posterity, the good sort only had license to speak, where now the wicked
are they that know not how to hold their peace: yea in those flourishing
seasons, the chafe was sifted from ye corn, the weed disseuered from the
good herb, good men preferred, and the wicked punished, yea vice was suffered
to hold no society with virtue: For that where vice is supported by
authority, men grow worse and worse, To restrain punishment is a great error
in government.
and where punishment is restrained there insolency commaundes the laws,
which is the greatest error that can be suffered in government.

Touching your demand, what manner of people in ye time of the Gentiles were
called thieves, and the sorts of punishment they were put unto: although there
be great necessity in your request, and no less insufficiency in me to
satisfy it, yet I will answer you with the opinion of Aulus Gelius, who
discribing many orders of thieves, distinguished as well their punishments, as
some kinds of theftes, which according to the time and person that commits
them, may oftentimes be taken for faults, but not esteemed as theftes* For in
pain and judgment the qualetie with the quantetie, must be considered. The
ancients held him as a thief, who, either in the field, or town, took away
that which was an others, and made no body privy to it, or against the will of
the owner: he also was esteemed as a thief, who borrowed a horse for one days
journey, and retained him longer: he also was accounted a thief, who being put
in trust with the keepinge of other men's goods, converted them to his proper
use, as if they had been his own. Lastly he boore the name of a thief, which
borrowed any thing for ten days, and restored it not in twenty. And as all
these in their several kinds were esteemed robbers and thieves, so the law set
down for them variety of punishment: For amongst the Greeks, they were
marked on the forhead with hot yrons, to the end to be more readily known.
Punishments for thieves.
The statutes of Licurgus were to cut of their noses: Promotheus ordained that
they should be committed to children to punish them at their pleasure: by the
law of Numa Pompilius, one of their hands was cut of. But the first that
invented to cut of their ears, or strangle them upon gibbets, were the
Goathes, who, (notwithstanding in other respects were Barbarus) yet used they
severe justice to thieves and robbers: But at this day (sir) if there were
commission to hang up all the thieves in the world, I fear there would be more
want of Gibbets, then of robbers to furnish them. And greatly have we to desire
with Diogeues, that the great thieves should not so hang up the little ones,
nor the laws be made like to Spyder webbes, who suffer the great ones to
pearce and pass through without punishment, and strangle the little fly, in
whom is least offense.

To don FARDINANDO de TOLEDO, to whom ar expounded two Authorities of the
Scripture, and the custom of the Egiptians in the death of their friends.
I Have not thus long forborne to write to you, in any necligent respect, as
remembering with what devotion you required me, and with what humility and
affection I am bound to obey you: And now if my answer seem to short to
satisfy you, let the same discression which is wont to take all things in the
best, bear now with my wretched infirmity of the gowt, which has made me
such a Martyr, that much less that I have leisure to write, seeing I have no
ability to stir or move: Yea, it has left no part free in my body, except
my heart to sighe, and my tongue to complain: You require me to send you in
writing the exposition of those two parts of the Scripture which I pronounced
not long since, before the Majesty of Caesar, which as I can not deny you
considering your Authority, even so, I hope you will wey the difficulty that
belonges to it, since the Pen can give no such grace to discribe a matter, as
the Tongue to pronounce it. The first was written in the 19. of Leuiticus, in
these words: Super mortuos non incidietis carnes vestras neque figuras
aliquas. etc. God, by Moses, commanded here the Hebrews that when any of
their parents or friends dyed they should not Shave their heads, nor rent
their Faces, and much less hurt any other part of the body, no, nor imprint
any carrect in the same: By the meaning of which commandment, we may gather
that ye children of Jsraell having dwelt many years with the Egipans, learned
of them many wicked and pernicious customs: For as (more then any other
people) they were given to the Mathematyke Sciences, and other arts and
faculties supersticious, as Magic and Nigromoncie, so there was no nation,
that in the death of their friends expressed greater ceremonies then the
Egiptian, who showed signs of stronger friendship to his friend being dead,
then when he lived: For, when either the Father lost his Son, or the Son
bereaved of his Father, or any other man by death was deprived of his private
friend: they resorted forthwith to this custom, to shave ye one half of
their hair, expressing thereby yt their friend being dead, they had lost ye one
moytie of their heart: For which cause, God forbad ye Hebrews to make themselves
balde, to ye end they should not be like ye Egiptian women, who in ye funerals
of their husbands, parents, children, or great friends, used to scratch and
disfigure their faces with their proper nails: which custom god forbad in ye
women of Jsrael, least, for using ye ceremonies of ye Egiptia^s they stood not
subject to ye scourges of Egypt: the inferior sacrificators of Egypt, when
their high priests died, used to make certain carrects (according to their
particular fancy) in their hands, arms, or breasts, to ye end yt as often as
they beheld them, they might express compassion and tears, as also at ye
death of their king, all ye officers and servants of his house, made wounds in
their arms, hands, face, or head, every one making his wound so much ye
deeper, by how much he stood in favor with the king: But God commanding the
Hebrews to refrain such wilful hurting of themselves, forbad them to imitate
ye Egiptians, nor to follow ye customs of ye household servants of their king:
for yt in all those ceremonies were effects of superstiton, and only innouated
by ye devil, yea, they brought hurt to such as lived, and were in vain to
those yt were dead: In ye old law God also forbad men to labor ye field with
yokes of oxen and asses: And to Sow in one ground two kinds of grain, with
such like, which were not without mystery, because all those customs depended
upon the Ceremonies of the Egyptans, which God would not should hold any use
amongst the people of Jsraell: But here we have to note that God restrained
not men to use sorrow and tears in the death of their friends: For, as other
Ceremonies are in our will, either to do, or not do them, so sorrow and
heaviness for the loss or absence of a friend do as naturally follow flesh^
and blood, as our appetite to eat and drink: and though by reason some men
may dissemble them, yet by nature there are few that can avoid them: Therefore
God that made the heart, and joined to it his affections, never added any law to
forbid tears and weeping: seeing to the heart, (whose chiefest property
consists in tenderness) there can be offered nothing more intolerable or
grievous: then to see it self divided from the thing it holds most dear: the
same standing good in apparent example in the experience and disposition of any
two creatures, who, (after their long conversation together) if they be
separated, or their faunes enforced, will imediatly (according to their kind)
declare their passion: the Lion will roar, the Cow will yeall, the Swine will
gront, and the Dog cannot but howl: much more then is the condition of Man
subject to sorrow and heaviness, as in whom nature breeds a more quick and
raging sense of passion for the discontinuance of their dear friends: And if
we have compassion over the misaduenture of a stranger, or the losses of our
neighbor suffering casualtie, or living in absence, are we restrained to less
remorce for the death of our great friend whom we see put into the grave? For
which cause the Philosopher was of opinion that so many times did a man dye,
how often he lost his friends: For that since two hearts united in one honest
affection, have but one being and place of residence, it is good reason that we
bewail the death of our chosen friends even with the same nature and
compassion which we would do our own: The Second part of ye discourse is
drawn out of Deuteronomy. in this text: Eligite ex vobis viros sapientes, etc. my
will is (says God) that all such as aspire to the administration of public
government, shall be wise and noble: This commandment was not pronounced of
God without great mystery, but chiefly that governors should be both wise
and noble, for that as wisdom without nobleness, is a troublesome thing, so
nobility without wisdom is but as a soul without a body, or as a painted
fire that becomes ye wall, but gives no heat to ye beholder: Therefore as to be
governed by a maiestrate flowing in science and knowledge, and failing of
nobleness, is both miserable and troublesome: so, it cannot but be
intolerable to live under ye controulment of him, to whom fortune has given
greatness of place and birth, and grace and nature denied discression and other
temperances of ye spirit, so yt to make up a full perfection, it is necessary
ye judge have knowledge to debate and determine causes, and nobility to
moderate ye residue of ye affections of ye mind, yet, The wisdom which god
requires in ye maiestrates of his common weal, ought not to stretch to
subtlety or tyranny, but to be tempered with modesty, sweetness, and gracious
behavior, What is required of a judge in matters of council.
for a judge, in ye office and causes of counsel, is no less bound to ye
observation of ye law, religion, faith, and equity, then to be void of all
hate, envy, fear, covetousness, or other corrupt affections, it was not without
cause yt god commanded to institute ye judges over his people, of noble
condition, seeing it is a great argument of ye sewertie and tranquillity of ye
state, whose magestrate is compou^ded of nobility and modesty. Therefore ye
first governor yt administered ye co^monweale of god, was ye easy and gracious
Moses, whom gods providence led to be nourished in ye court of Pharao by ye
kings daughter, to ye end that in such society and experience of so many wise
and noble judges, he might learn how to entreat and assure good men in their
innocence, and how to chastise ye evil amid their wickedness, A magistrate
ought rather to be terrible in threats then in punishment.
the affairs of war are far different from ye policy and government of a
co^monweale established: for yt in matters of enterprise, it is meet ye
captain be valiant, but to govern at home let ye magestrate express
affability and sweetness, for yt a ruler ought rather to be terrible in
threats, then in punishment, and so to te^per his authority yt his people may
feel his power rather with his liberality the^ with injuries: And albeit it is
no general rule that all the common sort be rude and barbarus, nor that every
courtier is fully furnished with ciuillity: yet, in such as receive their
form and fashion in courts of princes, is always found more respect,
consideration, and judgment of things, and are of a better correction of
manners, then the others. There be few things which ought to be guided by rigor
of justice, but fewer to be governed by force, by which reason it behooves the
judge to be wise and noble, to the end that by wisdom he may know what
justice is, and by his nobility he may moderate the rigor of the law:

A discourse before the Emperor CHARLES the fifth, Wherein is handled the
Pardon that Christ demanded of his Father for his enemies,
Pater ignosce illis quia nesciunt quid faciunt.
Amongst all the chief and principal virtues, the most worthy is that which
we call wisdom, for that without it, justice is resolved into cruelty,
temperance takes the habit of rage and fury, and fortitude brings forth
tyranny: for which cause Christ says not expressly to his Disciples, be
temperate, be strong, or be just, but he bids the^ be wise as serpents, and
simple as Doves, aduising us thereby, Math. 10.
that he yt is discreet in spirit and behavior, can not but be just in that
he commands, moderate in his actions, and strong in whatsoever he
enterpriseth. For he that is wise, is constant, and he that is constant is not
troubled, and who is not troubled, lives without sorrow and heaviness: so that
the discreet man is happy since wisdom and discression are compounded upon
ye knowledge of things good and evil: Praise of vvisdome.
So excellent is the gift of wisdom, that by ye providence and direction of
it, abuses past are reformed, things present are ordered, and by it men have
the faculty to foresee chances to come: by which may be concluded, yt he that
is not furnished with that high grace, sta^ds void of mean to recover that
which he has lost, is unable to retain that which he has, and has no power
to aspire to that which he hops for: Psalm. 118.
Thou have made me wise over mine enemies, says the Prophet David, wherein he
seems to offer thanks to ye Lord, for that though by his wickedness and sin,
he has deserved to have enemies, yet the Lord has succored him in giving
him mean to defend himself against the^ by his wisdom, without ye which he
had not ben able to have served God, nor resisted his adversaries. So noble is
the virtue and grace of wisdom, yt she cannot choose her perpetual dwelling,
in a person altogether wicked: And therefore, when we see any polletique in yt
they do, subtle in that they say, provident in their plots and purposes, and
diligent to execute their enterprises: Ierom. 4.
of such let us say wc S. Jerome, quod sapientes sunt vt malum faciu^t, facere
autem bonum nesciunt: such are wise men to do evil, but to do well they
neither know ye way, nor have the mean: Saul in a great presence of his
peers and potentates, said thus of David: Noui david filium Isai virum
bellicosum, 1. Kings. 16.
et prudentem in verbis: I know David the son of Jsai to be valiant in Arms,
and discreet in speech, wherein we have to note yt the scripture co^mendes not
David so much for ye stabilitie of his countenance, nor for his gravity in the
judgment of cases, nor for his policy in ye expeditio^ of wars, as for the
discression he used in disposing his speech and words, ye same remaining to us
as a good argument and example, yt in nothing may be expressed and manifested
ye virtue of wisdom more the^ in ordering ye spech, ye wiseman uses this
text Te^pus loquendi et tempus tacondi, Eccle. 3.
meaning, yt then a wiseman is best known, when he has discression to
discern ye difference of times to speak, and times to use scilence: for all
things of this life, have their place to stay in, there being, by mean whereof
they are preserved: time to work their condition whereunto they are inclined,
and have end, wherein they suffer end: God assigns seasons, and enhableth
every time to his proper office and function: for, as in one time men throw
seed into ye ground, so an other season brings unto them their increase and
fruit: sometimes men travel, and other seasons are appointed to rest: at one
time princes build, and at another they pull down: and at sometimes there is
liberty to speak, when at a another season it is more convenient to use
scilence: So yt as every thing has his time, and every time his proper season:
so it is necessary to speak when there is consent of time and place, together
with good counsel and consideration of ye matter yt is spoken: Scile^ce is a
gift without peril.
for as scilence is a gift without peril, and conteines in it many good
things: so, it were better our scilence brought our simplicity in suspicion,
then to speak either inconueniently, idly, or unnecessarily: this text tempus
tacendi. and tempus loque^di, teaches us, yt if first we learn not when to
hold our peace, we shall hardly know how to speak in opportunity: seeing with the
advised and resolute man this is one property, to po^der and make a judgment
of his words, before he deliver them publicly: And therefore it is holden an
assured sign of a wiseman, when he expresses ye true difference between his
liberty to speak, and discression to hold his peace: for as, such may be his
necessity to speak, yt to use scilence, could not be without great suspision
of his ignorance: so also, so requisite may be ye occasion to hold his peace, yt
to speak cannot be without imputation of folly: by which reason, ye wiseman
speaking so much of time, gives us liberty to speak in season, and not
otherwise, aduising us further yt as to use continual scilence cannot be
without sign of great simplicity, so, to speak out of opportunity and
purpose breeds in it self an opinion of great folly.

Who sees his brother, Ezech. 3.
says ye Prophet wallowing in wickedness and sin, and does not admonish and
persuade him to conuertion, God will require account of the sins of the
offender at his hands as consenting and guilty to his wickedness: the prophet
Esaias, being sorry yt he had holden his peace, cried out, va mihi quia tacui: as
if he had said, Esaias. 6.
Oh Lord God, how many faults I have dissembled and kept secret, so many ways
am I guilty, for that if I had disclosed them, I had been rebuked and
reformed: But if it be an evil thing to keep scilence, it is yet worse to
speak, according to ye example and experience in Caynemaior est iniquitas mea
quam vt ventam merear, Gene. 4
so great is my sin, that I deserve no grace nor mercy. Much better had it been
for Cayn to have holden his peace, then to speak so evil, for that his
wickedness was more intolerable dispairing of Gods mercy, then for ye murder he
made of his brother. Thus we see the Prophet was culpable for using scilence,
and Cayn condemned because he spoke: by which we may gather the great
necessity we have of wisdom to use time to speak, and time to suffer
scilence: For as the tree is known by his fruit, and the virtue of a man
discerned by his works, so, in his words and speech, are disclosed the
quality of his wisdom, or simplicity: And as Jesus Christ in all his
actions, was no less pacient to hear, then moderate in speaking, so, we find
not in scripture, that he ever delivered word in vain, nor never held his
peace but for fear of slander: And although it be a miserable compulsion to
use scile^ce in things which we have desire to disclose, yet, considering
scilence bringes sewerty, and conteines in it self many other goodly things,
let us stand restrained to the two seasons which Socrates aloweth without
reprehension: the one is when we speak of that which we manifestly know, and
the other when we have in hand things necessary: In which two times only, as
speech is better then Scilence, so in all other Seasons, experience approves
that we ought to prefer scilence afor speaking.

To what purpose or intentions tended all the speeches of Jesus Christ.
THe words of our Savior tended either to ye praise of his Father, Math. 13.
as when he humbled himself in this speech Confiteor tibi pater: or to teach
men what they ought to do, when he said Beati mites: Math. 5
or else to reprehend wickedness and sin, when he cried, Luke. 11
vae vobis legis peritis. So that when he was not occupied to give praise and
glory to his Father, nor to preach doctrine, nor to rebuke vices, it was then
he was settled in a devout and holy scilence: The Hebrews led him to their
consistories a fore three judges, that is to say, they brought him to the
Palaice before Herod, to the Bishops house before Annas, and to the tree of the
cross before his Father, at which place only he spoke, and in the others he
used scilence: and therefore before the two first tribunals he was accused of
crime because he held his peace: and standing as advocate before the third, he
spoke: And albeit right great and infinite were the works which our Redeemer did
from the time he was taken till he was crucified, yet his words were few, and
his speeches in very small number, the better to teach us, that in time of
tribulation and adversity, we ought more to seek our consolation in a holy
and devout patience, then to prefer or express great eloquence.

Christ then being upon the hill of Caluary, not only condemned to death, but
very nere the passion of the same, having his flesh pierced with nails, and
his heart burning in zeal and love, cried to his father. Pater ignosce illis
quia nesciunt quid faciunt, as if he had said: Oh eternal father, in
recompense that I am come into the world: and in consideration of the
preaching that I have made of thy name: In satisfaction of the pains and
crucifying that I endure, and in respect that I have reconciled the world to
thee: I require no other reward, but that it may be thy good pleasure to pardon
these mine enemies who have sinned to the end I should dye, and I suffer death
because they may live: Forgive them, since thou know, and all the world
sees, that in my blood is paid and satisfied their crime, and with my
charity I have raised and put them in my glory, so that let my death be
sufficient, to the end that no other death have more place in the world: Pardon
them, since thou know, that the death which triumphed in the cross, and by
the which I am nailed to the same, is crucified hear in this tree: by means
whereof (oh everlasting Father) I beseech thee esteem more ye charity wherein I
dye for them, then the malice by the which they prosecute my death: Forgive
them (Oh heavenly Father) since if thou considerest these my enemies in the
nature and merit of their sins, there will not be found in the furies of
Hell torments worthy enough to punish them: Then better is it (Oh gracious
Father) that thou Pardon them since that as there was never the like fault
committed, so shall thou never have occasion to use the like mercy: And seeing
my death is sufficient to save all such as are borne, or to be borne: those
that are absent, present, dead and on live: It is no reason that these hear
should be shut out from that benefit being a thing of most equity, justice,
and right, that as my blood is not spilt but with thy consent, so also, by thy
hands it should be well employed.

In this, we have to note that Christ said not, Lord pardon them, but he said
Father forgive them, as discribing this difference between those two estates,
that to a Lord, belonges properly to have Bondemen, Subjects, and Vassalls,
and the name of a Father presupposes to have children, so that he required his
Father not to judge them as Lord, but besought him to pardon them as a Father:
Christ also said not condicionally, Father if it be thy pleasure forgive them,
but he prayed absolutely (after himself had forgeuen them) that his Father
would Pardon them, by which example we are put in remembrance, that the
reconcilement which we make with our Enemies, ought to be pure, absolute, and
without affection: Besides, our Redeemer said not singulerlie, Father Pardon
him, but he spoke plurally, by which we may be informed, that as he prayed not
particularly for any one in private, but generally for all, so his blood
dispersed on ye cross was not only sufficient to redeem one only World, but
to satisfy the Ransom of a Million of Worlds: And out of this mystery may
be drawn this construction that our Savior, praying generally for all
expresses himself, so liberal to give, and so merciful to pardon, that when
he forgeues a sinner any offense, he pardons with all his other crimes.

It is not also without mystery that Christ said not I forgive them, but
besought his Father to Pardon them: For that if the Son only had pardoned
them after his death, the Father might have demanded the injury, because that
if the Son had forgeuen them, he had done it as a man, where the execution of
the justice remained in God, but as the divine word, yea the living Lord,
has performed this pardon with so true a heart, so has he not suffered that
there remain in it any scrupule: And therefore he besought his Father to
pardon them, to the end that by the humanity which he endured, and divinity
which suffered it, his enemies might be at the instant absolved, and we others
have hope to obtain remission.

That when CHRIST our Lord gave pardon he left nothing to forgive.
IN like sort we have to note that Jesus Christ required not his Fathere to
pardon them after his death, but besought him to forgive them at the instant,
aduising us by ye example that to be good christians, and true folowers of our
redeemer, it behooves us: before we pass out of this life, to desolue and
break all rankor and malice: for ye froward and sedicious shall have much to
endure in the other world, if in this life they were slow to pardon and
forgive. But since the speech which the Lord expressed upon the cross, was so
high and excellent, it can not be out of purpose to dispute what good thing the
Hebrews did to deserve so famous a pardon: for, so much more noble and great is
the remission, by how much less there is occasion given to do it. Five
injuries don to Christ at his suffering.
In the death of our Savior the Hebrews offered many great and unnatural
injuries, for the least whereof, much less that there was merit of pardon,
where, in the act was sufficient desert to have them all thrown quick into
the depest bottoms of hell: A circumstance of the passion of Christ.
In the first, they did not only put him to death by malice (being the man
most tolerable in their common weal) but they set at liberty Barrabas a
common murderer of the quick, and crucified Jesus Christ which raised from
death such as suffered death: if the execution had been don in some distant
village far removed from the Cities and resort of people, the injury and
dishonor had been more tolerable: But to their wicked Conspiracy to put him
to death, they joined a most abominable mean and manner of execution, and
applying it proper to their revenge to bring open shame to his innocence, they
crucified him in the great City of Jerusalem, where Christ stood in state of
good reputation for his sermones, and had there his allies and kynred, even men
of great honor and honesty. In their determination to put him to death,
although they published the execution in Jerusalem: yet, if they had either
taken the night, or chosen some private house, the time and place had not so
apparently detected their malice. For yt is more the^ barbarous fiercenes,
where is no respect to time, place, nor person, observations naturally
remembered even amongst tigers and lions in their extremest passions of rage
and fury. But of the contrary at the the third hour they led him out of the
City, and the sixth, they crucified him, and at the ninth hour he yielded up
the Ghost: seasons wherein the day reigns in his most clearenes, and people
make their common assembles: In whose sight, they ought to have forborne to have
crucified that innocent Lamb, between two thieves, he, whose race and lineage
was of Kings, and esteemed to be the sovereign Prophet: But to persecute him
as well with ignominy, as with pain, they gave him society with Robbers and
thieves, to the end the world might think that he was the greatest thief of
all: They might lastly have referred him to a kind of death less slanderous
to hear, and not so cruel to suffer: but according to their insatiable
malice, they restrained Pilate to that election and choice of death, as wherein
might be wrought to our Redeemer most appearance of obliquie and shame: for
malice, Malice the mistrese of injustice.
being the Maystresse of injustice, sturres up both the thoughts and hands of
men to wicked things: Albeit these were the works which they did, and the
merits for the which Jesus Christ should procure them Pardon and mercy: yet,
in recompense of this unworthy death, and so many blasphemous wrongs, Christ
cried with a pitiful voice, saying: Father forgive them, for they know no what
they do: Here may be brought in the saying of the Prophet speaking in the
person of Jesus Christ, Supra dorsum meum fabricauerunt pecatores: Psalm. 128.
prolongauerunt iniquitatem suam: as if he had said, I know not what I have don
against thee, oh sinagog, and yet thou have ben against me from mine infancy,
thou have persecuted me in my youth, and in the fruit and ripenes of mine age
thou have crucified me, and yet have discharged all thy sins upon my
shoulders: Supra dorsum meum fabricauerunt pecatores: Adam was ye first that
laid upon my shoulders disobedience: his Wife Eve, sloth and epicuritie: Cayn
his son, Murder and slaughter: the Patriarch Loath, incest: King David,
adultery: Jeroboam his Son Idolatry: and all the Sinagog so discharged upon
me her malice, that, where they in their wickedness committed the crimes, I
upon the Cross paid for them the ransom of their pains, which are not only
for that they laid upon my back all their offenses, but because that
assembling and heaping wickedness upon wickedness, they have prolonged their
iniquity, and have not been sorry for that they have done, but because they
were hable to do no more: so that, if their joys were great to see my death,
great also was their displeasure by the mean of my resurrection: Thus these
miserable Hebrews have increased and prolonged their iniquity, bearing envy
to the Doctrine of Jesus Christ, of which envy, they conceived hatred, and of
that hatred they conspired together to Crucifye him, and being bold to
Crucifye him, they took impudency to mock him, and after they had Scorned
him they denied his resurrection, and so resolved into obstinacy, that Jesus
Christ said not of them without cause, Expugnauerunt me a Iuuentute mea, Psalm.
12^.
Continuinge to Persecute me even unto my Grave.

But having thus deduced the small reasons of the Hebrews to put Christ to
death, Christ used most svveete words when he asked pardon for his enemies.
together also with the slender occasions they gave him to obtain there
Pardon: Let us withal speak of the great bounty wherewith he recompensed
their cruelty, and of the vnuersall pardon which he obtained of his Father for
them: wherein ye circumstances deserve almost as much to be noted, as the
pardon it self: Jesus Christ then well expressed his inestimable bounty in
the prayer which he commended to his Father at the instant of his death
requiring pardon for his enemies: A thing so much the more vehemently desired
of him, by how much he knew it was most necessary to them for whom he prayed:
Christ also felt bitterly the tears and sorrows of his mother (but that was a
passion according to the nature and condition of a son:) But the destruction
of the Hebrews touched him in ye zeal and compassion of a creator: The dollors
of his Mother could not stay him from dying for his enemies, for that he knew
that she had brought him forth in great joy, but he had redeemed the Hebrews
with most bitter travel: In this also appeared his wonderful bounty, that in
his Prayer he called not on the majesty of God by the title of Lord, but by
the name of Father: A name truly wherein is virtue to make easy and tractable
the heart of a man being appealed unto by his Son: Frons meretricis facta est
tibi et noluisti erubescere: reuertere ad me, et dic Pater meus es (...). Says
God, speaking to the Sinagogge of the Jews by his Prophet Jeremye, as if he
had said: Oh Jsraell, albeit you art so obstinate is thy malice, that thou
take no more shame of thy Sins, then a common woman dividing her body to
strange Flesh, yet, if thou come before me in Prayer and call me Father, I
will answer thee, and acknowledge thee for my Son: By this we have to
think that it was not to obtain a small thing, when he began his Prayer by
this invocation, Father forgive them: yea, he made offer of the same Phrase for
the remission of his Enemies, which he would have done, if he had prayed for
the advancement of his best friends: But in recompense of this Wonderful
affection and Zeal, that Nation (replenished with malice) Cried out to Pylate
to Crucifye him, who refusing to commit his Innocence to sentence, and not
fynding in him worthynesse of Death, they cried eftsoons Sanguis eius super
nos et super Filios nostros: Math. 27.
Be not so scrupulus to Judge an offendour say they for if thou think thou
do an unjust thing, let the Venggeance of his innocence fall upon us and our
Posterity: An indiscreet demand of the Jews.
but from this petition Jesus Christ seemed to appeal, for that as they Cried
that his blood might be against them, so of the contrary he sought to make that
Holy effusion profitable to them: So that where they demanded of Pylate their
condemnation, he Prayed to his Father for their Pardon: For a man to do no
Evil to his Ennemie may very well happen: to Pardon Ennemies belonges to the
Office of CHRISTIANS, to love an Ennemie is the work of a perfect man: But to
pardon him which would not obtain pardon, was never done by any but by Jesus
Christ: For when the Hebrews cried Sanguis eius super nos, Christ lift up his
voice and zeal to his Father, Pater ignosce illis: There was no great distance
between the time of the petition of the Jews, and the Prayer of our Savior:
for as they cried at the the third hour to have him crucified, and that the
reueng of his blood might light upon them and theirs, so at the ninth hour,
Christ prayed to his Father to forgive them: Oh Father (says he) let not the
vengeance of my death redownd upon them, neither stretch out thine Ire upon
this people that know not what they do, for they are ignorant of the price of
their demand and protestation that with such obstinate vehemency they pursue
to Pilate: Much better then did the Apostle consider and feel this great
misery, when he said, Accessitis ad sanguinis aspersionem melius loquentem
quam abell: Oh wretched Hebrews and happy Oh we Christians, who have obtained
pardon by the effusion of the blood of the Son of God, shed by your mean:
this speech sure was far otherwise, then the saying of Abell crying justice,
justice, but our Savior said mercy, mercy: So that, the iniquity so
general, and sin so wicked as ours is, had need of such an advocate as is
Jesus Christ, for who was so fit to obtain Pardon for our sins, as he
whose innocence made him without sin.

That God was wont to be called the God of vengeance, and now is he named the
Father of mercy.
Jesus Christ, Langushing in torment and Martyrdom upon the Cross, expressed
an other manner of Testament to the world, then King David, who in the very
passions of death, charged Solomon his Son not to suffer the gray hears of
Joab to come to the grave without blood, nor ye lives of his subjects and
servants, to end without reue^g: yet they had not so much as touched his
garment to offend him, where ye Lord would not cease to purchase pardon even
for those by whose violent hands was wrought ye effect of his death: Deus
vltionum dominus, deus vltionum, says David speaking of ye justice of god,
thou Lord art ye god of revenge, since yt from ye instant that we commit ye
offense, it is thou that thondrest punishment upon us: yea you art so called
because of ye fear that ye world has of thee, and that you dealest with ye
generations of men in so great rigor: with ye ancients he was called ye God of
revenge for ye immediately that Adam had transgressed, Genes. 3. Genes. 7.
Genes. 19. Exodus 32.
he was chased out of ye earthly paradise: ye regions of ye earth by the
vniuersalflud were drowned: ye two cities by his rigor subverted: ye faction of
Aron and Abiram consumed: the idolators yt offered worship to ye calfe,
committed to death: the thief of Hiericho stoaned: and ye host of Senacherib
overthrown: yea, without offering wrong to any, he did justice to all: Ad huc
carnes erant in dentibus eoru^ et ecce furor domini, et percussit populum plaga
magna.
That god in those times was ye god of ve^gea^ce, appears in ye actio^ on ye
mount Raphin, when ye Hebrews demanded of Moses to give them flesh to eat,
which turned to their great damage, for that they had scarcely begone to taste
ye flesh of ye quails falling in their host, when lo ye indignation of ye
lord slew such multitudes of them, yt the scripture forbears to express ye
number: The revenge of ye offense of ye king Abimelech, denying ye Jsraelites
to pass through his countries, Resensui quod fecit Abimelech Jsrael vade ergo
et interfice a viro vsque, ad muliere bouem, ^ouem et Camelum. etc. 1. King.
was it not executed three hundredth years after ye falt and in ye reign of
Saul to who^ god said, I keep remembrance of ye small regard which Abimelech
gave to my commandments stopping the passage of my people through his realms,
against whom look that thou rise and arreare thine army, and cut in pieces
all his people, sparing neither man woman nor beast: by which example with many
others of equal continuance and equity, ye men of the world may perceive, how
deep and unsearchable are the judgments of god: who sometimes punish the
ymediat offender, and oftentimes transferreth ye correction upon such only as
discende of their race: So that he punishes no man without desert, Psalm. 50
and therefore not without mystery is he called by the Prophet, the God of
revenge, because that albeit he uses to dissemble for sometime our
transgessions committed against his majesty, yet they are not parpetually
forgotten with him.

The same God yt the Hebrews had and worshipped in those times, do the
Christians hold at this day as true and sovereign Lord, of whom the Apostle
yeeldes better testimony to the Church, then did David to the sinagog: For
David called him the God of vengeance, and the Apostle honors him by the
name of Father of mercy and consolation: wherein as David was not without some
occasion to ascribe unto him that surname and title, so the Apostle also had
better reason to invoke him in the phrase of merciful father, for that in
that law of rigor and fear, God had a property to chastise people and
nations, where in this law of grace, he visits us in affection and mercy,
whereby having changed custom he has also joined unto him an other property
of name and title, being now worthily called the father of mercy according to
his many examples of mercy and pity expressed upon many sinners: as upon S.
Mthew in remitting his vseries, upon Mary Magdaline in pardoning her vanities,
upon ye Samartiayne in forgeuing her adulteries, upon ye thief in purging his
theftes, upon S. Peter that had denied him, and upon the wretched Hebrews that
conspired his death: Oh merciful Jesus, and delight of our souls, since the
time is past wherein thy father was named the God of revenge, A good prayer.
and the season come wherein he is called upon by the name of father of
mercies: we beseech thee oh savior of the race of man, to have pity upon our
souls, and amend our lives, we that are thy brethern and members of thy
church: and since in losing our selves we lose much, and the mean of our
safety stands only in thy goodness, pardon us according to thy holy custom
and property of thy nature: oh creator of all things, and redeemer of al
faults, since thou have spoken by thy Prophet, J will not the death of a
sinner but that he live and be converted: Behold us Oh Lord in thy presence
and converted to thee: Receive us Oh infinite and perpetual God as our Father,
and pardon us as thy children: and as we confess with humility: Tibi
solipecauimus, so, let it be thy pleasure to say to thy Father, Pater ignosce
illis: he was called in the old law the God of revenge, because his will was
that there should be restitutio^ of eye for eye, tooth for tooth, and hand for
hand: But in the law of grace he is called Father of mercy, for that he has
commanded to render love for hate, honor for infamy, clemency for cruelty,
and pardon for injury, Locuti sunt aduersum me lingua dolosa et odio
circundiderunt me, expugnauerunt me, Psalm. 108.
gratis ego autem orabam, says David speaking in ye person of Jesus Christ, Oh
sinagog full well do I know that thou can work me no more evil then thou
have already don: for thou have hated me with thy heart, blasphemed me with thy
tongue, and killed me with thy hands, and in recompense of these deadly wrongs,
I prayed to my father for thee, and with vehement humility called upon him to
hear my prayer: This Prophecy sure as it was pronounced by David both king
and Prophet, so has it also ben accomplished by Jesus Christ: For at ye time
when they crucified him with nails and torments, at ye instant when they
blasphemed him with their tongues, at the season when they held his Prophets
in derision* yea when he licored ye earth with his blood, and opened the
heavens with his tears, even then did he pray with great compassion to his
father, to pardon them: oh wonderful bou^tie of our savior, who seeing even
from ye cross his greatest enemies, Quod loquuti su^t aduersum illum quod odio
circundideru^t, and without occasion expugnaueru^t illu^, and yet he prayed for
the^, as if they had been free and exempt from fault: great is ye action of this
bou^ty, ouerpassing ye reach of man, and exceeding ye judgment of Angels, and
yet a work right worthy of the Lord, between whose holy intentions, and
Wicked working of his Ennemies, is expressed no small difference: For that for
love, they rendered hate: they appointed him prisoner, where he purchased their
delivery: they accused him, where he excused them: they persented him before
Pilate where he offered them to God his father: yea, where he desired to have
them pardoned they procured to see him crucified: so that in this he expresses
a greater zeal to them, then they can bear to themselves, for that he holds
the offender absolved, and demau^des pardon of his Father before the falt he
confessed: They prepared gal and vinegar to present him in the passion of
death, and sharped their lance to pearce his sides, and yet he besought his
father to remit the punisheme^t before they had actually committed the sin: if
the son of God, would have demanded any other thing of his Father, the
present view and estate of his martyrdom ministered sufficient occasion: for he
might have desired of his Father to remove ye panges of his passion, or to ease
the pains of his flesh pierced through with nails: to take his enemies from his
presence, to prevent the obloquie to suffer between two thieves, or lastly he
might have demanded yt after his death to his body might be joined a
sepulcher: But to requests of such nature, ye savior of ye world seemed to
carry small regard, and less expectation of comfort or ease to his own
distress: no, he esteemed it a thing far more worthy of him, and an act of
greater charity to require pardon for his enemies rather the^ to seek solace
for his present sorrows, or be careful for his pains to com: each redeemer of ye
world, let it please thee (we beseech thee) yt as in ye act of ye holy sacrifice
celebrated by thee upon ye cross, you prayedst for thine enemies, and besought
thy father to pardon the^: yt even by ye same bou^ty you would also vouchsafe
to prai to thy father for us particularly, saying, pater ignosce illis: for
albeit we were not of ye number of those yt crucified thee, yet we are not
exempt from tra^sgressing thy commandments, and are even with the first that
have offended thee: it suffised not Christ to say only Pater ignosce illis,
but in excusing them he added Nesciunt Quid faciunt: Oh Father (says he)
forgive them, as people that know not the harm yt they do in putting me to
death, and as men ignorant of the displeasures that will happen for want that
they have not known me: vouchsafe to supply the fault of their ignorance,
Quia nesciunt quid faciunt: Rightly spoke the Lord of them, when he said They
know not what they do, for ignorance was to them knowledge that by his blood
should be a appaised the wrath of the Father: the seats eftsoons replenished
which were made void by the offense of the wicked Angels: the old sin of
Adam defaced, and the universal world redeemed: This was an assured argument
of their ignorance, for that they put to death the son of God, ye inheritour
of eternity, ye workman of ye world, ye lord of angels, and he which is not
only just, but justice it self: truly they knew not what they did, since ye
time will come wherein shall be redemau^ded of the^ ye blood of ye innocent, their
city destroyed and laid open to spoil, their rich temple reuersed, their
sacrifices confounded, and their law take end: yea, until ye revolution of the
world, they shall wander as vagabounds, without law and without king: Nesciunt
quid faciunt, for by the effusion of that precious blood, ye Church has
succeeded the smagog: Jesus Christ (taken place of Moses:) baptim supplanted
circumcision: the Apostles succeeded ye Prophets, the old testament, the new:
the cross of Jesus Christ abollished the serpent of brass, and the sacraments
of ye Church defaced, the old sacrifices, so that as they took away ye life of
Jesus christ with pains on ye cross, so in ye same, he put end to their
sinagog: vouchsafe then oh merciful Lord ye as thou have pardoned the^ who
without any submissio^ crucified thee, so, you wilt also remit our sins ye
prostrate before thee accompany our petitions with tears and humility, beseching
thee to communicate unto us during ye use of this life, thy spirit of grace and
fear, and in ye other world ye fruition of thy majesty in glory.

A discourse before the Emperor wherein is touched the Conversion of the good
Thief.
Domine memento mei, cum veneris in regnum tuum.
TO every Christian judgment, ought to be acceptable this notable saying of
Boethius: Nihil ex omni part beatum: as if he had said, there is nothing in
this world so perfect wherein cannot be found imperfection, nor any thing so
universally blissed which is not subject to his bale, error, and reprehension:
yea, few things contain their just measure, being brought to the yard, and
fewer are found to hold equity of weight when they are paysed in the
balance: Man of himself is so small a matter, and by reason of his frayltie of
so weak power and apprehension, that there was never prince so mighty,
Philosopher so wise, Captain so valiant, nor any one so established in bliss
in whose condition could not be found occasion of correction, and in their life
amendment of behavior: what is he to whom god has given creation, and the
earth disposed her natural sustenance which has not sorrowed, which has not
sinned, and whose doings have not ben entangled with error? yea, if we behold
our selves with eyes of our selves, besides that we shall see in our common
actions nothing but imperfection, error, and sin, yet also we shall find
that the men of the world do many mo things wherein are mo occasions to
repent them, then means to work their commendation: Justus es domine et
rectum iudicium tuum: says the Prophet: Righteous is the Lord in all that he
does, and just in his judgments: yea, there is more certeintie in the justice
and judgments of the Lord, then either in the course of the Sun, the
revolution of the heavens, or stabilitie of the earth: Little honor had David
attributed to God in naming him just, if he had not also said that his custom
was to do justice, as in like sort it had not ben enough to ascribe unto the
Lord the action of justice if withal he had not given him the name, title,
dignity, and reputation of Righteous: For many there are, who are just in
their persons, but do not administer justice to others: as of the other side,
there be such as are instruments in the distrubution of justice to others, and
are not righteous in themselves: By reason whereof, we may say that so high
and noble is this privilege to do all things well and in their perfection
that God has reserved it to himself, and not vouchsafed to communicate that
divine prerogative to any Creature: And therefore all things upon the which
the Lord bestows his eyes and countenance, are not only good, but also we
ought to believe that in them is no imperfection or error, Quia vidit Deus
cuncta qua fecerat, et erant valde bona: which falls not out so in the
Actions of man, because in whatsoever he enterpriseth or brings to pass is
found good occasion of correction, and just reason of amendment: For the
days of our life are so short, and the Art which we learn of so long study
and time, that when we think we have learned any thing, it is then we stand
even in the Jaws of death, and are ready to pearce the Pit prepared for our
corrupt Boanes: In all the works of man there is imperfection according to the
Sentence of Socrates, who confessed he had learned no other thing in Athens but
to know that he knew nothing, wherein sure he said truly: For how Rude,
Vile, or Base so ever the Art be, we find in it always more things to learn
then we have learned, the same being the occasion of the Civil controversies
now a days, wherein the Philosopher reasons against the Philosopher, the
Master against the Master, and the Scholar against his mate, disputing and
mayntayning opinions only to seek out and know which is he that understands
most: all which proceeds of the little we know, and the much we presume, and
that noane will confess to be Inferior one to an other: Omnia in pondere et
mensura fecisti: god has made all things by weight and measure. Wisdom.
11.
says the wise man speaking of God, thou have made all things Oh Lord by
weight and measure which being above the power and prerogative of man, falls
out contrary in all his actions: For all things in this wretched world,
being guided more by opinion then by reason, it happens most often that we
cut of and abridge that we ought most to increase and lengthen, and of the
contrary, give continuance and amplyfication to things which deserve to be
discontinued and deminished: But in the house of God is neither faction in
opinion, nor parcialitie in reason, no, who can reasonably have occasion to
complain, seeing that all things that he geues to us, are laid out by weight
and measure: when God had Promised to Abraham the Land of Promise, he seemed
forthwyth desirous of the possession of it which the Lord would not agree
unto before three Hundredth years were past and finished, saying unto him that
Nondum completa erat malitia amorreorum, meaning, I am the great God of
Jsraell, the Judge of the Quick and of the Dead, and of the good and of the
Wicked, and being he to whom belongs the Rod of righteous justice, and in
whom only is the property to do Equity to every one, it is meet to
expect yet in three Hundredth years, to the end the Cananites may deserve to
loase their Land, and thy race proceed to be more worthy of it: from the
time that King Saul was forgotten of GOD, until David was Elected over
Jsraell, there passed Forty years before the Scepter was taken from the one and
the other joined to the Throane of the Kyngedome: In which respite of time the
Lord tarried till wicked Saul became worse, and David increased in virtue and
goodness: Since therefore the gifts and doings of God are administered by
weight and measure, this ought to be ye thought and judgment of every Christian
yt when he sendes adversities, it is to exercise us, if he visit us with
poverty, it is with this intention to make us deserve better: when he blesses
our estates with plenty, by so much more ought we to retribute unto him,
thanks, service, glory, and obedience. And if he chastises us, oh let us
think that he has meaning to amend and make us better: so that as al things
in the world and elsewhere within the circuit and circumference of heaven and
earth, were established by his preordinance and foresight, and guided to their
effects by his omnipotent, divine, and infallible providence: So, there is
nothing that he does administer or disperse to his creatures of the world, but
it is measured with his justice, and paysed with his wisdom and mercy. And
so following eftsoon our first matter, if it be true (as it is most clear
from error or falshode) that the Lord is just, and in his judgments righteous,
and does all things by weight and measure: A question not impertinent.
how can this be wtut appearance of contradiction, when he gave heaven to ye
thief without deserving it, and led him with him into Paradise having done to
him no service. For sinnai, for sinner, wicked for wicked, unthankful for
unthankful, and thief for thief, it seems to the advice and reason of man,
that God might as well have employed his kingdom in Judas that had followed him
three years, as upon the thief that accompanied him on the cross but three
hours: The solucion of the doubt*
fur erat and loculos habebat: it was written of Judas: he was a thief, and
had the bag, and of the other it is also written that he was a thief and a
robber, wherein if in the manner and fashion of robbing they were different,
much less were they like of name and fact: So that if Jesus Christ had taken
his kingdom from a wicked man to have given it to a good man, that had been to
do justice uprightly, but to take it from one thief, to bestow it on an other
robber, seems a thing very strait and hard, for that in the world, there can
be nothing worse employed, then that which is given to a person unworthy. God
the creator took the right of inheritance from Cain, to bestow it on Abell:
he deprived Jsmaell to give it to Jsaac, and Esau to transfer it to Jacob: he
took it from Ruben, too bestow it on Juda: he deposed Saul to the end to
raise David to the Empire, and deprived Holy to advance* Samuel: al which he
did, for that in ye one fort of them, he found great merits, and in the other
plenty of wickedness and abominable crimes. But in these two thieves, the
world discerned little appearance of merit, and less expectation of any good
thing in a life so evil disposed as theirs, where being detected iudicially,
the very testimony of their faults proved in them sufficient matter to be
reprehended and corrected. But since GOD is of a power to pearse into the
thoughts, God pearceth into the thoughts and intentions of men.
hearts, and intencions of men, and to him self he has reserved the solucion
and trial of things that he does: I say that in this, nor in any other case
what so ever, there is nothing wherein it is lawful for man to argue with GOD:
For in this did he justly send Judas into hell, and with the same equity
translate the thief into Paradise^ for that the one was worthy of glory for
confessing his trespass: and the other deserved to loase it for that he was a
Treator to the life of his Master: Let us not marvel at the things that GOD
does, and much less rise into thought and wonder at the things which the
almighty in his eternal counsel foreseeeth: one man finds out an other by
the habitte that they bear, but GOD judges every one by the heart that he
has, yea he leads the actions and effects of their life not according to
their worldly appetite or wisdom, but as he has preordeined in his eternal
presence, whereby it follows that in the sovereign and high tribunal of
Jesus Christ, the truth of his justice never was corrupted, nor the measure of
his mercy falsefied: Therefore if Jesus Christ communicated the kingdom of
heaven to the thief, he did it in these good reasons and considerations: first
because he confessed him to be Lord, he accompanied him on the Cross, he
rebuked his other companion, acknowledged him self to be wicked, died with
Jesus Christ, and to him recommended himself: Oh infinite bounty and secret
judgments of God, seeing that in recompense of a few transitory years
wherein the thief was a sinner in the world, the Lord was content to be
satisfied with the three hours wherein he became a good man on the Cross:
Yea those three hours only wherein he accompanied Jesus in his Passion,
served him more, then the three years of the Apostleshippe of Judas. And these
hours being the last and extreme seasons and respite of his temporal life,
he employed so well, that the more he had sinned at leisure, with so much
more devout diligence he repented, and so much the more soddenly aspired to
his conversion.

But let us now join to the example of this thief, Faith is the ground of
our salvation.
his singular excellencies, and withal let it be a chief office in our
Christian duty to know, that the foundation of our health and heavenly
felicity consistes in the true faith we have in Jesus Christ, by means
whereof as we ought to do our duty, and thereby stand in grace to obtain
that we would or desire, so without this mean we can not be saved, nor yet
deserve to be called Christians: For, to be a Christian, is no other thing
then to believe in Jesus Christ our GOD, and serve him as our redeemer: And
that this good thief was made a Christian, it is a good argument to hold that
he would not have answered for Jesus Christ, if he had not been a friend to
Jesus Christ, neither would he have recommended him self to him as to God,
had he not believed him to be God. That this thief was baptized, we make no
doubt, but the manner and place of his baptizing, is to us unknown: only we
may say that if there were want of water to perform the ceremony, there
wanted no tears of the mother, The mother of Christ.
nor blood of the son to regenerate him: At the baptism of Christ was only
S. John, but at the conversion of this thief was Jesus himself, his mother,
S. John, Mary Maudlen, Nicodemus, and Joseph, together with ye inhabitants of
Jerusale^: upon which we may infer ye in the house of God, more honor is
reserved to good thieves then to wicked Emperors. This thief was so good a
christian, and believed with so great zeal in Jesus Christ, that in faith, he
surmounted all those that till then were dead, and withal was no less equal
to all such as then lived: For publicly and without fear he confessed Jesus
Christ to be God, where all the others either denied him or doubted of him.
Jbi fides non habet meri^u vbi humanum ratio habet experimentum.
So much the more merit has the faith of a Christian (says S. Gregory) by how
much less the reason of man has force or vigor of it: So that the merit of
our catholic faith consistes not so much in things that the eye sees, as in
that the heart believes. But let us confer a little the simple belief of this
thief, with the faith of those that were dead long before him, and such also as
lived at the instant with him, and we shall find that by how much they excelled
him in good life and conversation, by so much did he requite it in the
recompense of his faith and belief. Abraham had faith, but it was by the
occasion that God spoke to him from heaven: Esaias had faith, but it was because
he had seen God in his majesty: Moses had faith, but it was for that God did
communicate with him in a bush that burned and was not consumed: Ezechiell had
faith but it was for that he had seen God environed with Seraphins: Great
(sure) was the faith of these holy personages, but much greater (no doubt) was
that of this sinful thief: For if they believed in God, it was because they
had seen him, and spoken face to face to him: But so simple and resolute was
the faith of this thief that he believed Jesus Christ to be God, and had
neither seen his majesty, nor yet to do the works of God: yea though Christ
did them, yet he understood them not. In like sort touching his comparison with
such as were then on live: We doubt not but Saint Peter had faith, but it was
for that he saw Christ march upon the waves of the sea. Mary Maudlein
believed, but it was for that he raised again her brother Lazarus: The woman
of Chanan had faith, but it was because she had seen him expulse the wicked
spirit out the body of her daughter: the Centurion believed, because Jesus
Christ had healed his servant: And Saint John had faith, but it was because he
had reapposed in the lap and bosom of Christ. Right slender was the faith that
these men had, considering the wonders and miracles which they saw Christ do:
but oh blessed and happy thief, who notwithstanding he saw no action of these
great wonders, neither Christ to command the waves, nor stay the wyndes, nor
chase out Devils, nor yet raise the dead to life, yet with open voice, he durst
confess his creator, and take him for a redemer: yea, in calling him Lord, he
acknowledged that he had created him, and in crying to him to have remembrance
of him, he confessed that he had redeemed him: and therefore as a good and
faithful Christian, he believed with his heart and confessed with his mouth:
What habit or appearance of a Lord, saw he in Christ, when he said to him domine
memento mei? Yea what argument of confidence or assurance could he gather in
him? seeing that to whom so ever is called Lord it appertains that he be free,
which was far from Jesus Christ being bound to the cross: to be called Lord,
it behooves to be mighty or at least compotently rich, which appeared not in
Jesus Christ being naked, dismembered, and crucified: to the port and name of a
Lord belongs great train and service, which was not expressed in the state of
Jesus Christ, who was forsaken even of his own followers: And to the dignity
and place of a Lord, belonges to be well obeyed and honored, which fell out
contrary in the person of Jesus Christ, for that every one conspired against
him, and opprobriously crucfiied him between two thieves: yea by so much more
worthy was the faith of this thief, by how much he saw the Lord suffer
imprisonment as a man, and whipped and scourged as a man, and yet confessed him
to be God, and called him God saying Lord have remembrance of me. Since this
thief was executed, and Jesus Christ crucified, great has been ye number of
saints that believed in him, and greater the company and fellowship of
Martirs that have suffered for his faith: So that the example of the thief
believing upon so small occasion, puts all posterities in remembrance how
justly we are bound to fix and settle our faith upon, ye same son of God whom
ye thief acknowledged to be the savior of the world: In deed the writers of
the gospel make no mention of ye race and nation of this thief, neither what
proportion of age he boar, what offenses he had don, nor what law he held, for
that to Pilate ye judge being a Roman, belonged this prerogative, to crucify
indifferenly the Gentiles, and apprehend ye Jews: but what mystery so ever may
be ascribed to ye scripture for using scilence in this case, let us gather and
believe that God is no acceptor of persons, but receiving all sorts that believe
in him, God in his election makes no difference of person, age, ^tates, sex,
or calling.
he makes no difference in his election, whether they be noble, or of base
blood, pore or rich, co^querors or captives, infamous or well renowned: only it
suffiseth that we repute Jesus Christ as our only king, and observe faithfully
ye precepts he has left amongst us: so that, of what sort of sinners so ever
we be, and how late so ever we come to the cross, Hear is verified the word
of God that when the sinner has contrition God will keep no remembrance of his
sins.
let us not despair to be hard, since we read not that to this thief was
ministered either baptism or confession, nor yt he fasted, used restitution nor
had repentance, until he was committed to execution, when one sighe powered out
in faith, suffised to make him a christian, and in one only word pronounced
in hope, was virtue to translate his soul into heaven: To rob in infancy,
to rob in youth, and to rob in old age, the experience is daily before our
eyes, but to rob at the very article and instant of death, we never red of any
but of this thief, who then stole the kingdom of heaven: Our original Father
Adam was a thief when he stole the Apple in Paradise: Fair Rachell was a
thief when she Robbed the Idols from her Father Laban: Achior was a robber in
stealing the rod of Gold in Hierico: David was a thief when he conveyed the
lance and flasket of water from the beds head of Saul: Math. 26, Acts. 5.
Judas was a thief in stealing the Alms of Jesus Christ: And the servants
of David were none other then thieves when they stole the water in Bethele^: But
amongst them all, none was more famous, more subtle, more notorious, nor more
cunning, then this thief, who rob bed, yea, before he was laid upon the cross,
and being crucified: for Pilate taking from him his life on the cross, he
stole from Jesus Christ in the same place, an other life: where, upon S. John
Chrisostom speaking upon that thief says, that for theft Adam was chased out
of Paradise, and for theft this thief was bestowed in Paradise: He that lost
his life by a tree went out of Paradise: and this entered into Paradise that
recovered his life upon a tree: he was chased out that believed not in God,
and this entered in because he confessed God to be God: a Thief was the first
that issued out of Paradise, and a Thief was the first that entered into
Paradise: Yea, at the hour of middaye GOD did justice of the first Thief, and
at noone tide he Pardoned this Thief, with whom the Lord grant us to be
Thieves not to steal the Apple as did Adam, nor the Idols with Rachell, nor
the Flaskette as David did, nor the Golden Rod with Achior, but to steal for
our selves the blessed fruition of the Majesty of GOD, which being the pray
of this Thief, he is thereby become perpetually happy even in the bo-some of
Abraham the Father of faith.

The good THIEF having no other thing to offer to God, offered him his heart
and his tongue.
SAint Paul, having seen the great secrets of god (of which it belongs not
to man to speak) being asked what we ought to do to please God, Answered,
Commendat vobis Deus charitatem suam: the chiefest thing says he which God
recommends unto you, is charity, which consists in this that you love him,
We ought to love our neighbor for that he loves God.
as he loves you, which you shall more easily accomplish if you love your
Christian neighbor, not so much for that he loves you, as for that he loves
and deliteth in god: Wherein the Apostle does not so expressly say, that God
recommends unto us, his faith, his hope, his patience, his chastity, and his
humility: But above all things, he enioyneth us to have charity, as thereby to
give us to understand, that, that man that deliteth truly in God, can not be
reproved of any vice: For what can be lacking to him that wants not charity,
as also who wants charity, is imperfect in all other virtues.

He that loves God cannot perish.
Let the charitable man, and he that delites to be pitiful, be assured that God
will always lend him his hand to the end he decrease not in faith, loase not
his hope, defile not his chastetie, despise not humility, nor forget patience:
For before the tribunal and judgment seat of God, is never used cruelty to
him ye on earth has exercised charity: si charitatem no^ habeo, 2. Cor. 13.
factus sum sicut sona^s, aut cimbale^ tynniens, says ye Apostle: though I
speak (says he) as an Angel, and all other virtues (except charity, were
familiar with me,) yet I should be but as a Bell, that calls the people to
service, and yet enters not therein it self: The man then yt is not
charitable, but takes delight in his rigor, is no way worthy of the name of a
Christian, and much less deserves to be called friend, because that in the
heart wherein is not lodged charity, shall never be found fidelity. If we ask
the scripture what thing charity is, Charitas est cum diligirous Deum propter
se, and proximu^ propter Deuns,
we shall find by many texts that it is a virtue drawing to none other effect,
then to love God for himself, and our neighbor for the love of God:
Whereupon the love of God and the fear of God, ought always so to be coupled
within the hearts of the just, that we never ought to fear God only to the end
he preserve us from hell, nor love him altogether in this respect that he
grant us Paradise: but we ought both to love and fear him, because he is the
Supreme and Sovereign good and on whom does depend and come all felicity:
The man of God loves not his neighbor for any wordl^ respect but for God.
If men love one an other, it is either for benefits all ready received, or
for hope of good tournes to come: But in the house of GOD, there is no
Sufferance nor Custom of such affections: For such is the nature, measure
and proportion of Gods goodness toward us, that the respect and intention of
our zeal ought not to consist only for that he is all in all for us, but
because the greatness of his goodness deserves it by which occasion the
Prophet cried oftentimes Paratum con meum, the better to instruct us that his
heart was not only ready to love the creator but also to bear affection to the
creature: That man is ignorant in charity who estemeth himself to love God,
and has no care of his neighbor: and less is he a follower of charity that
is reputed to bear affection to his neighbor, and loves not God, since that
all our Christian charity consistes in this, to do service to Jesus Christ,
and work some Good or benefit to our neighbor: For, the Lord bears such a
zeal to the Christian soul, that in loving us he will be only and singular,
and when we love him, he will be accompanied, the same being contrary to the
love of the world, with whom it is not suffered to have the heart divided into
many parts, but in the divine love and holy affection of the Lord, we are
required to love Jesus Christ, and have care over our neighbor, specially if
he be a christian: for, otherwise we ought to wish unto him good, and eschew
his conversation: This discourse have I brought in, to express and testify
the wonderful charity which the good thief had on the cross, who in ye
perplexity of death, and in a small moment of time, gave good declaration of
the affection he boar to Jesus Christ, and right published the zeal he had to
save his companion the wicked thief: Besides, he was not without fervent
desire to relieve his savior of the pains he suffered, which he well testified
in the service he did to him: For dissembled love is showed in ye property of
speech, where the true friendship and affection is expressed in ye service and
gifts that are ministered: the same appearing for the most part amongst our
vain worldlinges, with whom sweet and alluring words are familiar, but the
office and effect of service are most commonly forgotten: where in deed, whose
love is chaste, and joined with ye holy love of god, there, their mouths keep
seilence and their hands minister distributio^: Cain offered to God fruits of
ye earth, Abell brought firstlings and of ye fattest of his flock, Noe
presented Muttons, Abraham gave Pigions, Melchisedech brought Bread and Wine,
Moses Insence, David Gold and Silver, Jeptha sacrificed his Daughter, and
Annas Samuel his son: All which offeringes presented by those holy
personages bear great reckoning and are much to be accounted of: But far
more worthy was ye service and sacrifice of this thief, for that where they
offered to God things apperteining to their houses, he presented to the Lord
his proper heart, wherein he discovered a difference between the oblation of
things that we have near us, and to make an offering of our selves: Therefore
let no man marvel why I debate so much in praise of this thief: For, if I be
asked what it was that he offered, I may estsoones make a question what it was
that he kept for himself: When one man gives to another his proper being*
does he not give by consequence his will and ability? This thief gave not to
God his eyes, for ye they were cloased up and shut: he gave him not Gold nor
silver, having lost all by ye justice of his offense: he could not compart with
him his cloths being riffeled by ye executioners: he offered him not his hands
and feet, for that the one were nailed and the other bound: And much less
could he communicate with him his body, for that it was crucified: only he
offered that which he had remaining, which was his heart wherewith he believed and
his tongue by the which he confessed him to be god: So that as he testified his
faith and affection toward God with all that he had in his power, so we have
to think that if there had remained in him any property of more precious or
greater things, he would therewith have made service and offerings to the
Lord: Multiplicati sunt super capilos capitis mei, et cor meu^ dereliquit me:
Psalm. 119.
I am fallen into that age (says David) that I have no more sight remaining:
Mine enemies have environed me: my friends are dead, my sins have made me
fall: and my good days are now drawn to end: so that my grieffes, sorrows,
and perplexities, are mo in number, then my hears, but my greatest heaviness
of all is, that my heart has forsaken me: wholoaseth his eyes, and the other
particular parts of his body, together with all his goods, can not but loase
right dear and great things, but he that loaseth his heart, loaseth assuredly
all that can remain or aperteine to a man: For yt within ye womb of our
mothers, the heart is ye first that engendereth and takes life, and the last
that dissolueth and vanishes to death: So that like as, so long as our hearts
leave us not, we may both love, fear, and serve God, so also, if the heart
loase his vigor and geeue us over, assuredly we have neither power nor faculty
to Fast, Pray, or persevere in Breath: And therefore (according to Saint
Hierom) it is a great gift of GOD to be endued with a Constant and Valiant
mind, as on the other side to have faintness of heart and Pusillanimytye can
not but bear Testimonye and Prooffe of great Punnishement: Audi popule Audi
qui non habes cor: says GOD by his Prophet Jeremie: hear my voice, Oh
generation of Jsraell, and hearken to my words, Oh People of the Hebrews, I
call thee Fool because thou art without heart, yea, I say thou have no heart
because thou art a fool: where ye Prophet in this phrase charged ye people to
have no heart, he imposed upon them infidelity as though they had neither faith
nor belefe in Jesus Christ the true god, because ye like as when ye heart dies
the life dissolueth, even so by Christ aspiring upon the Cross, By the death
of Christ took end the sinagog.
the sinagog took end: So that the Prophet was not without great reason to
call the Hebrews Fools and men without heart, seeing the testimony of so many
miracles suffised them not, and much less were they satisfied with the number
of benefits and blessings, with infinite Sermons performed by our savior
Jesus Christ all tending to make them Christians, and yet wrought small
impression in them by reason of their slender knowledge and great folly: Even
so, according to morrall phrase, when we say any man has want of heart, it is
as much as if we should charge him not to have Jesus christ in his spirit, for
that as undertaking to do any good work, Jesus Christ is he that geues us
heart, and puts us in reason: even so by good conclusion, that man we may say
is deprived of reason and unfurnished of heart, which loves not Christ, thinks
not on Christ, serves him not, fears him not, and hopes not in him: So that
in the Law of GOD to call a man without heart, is no other thing then to say
he has a body without a soul: Omni custodia custodi cor tuum says the Wise
man, every one ought to keep and double guard his heart, to the end it be not
defiled by the flesh, oppressed of the world, deceived by the Devil, and
that it be not altogether exercised by his freende, nor outraged by his enemy:
For that even so much and no more have we in Jesus Christ, then we give unto
him Possession and place in our heart: Wherein according to the measure of our
confidence in GOD, shall we find recompense and retribution in him: Yea, if we
give our selves altogether to him, he will assuredly be wholly ours: So that all
those things which the Lord geues unto us being holy, hearty or unfeigned, it
belonges to us (the better to Prepare our offeringes to God even from our
hearts, fixed in our heart and unfeignedly to touch our heart) to keep our
hearts always replenished with Holy desires, and environed with good thoughts:
For which occasion it suffised not the wiseman to bid us simply keep our
hearts: but he enjoined us to a double and diligent guard, the better to
advertise us, that as the Eyes may be preserved by their Eyeliddes, the mouth
defended by the lips, the feet and hands kept from harm by Armor and
Gauntlets, and a man's treasure holden from the Thief under Lock and Key: So,
there can nothing in this world suffice to forbid an ambicious mind to think
and desire: And so falling eftsoons upon our first matter, I say that much
does that man offer to God, that offers his heart, as also what has he more
to lose that loses his heart: the same appearing in ye conversion of this good
thief, who, even as he hanged upon the cross because he offered to God only
his heart, found this recompense to be carried into the eternal Tabernacle of
God, and communicate in his glory: Let then the example of this thief stand
before us all, that notwithstanding we have not hands, Feet, Eyes, Silver,
Christ requires not but the offering of our heart
Gold, precious Jewels, or clothes to offer to God, yet let us not be troubled
or grieved: For, who has not these things in his power, let him not doubt to
be acceptable to the Lord, if he present his heart replenished with holy
desires. The Sister of Moses was diseased, Moses himself Stutted, Tobyas was
Blind, Mimpheboseph was Lame, and Zacharias the Priest was Dumb, yet these
imperfections hindered not these men to be holy and virtuous, yea God called
some of them to the function and ministry of his will: If we have our hearts
whole, holy, and sound, the Lord observes little the state of our other
members, no, he makes no care whether they be perfect or putrified: for, this
thief, in his sentence of condemnation and death, had his limbs bruised and
broken, his mouth, his eyes, and whole body crucified: but his heart only
reteining integrity, he offered it to his savior, and by his ^yth and
constancy, purchased the benefit of salvation: And albeit, in so small a
respit of time, in so quick and sharp torments, and in so grievous
apprehension of the dollors and terrors of death suffered by this thief on the
Cross, he could perform no great penance, express no variety or copy of
speech, or utter apparent remorse by sighs, sorrow or public contrition:
yet, for that to his passions he joined greatness and constancy of heart,
with faith and devotion to GOD: The Lord did accept not only that which he
did then, but also what he would have done, if he had not ben prevented by
death.

How wickedly the evil THIEF spoke hanging on the Cross.
THe Wicked Thief, speaking to Jesus Christ, How wickedly the evil thief
spoke hanging on the Cross.
said, if thou be that same Christ that is the son of God, deliver thy self
from death, and us from this Passion of torments: Oh cursed impudency to
pronounce such Horrible blasphemy against the majesty of our Savior: For,
albeit the Son of God was committed to the Cross, and in the Company of
Robbers, did suffer a slanderous Death: yet, it was not for ye he had any
community with ye offenses of the thieves, and much less suffered for his
proper crimes, but for the Sins of the World: Quae non rapui tunc
exsoluebam: I make (says Christ by the Prophet) satisfaction for the faltes
done by others, others have eaten the Apple, and yet I pay the price of it:
Though I have committed no Crime, yet mine innocence is put to punishment:
Yea, where others have troubled the commonweal, I am committed to justice, and
having no nature or effect of offense in me, yet I pass unto death for the
sins of the whole World: Right just was the occasion of our Savior to hold
such argument: For that if they crucified him under a most smarting and
infamous death, it was not for that he had deserved it, but to the end that by
it mankind should be redeemed: This thief, said not with sewertie that he was
Christ, and therefore, by making wicked doubt and question whether he were the
son of God or not, he deserved not (with his companion) to be made a
Christian: But the good thief, making no doubt of his omnipotency, said
absolutely Lord have remembrance of me, and therefore was not only adopted to
Christianity, but also there was joined to his faith, recompense of eternal
salvation: In the same manner S. Peter said not if thou be Christ, I will believe
in thee, but he protested in bold faith and cried, J believe that thou art the
Son of the everliving God: For who will receive the grace and blessing of
God, his faith ought to be without scrupull or doubt: he that will obtain any
thing of god (says the Apostle) it apperteines to him to ask it with a faith
that is not doubtful: for if God give us not forthwith that which we demand
of him, it is more for that we know not how to ask him, then that he is hard
to grant our requests: Let it then be far from us to say with the wicked
thief, If thou be Chrict save thy self and us also, but let us rather with
the Blind man of Hierico, say Oh son of David have pity upon us: For, so
shall we be made to see with the blind man, and not carried into damnation with
the Thief: Who, in saying to Christ, Salua te met ipsum et nos, thought to
persuade him to leave the Passions of the Cross, and put himself in liberty,
and deliver him from death: For this was the opinion of this wicked thief,
that even as Pilate put on him the sentence of death for his thefts and
roberies: even so also there was no less guiltiness in Christ as being
untruly holden a Seducer of the People and a man contrary to the common
Weal: And therefore he thought that as the Terrors of Death made him unwilling
to dye, so also there remained in Christ a desire to live longer: Wherein his
error was so much the greater, by how much, he considered not that there was
necessity of Christ's death for the redemtio^ of ye world: for which cause
though he wished to live longer yet our savior desired ye present stroke of
death according to his own words to his disciples. Desiderio desideraui hoc
pas^ha manducare vobiscu^, at other times (says he) I have celebrated with you
this feast, ye which at this present I esteem to be truly passover in holy
scripture: The doubling and reiteration of a word is a sign of vehement and
great desire, the which was well expressed in the zeal of our savior, who by
this phrase Desiderio desideraui published manifestly that he had no less
desire to dye for us, then most desirous to redeem us: For, of that nature was
his thirst and desire to overcome our perpetual death, that he expected
nothing more then the hour wherein he might employ for us his most holy and
undefiled life: There was great similitude and likeness between the blasphemy
of this wicked thief, and the request of the Jews, who willed him to descend
from the cross, and they would all believe in him: whereunto if our savior
had condiscended and abandoned the agonies of the cross, all the world had
stand crucified with death, sin, and the perpetual perplexities of Hell: Oh
wicked thief, Oh people hardened and obstinate: if Christ had come down from
the cross according to your requests: or if he had divided himself from the
pains of death following the blasphemous motion of the condemned thief, much
less that it had been happy with any sort of people, but of the contrary,
Hell had been always open for you, and the gates of Paradise perpetually
closed against our posterities: For, the Lord came not to descend, but to
mount and ascend, not to eschew the cross, but to dye upon it: Cum exaltatus
fuero a terra, omnia traham ad me ipsum, says our Lord Jesus Christ: Because
now I go Preaching from one country to an other, and that I have my riches
dispersed, you cannot have knowledge of my might, nor of the virtue and
benefits that are in my power: But when you see me elected and chosen to the
cross, even in the same place shall be my treasure: This speech truly is of
great admiration for the good sort, and leaves no little fear to the wicked:
Omnia traham ad me ipsum, by the which we are instructed, that who will obtain
any thing of Jesus Christ, ought to ask it upon the cross: For, never was the
Lord so liberal as when he was Crucified, at no time so rych as when he was
Naked, nor at any time so mighty as when he was condemned to death: All these
treasures did Christ bring with him from heaven to earth, and from the earth he
recaryed them with him to the tree of his suffering, and being there he
dispersed them through out the world: so that he that is found most near the
cross of our savior, on him is bestowed the most plentiful reward: it was
on the cross that he recomded his soul to his Father, his Church to S. Peter,
to Nicodemus his body, and to the good thief the joys of Paradise: it was on
the cross where he commanded the Sun to hyde his light, the stoanes to
break, the veil of the Temple to rent, the graves to open, and the dead to
rise again, (which carries an assured Testimony that in his death was wrought
the effect of our life:) it was on the cross that he spoke to his Father, gave
comfort to his mother, had remembrance of his Disciple, pardoned the believing
thief, and illumined ye centurion, to the end he might know Jesus christ to be
the redeemer and confess himself a sinner: it was on the cross, where his
side was opened, his blood shed, where he showed most plentifully his charity,
expressed most myldly his patience, and used greatest clemency: Yea, it was
the place where his death took end, and our redemption received beginning:
Lastly, upon the cross he was crowned as king, saluted as king, and hayled
with the title of king: So that all these being true, how could it stand with
any congruent reason that he should abandon ye cross which brought to him so
many preheminences: Oh Sovereign savior and love of our souls, let us not
beseech thee with the Jews, to discende from the cross, nor in the corrupt
affection of the Thief, to abandon the pains thereof: But grant Oh Lord
that with thee we may be joined to the cross: where, let us not require that
thou give us to eat, since in that place thou had but gall, and for thy
drink was reserved most sharp viniger: Let us not require garments, since
thou wast all naked, let us not crave liberty, since thou wast bound, and
much less have we reason to entreat for life, since thou did not refuse
the execution of death: That which we have to require of thee, is that it will
please thee to give us part and communion in this cross, since in it, thou
have with such plenty bestowed thy graces: for, well we know Oh Lord, that
thou do never communicate thy love and affection, but to such as taste in thy
pains and Passions: By all this discourse we may gather what heart we ought to
have to enterprise any good work, together with what magnanimity of courage
to execute it, seeing that even when we mean to begin to do well, Wicked
Spirits are then most near us, and readyest prepared to deceive us: For the
Flesh does prick and quicken us, men draw us back, and the World works to
our vexation and Trouble: Albeit many were the occasions in JESUS Christ
being on the Cross, to abandon it: As first the importunityes of the Jews,
the persuasions of the Thief, the bitter Agonyes of Death, the sorrows of the
Daughters of Jerusalem, the Scorns and Scoffs of Strangers Passing that
way, and Lastely, the small thanks and recompense that men attributed to him
for that Passion: Yet they were not sufficient to Tempt him from the Execution
of his Fathers Commandment, nor to let him to accomplish all that whereunto
his Charity bound him for the fulfilling of our Redemption: For, when he said
on the Cross J am a thirst, it was not for any appetite he had to Drink but
he spoke it rather in a vehement will and desire to Endure yet more for the
Health of our Souls.

The good thief rebuked his fellow hanging on the Cross.
THE good Thief hearing the wicked discourse of his companion against Jesus
Christ, could not but minister this rebuke: Neque tu times deum qui in eadem
da^natione es: non quidem digna factis recipimus, hic aute^ quid mals fecit.
Weighing (says he) with the horror of our life past, our present estate
drawing to the extremity of death, I marvel that thou have no fear of god,
and art without shame of that thou say seeking to Crucifye this Prophet
with thy Tongue, as these Raging Tormentors do with the violence of their
Hands: Oh thou know not that as this Innocent never did ill to any: So in
thee and me was never found any Good: Few were the Words which this Thief
Spoke, but right great Mysteryes are touched in them, and therefore it is
needful that we hear them with grauitye and Pronounce them in Charity: And
albeit it is most Sewer that GOD the Almyghtie Creator, is by Power, all in all
things, yet particulerlye by Grace is he more manyfested by the Heart and
Tongue of man, God is more manifested in the heart and tongue, then by any
other member of the body.
then through any other member of the Body, as they being the two Instruments
where with we do most serve him, and oftenest offend him: For, the Eyes
become Wearrye with seeing, the Ears wythdrawe from Hearing, the Hands refuse
to Work, the Feet forbear to Go, and the whole Body may be grieved to
Sin: But it is the Heart which never puttes end to his Thoughts, and the
Tongue is Seeldome wearye of Speakinge: The Good King David was upright in
Judgment and found of Body, and yet Praying to GOD, for the most part he
observed these two Petytions, Cor mundum crea in me Deus, and Domine labia mea
aperies, Wherein he required of GOD to raise in him a Heart clear and
Innocent, and also to bless him with a tongue that should not pronounce any
thing contrary to his will: for, albeit he received greeffes and disquiets by
his other members, yet he knew he could never be vanquished of them, for
that, it is one principal sign that we are in ye grace of god, Signs and
testimonies of a good christian.
when he blesses us with a heart replenished with, pure intentions, and geues
us a tongue refrained from speaking evil: yea, it is a true foundation and
testimony of good Christians, to believe in God with our heart, and set forth
his praises with our tongue: Much was the people of Jsraell in the grace of
God, when by Jeremie he said to them, Ego dabo eis cor nouum, and no less
favored was Ezechiell of that almighty worker of all things, when he said,
Ego aperiam os tuum in medio eorum, as if he had said to Israel, in sign of
the great amity I have with thee, I will illumine thy heart, and because thou
art my seruannt (Oh Ezechiell) I will open thy mouth, to the end thou may
publishe and preach my power and might: For right small is the number of those
which atteyne to my knowledge, and far fewer are they that preach sincerely
my name: yea, albeit a man have the faculty to read, to interpreat, to study,
and to deliver, yet he has not for all that the full faculty of a true
Apostolyke preacher, for, it is no small gift and blessing of the Lord, to
know how to preach well and pronounce his word and will: Great therefore was
the liberality which Christ used on the cross, seeing that the grace of
newnes of heart which he gave to Jsraell, and the spirit and power of well
preaching which he imparted to Ezechiell: he infused both together into this
good thief toutching his heart to make him believe in him, and opening his
mouth to the end he might publishe and preach his name: By which is happened
that after the Sermons of Jesus Christ, and before the preachinges of the
Apostles, this good thief was the first that preached in the Church: yea, even
where he was crucified, and in the presence of the people, he magnified that
which Christ did, and reproved his companion of blasphemy saying: Neque tu
times Deum qui in eadem damnatione es: I see (says he) thou have no fear of
God, and art in the way to be damned, therefore behold me, and think upon thy
self: To teach the ignorant, and reduce to truth him that is in error, is a
work of charity proceeding of great bounty, which was expressed in the
behavior of this thief warning his companion to consider that he was
condemned to death, having by his side the son of God in whom was power to
pardon his offenses, and withal to deliver him from the perpetual agonies of
Hell: Oh to how many of our companions and friends, may we say with this good
thief, that they are out of the fear of God, that they wander in their proper
destruction, that they are replenished with vices, and do not observe one of
Gods commandments: But, Man's friendship is maintained by supportation of vices.
by so much more wretched is our condition, by how much one friend dare not
warn an other, for that all friendship now a days stands upon these limits
and terms, not to correct one an other, but rather to cover and dissemble,
and suffer community of evil: It is a wonderful confusion to see one sinner
admonish an other, and a thief to reprove a thief, and yet one Christian
dare not rebuke an other, no, rather they will endure their vices, then divide
themselves from their friendship: Not to advertise a friend of his honor, or not
to advise him of his wealth, may happen and is suffered, but not to admonish
him of that which concerns his conscience, is hateful, and ought not to be
borne withal, for that in things touching the honor of God, we are bound not
to dissemble with our Father, nor to yield consent to our dearest friend:
Nathan reproved David, Samuel rebuked Saul, 2. Kings. 12. 2. Kings. 20.
Micheas admonished Achab, Helias reproved Jezabell, S. John rebuked Herod, and
S. Paul reproved S. Peter, not so much for having erred and failed, as for
offending God, the better to admonish us that him we ought to hold as enemy,
whom we know does not love God: Nonne qui oderunt te, Psalm. 138.
inimici facti sunt mihi. Oh great God of Jsraell says David, the greatest
service that I have done thee, is, that all my life time I have hated those
that loved not thee, eschewed such as followed not thy laws, was a stranger to
such as searched not thy precepts and will, and none have been worse welcome to
my company, then such as boar to thee no service: I would the example of
David might be embraced now a days, or that to christian friends were joined
such property of affection, so should there be no vice in men's friendship, nor
toleracion of wickedness, for that if evil men were not supported by their
friends, justice and discipline would either spedely determine their lives, or
shame and instruction lead them to amendment of manners: great then was the
charity of this thief to his companion, and the pity not little which he had
of Jesus Christ, whereof as he defended the one, and persuaded the other, so
his virtue concludes in good Authority, that it is a true effect of our
Christian pietye, to yield compassion to such as are troubled, and reduce him
that is out of the Way.

After this good thief was committed to God, and confessed his sins to Jesus
Christ and answered for him, he began then to lift up his voice and say unto
him, Domine memento mei dum veneris in regnum tuum: wherein with just reason he
calls him Lord, for that it is resolute with God, not to take pity or mercy
upon us if first we accknowledge not in him his divinity: and therefore in the
old times when God spoke with ye Hebrews, he used commonly this phrase, haec
dicit Dominus, etc. The better to advertise the nations and people of the earth
that all kings and Princes of this world are in all things, no other thing
but governors and deputies, and to God alone belonges all sovereign and
Supreme Potentacie: In which respect, it behooves us before all things, to
confess God to be Father and sovereign Lord, and to honor his blessed son
by the name of Lord and redeemer, for that it is directly to repugne his
ordinary power to Pardon sin in any man, which does not accknowledge in God
predomination and Lordship: Let us therefore with the humility, faith, and
conformetie of this thief, say Domine memento mei: For th:s ought to be an
office in our belief, that if we confess god to be sole ceator, and serve him
as sovereign Lord, he will not misknow us as strangers, specially if we
acknowledge us to apperteine unto him: The second word of this theefes
petition was Memento mei, agreeing with the invocation of Solomon, Da mihi
sedium tuarum aslis tricem sapientiam vt sciam quid acceptum sit coram te omni
te^pore: Sap. 9.
give me O Lord partin thy wisdom, to the end I may do the things agreeable
to thee, and tending to my salvation: notwithstanding, that Solomon, amongst
all the kings of Jerusalem, was most Peasible, most Rich, Renoumed, and most
Wise, yet, with all these Qualities, he durst not demand of God, but
Wisdom, and that not without great reason: For albeit a man knows that
which he would have, yet he is ignorant in that which is necessary for him: And
as we live in God more then in our selves, and that God loves us above our
proper affections, so, it is he that knows better the^ our selves what we
would have of him, and what we want and is needful for us: for which cause this
well advised and good christian thief would ask no other thing, but that the
Lord would have remembrance of him instructing us by that that God bearing to
us such plentiful will and affection, there is no great need to trouble him
with importunities, but only with a fervent heart put him in remembrance of
those things we desire to have: saying Domine memento mei, Lord that have
created me, have remembrance of me, Lord that have Redeemed me forget me not,
and thou Lord in whom I believe, be mindful of me: Vouchsafe Oh Lord to draw
me to thy self: Oh love of my soul, have remembrance of me since thou have
formed me of earth, and since thou have breathed into me a soul, made me man,
have employed thy life for me, vouchsafe to be mindful of me, to the end
there be no spoil made of my Soul, yea, since thou have suffered thy Passon
for me, resisted so many Temptations, and spilt so much of thy innocent blood
as satisfied the Price of my vile and wretched Sins, I beseech thee be
myndefull of me.

Here is to be noted that this thief, in these humilities to God, said not,
Lord have remembrance of my children, my wife, my friends, or my labors and
travels, but said only Lord remember me, aduising us that in this world
there is nothing which we ought to hold so dear, as the reckoning of our
conscience according to the express text of our savior to the mother and
children of Zebeda, Nescitis quid petatis, because that before they asked pardon
for their sins, they demanded realms and kingdoms, and before they sought
to purge the transgression of their souls, they aspired to be set one of the
right and the other of the left hand of Jesus Christ: But the wise Chananite
woman, before she said, Filia mea male a demonio vexatur, cried Miserere mei,
sewing first for pardon for her self, before she sought the recovery of her
daughter: for that, so good is the Lord our God, that if he love not him that
requirs him, he grants him not that he demaundes: But thrice happy was this
thief, who before all things desired the Lord to have remembrance of him when
he came into his kingdom, whereby demanding pardon and remission of his
sins, he obtained the kingdom of heaven more easelie then he thought for:
Abraham demanded of God lineage, and there was given to him a son (of whose
race Christ descended according to the flesh) Jacob prayed for the redeliuerie
of Benjamin, which he saw accomplished: Tobias beseeching God for the return
of his son from Niniuie, imbrased him safely restored and richely married:
Judith prayed to God to chase away Holofernes and his Camp from her town of
Bethulia, and he put the Enemy into her power: Anna, in great compassion
desired issue, and she brought forth Samuel the Prophet: And lo this good
thief besought God to have remembrance of him in the other world, and the
Lord did not only pardon him in this world, but also glorified him in his
eternal kingdom: Right true and absolute is the testimony of the Scripture,
speaking of the liberality of God, Quod ipse dat omnibus affluenter, God geues
to al men in great abundance, which is contrary to the manner of the Princes
of the world, who if they give, it is not in plenty, and if they distribute in
fullness, they give it to few: But such is the bounty and blessed liberality
of our Lord, that he refuses not to give that which is demanded, and much
less geues in penury that which is required of him: Aperis tu manum tuam et
imples omne animal benedictione: Psalm. 144.
All those in this world says the Prophet that give any thing give it
cloase fisted, (as the saying is) But the Lord always increases in
liberality with his hands open, who as he is Pitiful to pardon, so also in
his rewards and recompense, he expresses high Liberalitye. Here also is to
be noted, that this Thief in his invocation to Christ, did not desire the
LORD to have remembrance of him to the end he were not Crucified, nor
required him to be mindful of him that he might escape the Perilles of Death,
since it was he only that gave life: But he said only Lord forget me not
when thou come into thy Kyngedome: For, seeing thee on thy Knees before
Pilate (says he) and being asked whether thou were a King and had Realms, I
heard thee Answer that thy Kyngedome was not of this World: Which being
true, I beseech thee, Oh sweet comfort of my Soul, that when thou art in
Possession of thy Kyngedome of rest, thou will then have remembrance of me,
being the greatest Sinner in the World. This Thief, seeing GOD in presence,
hearing him speak in person and touching him with his hands, and would not
demand of him other things then of the World to come, can not but put men in
a maze, and draw even Angels to admiration. From the hour that our Blessed
Savior suffered his blood to be dispearced upon the Cross, there has been
great effect and virtue of it in the Church, whereof appeared right good
Testimonye in the discourse and action of this Thief, whose life and whole
course of his behavior having been infected with wicked conversation, he
demanded presently to be made a neighbor of the Hierachies, and companion to
our redeemer: And having done no service to GOD, he asked of him with full
mouth the Kingdom of Heaven: which he obtained, not so much through the merit
of his invocation and Prayers, as by the mean and virtue of the blood of Jesus
Christ: wherein there is no reason to doubt but as our Lord was ready to
yield up the spirit, and that the effusion of his blood prepared to an end,
so, this good thief saw the Heavens open together with the great glory laid
up for our savior, by which occasion he cried in sewertie of faith, Memento
mei cum veneris in regnum tuum: For otherwise it had been vain for a Thief
to have demanded with such boldness the Kyngedome of infallible felicitye.
But whether the Majesty and presence of Heaven were open to him or not, there
is no necessitye of reasoning: Only let us join our selves to his Faith and
opinion, and with his Prayer let us call upon the Lord to remember us when he
comes into his Kyngedome: for, there may we be sewer he will remember us, since
in this world he will not recompense the services that we have done to him, and
in the other he will lay upon us the offenses we have committed against his
Majesty. Let us beseech him that if in recompense that we are Baptized, if,
for the renoume, name, and tittle we bear of Christians, if for that we are
his Servants, and specially if because he has redeemed us it will please him
to bless us with any reward, let it not be bestowed upon us here on earth,
but when he shall be established in the estate and majesty of his kyngedome:
For all such as he marks with recompense and reward in the Book of this
world, it is a sign that he has razed them out of the register of Heaven.
Jsaac was advanced more then Jsmaell, Jacob preferred above Esau, Juda
favored more then Ruben, Joseph raised above his Brethren, and Nahabor
advanced to the Vines of Samaria: But let us pray for no other advancement
then, Dum veueris in regnum tuum, For out of thy house all honors, all
preferments, all riches and dignities are contemnible.

For the end of this discourse, we have to note that Christ pardoning this
thief, said not Amen dico vobis, but speaking singulerly he said Amen dico
tibi: Whereby as in the manner and estate of his pardon he manifested his
mercy, so, in forgeuing him alone, he showed his upright justice: Many nations
and men of sundry qualities and Countries standing then round about the
cross, would have been glad to have obtained remission, but amongst them all
to this thief only was granted pardon, the better to advertise us that since
he forgave him, we should not despair by the same mean to obtain remission:
And since he pardoned but him alone, let us not sin the more in hope that he
will pardon us: So for conclusion let us not forget, that he forgave the people
before they had transgressed, and pardoned the thief after he had sinned, by
which we are instructed to fear his Justice, and to remember his mercy, which
it may please him to exhibitte toward us here by grace, and in the world to
come by glory.

A discourse, expounding this text of the Psalm.
Irasoimini et nolite peccare.
CHrist, greeuing still with the increase of abuses in the Temple, saw great
necessity of Discipline, and therefore in one day, he whipped out the
Vserers, reuersed their exchaunges, and dispersed their treasors: Wherein we
have to note which of these two things were of a most importance either the
zeal that Christ had, or the fault that was in them, being sewer that men
committing such Cursed and miserable Sins, GOD for recompense, lendes upon
us great and heavy Punishementes. To hold that Christ was not moved to do
this by a Spirit of good zeal, were to faulsifye the Truth, and to say that
in this yt he did he did evil, can not be without imputation of Blasphemye:
For, in the Eternal law of GOD it can not hold Concord or comparison, to be
a Sinner, and to be called Redeemer. Before Saint John said Ecce agnus Dei: He
pronounced Ecce qui tollit peccata mundi: Wherein he both confesses him an
Undefiled Lamb, and after Extolles him to take away the Sins of the World.
One Sinner may help to make an other good, but yet has he no power to Pardon
the least offense that is: And therefore to affirm, that Christ in any his
actions was pushed forewarde by choler, or Sinned in the transgression of Ire,
it were both Heresy, and a Sin desperate, for that, as touching Sin and
Error, our LORD was so lymited and restrained, that he neither could nor had
Power thereunto.

By this text of the Prophet, Irascimini et nolite peccare, is given us to
understand, Psalm. 4.
that we may be angry, but yet with this condition that we Sin not: For,
often times the Lord is more wrath with the Ire of the maiestrate, or
Governor, then with the offense which the Subject committes. I find it very
hard that this good Prophet should give us License to be Angrye, and yet to
bind us that in it we should not Sin, specially seeing that of the Mortal
Sins Condemned by the Church, the transgression of Ire is one: Yea, it
seems more strange that it should be in the hand and liberty of man to be
angry, and yet Sin not, since by our nature even our thoughts enclining to
Anger, can not be without Sin: Where by I hold it rat her a Virtue of
Aungelles, then a a power human, when a man that is injured is hable to
limitte his passion, and govern the affections of his heart, seeing that to the
nature of man, nothing is more sweet then the passion of revenge: yea,
oftentimes we are vnmindfulto requite a good turn, but seldom do we forget
to revenge an injury received: But it is needful we deduce in particular,
Nothing is more sweet then passion of revenge.
those things wherein in good conscience men may be angry, and that without
scrupule of sin: For that by howmuch more they were friends and enterteyned
amity together, by so much more the offense, the anger, and the sin, (which
seems but a dream) would put amongst them divorce and division: We may not
be angry against such as maliciously touch our honor, or by Ambicion aspire to
our goods: For that to the Noble mind it belonges to demand his recovery by
justice, and his honor by the swoorde. May we hold anger against such as have
done us some notable injury, and published dishonest speech of us? I say no,
for that according to the rule of the Gospel we are bound to pardon all
wrongs, and leave the reueng to God to whom it belonges. Men ought not to
beangrie, if, in their houses their wives be Libertynes and dissolute, for that
so delicate is the honor of the Husband and the Wife, that her chastity can
not be detected, without that he have interest in the dishonor: and therefore
in things that can suffer remedy, we ought either to qualifye the rigor of
the punishment, or dissemble the injury: much less ought we to be angry
against our servants, when they do not the duty of their place, or murmr
when they are commanded: For, being but marcenary to us we ought to admonish
the^, and if they will not be brought to amendment, to give them leave to
depart. We ought not to be angry with our friends and familiars, if in their
prosperity they misknowe us, and in our great adversities will not succor us:
For, according to their behavior, we have to give this judgment of them, that
as if they had been true friends, they would not have failed us, so according
to their corrupt affection, their pride carries them into disdain of our
Pouertye: In cases of Breach of promise, it evil be seems a Wiseman to be
angrye, for that this reputation belonges to Patience, that he ought rather to
loase that he hoped for, then to break the patience for the which he has
been so long praised. And how can we be Angrye against our selves when we
err in that we say, and use falshoode in that we do? Seeing that the remedy
of our abuses consistes not to be Angrye and vex our selves, but in the
amendment and reformation of our actions. Why should we be Angrye when we see
fortune rayseth others, and forgets us? Seeing that if fortune distributed
to every one according to the rate of their will and meritte, she could not be
called Fortune, but Justice: but because she will iustifye the Limittes and
Charters of her Authority, she uses to advance those that she favors, and
spares to prefer such as deserve to be exalted. Sure, we have no reason to
be Angrye against the suttelties of the Devil and the World: For that in well
advised Judgment and consideration, much less that they deceive us, seeing of
the contrary they admonish and advise us: And according to the Testimonye of
the Scripture, the office of the flesh is to prick us, the Devil traueleth
us in temptations, Office of the devil the world and the flesh.
and to the World is joined a propertye to deceive us: And let us not be
wroth, if we have not such Power and habilitye as others, since, if we make
aright our own Computation and Reckoning, we ought to be more sorye that we
have not deserved Honor then that we have it not. And since the Law of nature
and Fortune make all things Subject to revolution and change, and that of our
selves we are the proper instruments of our own harms, we ought not to be
Angrye or vexed but against such as rise to offend God and stir us to
commit Sin: For, a good Christian ought to be more sorye for him that has
a wound in his soul, then for any that suffer loss of their Goods, though
there be never so great Nearenesse and respect of Kindred and friendship: So
that the thing that ought most to trouble a good Christian, and breed
compassion in the man of holiness and virtue, is to see that men bear such
appetite to the sweetness of sin, and with such boldness follow their
liberty to do evil, that many and many are those now a days, who had rather
break the commandments of the holy law, then to infrindge the least
statute of the Prince. This is a thing to be marueiled at, that when the
Merchant is taken with a counterfayt measure, or the Goldesmith with a faulse
weight, the measure shall be brunt, the Balaunce broken, and the offender
rendered to publyke Justice: But if a man ve known to renounce GOD, or to bear
the guilt of Perjury, Murder, or Adulterye, much less that he shall be
chastised, but of the most he shall be favored, supported, and iustefied, yea,
to his impunitye shall be added lybertye to offend further to the Dangerous
Example of a whole communaltye. That men Sin, it is no wonder, but that they
be suffered to heap Sin upon Sin, bringes slander to the whole race and
generation of mankind: For, to be so impudent as to Blaspheme openly, and to
be an Adulterer in publyke, is as though there were no Gospel to forbid it,
nor GOD to Punish it: It is sure most horrible for a man to swell and wax
Fat in Sin, whose sweetness drawing him on after the delights of this
World, makes him so suck and lick up the Sirup of every vice that if he
leave, of with any of Gods commandments unbroken, it is not for want of will
but because he may no more: and albeit it be lawful for no man to sin, yet
how many do we see so resolved and obstinate in wickedness that by continual
frequentation of evil, they dout whether they be evil men or not. There is
nothing more dangerous to a Christian then to accustom himself to harden his
Conscience, for that in such wretches there is no will to be amended, nor
mean to be remedied: An other sort of sinners there is who, not content to
have sinned, vau^t of their wickedness, Vaunters of sin.
and challenge a reputation for doing evil: those be the people, against whom
God is most wroth, and whose offenses he is most slow to pardon: And by so much
more do we offend the majesty of God, by how much we are diligent and bold
to sin, and slow to repent, and obstinate in perseverance, but most of all
when we publishe our vileness with impudency and boldness. Esaias did not so
much complain, of the people of Jsraell for that they had offended God, and
forgot him: But for that they published their abominations, following therein
the Sodemites and Cursed creatures of Gomorha, to whom it was no more shame to
sin then to eat: Then against such kind of sins and sinners, with good
reason we may be angry, since of all other actions and accidents passing in
the world we may marvel and wonder, but not rise into anger and wrath. Moses
was evil entreated of ye king, followed of the Jews, murmured at by Dathan
and Abiram, and envied of his Sister, and yet for all those troublesome
perplexities, he was never so vexed and angry, as when he saw his people
sighe for the absence of Egypt, worship the Calfe, and murnure against God. It
is written of the great Mathatia father of the renoumed Machabees, that
notwithstanding he was deuested of the state of Sacrificator, and banished the
presence of his house whylest his goods were abandoned to spoil, yea outrage
violently conspired against his person: yet much less that he took vengeance,
seeing he was not once seen to kindle in anger, till he saw a wicked Jewe, in
the manner of the Gentiles Idolators, offer a Sacrifice, for which dishonor
done against God, he did justice on the offender. So extreme also were the
persecutions which the Prophet Helias suffedred of Jezabell and the Idolators
of Jerusalem, that oftentimes he prayed to God to be dissolved, to the end
his afflictions might take end: And albeit the authority and wickedness of
his adversaries, accompanied his heart with continual troubles and vexations,
yet he never prosecuted the revenge of any, but such as bowed down to the
Idol Baall, of whom, with their disguised God, he slew three Hundredth. My
eyes says David are always as fountaynes of lively tears, Psalm. 118.
not so much for the wrongs and offenses which others do to me, as for
compassion of the dishonor done against my God: Wherein as his affection was
holy feeling more bitterly the outrages conspired against God, then the
displeasures committed against himself: So, by his example, I say, we can not
do a thing in this world more just, then to take as our own, the injuries
done against the innocence of Christ: seeing he has taken upon him the
account and reckoning of all our offenses, and made our transgressions as his
own.

Following then the example of so many holy and excellent personages, we may
accomplish this commandment To be angry and sin not, which we do then
best perform, when we rebuke the sin, and bear pity to the sinners, and
help to succor and save their souls, and give no mean to the loss and
infamy of their honor: The which now a days happens in the contrary, for
that in few men is found a disposition to rebuke sin, but al sorts are
displeased with the sinner, committing their zeal into Ire, and Ire into
vengeance, and so by little and little, under couller to chastise, most men
execute revenge. The sin of Anger, besides, that of it self it is hateful,
is also in the same dangerous, seeing that with no man the neighbourhode of an
angry man is welcome, nor his friendship tolerable. Description of a furious
man.
The angry and furious man has these discriptions: His eyes rolling, his face
enflamed, his body trembling, his tongue troubled, his heart burning, and his
hands ready to strike, and so long as he is governed with rages, much less
that he is fit to execute any public business, seeing he neither knows what
he says, nor comprehends what he ought to do: And the more he is raised to
place and dignity, the more hurtful he is: For that which in a private man is
no more then natural Anger, That which in a private man is but natural anger,
in a magistrate may be called rage and fury.
in a Magestrate: Authority makes it rage and fury, and therefore in the
administration of a common weal, there is nothing more unworthy, then to a
heart naturally fierce and cruel, to add power and Authority. To the
impatient and furious man most commonly things do not best succeed, for that
being in Passion, he has not the rule of his own judgment, and much less
is hable to dispose of his fortune, he seldom finds friends to follow him,
and has few servants to serve him: For, it goes for the most part with the
furious man to have evil will of many, and stability of fellowship with none:
And ash is troublsome to many, so every man has matter to speak against
him, whereby, by the just occasion of his own meritte he lives always in
contention, in perplexities, in suspicion, in murmr, and for the most part
does contest and accurse against himself. Such men move their own scorn,
for that in their Passions they are laughed at, their frendships suspected, and
in their dealinges they are feared: that more easy is it to endure a
temptation, then the neyghbourhode of a furious man. With such men, we must not
communicate in things discreet, nor trust them in secret business: For that
to give council they are to rash, and to use secrecy their mouth is to open.
It is dangerous then to commit to a man possessed with a spirit of Anger,
any charge of government in the common weal: For that, in affayrs of policy,
as there be things that deserve to be chastised, and matters that ought to be
dissembled: So, it can not but happen to the furious man, that in place to
appease and cover injuries, he will of himself thunder reproaches against the
parties: But now after the dangers and domages that come by Anger, it
apperteynes to reason and congruencie, to exhibit a few remedies to Cure or
qualify those moodes. In all our affairs and actions, it is good to fore see
both what may happen to us, and what may be said of us, For, so shall we be
Armed, that albeit men give us cause to be Angrye, yet they shall have no power
to make our passion furious: And therefore the same need that the poor man
has of Riches, and the Fool of Wisdom, the same necessity has the heart
of patience: For, being Subject to many Afflictions, and the troubles no less
that assail him together with the dangers that depend on them wthout
comparison, many mo be the things which he ought to suffer in patience, then
that are Lawful for him to revenge with his Tongue. And if of every wrong
that is done to us, and of every adversity that is natural to our condition
we should reteyne special account and reckoning, our hands would never cease to
revenge, our Tongue weary with complaining, and our heart wasted and broken with
sighing: For, what man being a member of this miserable life, to whom is not
one equal desire that his days and troubles might dissolve together: Men
being so ouergrowne with vices, and so devoured with affairs and businesses,
it is marvel that since they are so slow to cut of their cares and troubles,
that the waves of their proper adversities do not rise and swallowe them up.
And if the Physicians ordained to cure infirmities of the body, would bind
themselves to heal the sorows of the heart: they should in particular have more
patients mustering before their gates, then in times past were inhabitants in
Rome when it was best replenished: For, so natural is the sickness of
trouble and vexation, that though many eschew it, yet few have power to live
long exempt from it. What is he either past, present, or to come, who, in his
body has not felt some pain, and in his heart some passion, has not suffered
some loss or spoil of his goods, or infamye to his person, or at least who
can walk so vpryghtlye to whom is not done some Iniurye, or some Scorn or
Reproache spoken? But he that is Vexed with all these Adversities, and will
make Headde against them and Remedy them, Let him be assured, that even then
shall he lay the plotte of the end, and dispatch of his life, when he begins
to put order to these incurable harms: For as there is no Sea without working,
no War without danger, nor Journey without travel: Even so that there is no
worldly life void of troubles, nor any estate without stombling blocks, it is
most apparent in this, that there lives no man so happy which has not wherein
to be grieved, and whereupon to complain. For how many do we see whom Pride
makes fall, Envy consumes, Anger torments, Poverty wastes, and Ambicion
ends their days: so that for the most part such is the miscontentment of our
minds, that our adversities traueling our spirits in Martyrdom drive us to
wish rather an honest death, then to languishe in so troblesome a life.

And so, if we will accomplish this commandment To be angry and sin not,
let us (in accidents which the world, fortune and nature bring upon us, Good
advise.
) dissemble some, suffer some, conceal some, and remedy the rest, and in all
things let us follow reason, and flee opinion.

For such as enter into Religion.
Touching a Chapter pro^^^^^all.
SVch as be Religious, or aspire to the office and ministry of the Church,
ought to have always before their eyes the words which God spoke to Abraham
saying: Depart out of thy Country, and from amongst thy friends, and go into
the land which I shall show thee, and abide where I command thee: For,
under these words shall they find comprehended all that God does for them,
and likewise that which they are bound to do for the service of God. Abraham,
being in the house of Tara his father, and Aran and Achor his Brethren
Chaldees and Idolators, God appeared unto him, and bad him leave his Country
and Parents, and go where he would guide him, and rest where he would
command him, and in recompense of this obedience (says God) I will make thee
Lord over great nombers of people, and will so give thee my blessing, as thou
shall for ever remain blessed.

Out of these words, may be gathered four things which God commanded
Abraham, and other four things which God promised him: So that as a Lord, he
teaches him in what he ought to serve him, and withal tells him what reward
he will give him for his service: Before God called Abraham, it was not found
that there was any virtue in him, and much less that he had done any service
to God: only the scriptures make mention that he was of the generation of
Saruth, and son af Tara, three sorts of people called to religion.
and had to his Brother Aran, which all were Gentiles and Idolators: Cassianus
says, that of three sorts be called those that come to the perfection of
Religion: One sort, God calls by holy inspirations: an other sort is chozen of
men by good councels: The third sort is constreyned to enter into Religion by
some necessity or misaduenture happened to them: So that albeit the perfection
of Religion be always one, yet the means to come thereunto are many. The
first function or estate, is called divine, and consistes (as is said) in this,
when the great goodness of God so touches the heart of a man, that he leaves
that which he does, and does that which he ought, estraunging his mind from
worldly things, and raising it to divine and heavenly contemplations. The
second is called human or worldly, as when any wicked liver is turned to
God by the council of some good man, as Hippolito was converted to the Faith
by the instructions of S. Laurence: The third vocation may be called
constrained, or by necessity: as when a man of dissolute conversation, and
falling into adversity, is converted to God: And as these be the three manners
of calling, and means to enter into Religion, so, if they be well considered, I
see not how the first (oftentimes) either does much profit, nor the last much
hinder for more or less to serve God in religion: For, there have been many of
those which God has called to Religion, condemned, and many others which came
to serve him by force, have been saved. Christ called and chused to the
Colleadge of his Disciples, ye cursed Judas, and the Apostle S. Paul being
reuersed and fallen from his Horse, necessity compelled him to know Jesus
Christ: So that Judas being exalted, fell, and S. Paul being fallen, was
exalted. This I bring in this place to the end that none esteem much, or make
great account, either to be called to the Religion by the will of God, or to
come to it by any necessity or misaduenture: For the Servant of God which
trauelleth toward his salvation in a religious life, ought not to remember so
much how God called him, as to consider wherefore God called him. There be many
religious men in Monasteries and elsewhere who atribute much to themselves for
that they entered religion in infancy, others challenge more for yt they took
the habit in ye heat of their youth: Some there are that ascribe to their
aduauntag for that they profess an order very strayt and reformed, and others
for being the followers and Disciples of men of holy life: And many there be
with whom it is no small reputation to have continued in Religion thirty,
forty, or fifty years, and they, in respect of their prescription, hold all
others but Nouices: Yea, most of them stick not to refer all their
perfection to the long time they have dwelt in Monasteries, having no regard
to the little they have profited in them. But, to enter Religion in infancy,
in youth, or in old age, to the man of God ought to minister no occasion of
advantage or estimation over others: but rather let him (as a good steward)
make a good account of his time, and travel more in the study and service of
God, then to keep reckoning of the years of his continuance. For what
estimation can prescription bring to any man, when he can show no fruit of his
time? seeing that much more does the religious man deserve for his knowledge
and humility, then for his old age or continuance. Judas remained three
years in the Apostleship of Christ, and three hours and no more did the good
thief hang by our savior on the cross, and yet by faith we are assured that
more did profit ye thief those three hours in torments, then the three years
did good unto Judas being a follower of Christ: In ye parable of the vineyard in
the gospel was no more hire given to him that wrought from morning till night,
then to those that entered the vineyard at the last hour: whereby we are
instructed that our merit or not merit stands not in ye services which we do
to God, nor in the little or great charity which we express, but chiefly as
it please his goodness to accept or reject us. All ye Apostles were called by
Christ before his death, saving S. Paul, and yet who doubts though he was the
last in vocation, but that he was even the first and chiefest in perfection
(because he labored more then all the rest): So that albeit to enter religion
in infancy, in youth, or to remain there long time, can not be but
commendable, yet under this condition, that it be not to this end to have a
greater portion in the profits, but to be more humble in their profession.
Beware therefore you that he Auncientes in houses of Religion, that you fall
not into the deceits and circumuentions of the devil, who, in recompense of
the great number of years that you have dwelt in religion, and the many
temptations that you have endured there will perhaps go about to pay you with
the best chamber in the Dorter, and make you proud with the first voice in the
chapter: Which you must eschew, for that, how much less comfort and cherishing
you have in the estate of religion, so much more is your perfection and
reverence. In like sort in the good religious man ought to appear no vain
glory, for ye he professes the habit of a strait order, or a vocation of
liberty, or whether he be obserua^t or cloisterer: for, ye perfection of ye
Gospel consistes not in the monasterye wherein we enter, but in the good and
holy life we lead. The children of Jsraell worshipped one only God in Egypt,
and being come into the land of Promise they revolted and misknewe him: So
that in what place so ever we are, let our virtues give dignity to the house,
and not the place seduce or alter our devotion. Albeit Joseph dwelt amongst ye
Egiptians, Abraham amongst the Chaldees, Tobias amongst the Assirians, and
Daniel was cruelly handled amongst them of Babylon, yet were they always holy
and happy: And by them we are taught that to the perfect man, the whole world
is his Monastery, as of the contrary, the profane and wicked man, of his
Monastarie makes a world: The same appearing in many wanderers, delighting in
change and to raunge from one house to an other under couller of perfection
(which more properly may be called temptation) they are not without their
excuses, and have ready tongues to blame their governors for that their
Monestaries are not reformed, complaining perhaps more by opinion, then that
there lackes perfection: For, there is no place in the world so profane, where
a man may not labor to be good if he will, or which to the man of God, helps
not to the service of his perfection. Let not the servant of God also be
glorious, for that in his order he was esteemed of holy life: For great is his
shame to be taught by a good May ster, and forget to follow his virtues, and
far greater is his abuse if he be renoumed for holiness, and be found an
Hypocrite. Dathan and Abiram had Moses to their master, Achab had Helias,
Ananias had S. Peter, and Judas had Jesus Chrict, who albeit they heard their
words and Preachinges, yet did they little profit by their Doctrines. And as
in works made by man's hand, we have a custom first to praise the work, and
then the workman that made it: so, touching a life religious, it is to small
purpose for a disciple to bear praise by his master: The good Religious man
ought not to vau^t, if the Lord call him more to one religion then to an other:
for, after yt a man be baptized, there is no estate in all the Church of God
wherein the good man may not be saved, and the wicked condemned: And therefore
to take rather the habit of S. Benet, then of the Augustines, to profess more
the Dominicanes then the Franciscanes, and to follow the Charterers rather then
the Trinitaries or Mercenaries, or to be affected more singulerly to one order
then to another, I hold it of small difference since ye albeit they are al
habits au^cie^tly instituted by holy parsonages, yet in truth they are but
traditional and subject to alteration and chang, where Christ's religion is of it
self pure, firm, and simple, and has no affinity with outward observations
and ceremonies: So that as God does more consider the heart of him that serves
him, then ye habit which he bears: So, I think that any man that is a good
Christian and delites in the true sweetness of the gospel may enter into what
religion he will, and have liberty to bear such habit as best sets forth his
gravity: For, for men to choose the habit of one religion more then of another
ought to be referred more to devotion then perfection. And albeit I cannot
deny, but that there be religions some more correct and better reformed then
others, and wherein the professors have more occasion to be good, and less
liberty to be evil: yet, I dwell resolutely in this that ye good or the evil of
a monastery lies not in the habit, but in the men that bear it: And where we
see many religious men suffer sundry passions and difficulties, which of them
professes the most worthy and perfect religion, it is sure lamentable to see
the inconvenience and evil examples which rise by such controversies, where
amongst the servants of God there ought to be more dispute for the truth of
religion, then to examine who follows best his profession.

An other discourse tending to religion in a Chapter general.
CHrist, We must acknowledge Christ for our faith, for our redemption and for
our doctrine
speaking of such as being not content to be christians, will be perfect
christians, says, who will not renounce all that he possesses cannot be my
disciple: And therefore before all things it behooves us to have Jesus christ
for god touching faith: and for redeemer in that which concerns the health of
our souls, and for doctrine to follow him as master: For, if he teach us not
that we have to do, and lead us not by his way, we shall remain in
ignorance, and wander without a guide, and be ready to stumble upon error,
psalm 24.
heresy, and Idolatry. Vias tuas domine demonstra mihi et semitas tuai edoce
me: Teach me Oh Lord says David the ways that end in thee, and the paths
by the which thou drawest to thy self those that be just: The Lord says not,
those that will renounce, etc. but speaking in the singular number, He says he
that will renounce all that he possesses shall be my disciple: giving us thereby
to understand how small is the number of them ye know his ways, and far less
ye congregation of such as go by his paths: for, of all those multitudes of
people which have received baptism, how many ar come to perfection? Then since
Jesus Christ has prsented himself to be our master, it is good reason that
we esteem our selves to be his disciples, which we do then accomplish best,
not so much when we hear his word, as when we tread in his steps: Cant. 8.
Pone me vt signaculum super cor tuum: Oh thou (says ye wiseman) ye comes to
serve me, and to follow me, put me as a white and mark in ye most dearest place
of thy heart, even there where ye beams of thy thoughts do alwias strike. The
first lesson ye is taught us in ye schole of this good master, is that he ye
rejects not all that he has cannot be his disciple: wherein he gives
knowledge to al posterities of ye profession of religion ye the first and
chieffest mark of a disciple of ye law of ye gospel, is to bear as great
compassion even to the porest, as they did to those that were most rich whilst
they were of ye world: For so shall they follow naked, him ye was naked, in
poverty, communicate with him that was pore, and in afflictions, follow him ye
was crucified even Jesus Christ, to whose disciples it is a chief duties
rather to do then to speak. It is a duty in disciples of Christ rather too
do then to speak.
Where Christ co^mau^des you to leave ye gold and silver ye you have of ye
world, it is not for ye riches of themselves are evil, but because they are
hurtful impediments in ye service of God: much hindering the action of our
duty in holy profession by mean of the toiles we have to get them, the cares
and danger to keep them, and the griefs they give us to depart from them.
Troublesome properties anexed to rithe.
This is one property annexed to ye goods of this world, that who takes the
greatest pains to gather them, has often times the least use and pleasure of
them: For when they descend by succession, we esteem them little, and if we
atteine them with our policy, they cost us dear. And when we give over to get
more, it is then that the afflictions of old age give us no time to take the
pleasure of those that we have. Temporal riches bring with them Pride and
weening to him that has them, covetousness to get more, penury to keep them,
and sin to enjoy them: So that who holds himself most happy to have them,
it is even he that has his body most charged with vices, and his heart laden
with cares: Yea, if those that be most rich were examined of the extreme
toiles and labors they have endured by land, the dangers they have passed by
sea, the losses they have suffered by Banquerouts, the Bribes and charges they
have employed, with other infinite perplexities that follow ye traffyke of
getting: I believe they had rather with ye easy beggar, have gone from door to
door, then with ye thoughtfull merchant, have traded from fair to fair. To
riches and richme^ is joined also this passion, that as they use great
industry to get them so have they no power to keep them: For, if their wealth
consist in milnes ye water carries the^ away, or else they depend of ye favor
of the wynd: if their treasurs be in silks and cloth, they are subject to
moathes: if their garners be full of corn, vermin will not forbear to
devour it: and if it be in gold or silver, it is a sweet pray to entice ye
thief, whom ofte^tims god suffers to be such a scourge to ye richman, that
what he has heaped together with the sweat of all his life, the thief takes
from him in one hour. This is also one affliction incide^t to richmen, ye
whilst they get they are private and alone, but when they come to use and
enjoy their riches they are ^^te^times to much accompanied: for, what with
pare^tage and kind^ed, recompense of servants, and oportunities of other
friends, the rich man, when he comes to divide his goods, or make his
testament, shall have more trouble to please all, then himself took pleasure
to possess and get all. And albeit he be liberal of his goods and reasonable
in ye distribution of them, yet shall he hardly escape without ye mormure of
his kindred, or grudging of his servants, and curses of his neighbors, and
that not so much for any wrong he has done them, as for that he will give them
no portion in his wealth: So that if by nature and charity we have compassion
on the poor that wants, we ought by reason to have pity on the rich yt has
abundance: for that he is always environed with friends that never forbear to
crave, and enemies yt seldom cease to accurse: therefore I see not, but if there
be great travel to get wealth, there is no less trouble to distribute it: for
yt as it is gotten in sweat and labor, so we see it is divided and left in
sorrow and tears. The rich man must enterteine many servants for ye train of
his person, and furnishe his house with costly array: to him belongs great
expense in hospitality and charge of buzines and in nothing must he fail yt
may furnish ye countenance and reputation of his riches, lest his honor be
blemished: so yt by the miserable qualety of this world, men do rather
accomplish with opinion then with reason: With this toil is also accompanied
for ye most part this further trouble to richmen, yt when their fortune or
folly has raised them to an estate of ability and power, they had rather die
then abate their pomp: and albeit they be sunck in substance, yet must they
keep up sail, and as ye saying is, wash their face with fair water, and dry it
over with a dishclout: so yt how much so ever a worldly man has of worldly
wealth in in this world, yet has he not so much, but yt he has want of
something, seeing yt if he have to supply his lacks, he wa^teth to accomplish
the desires of his prodigal youth, with whom need is not satisfied with
having plenty of things, for that having abundance, he lives still in desire
to have more. And such men, as they traueyle more for that that is
superfluous, then for that that is necessary, so if they would control that
which they have, and be discrete in that which they spend, they should find
that the travel they endure is not to satiffie the necessities they feel, but
to accomplish the vanities wherein they live: Rich men, the more they begin
to find out the secret and suttletie of traffyke, the more do they fall into
the bottomless troubles thereof, as, to buy, to sell, to exchange to retayle
on creditte, yea, to beguile, rob, and deceive, and which worse is, when they
protest most to give it over, it is then they are most drowned in it: So that
the more they have, the more they seek to get, the more they buy, the more
bargaynes they make, yea, the more they desire the more do they rob, and yet
(such is their wretchedness) that that which they have, seems but little to
them, and the little that others have they esteem a great deal: yea, being
never satisfied, they hold that they have but little, in comparison of that
they desire to have. Lastly, temporal riches bring with them this error, that
as before we get them, we have an insaciable appetite to them, so, being possessed
of them we grow to loath them, as in all other things fullness alters the
taste: So that in getting them, we pass through infinite passions and
difficulties, and having them we receive with them perplexities and cares,
reaping of our sweat and labors, a croppe of care, sorrow, and anguishe.

By all these, we may prove it a faulse testimony of him that calls riches
goods, seeing they have no property nor nature of God, but work the effect
of much evil: For, if there be any evil in the world at this day, rich men
do breed it, and the poor sort endure it: And therefore riches can not be
called good, for that greater is the number, Rich men bread most evils in the
world.
without comparison, of such as being good, become evil by riches, then of
such as being wicked, are by riches helped to be good. For, riches are rather
the ministers of vices, then of virtues, and ready instruments to do hurt
even against those that get them with pain and travel, Riches the ministers
of vices.
and keep them with care and cost. If they be in the keeping and power of an
old man, his age will not suffer him long to enjoy them, and if they be the
portion of one that is young, they will never give him rest til he have spent
them. So that I may well maintain that they be not goods, but evils, and not
simple evils, but most great and hurtful evils, seeing they put our bodies in
danger, trouble our spirits, bring greefes to our hearts and oftentimes takes
away our lives, and put our souls in hazard. That if riches were good as the
world says, and not evil as all men see, there would not be areared so
cruel wars between Princes, so many reuolts and troubles amongst estats and
countries, so many quarrels amongst neighbors, nor so many suits and
processes between brethren: amongst all which is seldom seen, one man to
contend with another for the correction and amendme^t of his life, but rather
for ye usurpation of their goods and possessions: where in I see no reason to
call that good which is the occasion of so many evils, since that no other
things are the riches of the world, but a desire of vain men, a stumbling
block for the wicked, a limebushe for the good, and a perpetual perplexite
for all sorts.

Let this suffize to warn chiefly such as are entered into religion, before
whose eyes ought alwais to stand as a burning lamp, that heavenly change which
they made with ye world yt same day that they left the world and entered
religion, wherein they exchanged pride for humility, ire for patience, and
cruelty for charity: He that being in religion, thinks he has left in the
world much gold, silver, possessions, and temporal goods, knows not what he
has left, nor what he has taken: For, in leaving the world, he has left but
misaduenture and adversity: and in entering religion he has chozen a life of
surety: for that to the good and virtuous religious man, it is more hard to
pass one day in ye world, then to suffer a whole year in a monastery.
Therefore he that will be poor, patient, abstinent, and continent, may with
surety be a member in all monasteries, but if he delight in epicuritie,
dissolutnes, and impatiencie, let him know that a religion well governed, is to
hungry for a glutton, to severe for him that is dissolute, and very judicial
against all transgressors. For end, let all men take heed how they follow the
world, since it leads them out of the way, let no man serve the world, for that
it is unthankful, who trusts the world, shall find it a traitor, and who
delights in the world shall be deceived, for that it has allurements to
entice men, and charms to cast them into a sleep which never takes end till
they die. Such as know not the world, desire it, and receive therein their
destruction, even as in sweet drink brewed suttelly which poison men suck up
the fatal syrup of their death and destenie: But ye religious men, enclosed
within the circuit of their cloisters ought to close their eyes from ye sight
of vanities, and let their ears blud not to be ravished with ye noise and
charm of riches.

Instructions still tending to men entered religion.
SO good has God been always to those whom he loves that from the beginning
of the world, he has used to divide and separate them from ye world, and from
the society of worldly things: as he did by Abraham when he drue him out of
Chaldee, called Jacob from Sciria, and chused Moses out of ye palaice of
Pharao: by which we are instructed, that with God it is none other thing to
lead a man into religion, then to take from him occasions to sin, and give him
grace to serve him. When ye son of god would reueil any secret mystery to any
of his dear disciples, he used to lead the^ into solitary places, separate from
ye brute of ye world, thereby to signify to al posterities, that by how much
more god loves a man, by so much more does he estraung and divide him from ye
fellowship of ye world: Ducam illum in solitudinem et loquar ad cor eius: The
soul that is beloved of me says god by his prophet Osee, and which I have
predestined, I will draw out of the troubles of the world, and lead him into
solitary places, and pryuately reveal unto his heart my secrets: Right
happy is that soul whom the Lord calls to the desert of Religion, there to
serve him with greater devotion, and follow him with more constancy of heart.
God has spoken to many by signs, and has communicated with many by writings
and words, yea, to some he has whispered in their ear: But he spekes only
to the hearts of those whom he loves with his heart: And little serves it that
God spoke to us in the ear to hear him, to our eyes to behold him, and to
our tongue to exalt him, if with all he spoke not to the heart to love him: For,
it is impossible that he should love God with his heart, who has him not
imprinted in his heart: And then does GOD speak to the heart of a Christian,
when he draws him out of the storms of this world, and leads him into the
solitariness of a Monastery, where he may his body in purity, and his mind
in contemplation: For, the tree that stands by the high way geues more
shadow to the passenger, then fruit to the owner that prunes it: God does not
only say, J will draw him from the world, and lead him into the desert: But
he said he would speak to his heart, meaning, that little does it avail to be
led into the desert of Religion, if with a good heart we do not abandon the
things of the world. For, more does it hurt then good, if our Surgion draw
from us a gross tooth, and leave behind some corrupt rote to infect the
gumes: And therefore, who forsakes the world with good heart, and enters into
Religion with holy intention, it is he with whose heart God does communicate,
and loves him with his heart: God has promised that wheresoever two be
gathered together in his name, he would be the third, therefore it is good
Religion to believe that he is in all houses well corrected, and in every
virtuous congregation compounded upon religious persons magnifying and serving
him both day and night: So that such as are admitted to a virtuous assembly,
can not have in this World a more great felicity: And therefore not without
great mystery, God commanded Abraham to abandon the house which he had
builded, and the inheritance which he had established, thereby to instruct all
professors of religion, that in all temporal things are impediments to be
good Christians, and hinder the science of perfection in religion: Declina a
malo et fac bonum, thou ought to flee darkness, Psalm. 36.
if thou will enjoy the light, thou must follow the right way if thou will not
err, avoid the mire and dirt, if thou will be with out spot and clean, yea
thou must first forbear to be evil, if thou will begin to be good, and so
shall thou which the council of David, eschew the vice and follow virtue.

This discourse was uttered in the presence of a Noble Lady at her Churching.
SInt lumbi vestri praecincti et lucernae ardentes in manibus vestris: Oh thou
that come or meanest to come to the house of the Lord (says Christ) it
behooves thee to be straightly girt before the Candle and the Candlestick be
given thee in thy hand: For amongst the Servants of God, if we see any go
heauely, sadly, and discomforted, it is a good argument to say that he is
negligent and not well girt. The Scripture bears witness, that Elias in the
Desert, S. John in the Wilderness, S. Peter in Prison, S. Paul in Ephesus,
and Christ upon the Pinnacle, although they were thinly clothed, yet were they
well girt: By which is gathered this instruction that notwithstanding the
troubles and persecutions happening to perfect men, they ought not for all that
to give over that they have begone, nor be cold or negligent in that they have
taken in hand. The gown that is well girt keeps the body warm, and
gathers less wynd: Euenso ye man that professes a religion to serve God
being girt with puretie and holy intentions, is the better armed against the
wind of vanities of this world, and no less prepared for the heat of
devotion and service of God. So that then we may say a man is well girt, when
we see him in the way to be holy and just: For, so abstinent and continent
ought we to be in religion, that both the world may behold our virtue, and
many made better by our example. And therefore where the LORD says, it
behooves us to have our gowns girt before we take the candels in our hands,
it is to advise us that in such sort should we leave bound, trodden out, and
naked, the vanities and riches of this world, that they have no power to
follow us, and we less desire too go seek them. The lighted candelles
which we should have in our hands, be the good and holy works we ought to
do, and as he is one that holds the candell, and he an other that pertakes in
the use and light of it: so the good work of the holy man is not only
profitable to himself alone, but it also serves to edify an other that sees
him do it: with all, like as he is not exempt from sin, who to an other gives
occasion to sin: in like sort that man can not be without meritte, whose
virtue is the cause that an other does any good action: the same agreeing with
the interpretation of this text of the Prophet, Particeps sum omnium timentium
te: when we are the cause that other men serve God we do communicate and
partake (says he) with the merit of such good things as they do in his
service. It suffices not (says Jesus Christ) to hold one only candell in
our hands, but it is requisite to the office and piety of Christians to have
many: For, as the true christian, and man of perfect devotion to GOD receives
of the plentiful hand of the Lord, many graces and benefits: So it is
necessary that he do him many services, and keep his spirit in continual
exercise of thanksgiving. For, as this is common in the office and frendshippe
of men, that by how much less we are raised to benefits above our merit, so
much more are bound to owe al those due respects of recompense and ciuility
as may hold us acquitted, and leave our friend satisfied. Even so with God, this
is an infallible property in his justice, to minister rewards to good men
above the rate of their merittes, and prepare punishment to the wicked under
their deseruinges. And where Christ commands (not without great mystery) that
we should hold in our hands our candles lighted, and neither use the service
of the candlestick, nor appoint others to hold them for us: it is to advertise
us, that if God ought to save us, it ought to be through his great mercy only,
and not by any mean of our proper merittes, although in our actions we ought
always to express a holy industry and diligence. In like sort it is not
enough (in the profession of religion) yt we be girt, yt we have ca^dles, yt we
hold the^ in our hands, or that we have many candles: but it belongs to our
christianity to have the^ burning with light, and not as dead and stinking
snuffes: where by we are warned, ye better were it, not to enter into religion
at al, if in the same we correct not the abuses of our lives, and gather profit
by ye fruit and doctrine of the gospel: by ye example of ye great prophet S.
John baptist, being himself (as ye scripture says) ye candle yt burned and
gave light, are bound al sincere and virtuous religious men, to take heed yt
they want no wax of good life to burn, and be less replenished with vices to
give impedime^ts to their lights: so yt no other thing is ye religious man
undevout, then a candle dead: and it can not by any similitude resemble a
candle light, but rather a snuff trodden out and quenched, where the man of the
church has no other good thing in him then his habit, by the which he ought
never the more to exalt or glorify himself, since, before ye majesty of God it
is no no other thing to be reputed a holy man holding nothing of virtue but his
habit, then a candle, whose light being quenched his quality lies dead. The
virgins yt had not their lamps lighted (according to the judgment of ye
gospel) deserved not to enter with the bridgrome: euenso ye man by whom is not
performed the duty of a good Christian, and muchlesse has fulfilled the
office of a Churchman, may stand assured, that when de dies, he shall not be
found amongst those that are invited, but past over to the fellowship of such
as are deceived. That great is the grace which God shows to that man whom he
withdrawes from the world and reduces into holy religion, for that there is
more surety to stand, and not so much subjection to fall, and if he suffer
him to stumble, he has appointed him helps to hold him up, and many ready
means to repentance: Since that in the Church he has more opportunity to
serve God, and less occasion to commit sin. And albeit, being compounded
upon humors and complexions of corruption, we cannot but err in things
corrupt and worldly: Yet such is the care and protection of God over those that
he loves and has called and chozen to the service and office of the Church,
that if sometimes he suffer them to fall the better to make them know him, it
is not without the ready assistance of his hand to help them essoones to rise
again: Yea, he seldom suffers them to slide into such faults, as may give
him occasion to be angry with them.

Therefore, who under the habit of religion, rises into a mind of Pride,
Ambition, Epicuritie or Malice, is amongst the children of God, the same that
Satan is to all Christians, Dathan amongst the Jsraelites, Saul amongst the
Prophets, and Judas amongst the Apostles: Wherein let all men be warned that
have will to enter into Religion, that before they seek it, they may know
wherefore they follow it, since for no other cause ought they to come to the
communion of Religion but to amend and reform their lives. For, albeit the
sincerity of Religion receive great sinners. yet, it is with no tolleration to
commit heinous Crimes after they be invested. What other thing is meant by that
Discipline of the Scripture, wherein the Land of Promise for traueling in
small labors on the Holidays, they were commanded to be stoaned. But that to
the man of the Church sinning lightly in Religion, was merit of great severity
and punishment, for that a small sin committed in the world, bears an
estimation of a grievous crime in the Church. Take heed (says S. Paul) that
you receive not the grace of our Lord in vain: And what other thing does he
then receive it in vain, who makes no reckoning of his election, and cares not
to be called to the Church, and divided from the world. For, as by baptism we
are sanctified, euenso by the profession of the ministry we are regenerat.

Let every one then take heed what it is that he takes in hand, before he
begin to manage so holy a function, and whether they be professors by will or
by necessity: For, all religions being of the institutions of holy personages,
as it can not be tolerable that in their ministers be any imperfections or
want of perfect devotion and virtue. So, who in the habit of religion, will
live profanely or follow the liberty of the world, in that man is no
appearance of reformation, and less argument of faith or virtue. And therefore
in the church for some particular mento be more exempt and priuileadged then
others, or to aspire above the congregation and community of the Church in any
private or familiar prerogative: although it may be suffered for a time, yet
religion can not hold it tolerable long. For, no more then the Sea can bear
bodies that be dead, no more has the Church a nature to brook in her
ministers minds of Ambition and Pride: for which cause it is called order, as
wherein are contained all things well ordered, which, without this order,
cannot but bear to confusion. Who has once taken the habit of religion, and
will still continue entangled with the customs of the world, and exercise his
mind in vanities, can not but break the statutes of Religion, and stand in
peril of infidelity, since the doctrine of the gospel, and the liberty of
the world could never hold society or fellowshippe together.

A discourse in the presence of a great assembly of Noble Ladies of the good
and evil that the tongue does.
Mors et vita in manibus linguae.
IF to men of the world were power of election to demand the things they
desire most, before all other temporal felicities, they would require to live
long. And if (on the other side) they had liberty to contesse what thing in
the World they abhorred most, who doubts not but all men loath nothing more
then to dye? Whereunto there is to be made this ready reason, that as living,
they enjoy that they have, and dying, they leave to be that they are: So, with
life all things are remedied, The souerigne duty of mortal folks is the
solace of their life
and by death there is nothing which has not end, yea ye sovereign delight of
mortal folks is the solace of their life, and the greatest terror they suffer
is the opinion and conceit of death.

Beasts exercize generation, fruits return seeds to their planter, corn
yeeldes his grain of increase, and birds leave eggs in their nestes. And all
for no other reason then yt knowing they can not always live, they leave
others to liuein their place: yea, for no other purpose do men and beasts
eat, drink, sleep, and execute their other natural actions, then thereby the
more to preserve and pamper life, and with more security to prolong and shyft
of death. And, for that (in general experience) nature loves her conversation,
and abhors all things hurtful to her increase, we see there is nothing
more comforts the man that is sick, then when he is told that he may eat of
what his appetite lykes best, even so there is no word that does more amaze or
mortifye him then when he is put in remembrance of his mortality, and to
prepare his conscience, for with one word he has sewertie of life, and with
an other he hears his sentence of death: Whereof was verifyed a right true
experience in ye good king Ezechiell, to whom, in one hour, in one house, and
to one person, even to himself, was pronounced by the Prophet Esaias, that he
was condemned to death, and that GOD had eftsoons given him Pardon: So that
having deserved by the gravity of his sins that GOD should take his life
from him: God afterward, through the fulness of his mercy, and consideration
of his tears and repentance, found occasion to pardon his death: how incensat
and rude soever any creature is, yet we see he has judgment to eschew the fire
that burns him, All things desire to live and are loath too dye.
to avoid the Laborinth made to his destruction, and not to clime with
desperate peril those high rocks, from whose tops is present effect of death:
whereunto by what other reason is he induced, then to preserve life which he
holds dear, and flee death which nature teaches him to fear. The brute
beast flees death, and yet he is of a condition not to judge of the worthiness
and solace of life: but to man nothing is more dear then life, and of al other
things he holds death in most terror: for that living he knows what he is,
and being dead, he cannot tell what shall become of him (since after death there
is no restitution, no more then a tree once hewn down, can be eftsoons
replanted.) Friendship and the office of society, require yt we wish to our
friends, much ability, might, and power: but with a greater affection we wish
them long life: yea this stands in common regard with us all, rather to seek
to prolong our life, the^ increase our wealth, and not to make a greater care to
augment our treasor, then to continue our days: which being true, what a
wonderful providence of God and nature is this, that ye confidence of life and
death consistes only in ye tongue, who has ye same office in ye administration
of ye life of man, which is incide^t to ye portall or wyket of a great palaice,
through ye which do enter al things yt we eat and use, and by ye other do issue
all that we think and speak. So that it holds good conformatie with the
saying of the Wiseman, that life and death are in the power of the tongue,
since life is at the portall of our Palaice ready to depart, when death
striking on the hamor of our conscience seeks to enter, yea, there is no part
of our body wherein we stand more subject to danger of life and death, then
in our mouth and tongue: for that they being the open gates of the tower and
truncke of the body, life may go out without speaking, and death has liberty
to enter without knocking. 2. Cor. 4.
Habemus thesaurum in vasis fictilibus, says S. Paul: as if he had said: Oh
what pain have Christians to bear in feeble and frail vessels, such precious
treasures, as faith in the understanding, charity in the will, piety in the
hands, love in the heart, chastetie in the body, and life and death in the
tongue: Yea, they are virtues infused into vessels corrupt, and appointed to
consociate members putrifyed, who being so dangerous to be managed, and most
easy to be broken, what surety or guard is there to the life, when in the
mouth is found no government, and to the tongue is denied the gift of
secrecy: For, having no boanes to control it, nor senewes to restrains it,
what science or mean has it to do that we command it, or how can it
retain and keep secret things which are referred to his trust and
confidence. Therefore to the man that fears death, and desires long life, it
is necessary he minister government to his tongue, lest he know not how to
prolong his life, and much less find out where upon his death may come.

Solomon then said wisely that death and life were in the power of the Tongue:
Meaning, that as to some men the tongue has saved their life, so, in others,
wicked speech has wrought the occasion of their death: For that to a Noble
mind, an injurious word does more hurt, then a great cut or wound of a
swoorde on the body of a barbarous or rude man. And to prove by many examples
and figures in the Scripture, the operation of the tongue, in the action of
life and death: we read that Cayn being asked of God, why he had slain his
Brother Abell? In place to repent him of the fact and ask Pardon of God, he
said that his fault was greater then that Gods mercy could forgive it,
against whom S. Augustine cries vehemently that much less that the mercy of
the Lord could be inferior to the fault of Cayn, seeing that to pardon and
forgive is a thing proper to God, and to revenge and punish is far estranged
from his nature: To pardon and forgive is a thing proper to God.
So that there is no doubt but greater was the offense of Cayn in the words he
said, then in the Murder he did: (since, if with the stroke of the swoorde he
took away the life of his Brother, by the Blasphemy of his tongue he gave
death to his soul): To kill his Brother was evil done, but to despair in Gods
mercy, was even a transgression of the devil, for that more do we offend
God to esteem him without mercy, We offend God more too think him too be
without mercy then in any other transgrssion.
then in any other sin we commit against his majesty. Some of the Jews
Crucified Jesus with torments, and some with their tongues, in whom I think
was deeper effect of sin then in ye rest that pierced his body with nails:
For that, they laid their hands on him by ignorance, but the other filled
their tongues with false testimony, and Blasphemed and Crucified him by
malice. It is written in the Prophet Esaias discoursing upon the fall of
Lucipher. Quia dicebat in cord suo in coelum conscendam, et super astra dei
etc. Esaias. 14.
Because thou have said Oh Lucipher that thou would mount up to the highest
Empire of heaven and there erect thy Throane, and be like to the most high and
mighty God, it was good justice that thou should fall from that thou wast,
since thou aspirest to be that thou ought not: yea, in thy ouerweening
expressed in Proud and Arrogant words was wrought the reason and effect of
thy wretched fall: wherein let all men be warned to take heed what they say,
what they do, and what they think, since Lucipher was not thrown from the
seat where he sat, even into the bottomless Pit where he fell, but for the
disdainefull words which he spoke, and arrogant thoughts he conceived: So
that as his weening defaced him in heaven, so through his wickedness was he
recommended to Hell. Senacherib King of the Assirians and a great Blasphemer
against the omnipotency of God, preparing a mighty Army against Jerusalem,
sent his Heralds to King Ezechias with this sommonce: Non te seducat deus tuus
in quo fiduciam habes non enim poterit vos quis de manu mea eripere: 4. Kings.
18.
Take heed King Ezechias (says he) and be not abused in confidence and
opinion that the aid of thy God, or the power of thy huge Army are hable to
protect thee from the stroke of my hand, for that I will compel thee
eftsoons to communicate in the tribute and subjection of thy Auncesters. But
so God kindled in indignation against these arroga^t threats, that even before
he had done any pillage or murder in the country and in the beginning of the
Siege before Jerusalem, behold the Angall of the Lord killed in one night a
Hundredth and fourscore Thousand men of his Army: and himself fleeing to his
City of Niniue, was there slain by his own children, loasing in this sort
through the wickedness of his tongue, his Honor, his host, his Kingdom, and
his Sinful life, where many other Princes of the Assirians, Perses, Meades,
and Egiptians before him, notwithstanding they executed great cruelties over the
common weals of the Hebrews, yet they made wars with their weapons, and kept
their tongues in rest, and therefore were punished with more favor then most
wicked Senacherib: Therefore amongst Princes in Kingdoms, magistrates in
publyke office, and Prelates in their congregations, as it is a thing of most
equity that they do justice, so is it no less unseemly to be Blasphemers or
wicked speakers, (since oftentims men do more account of injurious words
spoken against them, then of the punishment that is laid upon them.) And
neither for the Prince in his kingdom, nor the general in the Camp, nor to
the church man in time of peace, can it be any way convenient to be proud in
their conuersations, In no estate is it seemly to be biting in word
and less biting in their words. The kindred of Cayn (sons of the
Patriarch Noe) said they would build a tower whose tops should aspire to
heaven, to save them from the surie of the fludde if God sent any upon the
earth: Wherein as they imagined that in their hands lay the power too avoid
death, and not in the might of God to take from them their life: So we have
assuredly to hold it a great Mystery, that for so great an offense GOD would
not Punish them in their persons, nor spoil their goods, nor reuerse their
Cities, and much less take from them their vices, but only he Chastised them
in their Tongues: against whose Pride and Arrogancy it is a good argument that
GOD boar a greater displeasure, then against the Huge Tower they had erected.
For that if he had not more dispized their conspyring Tongues then their
subtle Buyldinges, he would rather have defaced their Tower, then confuzed and
Changed their Languages. Before these Cursed BABILONIENS drew into Council
to Build this Tower, the whole World spoke but one sort and Phrase of
Language: But GOD, seeing the disposition of People and Nations declining too
do Wickedly, took from them the manner of speaking, where (if it had so
pleased him) he might have drowned them as he did the Army of Pharao, or
stricken them Blind as he did the Sodomites, or have Burnt then quick as he
did the Children of Aaron: But according too the Custom of his Justice, since
with their Tongues they had disobeyed him, he provided that in their Tongues
more then in any other thing, was published their Punishment. Oh that men in
these times would look up too the justice which God thundered upon Babylon,
so should they forget to Murmr, and forbear to blaspheame, yea if the
impression of those threats would take place in their minds, I doubt not but
the backbiters would turn their tongs from slander, Who can not flatter is
esteemed either malicious or proud
and al men cease to sin, yea, if the consideration of Gods justice stood
before the secret conscience and judgments of princes, they would not be so
subject to flattery, although ye time is now grown to this corruption, that
who cannot flatter is esteemed either malicious or proud.

Such is the danger of the tongue, that if it be not restrained to order and
limit, it has a natural liberty to speak even to our own hurt: And ye
speech being none other thing than ye image and figure of ye mind, there is no
less necessity of temperance and council in ye controlement of our tongue, then
to govern our conscience. We offend not more in any other member then in the
tongue.
There is no other member apperteyning to man, wherein we have a more facility
to offend, then in ye tongue, by whose unbridled swiftnes we are often times
carried into voices sou^ding even to our proper harms, as happened to the
Amalechite that brought David the first news of the death of Saul: I come
from the Camp of the Hebrews (says he) and bring thee tydinges that thy
ancient enemy king Saul is dead whereof these eyes are true witnesses, for
that these hands slew him obeying his own request. But David notwithstanding
he was delivered of an enemy, could not but disdain the boldness of the
messenger to lay violent hands upon the Lords anointed, and therefore he gave
this sentence of him. Let thy blood be upon thine own head, since thy mouth
has condemned thy life, and thy self have spoken against thy self, Sanguis
tuus sit super caput tuum. 2. King. 1.
saying: J have killed the anointed of the Lord, whose garment thou ought
not so much as to touch, and much less spoil the liberty of his life. Here
David did not justice upon this messengere so much for the murder he had done,
as for that he made vaunt and glory of it: So that as he slew Saul with the
sword, so also he Killed himself with his proper Tongue. And albeit in
respect of the Ancient Quarrel and Wars between Saul and David, this
poor Amalechite had thought to have been the bringer of glad Tydinges, and
for recompense to have received great advancement: yet greater was the
consideration of David to revenge the offen^^ ^^ne against God, then either to
rejoice in ye news, or regard the commodities that grue to him by the death of
King Saul: Wherein by so much was his perfection and charity greater, by
howmuch he did not only weep for the death of his enemy, and honored him
with funeral pomp and Burying, but also he gave Revenge to his Death. In that
fearful discourse which CHRIST makes of the rich man and Lazarus in the other
world, we find that the rich man Cried unto Abraham to have Pity on him: at
least wise that he would send Lazarus to touch with his Finger the flame and
heat of his Tongue: which request, albeit seems to carry no face of
importance or greatness, yet the upright justice of God would neither hear
nor help him: For that in his prosperity having denied to the pore the very
Crummes falling from his Table, by what reason could he deserve a drop of
Water to refreshe or comfort his necessities? And where by the testimony of
the Scripture we find that this wretched rich man was both a glutton, and an
epicure in delites of Banquets, Garments, and all other sensualities: Yet it is
apparent that in no part of his body he feels such sorrow, as in his Tongue,
nor in any sort commits so great sins as in speaking. By whose example and
Punishment, let all men in their conversation bring forth virtue, and in their
speech use council and discression, (since the next way to live in honor and
dye with praise is to be honest in desires, and to have a Tongue well
corrected.) And so for end, if to Cayn, Lucipher, Senacherib, the builders of
the tower of Babylon, the Murderer of Saul, and the wicked rich man, had not
been joined vain tongues to pronounce disdainefull and indiscreet things, it
may be believed that they had not with such lightness have lost their lives
in this world, nor in the other, had put their souls under perpetual damation.

But now, having proved how the Tongue has been to many the cause of their
Death: Let us also in another Example of the Piety of David, prove that in so
has been the occasion of life (according to the argument of our Theme, That
Life and Death are in the power of the Tongue:) In the body of Man, the most
necessary member is the Heart: The goodlyest Instruments are the Eyes: The
parts most delicate are the Ears: And the thing wherein is most danger with
good reason we may say is the Tongue. For that the Heart thinks only, the
will consentes, the Ears hear, the Hands stryke, but to the Tongue is tied a
propertye too Kill and Sleye. And as our Tongue is none other thing then as a
white Wall, whereon the Wise man may paynte devout Images, and the Fool draw
things vain and fond: So to him that can use his Tongue well it is an
Instrument that may work to his Salvation, as of the contrary, who employeth
it in ill services, it is sufficient to his Damnation. For the Heart being the
Fordge whereon our Wicked plottes are wrought, then that which our Tongue
pronounces is none other thing then the price and publication of the Sins
which we have within our Heart. But now to the History of King David, a thing
no less pitiful to hear, then necessary to know. For that the discourse
leaves to all Christians a true experience what weakness we have to fall, and
with what readiness we may eftsoons rise again. As king Saul by Gods will was
deprived of his kingdom, so in his place ye eternal providence raised ye holy
king David, who in the sight of ye Lord found so much grace, as the wicked
Saul was disfauored. So God loved David, that amongst al ye patriarchs he made
him most honored, amongst the prophe^s best inspired, amongst the Capteines
most feared, and amongst the kings best esteemed and loved: yea he found him
so agreeable in his sight that he promised and swore to descend of his race,
bearing himself such witness of his holiness that he confessed that amongst
all the Children of Israel, he had found and chozen David as best pleasiing
his Heart and most agreeable to his will: Juueni virum secundum cor meum.
And so was David loved of God with a divine affection For that he served him
with all his Heart: by which we may judge that with one equal Weight or
measure, God loves us with the ^ame measure where with we serve him.
are peysed the love which GOD bears too us, and the services which we do to
him. But as Idleness is the Enemy of virtue and the very train to all
Wickedness, it happened that David being in his Palaice, well dispozed of his
person, and mighty in Countries (but his mind environed with Idleness) he
fell into an accident most prejudicial to his renoume, and no less infamous
to his common weal. Whereby Princes may see that more punishment do they
deserve for the evil example they show, then for the vices they commit: For,
it had not happened so to ye good king David if he had been either writing of
Psalms, or busy in some expedition of war, or at least managing some other
his affairs of importance: but such is ye resolution of God, and so it is, so
it has been, and so it shall be, yt from ye time that princes take truce with
their enemies, they set at liberty ye fludde of vices to run with maine
stream into their courts and palaices, according to ye testimony of S.
Augustine in ye city of god. More hurtful was ye city of Carthage to Rome
after her destruction, then during ye whole course and season of wars which ye
Romans had with her: For ye whylest they had enemies in Affrike, they knew not
what vices meant in Rome: But now eftsoons to ye history. David being idle in
his gallery beheld ye beutie of Bethsabe ye wife of Vrias being then in ye
wars, and applying ye absence of her husband to ye commodity of his desire,
what with his great importunity, and her small constancy, he committed
Adulterye and gatte her with child. And fearing Detection of the Fact, he
Wroat speedelye to Joab his Gennerall in those Wars, that at the time of the
assault, Vrias might be preferred to the peril of his life, wherein, according
to the society that is in sin, it seemed that from one offense he appealed
to an other, as from Epicuritie, he fell to idleness, idleness bred in him
foul desires, by desire he was driven to solicit, by soliciting he beguiled
her weakness, and after he had beguiled her, he fell to adultery, and from
Adultery to Murder, so that the Devil had never deceived him, if himself had
not pitched the toils of his proper harms: Yea, if David had so served God,
as God loved him, he had never suffered him to fall so far. For, with such
care does the Lord hold up such as strive to serve him, that he never
suffers them to fall into great sins: But if we do slide, stumble and hurt
our selves, let us not be amazed, for even the same infirmities are common to
Angels: Therefore when we pray to God, we ought to demand with tears and
contrition, for, that if he then suffer us to fall, he will also give us grace
to rise again. So provident is the Lord over the virtuous, says the
Prophet, and so careless to the sinner, that if the just man swim upon the
main Sea, he will not suffer him to be drowned: Where the wicked walking upon
the firm Land shall fall headlong into wels and deep pittes, which the
Scripture does conster to that foul and huge enormitie of sins of the which
he has no power to repent. All this I have written upon the occasion of the
sins wherein King David fell, who notwithstanding used such diligence to rise
again, and from the time of his restitution so labored to live in Gods fear,
that albeit he was bruised with his fall, yet he was not greatly hurt.

Immediately then that the Lord advertised David by the Prophet Nathan, The
conclusion
that he was so much kindled against him both for the Adultery and Murder,
that he would send upon him punishment according to the greatness of his
falt. The good King lift up his heart and hands to the Lord and cried Peccaui,
and confessing himself to be an abominable sinner, he rent the heavens with
his sighs, and watered the earth with his infinite tears, wherein it is not to
be doubted, but that the exercize of so unfeigned repentance, and confession
of, his falt, was a great degree to his forgiunesse. He willed not the Prophet
to dispute with God, and say on his behalf that he was frail, or that the
Devil had deceived him, or that it was a sin human: But he aspiring to the
mercy of God, exhibited confession of his fault saying, Tibi soli peccaut et
malum coram te feci: Wherein, in not seeking to justify his fault, he found
forgiveness of his trespass. Here may be gathered to the comfort of all good
Christians, that after David had sinned, he went not so soon to search God,
as God was ready to receive him, whose providence and perfection is such over
his chozen, that though they fall in any notorious Crime, yet he suffers them
to have no perseverance in it, according to the experience of his heavenly
bounty expressed upon S. Matthew, and S. Paul, whom Christ searched, with the
blind man near the high way, with others of whom the Scripture gives
testimony that Christ searched them. Then let all Christians confess the
wonderful clemency of God, who even in our negligence goes out to seek us:
though we pray him not, yet he prays us, and where we forget to call to him,
he fayles not to call upon us, so that if we loase our selves, and be the
instruments of our own destruction, it is not so much for that we have sinned,
as for that after our transgression, we will not believe. Let us therefore take
pleasure to hear when God calls us: Let us be glad to be found when the Lord
searches us: Let us be ready to follow when he guides us: Let us be willing to
believe, when he takes from us all deceyt: And let us think us happy to serve
him, when he is disposed to pay us our hire. Yea, since he is so liberal and
pitiful toward us, let us with the council of S. Paul, Go with confidence
to the throane of his grace: For, Eamus cum fiducia ad thronum graciae eius
seeing he went to seek David who had offended him, let us believe that he
will be found and entreated of any that is his true servant, (the conditions
of the house of God being such, that as none are compelled to enter into it, so
it resistes none that knock at the Gates:) Where David stood not to reason
with himself that he had Sinned in this, or in that: we have to gather by him
that the matter of our Salvation consistes not so much in multiplycation of
words, as too correct our lives and increase daily in good deeds. And truly
GOD has no necessity of great Cries, to the end he may hear us, and less
need of many reasons too persuade him too understand us, since David used no
other solicitor for the removing of Gods wrath, then the imploration of a
penitent heart, Crying, Tibi tibi soli peccaui et coram te malum feci: Yea,
though men regard for the most part the exposition of the Tongue, yet with GOD
the impression of the heart stands always most acceptable, as appeared in
this conversion of David, who acknowledging simply that he had sinned without
further dispute with God, the Lord was neither scrupulous nor suspicious for
that he spoke no more but one word, but had regard to the sincerity of the
heart where with he repented. Oh omnipontent Jesus and sweet comfort of our
souls, grant that with David we may cease to sin and begin to amend our
life, and let us with S. Paul confess our sins with intention to offend no
more. And where, by our proper corruption, we are subject to daily transgression
without the aid of thy holy spirit, grant that as thy law is replenished with
mercy, so with David we may find remission, confessing with him that we have
sinned with intent to offend no more: Let us in the devotion of David
recommende to Gods mercy the faults and ignorances of our youth, for that in
that tender age we know not what we did, and were ignorant in that we ought
to do. Wherein, where David asked pardon of GOD only for the transgressions
of his youth, and not for the Sins he committed when he was old and well
experienced in the things of the world (the faults of which age are not to be
called ignorances, but malices, not simplicities but filthy enormities, not
light vanities, but heavy vices, and not faults done for want of knowledge, but
offenses committed with well aduized will and resolution.) We have reason to
think, that if his old age had been also defiled with crimes and sin, he
had likewise offered them up as a sacrifize with the confession of the abuses
of his youth: By which is well proved yt much does it import when God pardons
our sins past, without sufferance eftsoons to return and fall into them
again: For David had no sooner cried Peccaui, then GOD was ready to answer,
Lo hear J forgive thee: Whereby it is manifest that we are more slow to
confess our offenses, then God to exhibit his mercy.

And so for end of this discourse, That life and death are in the power of the
tongue, we see that as to many it has been the occasion of death, so to the
good king David it was the mean to preserve his life here through grace, and
in the other world to establishe it in eternal glory, to the which the spirit
of God bring us all. Amen.

A Letter to a great learned man aunswering to certain demaundes.
THis has been always one strange property in your friendship, that the more
I traueled to serve you, the more you studied to troble me, and that not so
much for necessity of matter as with inte^tion to exercize and prove my skill:
wherein albeit to your wit is joined a natural redines more then in many
others, yet your curiousnes brings with it this suspicion, that you have more
want of judgment then lack of time, specially desiring answer to those
demaundes whose use ought to be famyliar with all men that bear opinion of
knowledge or science. And where you Wrote too me but in sport, and for the
exercize of your memory, I will not wythstanding answer you in good earnest:
Following therein the manner of the Ancient Orators, who in causes most base and
of least importance, expressed a greatest show of their eloquence.

Demaundes and Aunswers.
How to know a good man.
WHere you ask me how one man may know an other to the end he may be either
accepted or eschewed: I answer that there be four rules to instruct you.
First, what affairs he takes in hand, what works he does, what words he
speaks, and what company he follows. For, the man that of nature is proud,
in his business negligent, in his words a liar, and calls to his companions
evil men, deserves not to be imbrased, and much less to be trusted: What
things are most precious and yet not too be bought for money.
Since, in men in whom is laid no ground of virtue, is no expectation of
faith, or honesty. You ask me which be the things that in this life can not
be bought for treasure, and much less any living thing can hold value and
comparison with them. I Answer they be these four: The liberty we have, the
science we learn, the health we enjoy, and the virtue for the which we deserve
praise. For, liberty lights the heart, knowledge enricheth the understanding,
health preserues our life, and virtue is the glory of the soul. All which are
so much the more precious, by how much they are the true figures and fore
runners of Gods grace to such as it pleases him to esteem and choose. Where
you ask me what be ye things which soonest deceive man, What things soonest
deceive man.
and by whose means he runs with more readiness into destruction. I say they be
these four: A thirst to have much, a desire to know much, an experience to
live long, an ouerweening of our own worthiness and value. All which are most
dangerous stumbling blocks to make man fall, for that too great knowledge
ends with folly, too much wealth breeds pride, in living long we grow
negligent, and in presuming of our own value, we fall into forgetfulness of
our selves. So that as every one of these in particular is sufficient to make a
man fall, so, in them all is full hability to hold him down that he never rise
again. To your demand what things are necessary to a judge, Four things
necessary too a judge.
to the end he use truth and equity, and not to be noted of tyranie. I
answer, that he ought to hear patiently, answer wisely, judge justly, and
execute mercifully: For, to that judge that is impatient in hearing, vain or
frail in his aunswers, particular in judgments, and cruel in execution, can
not worthily be ascribed the administration of justice, since the office of a
good judge is to consult with the law, with religion, with faith, with equity,
and with mercy. You ask me what be the things that make a man discreet in
his be hauiour, Four things necessary to instruct the behavior of man.
and wise in his words: whereunto I answer, to read much, to be privy to
the customs of many countries, to have endured many perplexities, and managed
great affairs: For to raise a man to the true estimation of wisdom, is too
travel many countries, to study many Laws and Doctrines, to be hable to
endure much pains, and to have experience of grave affairs. To your demand,
Four things which though we think we have, yet we have them not
what be the things that a man thinks he has when he has them not. I say
they are these four: Many friends, great wisdom, much knowledge, and great
power: For that there is no man how mighty so ever he be who is not subject to
be vanquished by an other, no man so wise in whose doings is not error, no
man's knowledge so resolute, who is not ignorant in some things, nor any man so
well beloved who has not some secret enemy. So that we have fewer friends
then we suppose, our power less then we desire, our knowledge not so much as
we presume, and all our wisdom full of imperfection. Touching your demand
to know what be the things wherein a man does the soonest undo himself,
Things wherein a man does the sonest undo himself and is most slowly
recovered.
and most slowly recover. I say they be these four: To be dilatorie in his
business, to forsake the council of a faithful friend, to meddle with things
that he ought not, and to dispende above his proportion: For, the man that is
negligent in that he takes in hand, forbeareth the advice of his wise friend,
joins himself to affairs of peril and difficulty, and dispendeth above
the measure of his revenue, such one shall easily fall and find no help to
rise again. You ask me what be the things which above all other a man would
not endure. What be the things which a man would not willingly endure.
I say they be these four: Poverty in old age, sickness in person, infamy
after honor, and banishement from his natural country: For, to be sick in
prison, too be Poor and Old, to be detected after we have borne Honor, and
to be Exiled without hope eftsoons to recover the solace of our country, be
passions so intolerable, that to the valiant mind an honest death were more
plausible, then to languish like a martyr in such a miserable life. Four
things which God abhors and are abominable to man.
And where you ask me what be the things which God abhors, and are
abominable to men. I answer, they are comprehended in these four: A poor
man to be proud, a rich man to be covetous, an old man to be lecherous, and a
young man shameless: For, where young men are impudent, old men without
modesty, pore men void of humility, and the rich sort divided from charity,
Four qualities necessary too a friend.
there can be no virtue cherished, nor good example ministered: you ask me what
ought to be ye qualities of such as men choose to their friend, and in whom they
may repose and take recreation: to such friends belong these four conditions.
To be eloquent, to be liberal, to be tractable, and to be trusty: For, where
is a sweet affability of speech, a frank liberality of that they have, a
nature easy to be induced, and a mind that brooks no corruption, there is no
doubt of honesty, and less suspicion of treason. Four things that most
trouble a man.
To your demand to know in what things a man receives most sorrow, and his
mind most troubled. I answer that it is in these four: To see ye death of
his Children, to hear of the loss of his goods, to behold the prosperity of
his enemies, and cannot reform the vanities of his friends. Nature sure cannot
minister a more torment to the heart of a man, then to bury his children he
has nourished, too loase the goods he has got together, to be subject to his
enemy, and see his friend continue in abuse and folly. Four things which
soonest disclose men's impatience.
You ask me what be the things for the which a man does most murmr, and
discloseth soonest his impacience: They be these four. To serve without
recompense, to ask and be denied, to give without thanks, and to hope for
things that come not: For that where to a benefit is offered unthankfulness,
and to a just demand is added denial, where no recompense follows due
merit of service, and where that comes not which we hope for: Oh in those
causes though the heart be driven to suffer, yet the tongue cannot use
scilence. You ask me what be the four things that rather dye then are
satisfied. And I answer, Four things seldom satisfied.
that how old so ever men be and their bodies broken with extreme trauelles,
yet you shall never see their tongue satisfied with speaking superfluous
things, their ears weary with hearing novelties, their hands cloyed with
doing wickedly, nor their heart cease to desire vanities. Four things which
men can not choose but feel and are less able to conceal.
You ask me what be the things which men cannot choose but feel, and are
less hable to conceal: They be these four, Riches, love, sorrow, and evil
will: For love is discovered by sighs, hatred appears in the eyes, riches
are expressed in the port and countenance, and dollor deelars himself by
complaint: so that where some men may for a time dissemble them, yet none can
long conceal them. Where you ask me what be the things in a man most praise
worthy and above all other to be esteemed best, Four things in a man most
praise worthy.
you shall find them comprehended in these four. That is too say, to be a
good christian, to be upright and true, to be patient, and to be secret: For,
that man that in his works shall express the duty of a good Christian, and
in injuries shall use patience and discression, in his words deliver
simplicity and truth, and have judgment to keep things secret, Who they be
that most readely get friends and as easelye loase them.
such one be bold to cloaze in your stomach, and lay up for him the reward
of an vnfamed affection. You ask me who they be that most readily get friends,
and as easily loaze them. Whereunto unto I answer that they be these four
sorts, the rich sort, young men, such as are mighty, and those that are
favored of Princes. But soon does the rich man loaze his friends when he
comes to be pore, and sooner is the young man forgotten when he falls into
age, easelie is the mighty man forsaken when his power is taken from him, and
soonest of all falls the credit of the courtier, when the Prince withdrawes his
favor. Four conditions of a servant
You ask me what ought to be the conditions of one that enters Service. To
him I appoint these four: To be diligent, to be patient, to be faithful, and
to be true: For, the servant that can suffer when he is rebuked: is just in the
office and charge committed too him: diligent to learn that he knows not,
and faithful in things committed to his trust: let the master be glad in such a
servant, and that servant not doubt of his aduau^cement. You ask me what be ye
things which women desire most, and hold themselves best contented withal:
Four desires of Women.
sure, I will forbear to discribe their particular fancies: For that their
desires are without limitte, and therefore, according to my order in the rest,
I will restrain them into these four. To be gorgiously appareled, to be
esteemed fair, to go whether they list, and that men believe what they say:
For, to a woman no less glorious are her garments, her beutie, her opinion of
credit, and her liberty, then the plumes to the Peacocke, who in other
respects is both leoathsome and unacceptable. You ask me with what
observations we ought to give when we give any thing, Four obseruatitions to
be used in giving.
whereunto I answer, that in administering liberality all men are tied to
these four respects: To consider well what we give, to know to whom we give,
to understand the cause why we give, and to have regard too the time when we
give: For, it is needful we judge and weigh the value and quantity of our
gift, lest we give less then to suffize the necessity of him to whom we give:
Too know to whom we give, lest there be no merit nor just necessity in the
person, to examine well the occasion why we give to the end that it be for
good respect, and above all who observes not the time, gives perhaps to no
fruit or commodity of him that receives. So that who gives out of these
conditions, gives not in true liberality, but as ye blind man, who weening to
power drink into his dishe powers it into the river which has no need to be
licoured. Where you ask me what be the Qualities most necessary in a Prince
helping best to mainteyne his reputation: Four necessary qualities in a Prince
helping to maintein his reputation.
I say they consist in these four. To have courage or virtue to suffer, a
heart to give, a hand to reward, and clemency to pardon. All other
imperfections ought to be suffered in a prince, if there be only found in him
clemency to forgive faltes, liberality to give dignities, a memory to add
recompense to services, and a patience to suffer traueyles and chances. Four
things which a gentleman had most need too take heed of, And whereof he is
most noted.
Where you ask me what things a Gentleman ought most to take heed of, and
where of he is the soonest noted. I send you them comprehended in these four:
In Cowardice, in Nigardnesse, in Lying, and in injustice: For, the Gentleman
that in war is a Cowarde, in his house a Nigarde, in his Country a Tyrant,
and in his words a Liar, much less that to such one is due the merit and
reputation of a Gentleman, seeing he is not worthy to communicate with the
fellowship even of the meanest estate in a common weal. And where you ask me
with what qualities a maid is to win her ronoume and estimation. I say that
it is necessary she be fair of face, honest in life, an enemy to liberty,
and a dispizer of Baudes and dissolute persons. Four qualeties incident too a
maid to win her renoume.
For that if in her Face she show not a pleasing beauty, and in her
conuesation bring forth honesty and virtue, if she be a wanderer after
Liberty, and delight to whysper and have intelligence with secret messe^gers,
her renoume shall run as a stream that never ceasseth till it fall into a
puddle that can not eftsoons be repurifyed. Thus (S^r) are your demaundes
answered, though not with such plenty of Eloquence as you looked for: yet
with that fullness of matter as may well suffize for your instruction,
specially being not drawn out of any great volumes or antiquities, but
compounded of mine own experience and common reason.

Touching the War which a man makes against himself.
Job complaining in his great affliction, confessed that he was made grievous
even to himself: Factus sum mihi met ipsi grauis.
Meaning that with better reason could he not complain against any, then
against himself, for that being contrary to himself, he heaped his proper
affliction. This sort of complaining is so much the more strange, by how much
it exceedes the common custom and experience of men in that case. For that,
how deep so ever any man be entangled with sin and crime, yea, though he
stand convict, yet will he rather labor to detect others then accuse himself.
And albeit there is nothing more common in this world then to fall, to
offend, and dwell in sin and wickedness, yet in few men is found a
disposition to pardon injuries, but in fewer is expressed a will to express
their proper error. For that to fall and err is a thing human, to repent
comes of God, but to continue in evil cannot but be of the Devil. To repent
coms of God.
Men complain of the earth for that it is unfruitful, and of the Sea, saying
it is dangerous, they mislyke the Air, because it is corrupt, they cry out
of fortune by reason of her inconstancy, they grudge against their friends when
they are found unfaithful, and cry out of the time that slips away so fast:
those men (for the most part) as they complain more by custom then upon any
cause, so albeit there is no man which in true examination is not the
instrument of his proper harm, yet we hear none complain against themselves.
But, as one not couning at Dice, blames not himself that understands not the
Game, but the Dice that run not as he would have them: So forbearing to
discende into conference and examination of our secret faltes, we murmr
against that we feel, and search not out the occasion of our torment to the
end to remove the fury of the affliction. For, if we would draw in to view and
consideration our abuses past, and weygh in one balaunce as well the faltes we
have done, as the punishments we feel, we should confess that God touches
us but with a mylde justice, and spares to visit us according to the
heaviness of our deserts. Yea, if this regard were familyar with men, who
would not forbear to murmr, and begin to make war against himself as
being the author of his own harms? But because this text of Job
complaining, That he makes war against himself, is of importance and
conteyneth mystery, we have to gather that he means not here the war of
one kingdom against an other, nor Civil war of town against town, and
much less the war of singular combat of man against man: But (says he) this
war that I make is against my self, no man assalting nor offending me: A
war sure of all others most dangerous to take in hand and of no less
difficulty to manage, for that in this war, who is victor remains
vanquished, and he that is overcome carries ye victory. This war is called
Viscerall, for that it is bred and begone in ye heart, and dissolueth and takes
end in the heart, where the Arrows be the tears we shed, the Cannon shot be
the sighs we utter, and who retyreth most to sorrow and heaviness, in this
war has most knowledge and experience. In this war fight together love and
fear, sweetness and bitterness, abstinence and epicuritie, robbery and
alms, reason and sensuality, sloth and diligence, anger and patience,
covetousness and liberality, and forgiveness and revenge: So that in this
wretched war we fight not accompanied, but alone, not in public, but in
secret, not in Camp, but in our conscience, not with the sword but with
thoughts and remorse, and not against enemies, but even against our selves:
this war is not seen with the eye, but felt alas in the heart, yea, and if we
will vaunt to be victors, we must suffer ourselves to be vanquished. In this
war have been dissolved and determined all the good and virtuous men that
have been in the world to this present, who by so much have been more
agreeable to God, by how much they were contrary to themselves. In conquering
sensuallitie, we get the victory of our salvation.
For, in the subduing or victory which is between sensuality and reason,
lies our destruction or Salvation. It is a thing worthy of wonder and
admiration, that Job having seen the spoil and havoc of his goods, heard
of the sodeine death of his Children, his body reduced to a deformity with
Botches, himself laid on a Dunghill where worms had liberty to gnaw his
flesh, his friends disdayning him, his wife vexing him: And yet he never
murmured so much against all these heavy perplexities and fortunes, as he
complained against himself, crying, Lo I am made grievous to my self: Of
this war, and against himself did the Apostle complain in these words: In
faelix homo quis me liberabit de corpore martis huius? Oh wretched and
miserable man that I am, when shall I see my self free from my self, that I
may do that I would, and not to be compelled (as I am now) to will that which
I cannot. Oh how often do I feel my self tied and fettered (says S.
Augustine) not with chains of Iron, but with the cord of mine own
sensualities: So that resolved wholly into tears, I complain not of another,
but against my self, for that, giving to the enemy my quarrel, I did against
my will. With this agrees Anselmus in his holy meditations saying: Oh
infelicitie of men, I J know not what to do nor what to say: For, being
contrary to my self; though I have liberty to complain, yet do I put no
order to my faults being made grievous even to my self. The passions of this
war were also felt of the holy man S. Barna^d: Oh sweet Lord (says he) I am
so grievous to my self, that hunger weakeneth me, eating wearieth me, cold
restrains me, heat anoyeth me, care makes me heavy, and company is
importunate to me, and that which I find most hard and intolerable, is that
nothing contents me being with my self much discontented. S. Hierom also
seemed to communicate in this agony saying, J cannot deny but that J am made
grievous to my self: Since as Satan solicites and my flesh consents, so my
sensuality desires to have honors, to get riches, to purchase favor: I would
govern all, be of great power, and esteem of no man: yea, in the matter of
commandment and authority I would be alone and singular, and wholly exempt
from travel. But so grievous am I to my self, that though I divide my self
from men because they shall not trouble me, though I fly from Satan for that
he shall not deceive me, though I renounce riches, to the end they corrupt me
not, and despise honors, for that they shall not make me proud, yet I find my
self from one day to an other to deminishe in virtue, and more to be
swallowed up in the golphes of the world. I have inferred the testimonies of
these holy personages the better to warn us sinners, that as they complained
of themselves not without reason, so, we should not repose confidence in our
selves by presumption: For, the wiseman ought not to be so suspicious of any as
of himself. We are made grievous to our selves: For that if the Prince owe us
displeasure we may forsake the Realm: A Wise man ought too be suspicious of
himself.
If the judge be against us we may challenge him and refuse him: And if our
neighbor be troublesome to us, our help is to divide us from his
neighborhood: But if we be enemies to our selves, it is impossible to fly
from our selves. We are grievous to our selves: for that in one heart, and in
one self house, we must lock up and keep love and hatred, contentment and
displeasure, prosperity and adversity, consent and denial, and hope and
despair: So that we trust our selves to much, baing of our selves deceived. We
are made grievous to our selves: since as well day as night we are vnresolute
what we ought to chuze or refuze, what we should love or hate, what we are
bound to flee or follow, what belonges to us to give or to keep, wherein we
ought to speak or to hold our peace, and whether we should suffer or revenge:
wherein in the end we find our selves unhappy in all things, saving that
even in our infelicities we are happy. We are grievous to our selves: since
all the delights of this life displease us, wearye us, and turn to our
coffeehouse: and yet being weary to live, we would in no wise die: Yea
though we abstain somtine from sin, it is not for want of will, but because
we cannot, as men that are tired and have no faculty to go further. We are
made grievous against our selves, for yt if we be sick, it coms through our
own surfeit and disorder: If we be pore, it is because we live idly: And if we
be punished by ye maiestrate, it is for that we have offended the laws. So
that in none is so just cause of complaint against any, as in man against
himself: for yt al ye travels, perplexities, and infirmities, that trauellour
frail bodies, our selves do breed them, and for the most part we go out and
search them. For, in giving liberty to our eyes to behold things vain, in
suffering our tongue to tell untruths, in yielding our ears to hear
flatteryes, and our heart to love things that we ought not: I say, if there be
in us any member that absteines from sin, it is not through any resistance
that we make, but for fear of some punishment.

Then, if it be true that we raise war against our selves, with whom shall we
have true peace? If we work our own afflictions, in whom shall we find
comfort? to whom shall we not be hurtful, if we be enemies to our selves? And
against whom may we make complaint, seeing of our selves we receive the
injuries? There is in us no hope or expectation of profit to others, when we
are hurtful instruments against our selves. Oh wretched infelicitie of man to
whom there are none so furious and raging enemies as his proper desires: who on
the one side hold him in fear, and on the other give him courage and heart.
Sure we ought to be grievous against our selves, when we remember the great
wealth we have, and the little good we do with it, when we confer our time
lost, with the evil example we have expressed: Yea, when we measure the
benefits we have received, with our ingratitude: our readiness to sin with
our slownesse to amend: the ill that we have done, with the good we might have
done: we ought (I say) in true conference and consideratien of these things,
to be ashamed to live and have great fear to die.

PLVTARKE writes to the Emperor TRAIAN being lately his Disciple and now
raised to the Empire. A Letter tending to instruct Princes newly raised to
principalities.
RIght excellent Prince: Albeit the long experience I have had of the
moderation of your will, together with what disposition you have always
affected estates and dignities: Yet I have never known you subject to those
desires which for the most part govern most me^, that is, to aspire to
kingdoms and principallities. A man to forbear to win and purchase honor, is
out of the limittes of wisdom, but not to give liberty to the heart to desire
it, is sure a virtue more divine then huntaine. For, that man does enough who
restrains the action that his hands have power to execute, and makes his
desires equal with things honest, indifferent, and reasonable: Wherein with
just cause may I say thy Empire is happy, since thou have done Acts to
deserve it, and used no corrupt industry to purchase it: For, Virtue rayseth
virtuous men.
dignities apperteining properly to virtue, virtue of her self transferreth
them, to those men to whom her self is conjoined. There have been many
Emperors, who have not been so much honored for the estates they have had, as
for the merit of their virtues by the which they have been raised unto them.
For, the honor of a man consistes not so much in the present office he has, as
in the virtues and merittes which followed his life before: So that it is to
offices that men give new honor, where to the personage belonges nothing but
pain and charge. And therefore remembering for mine own part, that I have
governed thy youth and instructed thy wit with good learning, I cannot but
rejoice as much in thy excellent virtues, as in thy supreme. Fortune, alluding
to my self no small happiness, that in my time Rome has a Lord, even he
that has been my Disciple.

Principalities of tiranie are got by force, and sustained by Arms, which as I
have always known to be far from thy nature and condition, so have thou, now
to remember yt thou ought to do nothing to bring thee into ye opinion and
suspicion of men. For, as the Empire is descended unto thee with the voice and
consent of all men, so it belonges to thee to enterteyne it with due justice
toward all sorts: Wherein, if thou be thankful to the great God,
patient in chances and fortunes, careful in dangers, mylde to thy People,
and affable to strangers, not greedy of riches, nor a lover of thy proper
desires, the burden of thy place will be easy, thy renoume perpetual, and all
commonweals and Posterities made happy by thy example. I aduize thee with
great reason, not to be a follower of thy proper desires, for that there can be
no worse government then that which is managed by Opinion only: Since he that
Administreth in a Common Weal, ought to live in Fear of all but much more of
himself, for that much more is he Subject to fail and Err following his will
and fancy, then if he Followed the Direction of his well aduized Council,
assuring thee, that too avoid Infamy too thy self, and prejudice to thy
People, thou ought first to apply Correction to thy self before thou
Minister Discipline to others. Therefore, it were good that now that thou
commaundest, thou should express thy self such one as when thou wast
commanded: For, other ways little would it serve thee by thy virtues to have
deserved the Empire, if afterward thy want of government made thee unworthy
to use it: It is more worthy too deserve honor then too possess it.
since it is more worthy to deserve honor the^ to possess it. To atteine to
honor is a work human, but to preserve it is a grace divine: And therefore
thou have to take heed, that though thou art a Sovereign Prince, yet thou
have no priueleadge to be in all things an absolute Lord: For, amongst men
there is no authority so supreme which has not God to be judge over them,
and men to be beholders of what they do. In which respect, now that thou art a
Prince, thou have a greater bond to be good, and less liberty to be evil,
then when thy estate was private: So that the authority thou have got to
command, leaves thee less liberty to offend, and no opportunity at all to
follow thy proper recreations. For if thy regiment answer not the expectation
of the people of Rome, and thy behavior be contrary to the desires and
opinion of thy old Master Plutarke, thou can not but be subject to many
dangers, and offer my aged body into the hands of my adversaries to suffer
revenge, since this is a common custom, that the faults and abuses of the
Disciple are transferred and heaped upon the head of the instructor and
Master. And therefore having been thy teacher, and thou my follower, like as
the good that thou do cannot but bring to me some honor, so also if thou do
evil, I can not but communicate in the infamy: which happened to Seneka, who
boar imputation for the cruelties of Nero, and the Philosopher Chilo for the
follies of his Disciple Leander: Who albeit were personages of such virtue as
they had the credit to fashion and govern right mighty Princes: Yet for that
they flattered their greatness with liberty and favor, when they should have
distilled into their youth doctrines and rules of direction, they left to
themselves perpetual infamy, and to many commonweals peril of subversion.
And as my pen has not spared to discribe Princes and ages past, so be thou
assured Oh Emperor, No prince but his behauiouris published.
that neither thy greatness nor my negligence shall be favored of such as are
to come: For, otherwise it will not come to pass but that such as have
interest in the fault, should be also inheritors of the Punishment. Thou
remembrest what I have taught thee in thy youth, and with what councels I have
instructed thy ryper age, neither art thou ignorant I know with what
frankenesse I have debated with thee by Letters since thou wast a Prince, and
familiarlie communicated with thee in secret: wherein I stood always upon
these observations, not to make thee acquainted with any thing which should not
be for the service of God, for the advancement of the common weal, and
furthering to thy reputation. And therefore, for any thing I have written,
spoken, or persuaded, I stand not in fear to be punished of God after my
death, nor to be reproched of men whilst I live, accompting it to belong to
the necessity of thy age, and gravity of my profession, to whisper nothing in
thine ear, which I might not have published in the open Senate. And now,
(before I adressed this Letter unto thee) examining my self, whether during the
time I had thee under my Discipline, I had done or said in thy presence any
thing which might provoke thee to ill example, I find that I never did any
thing which became not well the civility of a good Roman, nor spoke word,
which was not fully convenient with the modesty of a correct Philosopher. So
that if it please thee to make the rules and instructions of thy youth, the
compass to direct the course of thy high government and Reign, thou shall
find the needle of thy life and doings to draw directly to a renoume of
perpetual fame and felicity: Wherein I do not so much put thee in
remembrance, to the end thou should gratify me, but because thy life being
well instructed, there may follow better service and success to thy estate,
esteeming it enough for my recompense to understand that the world holds
thee a good man. Princes ought not to measure things by report but by equity
of concience
I beseech thee take this last council in good part, that albeit thou art
raised to the Empire, it is not for that thou art of the house of Rome, but
because thou have been a follower of virtue, who wills Princes, not to
measure things by common report of the People, but by justice and equity of
conscience.

The Emperor TRAIAN writes to his teacher PLVTARKE, debating that albeit a
good man may be Banished, yet he is not for that dishonored.
Before I had half read thy Letter, I had conjecture it came from thee, not so
much for ye experience I have of thy form of writting, as by the gravity of
the matter it contains, the same being the occasion that I read it often,
seeming therein to see thee write, and hear thee speak: yea I caused it to be
read at my Table, to the end thy affection might be known, and I put in
remembrance how much I owe to thee. Where thou can not believe (as thou
say) that I solicited the Kingdom, nor aspired to it by corrupt means, I
will not deny but as a man I have desired it, forbearing notwithstanding to
rise to it by broakage or corruption. For that I never knew any man purchase
honor by brybes, to whom the mean of such honor was not the cause of some
notable infamy, as is truly veryfied in ye example of the good old man
Menander, who, for that he practiced the consulship by money, was past into
Exile, and so (by the due justice of the highest) lost his honor, his goods,
and life. It was a doctrine read in thy University, that more ought men to
labor to deserve honor, then to be bold to procure it, That is unlawful which
is got by unlawful means.
esteeming that unlawful which is gotten by unlawful means. He that is
without credit ought to labor to win it: And who is in infamy let him study
to be made worthy of honor: But the man of virtue has never no want of
nobility, and much less can his honor be taken from him: since honor is
joined to virtue as the brier is to the rease, and though all other things be
of fortune, yet true Nobility dependes of virtue, as the house upon his
foundation. Many men have refuzed offices, and yet much less that they lived
in less love and estimation, seeing the disclayming of dignities brought to
them more honor then al ye victories they won in the wars, for that the
success of Conquestes follow for the most part the judgment of fortune, but
the denial of office and charge lies only in the wisdom of man. I assure
thee when the enseigne of the Empire was presented to me, I was no less
ignorant of the chance then out of hope of the dignity, knowing that it was
solicited by others with no mean practice and corruptions. But seeing it is
the providence of the great God to make me his minister being called with the
consent and will of all men, and that I have assurance in thy advice and
council, I doubt not but God will communicate with me in the government, and
restrain fortune for giving me any such sodeine mutation as may change the
courage and constancy of my mind: Assuring thee yt I acknowledge me to have
been thy Disciple, even with the same joy where with thou say thou have
taught me, and now see me Emperor. Wherein seeing you wilt not from henceforth
but call me Lord, I will never speak of thee by other name then Father: And
albeit I have been sought to, and councelled of many since my election to the
kingdom, yet amongst all, I reserve my self to be familiar only with thee,
considering that in such as sue to give me council, is an intention to draw my
will to theirs, where I know thou will not aduize me but for my profit and
commodity of my honor. Often times I have heard thee say, Such as give
council to princes should be free from passions.
that in such as give Council to Princes should be liberty and freedom from
all passions and affections. For that in the action of Council giving, where
the will is most inclined, there the spirit and wit have most strength. That
a Prince in all things do his will, I do not allow, and that he take
Council of every one, is less seemly: Therefore as to the affairs of a
kingdom cannot but be a great necessity of advice, so let the Prince make
this choice of his Counselors, What councelors Princes ought to choose.
rather to be Councelled by those of whom he is loved, then by such as himself
loves. For, in the affection of the Counceller to his Prince is great
security and care of the common business, where from such as be followers of
the Prince, can grow no great matter of providence for the public safety as
being men all together dedicated to the complexion and humors of the Prince.
Wherein having had long experience of thy deep insight in matters of policy,
and no less expectation that thou will use no less care to direct me now
being a Prince, then thou tookest pains to instruct me when I followed thee as
thy Disciple: I will that from henceforth to thee belong the chief charge to
give me Council in my most weighty affairs, and to aduertize me of the
imperfections and faults that from time to time appear in me. For, as Rome
holds me for the protector of their common weal, so I reserve thee to be the
beholder and examiner of me life. And if at any time thou find me froward
to be warned by thee in things necessary for my reformation: I pray thee
conster it not to any displeasure toward thee: Since, in such case, my
passion shall not be for the warnings thou geeuest me, but for the Shame that
I have Erred. And as to have been norished in thy house, to have heard thy
Lectures, to have imitated thy doctrines, and to have lived under thy
Discipline, have been (sure) principal means to prefer me to the Empire: So,
it cannot but be ascribed too great inhumanitie to thee, if thou forbear to
help me to manage and guide that which thou have procured me to win and get,
esteeming it I assure thee, to my great felicity to have familaritie with such
one as you whose wisdom makes thee worthy to be a judge of my Councelles, and
in thy faith I may be bold to repoze the Controlement of my life.

Lastly, where thou aduizest me to continue such one as I was before, with
condition not to decline, I believe thou drawest this warning from the example
of Nero, whose government being well ordered for the first five years of his
Reign, he grew afterward to increase more in wickedness then in dignity.
But rather then thou shall find me successor to the impude^cies and vileness
of Nero, I pray thee pray to God to give me no suffera^ce to reign in Rome,
since that Tyrants procure dignities to exercize Cruelty, and good men aspire
to kingdoms to the end to maintain virtue. By the misery of unfortunate men
others are warned to take heed.
And therefore to such as were good before, and are corrupt by the place, there
is more cause of pytie then malice: For that if fortune raise them, it is not
to honor them, but to make them fall. And to wisemen the misery of unfortunate
men is an example to warn others to keep a mean in their happy estate.

The Emperor TRAIAN writing to the SENATE of Rome, discloseth the trauelles of
Princes in their Gouernementes.
IT is not unknown to us that death has called from you your dear Lord the
Emperor and my late predecessor, whom if you Lament as in the loss of a just
Prince, I have no less reason of sorrow for the want of a Father so grave and
pitiful. When Children loaze a good Father, and a whole comunaltie a just and
virtuous prince, there can be no sorrow more intolerable, or that worldly men
cannot suffer losses of more heavy importance: Princes to commonweals are
the same that God is too sinners.
(since good Princes are the same to commonweals, that God is to sinners,
who, though we forget to love and obey him, yet he forbeares not to protect and
provide for us. The death of a good man deserves to be sorrowed of all, but the
loss of a just Prince ought to be extremely and bitterly lamented: for that
when a private man dies, there is lost but one, but when a good Prince is
taken away there dies with him the felicity of a whole kingdom: So that if
GOD would suffer us to sell the lives of good Princes already dead, the price
sure would be to base to buy them again with tears, since, even with the most
precious Gold and silver can not be weighed down the price and Ransom of a
virtuous man. If Treasure would have redeemed the life of Hector, the Troyans
would have furnished it in great abundance: or if money might eftsoons have
breathed life into Haniball, there would have been found no want in the
Carthaginiens. But God, God has authority too dispose all things by the same
power where with he created them of nothing.
having made all mortal things, has authority to dispoze of them even by
the same power wherewith he has Created them of nothing, reserving only to
himself Immortality. How reverent is the virtue of good men, and with what
prerogatives they are endued, appears easelie in this, that men bear more
honor to the Sepulchers of the virtuous, then to the emboasted Palaices of the
wicked. The good and virtuous man, though he be far absent and out of use
and knowledge, yet men love him, serve him, and answer for him, where, to the
wicked is given no credit in that he says, and much less are we thankful to
him in that he does for us. For, to the evil man is appointed this property
of justice, Due justice for a wicked man.
to be doubted most where he would faynest have credit, and not to be believed
though he speak the truth. Touching my election to the Empire, as it was left
by my predecessor, demanded of the People, and approved by you, so I doubt not
but my government will be so much the more plausible and profitable to Rome, by
how much in my adoption were fulfilled all things agreeable to God. And as it
serves to little for men to choose Princes, if they be not confirmed by God. So,
there be certain signs to discern such as are called by God from others
chosen by men. For, that which men by sodeine Council aduaunceth, God by due
justice bringes down: where those things which the mighty God planteth,
albeit they stand open to all winds and receive many adversities, yet they
never fall, yea, though they incline and bend, there is no power to remove
them. You know that albeit I was Nephewe to your predecessor, yet I never
solicited him for the kingdom, and much less occupied my thoughts to hope
for it, having learned of my Master Plutarke, that honor ought rather to be
deserved then purchased. And as I will not deny but that a kingdom is a
sweet pray, and that the present of so high and excellent a dignity was
welcome to me with inward gladness: So also I can not but confess that I find
great difference between the trauelles of a Kingdom, and the security of a
private life: yea, after I had tasted of what bitter cares this sweet pray is
compounded, I was sorry my weakness was so soon enticed, though it be too
late to repent. For, of such quality is Imperie and government, that if there
be great honor to have it, Princes subict to many perplexities.
there is no less pain and travel to weelde it. Oh to how many perplexities
stands he Subject, who byndes himself to govern others: For that, if he be
just, they will call him cruel: if he be pytifull, they will dispize him: if
he be liberal, they will hold him prodigal: if he be a husband of that he
has, they will say he is covetous: If he be peaceable, they will esteem him a
cowarde: if he be courageous, they will impute it to quarrelling: if he be
grave, they will note him proud: if he be affable, they will ascribe it
lightness and simplicity: if he be solitary they will judge him an Ipocrite:
and if he be merry they will say he is dissolute. So that men most commonly will
use more respect toward all others, then toward him that governs the
whole. For, to the Prince they account the morcelles that he eats, they
measure his pases, they epsy his words, they observe what company he keeps,
they judge his works, they are Jealous over his Looks and Iestures: Yea, they
examine and murmr at his Pastimes, and make conjecture even of his secret
thoughts: Who then weygheth with the trauelles that breed in principality,
the Ielousies that stand as espialles over such as govern: will confess (I
doubt not) that as there is no estate more sure then that that is divided from
Empire and rule. So, government being none other thing then the Foarge of
envy, the best cure and remedy is to forbear to be absolute, and live
contented with us estate private: For, if a man can not but with great pain
govern a Wife whom he has chozen: train up his Children whom he has
begotten: and instruct his servant whom he has hyered having them all in his
house. Far greater pain shall he find to enterteyne in one peace and unity
a whole common weal divided in to strange dispositions. Sure the life of
Princes deserve great compassion, for that in few can they repose or trust,
seeing often times they are most detected by those whom they most favor: they
can not eat without watching, sleep without guard, speak without Jealousy,
Perplexities of Princes.
nor go without espiall, so that being Lords over all, yet they are Prisoners
even to their proper vassals: Yea, if we consider the servitude of Princes, and
the liberty of subjects, we shall find that in whom the kingdom has most
action, even against him servitude has most power, so that though princes have
authority to give liberty to others, yet their place will not suffer them to
minister it to themselves: God having Created us free, we do so delight to
have our liberty free, that how near so ever a man tough us either in
friendship, kindred, or blood, yet we had rather he were our vassal, then our
Lord: For that, as liberty is as dear to us as blood and life: All servitude
is miserable.
so all servitude is miserable according to the desire of Caesar who, in
respect his Soldiers were made free, wished himself despised and worth
nothing: We esteem our selves so much, and follow our desires with such
partial affection, that as we shall never see any man who of his proper will,
will be made bound, so, we have not read of any yt against his will was made
Lord. For, the heart without liberty takes pleasure in nothing, as well
appears in the controversies of men, whose war we see are not so much for
the quarrel of obedience, as to establishe their authority to command: In
Eating, in Drinking, in Speaking, in Garments, in Iestures, and in all other
actions and affections men be different, saving in the desire of liberty
wherein they are all conformable. All this I have written upon ye occasion of
mine Empire, which being so universally offered, I have thankefully accepted,
though many times I find weariness in so great a burden: For, a large Sea,
and a great kingdom are two things pleasant to behold, and most perilous to
prove: Notwithstanding, since by the will of God I am appointed your Lord, and
by your proper consentes you are made my vassalles: I require to be obeyed as
Lord in things that are just, and pray you as Fathers to advertise me when I
do things unreasonable: Assuring you that if you fulfill the office of good
Counselors, you shall find in me that ready conformity, that belonges to
the action of the common weal. On whose behalf I recommend unto you the
providence of the common treasure, as well to consider by what means it is got,
with what sewertie it is kept, as also to what uses it is transferred and
employed: for the goods of the common weal are not committed to your
confidence to the end to enjoy them, but because you might govern them.

And albeit the Wars of Germany being like yet to be prolonged, for that the
king of Dacia continues in his revolt from the obedience of Rome, I shall be
yet driven to follow the occasion of the wars: yet in this absence I cannot be
unmindful of the affairs of the state, as holding it less evil for a Prince
to be negligent in the proceedings of war, then careless of the business
concerning ye government of the common weal: for, a good Prince ought to
think, yt he is not chosen so much to follow ye wars, as to govern ciuily: The
respect of a Prince in his election
not so much to kill his enemies abroad, as to suppla^t vices at hom: not so
much to follow foreign affairs, as to keep resort and residence amongst his
subjects: not to take ye goods of others, but to do justice to every one: not
to pardon the rich, in respect of his wealth, not to deny justice to the pore
for his poverty: not to give rewards all together for affection, nor to
minister chastisement by passion only: and not to deny justice to him that
demaundes it: nor show mercy but where it is deserved: Since whylest a Prince
in the Wars cannot Fight but for one and in his own person, in the Common
weal his absence geues liberty to many insolences done too many innocents:
Sure it is a just reward of virtue, that of Captains men come to be
Emperors: But there is no conueniencie that Emperors descend to be captains,
for that in that realm is seldom stabilitie of peace and quiet, whose Prince
is to much inclined to wars and enterprises: By these I pray you believe that if
the wars of Jermaine had not begone whilst I was in these parts, I had not
made my self a party to them, having alwais this principal purpose to be
reputed rather a civil governor then a follower of Arms. I recomend to you
chiefly the honor of GOD, and establishement of the Church. For that, that king
can not live in sewertie, who prouides not to have God honored and the
ministry maintained: That king can not Reign in surety who prouides not too
have god served
Let Princes fear God, enterteine justice, reverence the ministers of the
Church, and defend the poor. So shall they be perfect men, and pleasing to
God who for recompense, will not suffer them to be forgotten of their friends,
nor vanquished of their enemies. I wish you also to communicate together in
one friendship and fraternity: For that, in commonweals greater are the
harms that rise by civil factions of one neighbor against an other, then by
the fury of foreign and public enemies: I wish you to cut of all
occasions of quarrelles, to be cherishers of the poor, preseruers of the
Fatherless, and protectors of ye Wydows: For that, Virtue consists more in
works then in words.
to none is God wont to minister more sharp justice then to such as restrain
compassion to the pore, and suffer the innocent to receive oppression. And,
because virtue consistes more in works, then in words: I exhort you to use
modesty in speech: to be patient to suffer: and provident in your form of
living. For, it cannot but bring great falt and shame to a governor, to give
praises to the people of his common weal, and in himself bear just occasion
of reprehension: And therefore to such as manage estates and gouernementes, it
apperteynes to have more confidence in their works then in their words: For
that the common People is more inclined to judge of that which they see, then
to believe things which they hear. In affairs concerning the Senate, I would
not have any of you noted of Ambicion, Malice Fraud, nor Envy: For that, to
men of honor, truth and virtue, it is unseemly to contend more for the
Souereigntie and commandment of a common weal, then for the advancement and
profit of it. The Empire of the Greeks, has been always contrary to the
government of the Romans as well in Arms and Laws, as in opinions: For, the
Grecians had a singular felicity in eloquent speaking, and to us has belonged
the property of well working: By this I exhort you being assembled in the
Senate yt you bestow not more time to dispute and arguing of controversies,
then necessarily apperteines to the true search and decision of the same:
Since, if you will not entangle your judgments with passion and affections,
you shall (without long argument) be easelie led to reason and conclusion. In
this respect, many wise men have thought it more expedient that kings and
Emperors should suffer themselves to be governed by men learned, then to be
learned themselves: Forbidding them thereby to leave to their proper opinions,
of the which for the most part they ought to be suspicious. Let your judges
and such as sit in office to solicit the affairs of the common weal, be
wise men, skillful in laws, expert in customs, discreet in things they have
to judge, and circumspect in their conversation and form of life. For, in
instruction of life and manners, more good does the judge with his good example,
then with his severe punishment: and to the well government of a common
weal, more conducible and necessary is the wise man, then he that is too well
learned. Therefore in causes of justice and judgment, have regard to minister
the Laws in Civil processes, and in matters criminal it is good to moderate
their rigor: For that in the Creation of severe and cruel Laws, the chief
purpose was rather to keep men in terror, then to have the Laws committed to
extreme action: So that before the publication of your sentence, you ought to
consider the age of the offender, the time, the manner, the occasion, the
confederacy, and the value of the offense, in all which circumstances may be
helps, though not to acquit the trespass, yet to qualifye the rigor of the
law: in the administration and office whereof we, ought to deal in the same
rate and measure of mercy toward offenders, which God uses with sinners, on
whom he exercises compassion above their deserts, and punishes them under
the merit of their transgressions. And as in criminal offenses Judges ought
to think that God is more offended then men: So, if it please him to remitte
faults done against his maiestitie, it is a good example to warn us not to
execute the Laws extremely against those that offend others and not us.
Lastly, I wish you (in cases of quarrel and wrong) that if your enemies do
you any injury, you will forbear present revenge: For that, to pardon many
for the offense of one, holds of the office of Christianity, but to chastise
many for the falt of one, apperteynes properly to Tirantes. It is better some
time to dissemble an injury then to revenge it.
Yea, though in man's nature the dispight of an injury increases ye desire of
revenge: yet, there be wrongs wherein often times men find more sewertie to
dissemble them then to revenge them.

The SENATE of Rome writes to TRAIAN their Emperor, partly to answer to
some particulers of his former Letters: and withal expressing Documentes
necessary to the instruction of a Prince.
RIght Sovereign and worthy Emperor, Such was the compassion and regard of
thy late Uncle and predecessor Nervus toward thee, that in the very Article
and extreme approach of death, he made no sorrow for that his children were
dead which might have inherited his possessions: but gave thanks to God for
leaving thee to succeed him in the Empire. So that albeit too the good
Emperor were successors other then thou, both more dear in friendship, more
bound in service, and better experienced in policy and Wars: Yet he
vouchsafed to fix his eye upon thee only, as in whom he had most opinion and
confidence that thou would eftsoons revive the virtues and valor of the
good. Augustus, and root out the insolences and Tirannies of Domitian. When
thy Uncle took Possession of the Empire, he found the Treasure dispersed, the
Senate in faction, the People in Mutiny, justice ill observed, and the common
weal in general ruin: but thou shall come to great plenty of Riches, the
Council void of discention, the multitude ignorant in commotions, the judges
without corruption, and the whole state peacible, reformed, and flourishing:
beseeching thee, with the maistie of so large an Empire, to succeed also thy
Uncle in custom and constitutions, seeing that new Princes under cooller to
innouate new laws, do for the most part commit their commonweals to
perdition. Like as the Fourteen Princes that have managed the Empire next
before thee, were al naturally of Rome, and thou the first Stranger adopted to
the kingdom: Even so we beseech the immortal God that as in thine uncle, our
ancient Caesar's have taken end, so also with thee may be brought good Fortune
to Rome, wherein we hope so much the more, by how much thy virtues more then
thy policy, made thee worthy of the Empire. Where virtue does raise to
honor, there GOD fails not to establish the dignity.
For that where virtue is the mean to procure honor, there God never fayles to
establishe the place, and takes from fortune al power to minister adversities
to it.

Where by thy Letter thou geuest us instructions what to do, we are bold also
to advertise thee what thou ought to fore see. And seeing thou teach us
how to obey thee, it is good equity and justice that we know the things
wherein thou will command us: For that, (by the occasion of the wars) having
been long disaquainted with the manners of Rome, and not knowing to what Laws
and Customs we are sworn: thou may perhaps decree things to our damage
and thine own dishonor, Wherein, (according to thy wisdom) we hope thou will
not hold it unreasonable to be advertised: For that Princes oftentimes are
negligent in many things, not so much for that they have no desire to foresee,
as because there are none that dare warn them. And therefore we beseech thee
turn not that to presumption which we present to thee of just duty and
office, assuring thee that the affections of Subjects are more drawn by a
gracious industry, then by compulsion or force.

We beseech thee, that all those commandments which thou sendest from the
Camp, with all such other orders as we establishe here, may be severely and
firmly kept, since the benefit of Laws consistes not to erect and ordeine,
There is no benefit by laws if they be not executed.
but in the due and just excution of them.

Thou must not forget to have patience to suffer such as are importunate, and
dissemble with offenders: seeing it is a property duly anexed to a good
Prince, to punish the injuries of the common weal, and pardon the insolences
done against himself. And as it belonges to a good Prince to have more regard
to the benefit of his Country, then to the delights of his person: So, where
thou writest that thou will not see Rome til thou have given end to the wars
of Germany, we cannot but hold it a determination of a noble and valiant
Emperor: For that such good Princes as thou art ought not to seek out places
for their recreation, but follow exercises to increase their reputation. Thou
recommendest to us the veneration of the Temples and Service of God: we
beseech thee let that be an office just and equal to thee also: since, our
service to God can be a Sacrifice but of small importance, if with all thou
make it not perfect with the offer of the humility, obedience, and consent
of thy heart. According to thy Council, that we hold friendship and community
one with an other, we find it a charge of very hard action, if in thee be not
also accomplished an equal and general affection to us all: For that, by the
parcialitie of Princes embrasing some more then the rest, are oftentimes raised
factions and murmures amongst the People. Touching the relief of the pore and
protection of wydowes, we can not fully perform our devotion that way,
unless thou command such as levy thy Tributes to forbear to molest them
when they gather thy rightes: For; greater is the sin to pill and oppress
the pore, then the merit to succor and aid them. Thou warnest us that we be
not tedious in the Senate, nor affectioned to our proper opinions: Which, being
a Council of great gravity, is also accepted in duty and good meaning,
desiring thy wisdom to consider withal, that in businesses of great
difficulty, the more serioussy matters are debated, the more truly are they
resolved, and their inconveniences avoided.

If (according to the advertisement of thy Letter) thou will have thy judges
honest in life and just in their office, thou must take heed that in such as
thou chusest, there be no occasion or necessity of reprehension. Touching thy
advice, that we restrain our Children to such education, that they bring no
slander to the common weal: It behoues thee specially to let them be called
from time to time to the necessity and service of the wars: For that, as
there is nothing that brings so easy and sweet a subjection to vice as the
season and idleness of peace: So, there is no better mean to purge a common
weal of loytring and unprofitable people, then to have wars with Foreign
enemies. We will not repeat thy other aduertisementes, but study to keep them,
esteeming them rather Laws of a divine spirit, then Councelles of a mortal
man.

Of the great reverence given in times past to ancient men, with certain
privileges appertaining to old age.
LIcurgus, and almost all the other Law readers of ye world, albeit in many
things they were different, yet they had full concord and agreement in these
three. To honor God, to owe compassion to the poor, and to bear a reverence
to old men. It seems that these customs have had from the beginning an
assured consent and affinity with nature, for that there has been no nation
of such barbarous rudenes, nor any people so intractable, which have forbidden
the service of their Gods, restrained succors to the poor, or withholden
reverence from old age: For that they be things so reasonable and just, that
according to natural right and equity, there is no necessity of laws to
ordain them, nor authority of Kings to command them. Eschinus the
Philosopher in an oration he made to the Rhodiens, commended the government of
the Ilandmen in that their policy suffered but these seven Laws, to worship
their gods, to be pitiful to the poor, to bear honor to the ancients, to
obey their Princes, to resist tirants, to execute thieves and robbers, and to
suffer no man to wander out of his proper country. And Aulus Gellius reading
statutes to the most ancient Romans, will not have so much honor borne to
the most richmen and chief of the senate, as to old men reteyning always one
constant and settled grauetie. In these testimonies is good experience and
proof that to ye old men in ages past were borne such honorable respects, that
as Gods they were reverenced, and holden in the place and reputation of
fathers, according to ye Law which ye Romans took of the Lacedemoniens, that
to ancient me^ only and to no others should be committed ye charge of justice,
and administration of ye common weal: but speaking in ye opinion of a
christian, albeit to al old age is due a reverence in respect of their
maioritie, yet in such is it most worthily invested in whose grauetie is
expressed good example to others, and whose virtue brings honor to their
years, in who^ it is a just duty to be divided from vain fancies and cares,
and reduce their deliberations to commendable actions: For that, as the most
part of our time passes away in thinking from one day to another to give
reformation to our life, so, let us be warned, It is too late to learn to live
when we are at point to die.
that the wings of old age being plumed with the feathers of death, we shall
find it too late to learn to live when we are at point to die: And therefore
all men ought to examine in themselves how many dear seasons they have past,
what perils they have escaped, how many friends they have lost, and from what
perplexities they have been delivered, acco^pting it not to their own merit yt
god has taken the^ out of so many dangers, but to ye end they should have
further time to amend their life. A man to live sound and without diseases, the
regiment of physic with our own good government, are much helping: but the
stroke of death whether it come early or late, that depends more on the power
and hand of God, then on the will or disposition of men. Therefore let all men
be moderate in their exercise, and use temperance in their universal actions,
making more estimation of their wisdom, then of their old age: since
otherwise, if they forget not to reckon their years, others will not forbear
to keep account of their vices. Many learned men have proved by many reasons,
that old age is profitable, and that the life of ancient men is good: But God
give them better quiet and tranquillity, then that their opinions have any
society with either experience or reason. For, now a days where is the
retraite of infirmities, but in an aged body? or in what co^sistes the misery
of man's life, but in the passions of age? whereunto is appointed no other cure
but sufferance in pain, and grief without hope: Old age a sickness incurable.
old age being none other thing then a disease without remedy, and a sickness
incurable.

But coming now to exhibit some privileges and liberties which old men enjoy,
I mean not to meddle with the complexions and qualities of those whose wisdom
agrees with their age, and their years conformable to their grave discretion:
and much less to give liberty to my pen to contest against any of those
grave, honorable, and virtuous ancients, by whose direction commonweals have
been governed, and in their wisdom young men have found surety of counsel:
But to set down some customs of old men that be wanderers, waspish, bablers,
scoffers, players, dissemblers, and such as are lead by amarous humors,
together with what familiar manners their sorrowful old age is accompanied, I
hold it neither against reason nor honesty.

It is a custom to old men to have a short sight, their eyes yielding double
judgment comprehending two things for one, and oftentimes to have clouds in
their eyes when there is none in the sky, by means whereof for the most part
they misknow their friend and take him for an other. It is a custom to old men
to be thick of hearing, by means whereof, such things as they hear and do
not well understand, they think, is either spoken to the prejudice of their
honor, or detriment of their goods. It is familiar with old men to have their
hairs fall without combing, wrinckles growing and no seed sown, and their
head fuming without any fire made, for remedy whereof when they would take the
bathe, it is forbidden them by reason of their weakness. Old men have this
privilege to eat bread without crust for the ease of their teeth, to have their
meat minsed for the help of disgestion, to have their drink warmed for the
comfort of their stomach, and in case of infirmities in their legs, they
have their oils to supple them, their rollers to wrap them, their hoaze at
liberty and their buskins buckled: and if any grudge at this bravery, they
have to answer, that it is done more for the ease of the disease that
troubles them, then for any glory they reappose in such attire. It is a
custom with old men, to enquire after the disposition of the wether, wherein
they have great sense and judgment by the motion of their infirmities, whose
humors following the revolution of the Moon, and change and distemper of the
air, bring the poor old man to be half a physician, and to have a painful
science in Astronomy. It is a custom with old men to complain much of the
travels of the day, and to keep reckoning of the hours of the night, that
their dinner is not resolved into disgestion, and their supper would not suffer
them to sleep: and yet, it is no sooner day then they begin to murmr that
their breakfast is not ready. It is a privilege to old men to search company,
and either in temple, tavern, or shoppes they enterteyne all that come,
enquiring of the news of the world: and whatsoever they hear, be it true or
false, they will not only believe it for true, but ad to it somewhat of their
own: it is familiar to old men to be suspicious, distrustful, obstinate,
intractable, and subject to self opinion: by means whereof they lack reason,
and live in error, and though they are not abused, yet they will be jealous of
their own shadow: yea such men have rather want of any other thing, then of
suspicion: It is a custom with old men, once a month to be locked up in their
closet and count their treasure, dividing their coins, and searching the
locks of their chestes: such men will not deminish one denir of that that is
heaped up, but love to live poorly to the end they may die rich. To some old
men it is a custom to have familiarity with physicians and friendship with
Potticaries: but some delight more to haunt tauernes where is vent of good wine,
then in the conference of learned men by whom is ministered whole some regiments
of health: it belongs much to old men to be fickle in all things but specially
to be inconstant against ye time, commending much the ages past, and
complaining more of the season present: which for the most part they do more of
custom then by any reason, and rather by authority, then for necessity: It
is due to old men to wrap and cherish themselves, to have their chamber hanged,
their fire ordinary, their bed warmed, and yet for the most part, they spend
the nights in coughing, and the days in complaints, making their bed a place
to debate the actions of their youth past, and to feel the infirmities and
weakness of their present age: the memory of which things makes them
oftentimes so ill contented that they are careless to provide for death which
they see even before their eyes. And it is one common property with old men to
be angry with such as enquire of their age, and most familiar with those that
will tell of the pleasures they have past. So that, they would be honored by
reason of their age, and yet they are grieved when they hear a reckoning of
their years, and so old men delight in authorttie, and yet wish their age might
be co^cealed.

To a noble personage touching the difference between the friendship of men,
and love of God.
THe great Philosopher Eschinus, in a famous inuectiue against his mortal
enemy Demosthenes uses these words: it belongs to the Demosthenes
according to the estimation which thou make of thy wisdom, to be resolute
in thy enterprises, true in thy promises, well advised in thy counsels, and
righteous in all that thou do: all which fall out contrary in thy behavior
and actions, for that oftentimes thou art seen to do things which thou
ought not, and no less often art heard to speak that which thou think
not. These words spoken by the Philosopher to the reproach of his enemy,
deserve to be applied to all men, for that there are none that can worthily
challenge the true merit and imputation of wisemen, if they express not as
great modesty in their speech, as equity in their works: it is a just thing
that every one take heed to that he does, and be well advised in what he
says, since amongst noble minds more easily is satisfied an actual wrong
done against their persons, then an injurious word uttered to the prejudice of
their honor, always esteming that the blow of a sword hurtes but the flesh,
but a word suggested to infamy offends the reputation. This I say (sir)
upon the occasion of your letter charging me eftsoon to repeat my late
discourse uttered in the presence of the Emperor upon this theme, that it is
very hurtful to have Christ to our enemy, and a thing no less dangerous to
have man our friend: If, in your opinion I speak any thing which was not well
studied and considered upon, you do wrong to the grauetie of my profession,
since it is my custom, never to pronounce words of such divine and high
subject, but even with the same attention and devotion wherewith I would
confess my self to God, accompting it withal to too great a fault to publish
any thing which might breed scrupull in your Lordship, or murmr in so
excellent an auditorie.

But now to our purpose, wherein I confirm eftsoon, that if it be evil to
have the creator to our enemy, it can not be less dangerous to have to our
friend the creature. And if there be no necessity to employ the Physician and
our friend but in times dangerous and doutfull, it can not but be to men a
most assured counsel rather to eschew perils, then to entreat friends: since
friends being of the world, their friendship has also his corruption of the
world, in whom is more confusion then continuance of things. I do not say it
is evil to have friends, but that it is dangerous and painful: for that the
mighty thy friend is of estate, It is dau^geours too have great friends.
by so much is thy danger the greater to prove him, and thy care no less to
observe and keep him, seeing specially great friendship is not known but in
extreme necessity. Many and many are there now a days who would abstain from
many heinous and hurtful faults, if they had not confidence in the favor and
reskew of their friends, which being a branch of impunitie, can not but bring
peril to a common weal where the due course and sincerity of justice is
stopped by the corruption of particular favor. This is one manner of election
of friends amongst men, that meeting by chance, or co^moning together, or
eating at one table, they suppose from the instant a perpetual friendship to
be established between them, which in good certainty and truth can not be so,
for that in times of necessity and trial, there is no more proof or effect of
such friends, the^ between the Crow and the Kyte, of whom when it happens to
the one to be bare of feathers, the other answers that to him is no more then
suffices him to fly. That which one friend does for an other in these times,
is, either to excuse or conseale himself when there is need of him, being
more ready to lend him his conscience, then his money, that is either to go
with him to the revenge of an enemy, or to perform some exployt of vice, or
at least to serve his turn with some false testimony. Which sort of friends,
as they are most common and least rare, so let all men esteem it no small
felicity to be divided from them, seeing they are more prodigal of their
conscience then liberal of their goods. Who waigheth with the number of
friends that are professed to hint, how many have ministered the true office and
quality of friends to give succors to his necessities, for one that he has
found faithful, I doubt not but he shall be hable to disclose an hundredth
dessemblers: In which respect, I said not without great reason, that it was
great peril to a man not to be consociate with a friend honest, firm, and
virtuous, since, for no greaten cause then the action of a common reverence and
ciuilytie, they are ready to require our goodds to loan, command the use
and service of our house, and not stick to bring our conscience in doubt,
(occasions that many times move men to disclaim neighbourhoodes and
frendships which they had begone in great good will and devotion. But right
blessed and holy is the frendshippe of Jesus Christ, wherein can be no scrupull
nor danger. For that, in recompense of the affection he bears us, he neither
demaundes our goods, nor trobleth our conscience: his friendship is always
assured, for that it is well established: it is certain, since he never forgets
us: it is not feigned, since it correctes our conscience: it is just for that it
suffers nothing unreasonable: it is righteous since in it he does
communicate to us his grace, and it is most rich and plentiful as by whose
mean he geues us his glory. So that he only may and ought to be called a
friend holy, a friend just, faithful, profitable, and perpetual: For that the
friends that he takes, he looks not if they rich, and much less esteems it
to dishonor if they be pore, he chooses for his friend whom he lyketh and after
he have once called him, he never forbeareth to love and like him: He looks
not whether he be mighty or impotent, fair or deformed, or whether his
condition be free or bond: No, he makes not so great reckoning of the services
we do him, as of the love which we bear to him: Jn charitate perpetua
delexite: The love, says Jesus Christ by his Prophet, where with Christ
loves us, is not feyned nor transitory, but reteyneth always one perpetual
and settled stability, as appears most truly in this, yt by the mean of his
grace we are made agreeable to him, before we are able to do any thing to
deserve to be his friends: Such is the perpetual perfection of his charity,
that the love that he bears us being his own, the profit that comes of it
apperteyns to us, pretending no other thing in the love which he bears to all
Creatures then to make seen his sovereign bounty employed on our behalfes in
most high and worthy Charity: the same being well expressed in the day of
his Passion, when neither the torments of his body, nor the wickedness of
his People, could restrain the course of his great love wherewith he Prayed
for such as Crucified him, and pardone those that offended him: Yea, he prayed
not only for his Apostles and Disciples, but also for all the faithful that
believed in him and loved his Father, with whom as he was one self thing in
Divinity, so he prayed to his Father, that all such as believed might be in
him one body mystical through Charity. Great was the love of Jesus Christ in
the words of his petition to his Father, seeing that albeit we were not then
borne, no nor our far ancient Fathers: yet he besought his Father in great
feruencie for the estate of all his Church even no less then for those that
did communicate with him in the Supper. So that as he dyed for all, so he
prayed for all: By which we have good reason to believe, that seeing be
remembered us before we came into the world, he will also keep care over such as
are employed in his service. If Christ had not loved us with that Charity, and
prayed for us in such feruencie of zeal, what had become of us: Sure, if there
be in the Church of God at this present any obedience, patience, charity,
humility, or any abstinence or continency, it ought all to be atributed to
that love which Christ expressed in the prayer that he commended to his Father
for us, Redeeming with his blood our disfavor, and with his prayer he restored
us eftsoons to an estate of Grace and reconcilement. To love those that are
present, and such as are absent, to bear affection to the Quick, and remember
such as are Dead happens often and is natural, but to love such as are to
come and not yet borne, is a zeal that never was heard of but in the person
of our Redeemer, who prays for such as live wickedly, and loves good men
although they are not yet borne: In worldly things, so straight is the
copulation and unity between life and death, love and hate, him that does
affect, and the thing affected, that al takes end together and in one hour:
But to the friendship that Jesus Christ bears us, belonges an other qualetie,
for that his love took beginning before the foundation of the world, and will
not end, no not at the day of judgment.

In this Letter is debated the difference between a servant and a friend.
FInding in your last Letter more matter worthy of rebuke, then meet to be
answered, I am bold to give you this Council, that in causes of importance,
the Pen is not to be used before the matter be well debated, lest others take
occasion to judge of your domges, and your self be denied of that you
demand: This is also to be observed in speaking to any personage of estate,
with whom we ought not to Communicate but with fear, reverence, and modesty.

By your Letter you wish me to be your Master, and withal would choose me to
be your friend: Two estates no less different in quality, then incompatible
in one person, and most unlike in office, for that a friend is chosen by will, A
friend chosen by will, and a master taken by necessity.
and a Master is taken by necessity: A friend will consider, but a Master
must be served: A friend geues of liberality, but a Lord demaundes by
authority: a Master has liberty to be Angry, but it belonges to a friend
to suffer: And a friend pardons, but a Master punishes. So that the
comparison being so different, it cannot be possible that being your Master, I
should bear unto you the due respects of a friend: since, if I be your
Master, you are bound to serve me, fear me, follow me, and obey me: Offices
prejudicial to the prerogatives of a friend, and against the laws of that
liberty and free souereignetie which the heart of man desires.

To require me with such rashenesse to be your friend, is (sure) to demand of
me the most precious Jewel I have in the world: For, to be your friend, is to
bind me to love you all my life, dividing my heart into youres, Offices of a
friend.
and making you even an other moytie with my self, true friendship being none
other thing then an unfeigned consent of will and affections, and a
transportation of two hearts into one body: And therefore two friends, if they
will love and live in the true observations of friendship, ought to speak but
with one Tongue, and love with one heart, yea, they ought to Communicate
together in one substance and rate of life, and not grudge to suffer in common
one perculier and singular death: Amongst friends, what is suffered of the
one, ought not to be intolerable to the other, and albeit their thoughts be
proper to themselves, yet their persons, their goods and fortunes, ought
always to be common: One friend ought not to say to an other I will not, or I
cannot, since, it is principal priueleadge in friendship to find nothing
impossible. Therefore, who ioynes in friendship with an other, We owe to our
friends all that we have, only we ought to have but one friend.
binds himself not to deny the thing that he demaundes, nor to use excuse in
any thing that his friend requires him to do: since in this consistes the full
office of friendship to owe to our friends even our selves and all that we have.
By the Council of Seneka the wise and discreet man ought to admit but one
friend, forseeing withal (as near as he can) to have no enemy at all: For,
says he, if there be danger in enemies, there can be no surety in the
multitude of friends, since, in respect of their number, they breed difference
of consent and will with variety of conditions, and where is no conformity of
manners, there can be no perfection in friendship. So straight is the rule of
friendship, that of many that profess liberal affection, there are few that
perform it, being an office particular to the Children of vanity to have
ready tongues to promise and slow hands to perform: True friends are bound
to feel the adversities of their friends with no less affection then if they
had proper interest in them: yea, it belonges to them to minister remedy to
their necessities, and give comfort to their miseries, esteeming it to
apperteine to their duty to communicate in all the fortunes of their friends:
The same agreeing with the resolution of Eschinus the Philosopher who being
asked what was the greatest perplexity of this life, answered, that to loase
things which we have got with pain, and to be divided from that which we
love, are the greatest afflictions that can travel a human mind. The friend
who^ we choose ought: to be wise and welthie.
The friend whom we choose, ought above all other things to be discreet, to
the end he may Council us, and of ability and wealth, the better to
administer to our necessities and lackes: For other ways, if he bear no
advise and judgment, we shall want Council to govern our prosperity, and
if he be pore, what mean is there to join succors to our wantes? by which
imperfection our prosperity stands in hazard for want to be warned, and in
adversity we are subject to despair or murmr by the intolerable burden of
our necessities, being no less hurtful to be raised to wealth and dignity
without a friend to instruct us to govern it, then to be extreme poor and have
no mean to releue us: therefore amongst men there is nothing more necessary
then to be environed, with friends, who in their presence may assist them with
good counsel, and in their absence hold common faith and loyalty. There be
two things that prove the malice of ye world to be infinite, Two things that
prove the malice of the world to be infinite
and therewithal warn all men to seek security in a wise and well hable
friend. The first is, yt to him that is ouerthrown there are very few that will
lend their hand to help him up again: and to such as stand in wealth and
favor every one studieth to cast stumbling blocks to make them fall. In which
respect, that man is possessed of no small treasure who has admitted society
with a wise and well advised friend, whose quality ought to be such as to
comfort his friend with his eye, to counsel him with his speech, to succor him
with his goods, to protect him with his power, and not only to do his best to
keep him from falling, but if he be down, to lend him his liberal hand to
remount him. To the qualetie of our friend it appertains to be discreet and
secret, A friend must be doscreete and secret.
least his lightness make him intolerable to us, and being lavish, he can not
but be troublesome to our affairs: and therefore as the bosom of our friend
ought to be a place of retraict for all our counsels, opinions, actions, and
enterprises, so, in the election of him, if we first seek that we would, and
suffer that we most fear, since true friendship to young men is a notable
sobriety, to old men an infalliable comfort, to the poor sufficient riches,
and to the rich assured honor. Let no man disclose the secrets of his heart,
but to such as he loves with all his heart: since it is one chief branch of
the office of a good friend to keep that he hears, and conceal what he
sees, and therewithal a rule most infallible that who speaks without
discretion shall be answered with shame and confusion. A true friend ought never
to flatter his friend, nor join reproach to any pleasure he has done for him,
taking it for his recompense, that he has don pleasure to him to whom he is
bound by the merit and law of true friendship. For, in case of danger and
necessity there ought between friends to be no delay of succors, no, no
remedy ought to be required where all things are due by justice, nothing
ought to be holden particular where all things deserve to be in common, nor no
importunity int^llerable, where ought to be no necessity of request. It is
not proper to all men to profess the qualetie of a friend: for that if they
have power, they may want disposition, if they have counsel they may have
weakness of action, and if they have minds to love, yet they may be subject to
the error of inconstancy, so that in case of friendship men can have no such
full perfection, but that in some respect they suffer infirmity either by
person or qualetie. And so if you weigh the office of a friend with the
inconveniences annexed, and consider the state of a Lord with the services
appertaining, I hope you will neither reteyne me for a master, nor choose me
for a friend, since for the one I am unable, and to the other unapt.

A letter to a noble personage, wherein is debated why God afflictes good men.
ALbeit I have had small mean hitherunto to declare my good affection to you
wards, and less expectation of great things in so poor a state as mine: yet
has there not wanted good will to wish well with the best, and so wishing, as
with effect I might express it, and leave you satisfied of my good meaning,
neither to merit the more nor to advance the sooner, but only for the due
respects I owe to your greatness and virtues, by whose aid I confess I have
aspired to the success and end of all my desires. And where my profession
keeps me so restrained, that to your many benefits I can give no equal
recompense, I am glad that byt he request of your letter is ministered occasion
to declare with what devotion I wish to do you service: praying you to esteem
me, not as I am, but as I desire to be on your behalf.

You demand by your letter why God suffers so many adversities to afflict
good men? whereunto I answer, that to the man of virtue nothing can happen in
ill, since according to the opinion of Philosophers, contraries can hold no
consent nor unity together. For, adversities albeit they have custom to vex
and trouble men, yet, they have no power to change the constancy and courage
of a valiant and resolute mind, who in all reuolutions reteynes one firm and
immouable virtue: even as a tree which being well rooted although he be shaked
with many violent winds, yet in their fury is no power to supplant him. Men,
through exercise of adversities become humble, wise, and perfect, and the just
man is better reformed by the proof of afflictions, then by any other mean.
For, knowing them to be messengers and warninges of God, he debates not the
grieves he feels, but calls his conscience to reckoning, he glorifieth
himself in tribulation, knowing that tribulations bring patience, patience
breeds experience, Benefits coming by tribulation.
experience rayseth hope, and hope can not be confounded, for that the love of
God is dispersed into our hearts by the holy spirit that has been given to
us: he suffers his sorrows, but in the end he surmounts them, and is not
overcome by their violence, showing then his own greatness and with what
virtues he is environed, when he proves what force his patience is of: he
takes all things for exercise of his virtue, since virtue without adversity
wythereth and loaseth his force. True magnanimity hears al fortunes.
A noble mind ought not to fear hard and doubtful things, nor complain of
any perplexity he endures: For, having true magnanimity, he ought to take
all things in good part, and hold no fortune grievous. Let him not debate what
he suffers, but determine to endure to the end, since God never proves his
people above their power, nor uses to visit their frayltie otherwise then
with a shaking rod, which rather threatens then strikes: Yea it is one
custom in Gods affection to correct those children whom he receives and
loves, to the end they may attain to a true strength, faith, and perfection,
not suffering the extremity of his justice to tempt them to murmr or
despair, but mildly to prepare them, having appointed to the godly no other
passage to heaven but through the furnace and fire of af^ictions. Creatures
that be fat and heavy for want of exercise, become unapt and idle, they are
not tired by labor only, but withal through custom of ease and rest and by
the heavy weight of their own bodies: even so that felicity that has
suffered no community with misfortunes can have no great continuance: but when
it has kept long wars with his incommodities, and by suffering injuries is
made hard, then is he in his perfection, and armed to resist all harms, God
suffering his people sometimes to encounter very rude and hard adventures, the
better to prepare them to a true judgment and examination of themselves. We
have no great need to exercise mercy to a good man, No man miserable but he
that esteems himself so.
for that though in appara^ce his estate seem needy, yet his virtue makes him
no way miserable: No, no man is unhappy but he that esteems himself so by the
base reputation of his courage. Demetrius was of opinion that there was no man
unhappy but he to whom adversity never happened. And as virtue and wisdom
are hid oftentimes in those persons, whom either malice pursues, envy
oppresses, or fortune contemns: so, for the most part, God suffers
adversities to exercise their force against such as are most strong, not to
tempt them above their power, but, through exercise to make them better
established. Fortune proved the force of fire in Scaeuola, the violence of
poverty in Fabricius, the perplexities of banishment in Rutilius, torments in
Regulus, poison in Socrates, ingratitude in Scipio, persecution in Caesar, and
death in Cato. There is nothing that sooner makes a man great and mighty, then
the trial of a perverse fortune: nor any thing breeds a more stabilitie of
faith and patience, then the exercise of adversities, as was well expressed in
the wonderful constancy of Scaeuola, who^ we may not call unhappy for that
he burnt his right hand in the fire of his enemies, nor repute Fabricius
wretched, for that whilst he was absent from the government of the common
weal, he labored his grounds with his own hands, and much less may we
refer to the conquest of fortune the virtue of Regulus, who being led to the
Gibbot was made there a monument of faith, and an example of patience. Let us
not esteem those men wretched who suffer so great things, for that by the
passion of them they are made happy, yea they are ye preparatiues to true
felicity, and the comfortable guides that lead men to the perpetual joys and
tranquilities of heaven.

The Author, under terms to reprove his friend that had charged him to have
taken out of his chamber a Pomander, speaks justly against such persons as
delight to be perfumed.
IN a singular combat between two Roman Knights in the time and presence of
Quintus Fabius, it happened that the victor holding in his mercy and under his
feet him that was vanquished: Thou shall says he deny in this presence that
thou have said, and acknowledge thy report to be false and wicked, or
otherwise this sword shall minister revenge to the untruths which thy lying
tongue has pronounced. Oh says the other, that thou knew as well how to use
the victory, as thy fortune has suffered thee to win it, or that there were
in thee as good desert or merit of Knighthode, as thou art my mortal enemy,
then would thou not be more desirous of my life, then to preserve thine
honor: suffice thee yt thy counsel shall not tempt me to the prejudice of
mine innocence, for if my strength fail to fight further, thou shall find in
me no want of heart to die. By the discourse of this ancient example, I am
bold to make insinuation into the wrong you have offered me, making me
guilty of the Pomander which you lack, which you have not only laid to my
charge in express terms between you and me, but also you have of late
accused me by a public letter compounded of the vapoures of your brain,
more full of choler then furnished with discreation, which gives me occasion
to say with the Roman Knight, that forgetting the regard of a friend, you are
fallen into the malice of an enemy, seeing you esteem more your Pomander then
mine honor. I am not determined to make account of the injury, and much less
to answer your letter in passion, bearing more regard to the profession I
follow, then to the house I am come of, since it is most sure that after my
death there will be no account demanded whether I have used my self as a
Knight, but rather if I have lived as a Christian. And therefore the weapons
wherewith I am bound to fight, are patience, hope, abstinence, charity, and
humility, arms always sufficient to defend my person, and without the which
I would not live. But albeit, for many good respects, I forbear to join
revenge to this injury, yet it is not without reason and liberty that I say
my fancy. The things which the men of this world do by passion only, and
without advise, proceed indifferently of want of wisdom, and superfluous
hope or ouerweening, which in man of respect ought to be eschewed, for that
they be two humors so factious in man's body, that the end draws him to do
nothing but what anger prouokes him unto, and the other is hateful to all
reason and Council. And if for every storm of fortune, we become weak and
complain, it can not follow but in time we shall imbrase despair, and hasten
the untimely destenie of our life: Which seldom happens to a man resolute
and wise, with whom patience and reason have more custom then choler and
passion. It is without fruit to speak fruitful things to a man possessed with
passion, for that he has neither sense to taste them, nor wisdom to feel
them: Yea, it is in vain to communicate with him that is obstinate, furious,
or incredulous, for that, when we think them most apt to be persuaded, it is
then they are furthest of from Council, and in laboring to appease them,
oftentimes we give increase to their anger: specially if we reduce to their
memory things that were the cause of their pain. By these (Sir) you have to
gather, that to men of virtue, honesty and estate, (even such as you ought to
be) it apperteynes to take heed that they do nothing to make them hateful:
For that one fault only suffiseth to make infamous a whole race, dishonoring
as well those that are past, as such as are present, leaving withal an
infection of blood to such as are to come. In Cassianus it is mentioned that
certain Pagans, using outrage and injury to a religions man of honest life,
asked him by disdain what fruit or profit he had by his Christ? Is not this
(answered he) a singular fruit, not to be moved with the bitter words which
you pronounce against me, and so easily to pardon the heavy wrongs you have
done to me? an answer sure worthy to be written in the hearts of men, since
thereby we are instructed how great is the virtue of patience, and of what
necessity and profit to the life of man. What meritte or estimation can be
due to the impatient man? Above all other mortal virtues, patience is most
necessary.
what wealth has he that has not the riches of patience? and how does that
man live, that lives without patience? The conversation and life of man has
often times need of all the morrall virtues, but the virtue of patience above
all others and at all hours and momentes is most necessary: For that so many
be the infelicities which surprise and travel our human life, that if we
make not as good custom to bear and suffer them, as we do to eat and
drink, we live in vain, and shall assuredly find trouble in stead of true
tranquiletie. All which I apply to my self, and there with all do let you
know that if it were not familiar with me to suffer and dissemble with such as
you are, I had ear this in publyke sort defied your malice, and ministered
revenge to the injury you have offered me. The determination of enterprises of
war belongs to the Prince, the affairs of the common weal are referred to
the Laws, and al causes of controversy are managed by justice: but quarrelles
that impeach honor are tried by the Sword, being albeit no less just to
chastise the corrupt Testimonies against our name and reputation, then to
weep and use contrition for our proper sins: yet in regard I am Christian
and no Pagan, and that I profess religion and am a Gentleman, I hold it more
tolerable to forget this wrong then to revenge it, alowing ye opinion of
Alexander the great, that to him that is iniuried is more need of virtue and
courage to pardon his enemy, then to kill him. If you had charged me to have
taken away any trifle tending to recreation of pastime, I would not have denied
it, for that I know how far in all things stretches the office of friends:
but to say that I was so impudent to take your Pomander, or so vain to wear
it, you do great wrong, for that the one had been against my Conscience, and
in the other had been offense to my modesty and shame. And therefore I say,
that if to wear sweet smelles be no great sin, at least it cannot but
incline to voluptuousness, and partake with vanity: Such a young and valiant
Knight as you are, ought more to raise his merit and renoume by actions of
Chieualrie in foreign Wars, then wearing Musk in the seames of his
Garments at home. To Women, The good woman will rather have her virtues shine
then her garments smell of musk.
reteyning by nature many ordinary infirmities which without the help of
sweet smelles would often times appear loathsome, it is more tolerable to be
perfumed then men: and yet the good woman will rather labor to have her virtues
to shine, then her Garments to smell of Musk: Yea, they are all bound rather
to live well then to smell sweet: A Pomander how well so ever it be tempered,
and how sweet so ever it smelles, yet can it cast his savor no further then
the length of a streat: Where a good renoume will ring over a whole kingdom,
and the fume of a wicked life will smoke over a whole World: So that whether
she be married, or Wydow, whether she be a Maid or a Wife, let her always live
in fear of slander, and think that the fame and report of honor is the
sweetest Insence to make her acceptable to all men, being a thing most foul
and loathsome that her Garments should be perfumed with sweet odors, and her
life putrifyed with evil conditions: I never read that any Woman has remained
unmarried for lack of being well perfumed, but many and many do I see refused
for want of virtue: for yt the man inquiring of the conditions of his Wife,
will not so much care whether she smell sweet, as examine if she be of good
Life: But let us also speak of men to whom generally the Philosophers have
forbidden to wear perfumes or smelles: By which occasion Rome remained almost
three Hundredth years without either Spice to eat, or perfumes to smell: but
after the Wars began to discontinue, vices forgot not to reenter into
custom: By which we may infer that if there were no idle men in the world,
there would be no such reckoning made of vanities and vice: Cicero says that
the five vices, To erect Tombs, to wear Gold ringes, to use Spice in Meats,
to allay Wine with Water, and to bear sweet Smelles: The men of Asia sent
as presents to the Romans, in revenge of the Cities and blood that they had
taken from them: By which I gather, that greater was the damage which Rome
received by Asia, then Asia by Rome: For that the lands and Provinces which
the Romans Conquered of the Asians, were eftsoons reconquered and restored,
but the vices of them of Asia remained as a perpetual inheritance amongst the
Posterities of the Romans: He that follows the Wars to fight, and he that
laboreth the earth to live by it, has more care to succeed his business then
to smell to sweet odoures: Yea, it is familiar to vain men, to seek to smell
sweet, and forget to live well: In Rome it was forbidden that neither Maid nor
Wife should drink Wine, nor Man buy Musk Aumber, or other perfuming smells:
And it was as ordinary with the Magestrates to chastise men that boar
perfumes, as to punish women that were found Dronkardes: The same being
verifyed by the virtuous Emperor Vespatian, who having the Pen in his hand
ready to sign a dispatch which he had given to a Roman Knight and feeling
him smell of perfume, he did not only revoke his grant, but with many
threats banished him forthwith his presence: The Romans persecuting Plutus (a
Conspirator with the Triumuirie) found him hid in a sellor by no other espiall
or intelligence then by a sweet smell which he had scattered as he went:
Haniball a valiant and happy Captain in his youth, suffered his old age to
be seduced by the Dames of Capua, and sweet ointments of Asia, who so
effeminated the forces of his mind and body, that he did never afterward any
thing worthy of report. The Romans being in debate to choose a Captain to
send into the wars of Pannonia, referred the resolution to Cato Censorius,
who, of two that stood in that adoption, refused one of them being his
nearkinsman, for that says he I never knew him to return wounded from
wars, but I have always seen him go perfumed in the streates. The great
Numantia in Spain could never be won (notwithstanding fourteen years seege
of the Romans) till Scipio purged his Camp of loyterers, perfumers and whores.

Licurgus a notable law reader amongst the Lacedaemonians, erected and
institution upon grievous pains, that no man should buie or sell any odiferous
or sweet ointments, unless it were to offer in the temples or to make
medcines for the sick: By these examples may appear how intolerable perfumes
have been too well ordered countries, and how hurtful to many particular
personages: it is a vice that slaundereth the magistrate, offendes the
multitude, breeds disease in the brain, and brings decay to the purse. For,
to buy a pair of gloves of ten crowns, is more for curiosity, then
necessity: Yea there be many vain and light men that will not stick to
bestow a dozen crowns upon a pair of sweet gloves for their Lady, that have
not the heart to bestow a poor gown upon a student, nor in smaller things to
minister to the necessities of their near parents: such men spend their
portions more by opinion then in reason: and against such men is pronounced the
threate of the Prophet. The time will come (says he) that the perfumed men
shall suffer great pains, and in place of precious ointments, they shall feel
most horrible stinckes: Yea such men are abominable before God, infamous to a
common weal, and their quality dangerous to their conscience, and chargeable
to their purses. In which respects, let all gentlemen practice more to live
virtuously, then to study to be perfumed, since under heaven there is nothing
that carries a sweeter smell then a good renown, nor any thing that sauoreth
more horribly then ye fume and incense of wicked life. To be a good Christian,
is a sweet ointment: to have a clear conscience, smelles better then Ciuit:
and to be innocent in life and virtuous in example, is of far greater merit
and dignity then all the perfumed Pomanders we can wear.

A letter to a particular friend, rebuking all such as offer outrage or injury
to any that are newly converted to the faith of Christ, calling them infidels
or miscreants, or by any other name of reproach.
SIr, before the children of Israel issued out of Egypt, they had a King, and
no Law: but long time after their departure, they lived under laws, and were
subject to no kings: Only there commonweals were administered by judges, and
their souls instructed by sacrificators, of whom the last saving one was Hely,
A man very zealous to his country, but most negligent in the institution of
his house and posterity: For, his children were so given over to disorders, so
subject to their particular wills, and so far estraunged from virtue, that
the scripture in the first Book of the Kings, detecteth them in this sort
peccatum puerorum erat gra^de nimis coram domino quia detrahebant homines a
sacrificio: the sins of the sons of Hely were too great in the sight of the
Lord: For, not content to be wicked themselves, they labored to draw others
from well doing: Of which sin they were most of all other convinced, as
persuading al others to do no sacrifice: by mean whereof, and for punishment
of their faults, the old man perished suddenly, his children were slain,
and their wives died of child: So that the punishment of the sin of ill
doing, and the Crime of drawinge others from dooinge well, fell not only upon
those that did it, but also upon such as consented thereunto. I have drawn
this ancient history into these perticulers, not so much to reproach you as to
wish you to well weigh and note it: but chiefly to introduce occasion to
answer certain late speeches of youres, which ought to have been as far
from your conscience, as they deserve no way to be familiar with your
nobility.

Plato entertayning an old man as his special friend, ministered to him no
small travel to reform his vices: and being oftentimes persuaded by his
followers to loase no more time to take away such desperate and hardened
faults: Sure (says Plato) I had reason to be weary to warn him, if I boar
no more regard to the office of a friend, Not to do ill is the office of an
innocent.
then to the hope I have to do good by my travel: For so delicate is the law
of friendship, that a friend ought rather to loase his pains, then leave any
scrupull in his loyalty: This example serves as well to our purpose as the
figure of the great Priest Hely: and so to our matter. Not to do ill I say is
the office of an innocent, even so to give over to do well, belonges to a man
negligent: To be hold to be wicked is the office of an evil man: But to be
desperate and defend the ill, is the work of a man wholly governed by the
devil: For that no man can be reformed of his sin, if first he acknowledge
not his fault: according to the which (Sir) I have to charge you, that in that
you disputed yesterday, you neither showed your self a knight, a Christian,
nor a courtier: For, a Christian ought to esteem his Conscience, the knight is
tied to his modesty, and the Courtier (above all others) ought to express
affability: And therefore, seeing that the honorable moare in the Court, is
already baptized and reconciled to the faith of Jesus Christ, and that by my
travel and against the will of all the Moarishsect, you did against the
Charity of a Christian, abused the profession of a Knight, and steyned the
reputation of a civil Courtier when you called him Infidel, Miscreant, and
infamous Moare: Are you that God whereof the Prophet speaks, Scrutans corda
et renes: Taking upon you to know whether this Moare be a Miscreant or a
Christian? It may be that you have measured your merittes with his, and weighed
in one Balance his faith and youres: or perhaps you have Gods at commandment
to acquit your sins and give you place amongst the just, seeing you
condemn others and iustifye your self: Wherein it seems you remember not
that to God only is reserved the truth of the secret of such as are ordained
to be saved, and appointed to be damned: So that if this Moare believe in God as
well as you, if he be Baptized as lawfully as you, if he go to the Church with
as good devotion as you, and if we see him do no act, but of a Christian, and
in you is found no miracle: I see not how you have any authority to call him
Infidel, no more then he has reason to doubt you to be a Christian. They be
words of great rashenesse one man to vpbreade an other with such injuries:
Seeing that to be a good Christian, we are not only bound to do good deeds,
but also to use modesty and my lonesse in our speech: otherways if a Christian
call his neighbor Fool he shall be guilty of Hell. And as there is no great
difference of the injury for one man to call an other Fool, and to call him
Dog: So, to a man received into the faith, there can not be a greater
reproach then to be called an evil Christian: For that to be termed Fool
tendes but to the prejudice of the reputation of wisdom, but to be called a
wicked Christian touches a man's soul and defaceth his renoume: So that if
Christ forbid us Christians to call one an other Fool, much less can he
brook the outrage of greater injuries: Since by the Schole and rule of his Law
we are taught to imbrase one an other with such sincerity, as neither to
stryke with our hands, nor reproach or slander with our Tongues: When I
rebuke you for ministering such inciuilitie to the poor Moare, you answered
that it was an ancient custom of the country to call them so, in which
respect you held it no offense to conscience to vpbreade them, nor breach of
civility to use the terms where with your Tongue was most enured: Oh that
men of virtue and honor, taking upon them to correct a fault are bound to
great consideration of the estate and nature of the fault, lest in seeking to
reform others, they Condemn themselves: as may be justly imputed against you,
who, in tourning the custom of the Country to the help of your fault to call
him Infidel, you committed the greater offense, according to the saying of God
to Moses: Take heed Oh Children of Jsraell, that when you enter into the
Land of Promise, you keep no custom with the Laws of the Egiptians: Wherein
we are warned that if the Law of our Country be evil, and the customs
wicked, we ought not only not to allow of them, but also not to observe them,
since it is as lawful to discontinue an ill Custom, as to forbear to do
ill, and with as good liberty may we reform an ill Law though it has stand
by long continuance, as to translate any ancient Garment, and reduce him to
the present fashion. The reverent Moare found himself much iniuried with your
words, and the assistance not a little dishonored: yea, the remeynder of that
race being in good towardnes to be adopted into the church, made their
reckoning not to become Christians, if for their faith, they should be vexed
with such reproaches: So that this your fault is the greater, for that in
following the Children of Hely, you trouble such as are baptized, and are the
cause that others will not come to Christendom: Vidi afflictionem populi mei
in Egipto. etc. I am not says God to Moses so careless as men think of
those that serve me, nor forgetful to punish offenders: Since I have opened
mine ears to the cyres of my People in Egypt, and do see the great tiranies
which the Governors of the Kingdom use against them, for which cause I will
draw them into liberty, and put the Egyptians to punishment: Wherein (with
the exposition of S. Augustine upon these words) the Hebrews felt themselves
not so much wronged, nor God was so greatly displeased with the trauelles they
endured. as with the particular injuries which they received of the Egiptians:
Which I beseech you may warn you hereafter not to be so rash and abandoned
to words, seeing I never knew any man minister injuries to an other, but there
was inquisition made of his own life and doings, yea, even to the desiphering
of his race: which is fallen out against your self, for that at the instant
when you reproched the reverent Moare and called him Infidel, there were that
stood behind your back, that said secretly, if he were descended of the
Moares, your ancestors were of no better Lineage: Such is the gaiue that People
of ill Tongues do reap, who, if they outrage such as are on line, others will
deface their progeny that are dead: which being a justice appointed to such as
are ministers in malice, yet there it may be avoided, where is government and
restraint of Tongue: And therefore I wish you to use Charity to the end you
may find recompense of Charity, and forbear not to do well the better to
nourishe good example and keep you from the imputation of the Sons of Hely.

A Letter to a Noble man touching familiarly how inconvenient it is for a man
married, to have a Woman friend besides his Wife.
SIr, it brings no small grief unto me that after so long intermission of
letters, there is present occasion given, not to common according to our
custom, but to debate injuries between you and your Wife, who as I
understand has no less need of Consolation, then you of Correction: Wherein
by how much I labor to seek out in whom rests the fault, by so much do I
find you guilty in the occasion, and in her no want of reason: assuring you
that if I found her as disordered, as you are reported to be disolute, I would
as well pronounce her worthy of sentence, as with all men you are holden void
of merit: And if there can be required of a man no more but that he be good,
the same ought most of all to be expressed in a woman, since in her is more
subjection to judgment, and less ability to cloak or cover, yea, if her
virtues appear not in example, her light burns dim, and as a shadow does
but delude the world: which being far otherwise in the behavior of your
Wife and my niece, it may please you to pardon me if in this Letter I defend
her innocence, and prove your fault, since of friends Council ought to be
taken, and of parents remedy is to be ministered.

Corinthus a notable tirant, before he made choice of his wife, desired of
Demosthenes to know what conditions his wife ought chiefly to be furnished
withal: Counsels in the choice of a wife
to whom the Philosopher gave this counsel: Be sure (says he) that thy wife
be rich to the end the necessities of thy life may be supplied, and the
countenance of thy estate plentifully supported. Let her be nobly borne, the
better to minister to thy reputation and join honor to thy posterity. Let
her be young to the end her service may better delight thee, and thou have no
occasion to find marriage loathsome. Let her be fair the better to content thy
desires and conteyne thee from strange affections. And let her be virtuous and
wise, to the end thou may with security reappose thy estate upon her
government: For, who takes a wife without these co^dicions is sure to find
that which he fears, and miss of that that ought to make his marriage happy:
since of all accidents ordained to trouble the life of man, there can not be a
more infelicitie then to be ill encountered in marriage. There is nothing in
this world so perfect, nor any person so thoroughly accomplished, to whom is not
either further perfection to be added, or just cause of reformation or
amendment. And such is the infirmity of our common nature, No man agrees
with the condition of his fortune.
that there are few of so full prosperity, who in some respect complayine not
against the quality of their estate: For, many we see are raised to great
wealth, but they bear shame of their base lineage: some enobled by birth and
parentage, and yet are followed with poverty: Many blissed both with riches
and nobility, but they want the delight of children: and some gladded with
procreation, and they eftsoon made sorry with their ill demeanor. And to
speak of natural things, we find by experience that if the fire comfort us
with his warmth, it vexes us again with his heat: If the air minister
recreation when it is temperat, it puts us again into passion when it is
violent. If we praise the earth for her fruit, we murmr against her when she
is barraine. If we have commodity by rivers for the stay of our thirst and to
breed fishes for our noriture, they are intolerable on the other side when
they ouerflow their channels and drown our fields and cattle. Too much meat
breeds indigestion, and too little makes the stomak weak: want of exercise
brings sickness, and too much labor is hurtful: solitariness makes us incline
to melancholy, and too much conversation is importunate: Riches are accompanied
with care, and poverty subject to sorwe. But let us exchange these customs
with the actions of ancient noble men in times past, in whom if there were
causes of many merits, they boar also matter no less worthy of blame: For,
the Gretians praised Hercules for his force, but they accuse him of tirannies:
The Lacedaemonians attribute much to Licurgus for the zeal he bare to his
common weal, but they note him for a most severe and rigorous judge: With the
Egyptians Isis is famous for his patience, but they stayne him for his
vnchastetie: The Athenians extol Plato for his doctrine, but they accuse his
great covetousness: The Romans make Caesar to be merciful, and withal
reapport him to be hautie and proud: So that if in men of so great account have
been found imputation of vice and fault: you and I (sir) may well conclude that
there is no bread without branne, no Nut without shell, no tree without bark,
no corn without chafe, nor any man without fault. All my life long I have
heard men complain of women, and women murmr against men, in both which I
think is one equal and common reason: For, since there rests between man
and woman such difference in their creation, Man and woman differing in
creation, must also differ in condition.
they must of congruent necessity be contrary in condition: And therefore
except in Jesus Christ, it is Blasphemy to think that any person is dispensed
with all from erring, or acquitted from falling.

This discourse (sir) have I used ye better to bring into your remembrance the
marriage between you and my niece, which was accomplished rather by joint will
and consent then by necessity, either of you being in state well hable and
sufficient to prefer you. And seeing you cannot deny that when you made
choice of her, you promised to serve her, and with great importunities
disauowed your self from all others to cleave unto her: It is neither
reasonable nor just that you now bequeath your self to the service of an
other, seeing by no equity, you can be due to none other but to her only. If
there be infirmities in her, I hope they are not so desperate, but the office
of a good husband may either reform or suffer them: and for imperfections, I
see not how she can be charged with any, having beauty, riches, lineage and
virtue. Oh how many wives be there now a days, Infirmities in marriage.
who, if they be rich, they lack beauty: if they be fair, they want lineage:
if they have high birth, they are void of virtue: If they be virtuous they are
not young: And being young, they may perhaps want discretion and government:
by means whereof as their husbands have whereupon to repent, and their
parents no small cause of sorrow: So, let all men esteem it no small felicity
to receive in marriage a wife, well borne, young, fair, rich, and virtuous, to
whom he is bound as the soul to the body, and if he exchange and divide
himself to strangers, he stands, guilty of no small offense, and is subject
to no little danger. I hear (sir) that you use the service of other houses
then your own in the night: that you delight to walk the streets and behold
the stars: that you visit Curtisanes, and have familiarity with bawdes:
exercises truly to decay your substance, and bring danger to your person. And
I cannot marvel a little, that having already traveled most regions in
Christendom, which ought to suffice to establish the race of your youth, that
now you will not seek to put your mind in rest, Being once married all men
ought to be particular to their wives.
the opportunity so serving, together with the commodity of so good a wife and
large living. The vanities or follies which follow young men, are for the most
part referred to the greennes of their youth: but if we hau^t lightness after
we be married, much less that we can be excused, seeing all the world stands
up to condemn us. And therefore, to make pilgrimage to such saints as you
worship, or visit shaded houses wherein dwell no body but curtisanes with
painted faces, or to be a stranger to your own house wherein you find
nothing but virtue and virtuous delites: it can not but bring prejudice to your
honor, hazard to your soul, slander to your posterity, and spoil to your
patrimony: For that, being so possessed by strange women, where they have no
possibility to marie with you, they will labor to plumbe upon you till they
have left you neither fether nor flesh: If you have no regard to your soul, at
least look back to the safety of your goods: seeing that from the day you
enter marriage and have children, as touching your goods, you are no more Lord,
but only a tutor and keeper of them: And therefore no less guilty is he that
loaseth his own goods, then he yt robs an other. But if you have no respect
to your goods, at least bear care to your honor, to the end you may more
easily aspire to public charge in the common weal, which being not
distributed to young men full of liberty, but to men of settled stay and
grauetie: It behooves you to remain no longer as you are, but to be such one
as you esteem your self to be: If you bear no respect to your honor, at
least use consideration of your soul: For, so delicate is the law of Jesus
Christ and so strait the commandments of God, that they do not only forbid
men conversation with strange women, but also condemn all desires that way:
It behooves you also to have care over the security of your person and health:
since it commonly happens to the man that emboldneth himself to drink of all
Waters, and carries a key to open other mennnes Locks, that in seeking to
dishonor his neighbor, he shall suggest peril to his own life: Your Wife
will endure hard Fare, many frownings, restraint of liberty, all reproaches,
yea though they be thundered with stripes, with all other perplexities, upon
condition only that you love her alone, and seek no knowledge with others:
For, there is no greater despair to a Married woman, then when her Husband
discharges upon her back all his Iars, Quarrels, and passions, and reserueth
his pleasures, joys, A great cause of unkindness of the wife against her
husband.
and company for an other: Yea, it is hard in whether of the two rests the
greater heart, either as touching the Husband to do so, or in respect of the
Wife to endure it: Oh it is intolerable to the Wife, to hear her husband
merry abroad, and find him froward at home, to have him steal from her to
enriche his friend, to communicate with his minion, and be a stranger to his
Wife, and to minister to the wantes of his Concubine, and be without pity to
his proper Children: In the Law of Christianity, the same faith the woman is
bound to keep to her Husband, he is al so bound to observe to her. But if
Wives had the like authority to chastise, as Husbands take liberty to
accuse, sure, they would neither take to such sorrow the disorders of their
Husbands, nor in them would be found such facility to offend: Besides, from
the season that Man and Woman be united by the holy promise and covenant of
marriage, they have so small jurisdiction in particular over themselves, that it
is a kind of theft, if either the one, or the other, alien or divide their
bodies. Consider therefore (Sir) the great occasions you give to your Wife,
who, having youth, riches, and beutie, and courted with no simple
importunities: If she were otherwise then she is, she would perhaps bestow her
heart upon some one of those many that bestow upon her their eyes: occasion may
do much, and there is no worse thing to tempt a Woman then the ill example of
her husband. No worse thing to tempt a wife then the ill example of her husband.
For your part, if you think your Wife not worthy to receive recompense of
affection, at least have consideration of her merit, and let not her loyalty
discover your penury, nor her constancy complain of your want of honor. If
you will not observe to her the Law of a husband, for the respects of your
soul, your honor, your goods, and your health: at least remember that what
pleasures or felicyties you find in the company of your Concubine, are
nothing in regard of the disquiets you shall find when you come home: For,
how wise, how secret, how temperate, or how holy so ever a Wife be, yet she had
rather die then not to give revenge to the injuries of her Husband, or not to
make him feel her Jealousy. And therefore to men that are drowned in fancy
with forreyne Women, it is in vain to repose in the Baude who will be
corrupted, or in the Concubine whose indifferency makes her a blab: Seeing in
cases of Jealousy, Wives are so subtle, and with all so liberal, that the
better to epsy and trace out the Confederacies of their Husbands, they will
not stick to corrupt hte Quick by money, and Conjure the dead by Charms.
And so God grant you that you want, and defend you from that you deserve.

A Treatise of the Resurrection of JESUS CHRIST* together with an Exposition of
the Fifth Article of the Creed that he descended into Hell, and roase again
the third day.
ACcording to your request, I have sent you herewith ye declaration of ye fifth
Article of the Creed, in substance as I published it, but not in sort as I
pronounced it: For that it is impossible that in the Pen should be
represented the facility, grace, and edifying virtue of the Tongue, according
to the opinions of the best Philosophers and Orators, both Greek and Latin
with whom the Pen was accounted insufficient to satisfy or compare with the
honor which they had gotten with the Tongue, and specially to record or write
Sermons, wherein they held that the matter should loase his Grace, and the
auther his reputation. Notwithstanding, according to your power to command
me, you shall find no want of desire to do you service: albeit under this
condition, that if you be not satisfied, the fault is more in your importunity
then in my charity: and so to the matter.

The fifth article of our faith expressing that Christ descended into hell and
roase eftsoon the third day, contains two parts, whereof the first
comprehendes our confession that he went into hell, and in the second is
contained his resurrection. Some deuines divide it into two articles, but we
draw it into one, containing notwithstanding two parts tending to one end.

We confess that our redeemer being buried, his holy body remained in the
grave three days, being in deed dead during that season. But his soul in the
mean while was not idle, for that it descended into hell to do there a
wonderful action, which he accomplished: And so we confess that on the third
day his soul was reioyned to his body to give it real and essential life:
So that there can be no dout that he roase not again having obtained the
victory against death: Wherein, if we consider things in judgment and
equity, we shall find great matter in the humility of the son of God, and
in whom may be seen the singular mercy of the father not sparing his son,
and his ready obedience to accomplish the eternal will of his father all
inuiting us to bear no small love and thankfulness to him. In this article and
in the former, are declared the degrees by the which the son of God
descended, The Ladder or degrees whereby Christ descended from heaven
and embased himself even to things incredible for a personage of that
dignity. The first degree was to make him man, and to vouchsafe to be borne at
a time certain, he which was borne eternally. The second was that he yet
humbled himself more to suffer sentence and public condemnation as a
malefactor. In the third, he took upon him the torments of the cross, a
death most cruel, and more infamous then any other sort of passion. By the
fourth, he was content to suffer death not as God, albeit being God, but as
man, in such sort as the very person of God suffered death. In the fifth, he
suffered himself to be buried as others that were dead, making himself like
them in all things as if he had been comprehended under the curse of Adam to
return into dust whereof he was formed: yea he that was free from sin and
the curse. And by the last step or degree he descended into hell, whether were
descended such as stood destitute of their proper justice, to the end to open
to them the gate of the kingdom of heaven. By these degrees, if we consider
spiritually the discending of Jesus Christ, we shall find it as long as is the
distance of heaven from whence he came, until the Center of the earth whether
he descended. And as there restes no other place any further to embase the
son of God, so would he not be committed to more humility: only there
remained one degree which proceeded of sin and the fellowship of Satan* out
of the which the person of Christ was exempted, he which came to redeem
sinners, and justify men, and vanquish the devil. All that he could suffer to
be made a sacrifice for our sins, ye son of God was inclined and embased
unto it, sin only except whereunto he could not be subject for that there is
too great enimitie between ye justice of ye savior, and ye malignity of sin.
The greatest part of ye degrees above mentioned concerning the discending and
humility of the son of God, are declared by the Apostle, who speaking by the
suggestion of the holy Ghost, says, that the son of God being very God, was
content to disguise himself not to be entreated of the world as God, but
embasing his estate even to take upon him the form of a bondsman, and appear
to the world in the representation of a man, becoming altogether a servant
whose obedience refused not the passions of death, yea the infamous execution
of the cross. In this (as is said) is expressed the greatest part of this
wonderful embasement of estate which the son of God took upon him, seeing
of very God he is made very man, and being man he embased himself under all
men, being handled as a poor slave of whom the world made no reckoning. From
thence he suffered an other embasement even to be passed to condemnation of
death, and not a death in common manner, but the execution whereunto were joined
dishonor, infamy, and bitter torments: Of this humility the Prophets have
written saying, he was put on the rank of offenders and accompanied with
wicked men. Esaias. 35.
In an other place Esaias gives this testimony of him that he never hid his face
from such as would buffet him, nor his shoulders from those that would strike
him, nor bis beard from any that would rent it: In Jeremie also is declared the
assembly of the wicked against the Lord, Iere. 1^.
and the conspiracies which they levied to persecute and destroy him, and to
empoyson his meat and life. In S. John albeit he had made the world, yet he
was misknowne of the world: John. 1.
and the Evangelist has comprehended in few words the depth of the place from
whence the Lord descended, seeing, being the workman of the world, he is come
notwithstanding in such extremity that the world misknew him: For, much less
that he was acknowledged for Lord and maker of the world, seeing he was not
judged worthy to dwell in the world: being innocent, he has been condemned,
and albeit his justice and integrity were public and manifest, yet the world
made no conscience to throw upon him those great wrongs: yea, being assuredly
known htat his enemies accused him by faulse testimony, yet the wisemen of
the world would rather condemn justice, then displease the wicked. Lastly the
humility and handling of Christ, agreed fully with the Prophet David speaking
in the person of our Lord in these terms: J am no man but a worm of the
earth, the reproach, retraict, and shame of men, Psalm. 18.
and the scome of the people. There rested yet one degree, spoken of in this
present article of the Creed, wherein we confess that the son of God
descended into hell after his death: And touching the declaration of this last
discending, we have to consider that this article may be understood in two
sorts, they both being certain, catholic, and full of great mysteries. The
first intelligence has been already begone to be declared, and contains a
demonstration of the great humilite and wonderful embasement supported by the
son of God in this world, being reduced to the utter extremities of sorrow,
torments, shame, and infamy. There is no spirit sufficient to comprehend fully
the great sorrow expressed by the Lord in these words my soul is heavy even
unto death: The fear and heaviness being so much the more apparent, great, and
terrible, by how much they enforced drops of blood to fall from his face even
to the earth. Psalm. 68.
All the other Passions wherewith the world vexed him were of no meaner effect,
and therefore complaining to his father he cried Oh save me Lord for the waters
and broils of the tempest are entered, even to take away my life. I am sunk in
a gulf of myer and can find no place firm to fix my foot upon: Wherein is
meant no other thing but the storm and fury of our sins with the punishments
due, together with a signification of all our miseries, and that which the
Devil and the world could do by the mean of the unrighteous and wicked
keeping war against our Savior with persecutions, torments and vexations. In
this sort was his discending into the deapth and bottom of the earth, and by
consequence the first intelligence of our Article, which, together with all
that depends upon it, may be proved by the second understanding which must
presuppose that such as before the coming of Christ were dead in his faith and
in his spirit and knowledge, had obtained pardon and were truly reconciled with
God, notwithstanding the gates of heaven were not open to them until the Lord
which delivered them had passed therein as the only iustifier and true pacifier

In the mean while they remained in rest in a place named Hell or bottom of
the earth exspecting their delivery when the son of God should come to draw
them from thence: But all this while they were neither in the company of the
Damned, and much less endured their tormetes neither had the Devil any
jurisdiction of them: Seeing, if they had been of the reprobate and Damned
sort, the Devil had had perpetual power over them, as he has had and has
over the Cursed and miserable who die without repentance of their sins, and
without participating in the benefit of the blood of the Son of God. And for
that by the occasion of sin and reign of the Devil, the gates of heaven
were cloased, and the joy and use of beatitude stood restreyned and limited to
a certain time, I say that that place was a prison and the prison of Hell, a
place wherein the Fathers of faith exspected the coming of the Savior of the
world.

In this place then were the auncientes that were just, not that they felt the
torments of the Damned, but had only a careful desire to see the prophesies
accomplished and themselves delivered, and al to enjoy the presence and
company of the Savior together with that most happy vision of the majesty
of God. So that in this sort did the soul of Jesus Christ discende into that
place accompanied with his divinity which never forsook him, and dissoluing
the prisons, he brake in pieces all the Cheines and Linkes, that held tied the
souls of the faithful. This was it that Zachary the Prophet meant, when he
said that by the virtue of the blood of thy stomach and of thy Testament thou
have drawn thy prisoners out of the Lake with out Water. Wherein the Prophet
speaks even with the Son of God, as true God and Savior of men, and
foreseeing such great misery, he says that by the virtue of his blood wherein
consisted the Salvation of men, he had drawn his Subjects and friends out of
their dark prison which he signifies by the Lake without Water: Seeing that
in such like places Conquerors are wont to bestow their Prisoners for their
more punishment and better security in prison: By the same also the Prophet
takes the comparison of a great Prince that enters into the Land of his
enemy, not to shake his Sword and remain there, but to surmount and havoc
his enemy and take from him by force his Servants and Subjects whom of long
time he had holden Prisoners. By this is showed the great power of Jesus Christ
according to his own phrase in these terms: So long as a strong man (says
he) and well furnished with weapons, kepes his house and defendes it by force,
all that he has is in peace. But if there come one more mighty then he, he
makes him forsake his guard, chaseth him out of his house, and becomes Lord of
al his goods: even so did our Lord with the Devil, expressing upon him his
wonderful power, and great victory which he obtained against the kingdom of
darkness: For, seeing the Devil has laid aside his weapons, it is a sign he
is vanquished, and seeing death is conquered, the Devil must needs remain
disfurnished of Arms: And seeing the depthes and bottomes of the earth have
been illuminated by the light and presence of our savior, the kingdom of
darkness is defeyted and brought to ruin. And so for conclusion we find
three great considerations in the first part of this Article: Whereof the first
has been debated, comprehending the great discending and extreme humility
which the Son of God took upon him to save man and confound the works of
sin. The second consists in this, that whilst his most holy body accompanied
with his divinity, remained in the grave to testify that he was truly dead:
His soul descended into the dark prisons, where were detained the holy
fathers notwithstanding they were not in the power of the devil. For albeit
they were justified by the virtue of the mediator and their faith and
repentance, yet they were banished from heaven and put as it were in prison, to
witness the effect and operation of sin, together with the necessity which
man had of the coming of the son of God to give them their full remedy. So
that the savior of the world entering into this prison and confounding all
darkness by his great light, did fully comfort and satisfye by his presence,
the holy souls which exspected him with a desire far above the judgment or
comprehe^cion of man: it was then that those good ancient Fathers saw the
accomplishment of the promise long before made to them, that out of their seed
should rise one that should break the head of the great Serpent. Then all
their desires were accomplished, The vision and consolation of the ancient
fathers.
beholding even with their eyes the majesty and presence of him, whom so often
they had seen in contemplation and Spirit: In whom they had laid up all
their hope, from the remembrance of whom they did never swerve, and by the
only thought of whom they had overcome all their adversities, taking comfort
in him in their miseries and perplexities. Then did Abraham see him who was
promised to bless al his people and al Nations, in the faith of whom he was
circumcised, and made alliance with God. Jsaac saw him whom he prefigured when
his father thought to have sacrifised him: he saw the sprinkles and marks of
the blood, whose effusion was most sweet before the face of the father from
the beginning of the world. Jacob who had called upon this savior in his
death, saw his desiers fulfilled, no more resting which he might require.
Melchisedech saw the great sacreficator, the sacrifice of whom had neither end
nor rule. Moises spoke then with the great Prophet which God promised to send
to deliver his people from the captivity of the spiritual Egypt, whose power
and authority should be so perentory and great, that who would not obey him,
should dye eternal death. And the great Prophet David embraced then the
health which he had so long desired: he saw then that great and mighty Christ
of whom he had made so many holy ditties and songs, and in whose hope he had
so many times taken comfort and vanquished sin. Lastly, all the just of ye
times past, saw the accomplishment of their desiers, the end of their sighs,
the remedy of their miseries, the comfort of their sorrows, and the victory
against death, hell, and sin, and all by the presence of the captain which
came to guide them even unto the sight and majesty of GOD. Oh how possible are
the perplexities which men suffer under hope of the promises of GOD: How happy
is that abiding or expectation, which for pawn has the verity of GOD? How
well assured and well recompensed is that patience which is of long sufferance
and never swarueth? All these ancient Fathers were in diverse seasons, and yet
they had all one faith, they were all inspired with one spirit, all served one
Lord, all lived and dyed in one hope: they all bare their cross in this life:
they all were made prisoners in that place: lastely they all saw in one instant
him whom they had so long expected, together with the fulfillinge of all the
promises which had been made to them. There the Savior of the world spoke to
them, publishinge good news touching their remedies and restitution: And
comunicated with them the greatness of the mysteries which it behooued him to
do for their Redemption: there is no doubt but with them he used most dear
familiarity: Yea he who was always so joyful with his own, used no less
favor and consolation to those with whom his Father had made alliance, and so
justly kept his promises. And they likewise rendered no small thanks and
praises to the Lord that had so accomplished his word for the Salvation of
the world, yea, they departed out of their old prisons with no small
triumphs, to follow their captain which had over come so many and great
ennemies.

The third consideration is, that our savior Jesus Christ did not only break
the prisones and deliver the holy Fathers, but also by this discending, he
brought a great astonishment and fear into hell and over the whole kingdom of
the devil, making him know that his forces were dissolved, and that now was
brought to effect the breaking of his head expressed long before by prophecy:
and that the gates of his dark kingdom were thrown open, and all his works
brought to naught. Even as a captain victor entering into the fortress of his
ennemie, and having once pluckte down the munition and ensigns, so committes
it to ruin and spoil, that he leaves an easines to subdue it as often as he
will: even in the same sort the Sun of God gave such a terror to the
kingdom of hell: that satan and his ministers knew well, their forces were
broken, and that there remained unto them no possibility eftsoon to
reestablish a kingdom of sufficient power to resist the meanest soldier of
that great captain, and that hereafter he could take no prisoners except some
wretched cowardes and people of small valor, which would offer themselves to be
captives of their proper and miserable will. In this sort the princypalitie of
hell so felt the invincible and assured power of him, who being dead and his
body left in the Sepulcher shaked them notwythstanding with so great War,
that on the one side he leuyed those Prisoners that were kept restrained, and
on the other, his virtue so weakened their infernal forces that they remeyned
ever since vanquished. It was then that they saw and knew that their Hell,
whither they thought to have reduced all mankind, was forced and dissolved:
And that sin which they had introduced into the world and death that ensued
it, were dead and vanquished by the conquest of this new and invincible
Prince. That was it which the Apostle spoke of, that the son of God has
defaced and sacked the powers of Hell the world am putting them to publyke
confusion, and Triumphing over them in his proper person: So that the
enterprises of our Savior in this comparison, represent unto us the form and
actions of a valiant Capteyne marching before men, before Aungelles, and before
the face of the Father, with a great troop of enemies vanquished, bound, and
spoiled of their forces.

In the beginning of this Article we touched that our Lord made his
discending by certain degrees: yea, even to a Wonderful embasement of
himself, and known only to the divine wisdom. This embasement has been
Prophesied under the sign of discending from Heaven unto the the Bottomes of
the Earth, But now we say that of all those degrees by the which he descended,
and of al other things which in the wisdom of ye world made him seem so
embased and vanquished, he carried a wonderful victory which increased alwais
more and more. In ye first degree he was made man, that was the true and
eternal son of God. This step and wonderful humility albeit it is great:
yet he never abandoned his divinity, no, he could not loase it, and much less
diminishe it: by it his humanity was greatly exalted, being by the same mean
so connexed with the divinity, that one self person was GOD and man* if it
were possible yt God might gain in any thing, it might be said that he gained
in this, but having want of nothing, God has no necessity of any thing.
he gains not as a needy man: For, he has no necessity of any thing, and
much less can there be added to his greatness. But because the gain of men
is great in this, Heb. 1.
receiving a benefit which was never Communicated with Angels (for God never
took aliance nor seed of Aungelles but chused the Lineage of Abraham) we say
also that there was a gain and profit to God, being a true declaration of
his riches, and of his works which are comformable to him together with a
plain manifestation of his mercy. This victory against sin and the devil
is truly worthy of the person of the Son of God: Seeing that mankind which
was put to perdition by the suttletie of the Serpent, is redeemed and
redeliuered from the servitude of the Devil, and restored to an estate of
ability to be the Children of God, by the mean of this savior. The second
degree of this discending of the Lord, was in that he was condemned publykly as
a malefactor. In this descending there is a great want, and yet by it he
recovered a wonderful victory: For, being our brother he delivers us from
the eternal condemnation, so that all our liberty and absolution depend
upon his Condemnation: Our absolution depends upon the condemnation of Christ.
he has paid the debtes which he made not, even so those shall be discharged
which ought them. He was Condemned by the Sentence of men, and we absolved in
the judgment of God, having delivered us from ye curse of ye law which had
condemned us, The third degree was when he was judged to the Death of the
Cross: For, by his death he brake the forces of Death, dispoyling him of his
weapons wherewyth he had made so great and universal slaughters: For which
cause the Apostle demaundes of death where was his victory, and where were
become the means by the which he determined so many men?

By the fourth step or degree he was put into the Sepulcher, but the better
to comprehend the true sense of this passage, it is meet we make some judgment
and construction of things. The storye of the Gospel declares that our Lord
being dead, Joseph demanded of Pylate to take his body from the cross and
bury it, which Pylate suffered by the ordinance of God. And having taken it
from the cross, they wrapped it in a new Linen cloth, and laid it in a
Sepulcher where no man had yet lain. Lastly having embawmed him with the
oyntmentes which Nicodemus brought, they left the body in the grave, roulling
to the mouth thereof a great stoan: ( Mary Nagdalin and the other Mary
considering well in their understanding the said sepulcher.) All this serves
to two effects: the first is to render testimony of ye truth of the death of
Jesus Christ, showing also a great mystery comprehended under the grave: but
the Church comprehendes both the one and the other in one word, his Sepulcher:
and that he remained there three days expresses the truth of his death,
making by that mean his resurrection more evident. In this Article the
imbasement and humility of the son of God increases more and more, as also
his spirit and victory which he has obtained for us. For, it is said first
of all that he suffered the condemnation of Pilate, and was executed, and so
being dead, his body was buried. It seems that all these bring increase to the
victory of the devil, the world, and death: But of the contrary, it is our
victory that is enlarged. For, by how much nere does approach and is manifested
the death of our Lord, by so much more is at hand the end and ruin of our
death. Death is dead, and vanquished in such sort that he has no power against
us, and for such one we put him into the grave. Esaias has Prophesied that the
Lord should destroy death eternally, and dry up the tears of his people, and
take away the dishonor of the earth, in which words may be discerned the full
victory against death, which has no power to co^fou^d nor make sorrowful the
true Christian. It is not said by this that we shall not die, and not feel
death which is natural: but by this is expounded that the pricks and sorrows
of death are vanquished, and have no authority against a Christian, seeing that
for the exchange of this temporal life, he goes to the eternal life,
accompanied with the faith that he has had that Christ is his redemption and
his life. In this is performed the Prophecy of Ose speaking in the name of the
Lord, Oh death J will be thy death, Osee. 13. 1. Cor. 11.
the same agreeing with the Apostle, who assures us that our death is
vanquished by the passion of Jesus christ, and our sepulcher buried in his:
yea, our death has lost his forces which made him reign over us, and our
grave has lost his power and possibility to retain us still, seeing it cannot
now any more hold us in property or perpetuity, but as it were by deputation
and for a time. In this sepulcher of ye son of God is also contained ye
mystery of ye conjunction which we have with him by death and the grave: the
end of the death and burying of Jesus christ tending to this, that we die and
be buried with him. For, as the bands and forces of our death were broken by
the virtue of the death of him that killed death: even so by our death must be
vanquishe the stinges and pricks of that death that the merit of our sins
made due to us. This is the same which the holy Ghost speaks by the mouth of
the Apostle, We are buried with Christ in his death, to the end we participate
with his life, being impossible we should communicate with his life, if first
we have no action or society with his death, for that we can not have part
in the one, unless we accompany him in the other. And so the last degree
conteynes (as has been alredie declared) that he descended into Hell,
committed the Devil to spoil, and brake his Prysones for ever. Wherein
(according to the text of the Apostle) his victory increased and became great,
even by the same measure that he embased and humbled himself.

Thus much for the first part of our Article, and so let us descend to the
second part, wherein we confess that ye son of God roase again from death,
and the third day returned really and truly into life.

Touching the resurrection of Christ.
LIke as the four Evangelists have used great diligence to perticulate the
outrages, condemnation and death of the son of God, even so they have been no
less careful to set out point by point his restoring and resurrection.

According to the computation of the time used in the gospel, he died the
Friday at ix. a clock in the evening, and roase again the Sunday following in
ye morning, jointly whereunto we agree that he remained three days and three
nights in the grave, taking part of the Friday which was the day of the death
for the whole day: and the residue of the Sunday (being his resurrection) for
an other whole day. All which do serve manifestly to the proof and truth of
his death and restoring to life, being al foreordained and established in the
counsel of God.

Joseph demanded of Pilate his body to bury it: but Pilate desirous to know
whether he were dead in deed, sent for the same purpose a Centenier to
discover a truth, and then condiscended to Josephes request: yea, when they
came to take down the dead bodies from the cross, because they should not
remain there the next day, being the great feast of their Sabbath, they found
the two thieves on live, and our Lord dead. All which, with many other
approbations which may be alleged, together with some perticulers which we
mean to join to the sequel of these, are sufficient proves of his
resurrection.

Our Lord being thus put into the grave and embawmed, Soldiers were set to
guard the Sepulcher: And in the mean while his Disciples remained sorrowful
and heavy, having very little hope of his Resurreciton, and small knowledge of
the scriptures to the understanding of this mystery. They believed that their
master had preached the truth, and that he was most just in his works, and
that God had sent him: But touching the matter of resurrection, they were very
blind and doubtful.

After there was time enough performed for the proof, faith, and testimony
of his paineful death, and to establish the accomplishement of the mysteries
and prophesies. The Sunday morning, bringing with him the triumphs of hell and
death, he Roase again and returned to life, and to such a life that after
that, death had no more power over it, being defaced and deuested of all
means eftsoons to exercise his jurisdiction.

Imediatly after he was risen again, he appeared to his Disciples, to assure
them of the consolations given unto them before he dyed, and wythal to
accomplish the words spoken and promised by him, That he would rise again the
third day. The first person to whom he revealed himself after his
resurrection, was the virgin Mary his Moother, as who above all others lived in
most expectation for him, and he likewise bare unto her a most dear affection:
For, if we consider her by her faith, she had it more great then all the rest:
And if we have regard to Services, she merited with the best, having
nourished him and followed him with no small care, poverty, and perplexity
thirty three years. In her is expressed a good Testimony of his death: for
that standing at the foot of the Cross, where she felt the accomplishment of
ye prophecy of Simeon, that the sword of sorrow should pearce through her
intralles: she was chosen of the Father to serve in an estate of great
excelencie: even so was she accomplished with thoughts and actions meek for
the service of such a function. And albeit, both by her perseverance (being
greater then the rest that followed the Lord,) and that the trauelles of his
Death were of more Passion to her then to others, having more interest first of
that holy company to whom he disclosed his Resurrection: Yet the Evangelists
ascrybing nothing to the singularity of persons, leave all that aparte, and
recyte to whom he appeared with all such circumstances and proofs as serve
for Testimony against the People of the Jews. He appeared to Mary Mardaline
in form of a Gardener in the self same Gardeyne where he had been Buried.
He appeared to his Disciples the self same day in the place where they were
drawn together for fear of the Jews. He appeared to two Disciples which went
to Emaus. At the end of Eight days he appeared once again to his disciples,
S. Thomas being then present, who was absent the first time. Lastly he was
seen of his Disciples near the Sea of Gallile, there being yet besides these
so many other testimonies to confirm this truth, yt it were but superfluous
to ad more to ye authorite of these: Thus much for the narration of the History.

And like as the Resurrection of that Messiah was of great importance, so also
was it prefigured and foreshewed by the prophets that went before: For, Jonas
was thrown into the Sea, and swalowed of a Whale, and yet by the mercy of God
after he had remained three days and three nights in the belly of the Fish,
he came out safe and sound to accomplish the commandment of God. In this,
Jonas the Servant of the almighty was a figure of our savior: For, as he was
cast into the Sea to save from wrack all the others that were in the ship,
and that by the consent and determination of the Mariners: Even so our Lord
was past to condemnation by the council and resolution of men, and for their
safety thrown into the Sea of persecution of death: in such sort that the
earth received him as it does other dead bodies, reteining him three days and
three nights as a body dejected without life, and yet in the end ye power of
God raised him again, and drue him out of the grave having vanquished death.
Of this besides many other prophesies, David has written most manifestly,
speaking in ye person of our Lord as a man, and that by ye inspiration of the
holy Ghost: J always (says he) set before mine eyes the Lord, whom I have of my
right hand to keep me that J fall not: For this cause do J rejoice, and my
tongue shall bear Testimony of my contentment, Psalm. 15.
but specially for that my flesh shall rest in hope. For, Lord thou will not
leave my life in the grave, nor suffer thy holy one to see corruption. Thou
have showed me the way of life, even so shall thou fill me with pleasure by thy
presence: For, thou bear in thy right hand a perpetual bliss. In these
words the Lord shows the singular favor which he received of his father, in
ye death had not domination over him but was subdued and vanquished, showing
withal the gladsome contentment he had to see the eternal Father on his right
hand. In this hope he offered his body to the death, and dispersed it upon the
cross, and received the grave, being certain of his resurrection and victory,
and that as well touching himself, as also for all mankind: wherein declaring
also his confidence and joy of his victory, he says that his Father has not
suffered that his life should remain prisoner in the grave for ever, and much
less that his soul should be there deteyned, and not return eftsoons to be
reunited to his body. And lastly that his most holy body conceived by the holy
Ghost in ye womb of the Virgin, and who had passed so many Passions of
Torments for the Service and Obedience of his Father, should not suffer
corruption in the Grave, but before Nature could accomplish that operation,
his Soul should eftsoons receive coniuntion with his Body. The Prophet
says moreover that he has showed him the way to return to life: concluding
with action of thanks, that he has surmounted death and sin. The son of
God did not only obtain privilege to rise again, but also to him was joined
power to make his resurrection before there was any such sign of corruption in
his body as naturally appears on others that be dead: this respect was kept on
the behalf of his most holy person, and the flesh which he had taken for that
effect, being pure and wihtout any mark of sin. Besides all these, we may
consider upon the end of this Psalm a great mystery of the victory which
our Lord obtained against death, together with the assurance of our
resurrection, the same leaving us satisfied and certain that once again we
shall reenter into the possession of our bodies, after we have abandoned them
by the rigor of death.

With this Psalm S. Paul proves the resurrection of the Messiah against the
Jews, saying, that David was dead and buried whose Sepulcher was well enough
known amongst the Jews: concluding, that seeing the body of David had passed
by that corruption which is common and general to all dead men, it was not
possible that those words should be understood by him, and therefore what he
said, he meant it by Jesus Christ, whom neither hell nor the grave had power to
deteyne, and to whose flesh could be attributed no sense or suffrance of
corruption: So that David being a Prophet, and having received promise by oath
that the Messiah should descend of his seed, prophesied of his coming under
the form of words before recited. This is of great importance for Christians,
to whom it is a true approbation and sommarie of all the works which the Lord
did and of all our religion, together with an assured gage or pawn of all our
hope. Romans 1.
Saint Paul says that it is concluded and the resolution already set down
against the adversaries and unbelieving, that Jesus Christ is the son of God,
the same being proved in this that the father has raised him from the dead
with a great force and wonderful testimony, thereby to show that he was his
only son. Wherein on the one side might be seen the sentence of men, the
condemnation of the world, the reprobation of the people of the Jews, ye
injuries, outrages, and torments of the Cross and of death, which may allege
against the savior of the world that he was not the Son of God but an
abuser: Seeing he was condemned by so great personages, endured so many
afflictions, yea, fixed on the cross in such sort and such extremity, that
the miserable world might esteem him for such one as of long time had been
Prophesied: that is, that he was not reputed a man as others were, but as one
most abandoned of God and of all men. And on the other side might be seen the
holy Prophesies, works and words of our Savior, and his Doctrine expressing
the reason of his coming, and the misery of his death, together with the
sentence of his Father, who, to show himself true in his works and promises,
had raised him again from death, declaring that he was his true son. All
these things being of such importance were foretold by Jesus Christ before
his death, being willing to Prophecy and published his resurrection both to
his friends and to his enmies, to comfort the one, and convince the other: Yea,
he thought meet to manifest it to all, to make the world understand that he
was sent of the eternal Father to save the world, and that it was he that had been promised in the Law, offering himself to death of his only and proper
will. The Jews demanded of him some sign to know who he was, but he
answered that they should have no other sign but that of Jonas: For, as Jonas
issued out of the belly of the Whale the third day, So the third day after
his death he should eftsoons rise out of the center of the earth, having in
that action vanquished death. Math. 2^.


As he went once to Jerusalem, he told his Disciples that he should be
delivered into the hands of the gentiles: he comunicated the form of his
death, assuring them that the third day he should rise again. And speaking
with them a little before his death, he comforted them saying, that after his
resurrection he would go before them to Gallely: So that our confession by the
which we acknowledge our Lord to be risen again the third day, is confirmed
by good and great testimonies requisite in a thing of so high mystery and
importance, being also matter of no small consolation to the children of GOD,
together with assured testimonies that may be gathered against the wicked in
the Holy Scriptures and predictions which our Lord made before his death.

Certain Meditations and considerations upon the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
THe first consideration that the faithful christian may take of this
resurrection of Christ, dependes upon the mean we have already spoken of.
For, in his resurrection we may comprehend that which appertains to the
dignity of his person, to declare him such one as he is. By which he has
showed that he came to vanquishe and surmount sin and death, and to
pronounce, that as who so ever would follow him should live eternally, so to
such was reserved everlasting death as would not obey his word and doctrine.
For, in him says he is contained resurrection and life, yea and the Salvation
of those that believe in him.

To that to prove those things, and to assure consolation to all such as
should give faith to his words, it was requisite, that he should not only
manifest himself the author of life in raising others, but yt also he should
express it in his proper person, giving this testimony of himself, that
albeit he was dead, yet he had more power then death, for that he was able to
return to life. By this it appears that the resurrection of Christ, is a
true proof of his greatness, and a declaration that he is the Son of GOD,
has surmounted all travels and perplexities, has domination over death, and
overcome hell, sin, and the devil, seeinge he has disfurnished them of
their principal weapons, wherewith they did tirrannise over the Lineage of man,
which is death that followeisd. It also a proof, that as we honor serve and
believe in a man dead and crucified, so also we must obey, follow, and serve
in faith a man that has foretold his Resurrection, and which is risen again
from the dead, seeing that one of the reasons why he dyed was, the more to
declare his power, and manifest further his force and excellency of life
together with his power against the kingdom of satan.

In the Second consideration is enclosed a wonderful secret greatly auailing
the estate of mankind, it is divided into two parts according to the
testimony of the Scripture, whereof the one consistes in his death, and the
other in his resurrection. Touching his death, we have already debated that
in it was comprehended the death of our trauelles, the death of our death, the
mortification of our old Adam, and the spoil of the forces of the wicked
root of sin which reigned over us. And in his resurrection we say now is
comprehended the reestablishment of our life, the newnes of our justice, the
virtue and spiritual generation of the new Adam in us: the works of this
new life, the hope that this new people of GOD has to return to Heaven, and
finally the thoughts and operations agreeable to the majesty of GOD. Christ
was not sacrificed only for himself, but for us: he is not risen again only
to declare what he was, but with all to make himself such a one to us as his
Father might receive us: He is dead for our sins and risen again for our
iustificaiton: His death made to dye all wicked things but in his resurrection
were revived al good things.

In effect we have to consider touching the virtue of the mystery of the
resurrection, that he is also so risen again in us Spirituallie: that if it be
not long of our obstinacy and Rebellion we shall feel the force of his
Resurrection in us, that is, he will engender in us a power and will to do the
works worthy of a new life, and will make us to rise again to a newness of
life, by the which we shall be found agreeable before the face of God: And
being risen with him we shall vanquishe death and sin, and be made free from
the servitude of Satan, being affected to the commandments of God, lovers
of his justice, and zealous of his glory, to perticipate in the end with the
heavenly life by the communion which we have with the life of Jesus Christ in
thoughts and works: So that let all Christians understand, that if in
humility they search a remedy for their sins, opening with all the gate of
their heart, they shall find with in Jesus Christ raised again: And that
being in the company of so great a Lord living, who has vanquished death,
they can not have in them any dead thing: For, they shall also rise again
spiritually with the Lord into that newnes of life whereof we have spoken. Let
us therefore take heed to refuse the mortification of our wicked works, of
our disordered appetites, and our wicked affections: For, if we bow or bend
our selves we shall without doubt apperteyne to the other part of this
mystery, and rise again with Jesus Christ. In this sort is to be understood
the saying of the Apostle, That we are buried with Christ by Baptism and dead
to our sins, and to our old Adam. For that as Jesus Christ is risen again
from the dead for the glory of the Father: So we must enter into a newnes of
life, Rom 7.
being assured to keep him company in the Resurrection, if we accompany him
in his death: he dyed to make dye our sins, and lived agai^e to give life to
our justice, and therefore if behooues us to dye as touching our sins, and to
be diligent to do good works: whereunto let every good Christian refer all
his care and study, and raise al his thoughts, demanding al those things in
his prayers, and searching them neither more nor less then he would do a
precious treasure wherein lies hid al his felicity. The victory is already
gained, and the faithful are assured of their forces, for that the son of
God soliciteth for them, and holds al these benefits in his disposing. In him
we may be bold to repose our sewertye, seeing he has so much suffered for us:
and to make us communicate with these graces, his mercy will never fail us,
seeing he has not denied it us to get them: Sure, in respect they have cost
him so dear, and that the payment is already made, it will not be hard to give
them unto us.

In the third consideratcon of this article the good christian has to
understand, that in the resurrection of the lord, we get not only spiritual
resurrection as has been said, but also we have assurance of the resurrection
of our bodies. So that, considering that Jesus Christ is risen from the dead
for our wealth and profit, we may be assured that he is risen both in body and
soul, and that our resurrection is no less certain then his rising again,
being the assurance and gage of our resurrection, and he being in all things
our first borne and captain, he marched before us, and we must follow him. All
the wretchedness that the devil had caused, were repaired by the son of God:
for, as the devil threw spiritual death upon mankind, so in the virtue of
our savior that death is destroyed and vanquished, and a life spiritual given
unto men. The devil procured corporal death to man's race, (for death was
brought into the world by sin) but the son of God has joined to us a
corporal resurection. For, as death was introduced by a man, so by a man came
restitution and resurrection: we were all dead in Adam, even so are we al
revived and raised again in Jesus Christ. This accomplishment appertains to
the liberality of the dyuine majesty, which has reestablished and restored
us to the benefittes which he has already communicated to us: Our death is
vanquished on all parts, and on all sides our life is eftsons reestablished.
We are absolved and made free of all things, seeing we have on our side the
death and life of Jesus Christ: the sovereign bownty draws us from sin, the
sacrifice is offered, and we have obtained pardon for our iniquities: being but
poor and wretched slaves we are made rich, and have obtained liberty to be
the children of God. And if we loose this benefitte, it is either for some new
falt of ours, or that we will not cast or change our old skin. In effect,
in this Article is disclosed the great humility and mercy of the Son of GOD,
who refused not to go into the dark prisons of the Earth, to deliver the
Souls of the just there detained, and dispoile the Devil of all his force and
power, to the end that men may with more ease vanquish and surmount him. We
see also that after all this, he rose again the third day and returned into
true life, yea a life so excellent that death has no more power over it, nor
any possibility eftsoons to prejudice it. We have showed how this
resurrection has been sufficiently iustefied even by the places of Scripture
according to the testimonye of the creed That Christ rose again the third
day, according to the Scriptures, which seems to have been taken of the
Apostle. We have also declared how necessary was this resurrection, for the
approbation of the dignity of the person and doctrine of Christ, seeing that
in the same he is expressed the Son of GOD. We have also debated how it is
to be understood and practiced this great mystery, partly for the regard of
our Lord, and partly for the resurrection spiritual and corporal, which he
works in us by virtue of his restitution. There remains now to declare who
they be that practice the contents of this article in faith and works: and
who they be that satisfy it not. Such as profess and practice the substance
ot this Article as appertains, are those that persevere in the mortification
of their sins, their flesh, and their disordered suggestions of the old
Adam, that they reduce and bring him even to the grave, that is, that they make
a full and perfect victory of him, with a great remorse in themselves, and a
resolute hatred to all wicked and ill actions: returning by the same mean into
a newness of life, new desiers, and new operations and actions: Beeinge lastly
altogether conformable to that newenesse which the Son of God is wont to
co^municat with such as are risen again with him. Those be they that
accompany our Savior: For, as he is risen again to be never after made
subject to death: so the faithful risen again spiritually, feel themselves
so converted and out of taste of the works of sin, that the spiritual death
can not pearce so deep as their heart. And as our Lord rose again triumphing,
so shall they also have a glorious restitution, being repurged of all wicked
affections and enclyned to all good things, to whom the yoke of the gospel
shall seem easy and sweet, and shall travel in great thirste and appetite
to observe the comaundementes of GOD. Their charity shall inflame, their
patience prepared to suffer all pains and tribulations: they are glorified in
the glory of Jesus CHRIST, they have an honesty and purity of conscience,
they are chaste, they love their neighbor perfectly, and pardon with all their
heart such as do offend them. They retire themselves from the things of this
world, and abandon the pompes and ambitions of the same, as though they were
unapt thereunto, and had no minds affected to such transitory vanities. For,
they are made new men, restored and raised again by the Son of God, who
has triumphed both over death and all dead things: And so are they made his
that has raised them, to serve him with new fruits which their new life
bringes forth. They fear not to suffer death to maintain that which God has
ordained: they care neither for reproach nor hunger to defend justice and
truth: For their new life kepes them from smelling of those things which might
hinder their faith, perseverance, and constancy of heart in the train of the
gospel, and ioynes unto them a certainty of a better life which assures them
of all things.

Of the contrary, such as be estraunged from this practice have no other thing
but the simple name of those that are raised again. They are as painted
sepulchers set out to the show without, and within contain nothing but
rottennes and corruption: such were the Pharasies with whom they have only the
title of life and lively, and in effect are nothing else then dead, rotten, and
corrupt Reteyninge that stink and loathsomnes which is wont to be about
dead bodies. Such be many of our christians, who under this name, hyde a pride
and arrogancy which the devil teaches them, instructing them withal to be
covetous and impatient, the more to make them savor of their stink and
filthynesse. Lastly those be they that have not changed nor cast their skin,
and who being not mortefied, can not be raised again. For, resurrection
presupposes death, as there can be no death but there must first be a life,
wherewith I end the exposition of this article, yeeldinge thanks for all
things to GOD, whom I beseech to continue his people in that proportion of
faith which he thinks necessary to their salvation.

Certain testimonies of Pagan Authors serving to approve christian Religion:
written in form of a letter to a Noble man.
According to your request I have sent you here with my opinion, though not
so liberally as you looked for, yet with that faith and industry as may very
well serve to satisfy your conscience, and leave me ^^quited of my promis,
esteeming it to appertain to me to instruct you, seeing of your self you
express such desire to know and learn. And albeit the matter it self drawing
many circumstances, requires a long time: yet, where things are debated
faithfully, and the resolution accepted diligently, that that is long seems
not tedious, and though it be little yet it may be enough for instruction,
beseechinge you to way my reasons which I have not drawn out of dreams, but
written them out of the best resolutions and agreementes of my books.

The virtue of christian religion is so great, the miracles that have confirmed
it have been so public and evident, and the innocence and holiness of life of
such as have professed it, have bin so clear and manifest: that the very
enemies have bin driven to bear testimony with it, notwithstanding that they
impugned it with all their industry. Yea it is a thing wonderful, and serving
sufficiently to declare that our religion is guided by the hand of God, that
besides the large and great testimonies annexed to the gospel it self, yet the
adversaries bear with it such witness and authority to the dishonor of
satan and his errors, that by their own confessions we see, that the cause
why they remain in their hardness of heart without receiving the light and way
that leads to eternal life, has proceeded of their sins and blindness, making
them subject to the subtle suggestions and pollecies of the devil: wherein for
a proof, I shall not so much need to infer authorities of scripture and old
christian authors (who notwithstanding are sufficient to verify and confirm
our faith) as to take to my aid the weapons of our enemies, to the end that
by the testimony of their proper consciences. we may remain absolved, and
they condemned.

The first testimony I will produce shall be Tertulian a writer in the time of
the primative church, a man of great knowledge maintayning the cause of the
Christians against the Pagans, and pleading and writing publykely on the
christians side. And having (as it were) but sipped and tasted of christianity
He had more fully surfeyted of the Pagan faith to whom he bare a resolute
zeal: he was in the times of the Emperors Seuerus and Caracalla, being about
two hundred three score and ten years after the death of Christ. All the
arguments which he infers against the Pagans, he deriueth from their proper
historyes, and of things that were done in that time, showing the reason why
Christ was not worshipped at Rome. The Romans had this custom, not to
Canonize any new God (although the Emperor would have it so) without the
approbation and consent of the Senate, the same well appearinge in all the
Roman Edictes and histories, wherein is defended to receive any Strange GOD
without the authority of the Senate, and that by reason of the great
inconuenyences happening by the liberty that every one took to patronise
himself with one GOD a part, as may be seen in the times of the Bachanales
and other seasons.

It happened that Pilat who had given sentence of death against Christ,
notwithstanding he was stubburne in his opinion, yet being convinced both by
his conscience, and the certainty he had of the restitution of him whom he had
condemned to death: Advertised Tiberius the Emperor of all that had passed,
touching the death and resurrection of our Lord. The Emperor, observing with
this report, the opinions and great renoune that went of his passion, wrote to
the Senate, that it were good to canonize Jesus Christ for a God: But the
Senate, whether it was for that they were not called to the first consult of
this matter: or that they would not make things so easy to the Emperor,
specially in a case of so great importance, fearing it would grow to example
and consequence, held opinion contrary to the Emperor, and would not suffer
that CHRIST should be worshipped as GOD. Whereupon the Emperor published an
Edicte against such as would accuse christians, the devil having then
stirred up the Jews and Gentilles to persecute those that had received the
gospel, by which it came to pass that in the time of Tiberius the christian
church was somewhat in rest the gospel fructifiinge greatly amongst the
gentiles. Thus much for Tertulian, who durst not have written so in his time,
if things had passed otherwise: For, then was Rome in her estate, and
statutes of the Senate were diligently preserved by registers, where unto
Tertulian sendes the gentiles, referringe them to their proper acts and
ordinances, wherein they may find that the first persecution against the
christians was in the reign of Nero: In all these are ministered many things
of consideration, declaring that the affairs of the gospel have been managed
by a special providence of God: For first, GOD so wrought that Poncius Pilate
who had passed CHRIST to execution, bare witness to his Father of the
greatness of him whom he had condemned: Secondly the laws of the Senate and
contention that was between the Emperor and the magistrates, make good faith
and proof, that the refusing to canonize christ at Rome, was not by any
default that was found in him, but by reason of the vain ordinances observed
there, by the liberty of which they had power to accept for GODS such as they
would, and reiecte whom they held not acceptable. Besides, the great
providence of GOD is known in this, that the divinity of Jesus Christ being
sufficiently iustefied as well by his works as by his holy doctrine, yea by the
testymonyes of his enemies: yet he would not suffer him to receive this
dishonor to be accepted of the people of Rome for god, and much less to be
compared and placed amongst their false gods whom they worshipped, he which
was true God, and had preached that there was but one God, and that al others
were nothing else but abusers and spirits of the Devil. This providence also
showed it self great in this, that albeit the Emperor was no christian, yet
he forbad upon great pains to trouble, persecute, or to accuse the
christians: the same being the cause that the gospel was published in his
first age, and that the gentilles and Pagans gave ear to it: to the end that
when the great persecutions should happen, the church might be found to have
some foundation, and certain troops of christians united by the holy word of
the gospel. And therefore we have to conclude, that all these things and
accidents have been guided and governed by the wisdom of God, seeing they
serve to the approbation of so high a mystery. For our second testimony we
will use Plutarke, a Pagan borne and of no small authority amongst them, and
at no time well disposed to the christians. He thinking to set down a reason
why the Oracles of the gentilles had taken end, aledging many things
according to his blindness, and without any knowledge in the affairs of God,
recites an history by the relation of a friend of his of no small authority
and knowledge as is suggested. To this was referred so much the more stabilitie
of faith and credit, by how much he makes it to happen in his time.

He says that sailing into Italy, and being in a ship accompanied with his
said friend and many others, about the evening they fell with the coast of
certain Islands now called Cuzolares confining upon Italy, There the wind
failed them, and by that necessity were driven to go on shore in one of those
Islands called Paff(...)e. Before the mariners had supped (the Sea being at a
soft and still calm) they hard a voice coming out of the Island which called
one of the patrons of their ships, being an Egiptian, and had to name Tamus:
which was unknown to many of the company, suffisinge to see him a Captain and
Governor amongst them. This voice calling him three times, he answered but to
the third, as king what it would: to whom the voice replied aloude in these
words. O Tamus when thou shall ariue at Salus (nere to the Jle of Corfu) tell
them that their great God Pan is dead. All the Navy fell into great fear and
trouble of mind with the sound of the voice, and consulting what was to be
done, Tamus to whom was committed the confidence of the message, resolved, that
if the wind served, he would pass by the place assigned by the voice without
saying any thing, giving no other credit to it then as a vision or illuding
suggestion, but if the wind sailed, then he promised to perform the
imbassage. According to which resolution, the wind abating, he was driven to
rest at anchor even in the same place. Tamus standinge upon the vppermoste
hatches of the ship, began to erye with a loud voice The great God pan is
dead. He had no sooner ended his speech, but there were heard general
lamentations, sighs, sorrows, skrikinges, with strange and wonderful
voices, and that in marvelous multitudes. This accident was forthwith carried to
the knowledge of Tyberius the Emperor, who raised all possible diligence to
understand what might that GOD Pan be that they said was dead, wherein the
wisemen and wysardes of that time, answered him according to their
superstitions and vain conjectures. This Pan was a God which the gentiles
worshipped, there being many other Gods of that name. And this happened about
the time of the passion of Christ, as may be gathered by the years of the
reign of Tyberius the Emperor. In deed Pan in greek signifies, al.
Whereupon many do gather that all this was spoken of the death of Jesus Christ,
true God and lord over al things. But because the gentiles held Pan for a God,
there is good congruency to take the death of this Pan for the spiritual death
of the Prince of deuilles, for the destruction of his kingdom, and the ruin of
his errors by the which he has kept in captivity all mankind. To this are
conformable the noise and voices of the spirits complayninge and lamentinge
the ruin of their Prince and his spiritual death, being now made naked of the
strength and forces wherewith he oppressed and vexed mankind. The same author
affirms that about the same time one Demetrius passing by the yles Orcades
near to England, was told that not long since, there was heard great
whispering and howlings in the air, and many fearful things seen, the wise
men of those Islands construing those prodigious things to ye death of some
great god, which opinion has some reference with the judgments of ye other
woonders. But these strange sights and significatio^s in the world, interpret
in true testimony and judgment the strangnes of the death of our souiour Jesus
christ, and of the victories which he has obtained, together with his
triumphant glory.

The third testimony we may draw from Traian the Emperor, a Prince Pagan, and
albeit much resolved into pagancy and a great persecutor of the christians: yet
so qualified by the truth of the gospel, that he was constrained to moderate
his cruelty, though not so much as he ought, yet so far as ministered ease to
the godly. Plinius Secundus established his deputy in Asia against the
christians, aduertiseth the Emperor that he found no other ill in the
christians, but yt they made certain assemblies, not to erect any Monopoly,
nor to commit theft, nor to use ribaldrie, nor practice deceit, not to desire
the goods of others, nor to execute any vylanus act: only the cause that they
assembled together, was to communicate in common and necessary actions: as to
eat and drink together offering no hurt or prejudice to any That which he
found most wicked and ill in them was, yt they were adicted to a certain
superstiton, not declaring it, and so concluded that there was no ill in them.
This was in the beginning of our christian religion, and yet in that time the
professors of it were bitterly persecuted. But notwithsta^dinge they were
accused and suffered imposition of great Crimes, yet when they came to the
trial and proof (no small matter amongst people Pagans) they were holden so
guiltles, that even their ennemies gave testimony of their innocence (the
Devil notwithstanding keeping them so blind, that they had no judgment of
that which they did, nor understood what they pursued, and much less knew what
they were whom they caused to die so cruelly.) Pliny found the^ not culpable
in any thing except a certain superstition, and yet without an appearance of il:
he esteemed it superstition to believe that one man dead on the cross was the
savior of all men, not considering further ye grounds of this religion. The
assemblies they made were chiefly to celebrate the sacrament of the supper,
which contained a greater mystery then Pliny could find out. But the Emperor
having this advertisement from his deputy, forbad any more to enquire against
christians, willing notwtstanding yt such of them as were attainted and
convinced, should be punished and corrected. Tertulian deriding this edict,
exclaimes against it saying: oh ordenance confused and foolish: he forbids
inquisition because they be innocent, and yet leaves liberty to chastise them
as offenders, in one instant he pardonith, and yet he is cruel: he confesses
innnocencie, and yet dissembleth it: if he will punish them, why defendes he
information against them? And if he will not have them enquired upon, why does
he not absolve them? There are established in every Province prouostes to
apprehende and imprison thieves and robbers: and every one has liberty to kill
a public enemy, and to execute such as the law has convict of treason: But
alone touching the christians, it is not suffered that they be cifted as
offenders, and yet is it lawefull that every one accuse them, as though they
be things different to cut of any one as an offendour, or to present him as
a malefactor: Wherein this Edicte suffers this contraryetie, denyinge
information and inquiry against the christians, and yet leaves liberty to
punish them if they be found guilty. For, if no man inform against a
christian, how shall he be found guilty? And in case of information, what
mean is there to accuse him, and so consequently to punnishe him not findinge
him culpable of any thing. So that the Emperor would that they were punished
not as culpable, but only for that they were Christians. In all which as may be
discerned the testimony which the first Christians had of their proper
enemies, together with the simplycitie of the statutes by whose mean they
were persecuted: Even so in all these things is matter tending to the aduowing
and justification of our iueice.

The Fourth testimony we may draw out of the doings of Adrian, a Prince Pagan
and dieng in the same superstition. Who, upon the view and consideration of
certain inhihitions delivered to him in writing by Quadratus a Disciple of the
Apostles, and Aristides a Philosopher converted to christianity, dispatched
commissioners to his proconsull of Asia, enioyning him not to molest the
christians, for that they are and bear the name of christians. He had not sure
erected this Edict, had he not been well informed of the innocence and justice
of such as followed christian religion, and had some taste by the doctrine of
Quadratus and Aristides of the reasons appertaining to the mystery of the
gospel. For he devised to build Temples dedicated to the service and
woorshipping of Christ, wherein his counsel restrained him, alleadginge that
in that example would be general conversion to christianity. In this may be
discerned the conscience of his councillors, who stood upon no other
impediments, but a certain fear that by yt mean the multitude would come to
ye knowledge of ye truth. Those temples that he did build were not subect to
idolatry, neither would he suffer customs of superstition, being for those
respects called the temples of Adrian.

Marcus Antonius Aurelius, declared in favor of the christians, that they
worshipped the immortal God: he gave liberty to whom would be a christian, and
forbad expressly that they should be molested.

The Emperor Alexander Seuerus published a law in grace of the christians,
that they should not be persecuted, and much less restrained to use public
conference and action of their religion: he had hanging in his Oratorie the
Image of a Crucifix, and devised to build a Temple wherein Christ should be
worshipped, but he suffered many impedimentes that drew him from it. All this
was wrought by Gods providence, foreseeing that the Savior of the world
should not be put amongst other false Gods. This Prince in all his devises and
speeches had great familiarity with this principal point of christian
discipline. Not to do to an other that which he would not have done to himself:
wherein was good declaration that his conscience could not deny that truth
which those men professed that were persecuted of the world.

Valerius Maximus the Emperor was a great vexer of the christians, yet the
truth of the gospel, and the chastisementes of God which he had bitterly felt,
made him oftentimes revoke the straight and seueare Edictes which he had
ordained against the christians, giuinge liberty to who would profess the
state and opinion of christianity, and they not to be vexed by any
persecutions. All these men and great Princes were sworn ennemies to the
religion, and died in their ignorance and blindness, whose testimonies are of no
small effect against the ennemies of Christ. For, when they ceased to vex and
persecute the church, and bear favor to the christians, it proceeded of none
other motion the^ of the puretie of religion, and of the justice and innocencye
of those that professed it, together with their constancy in all acts of
virtue, bearing withal a settled hatred to all vices: They saw also the sundry
maruelles and prodigious things which were don daily for the reformation of
that doctrine, and felt the anger of GOD and his chastisementes thundered upon
such as persecuted the church. So that it seems that in those things was a
spirit enforcinge those mighty Princes to testify for that doctrine and bear
favor to it, to the end that on all sides error and falsehoode might be
driven away, as being not hable to remain where the light of the gospel
should dispearse his beams. In that time when the gospel began to be planted
and sown, and that the name of a christian was so dearly sold to him that
bare it: the providence of God raised a mean to remove the cross from the
church, to the end she were not so oppressed with persecutions, as not to
have leisure to recover breath and eftsoon take fresh courage. This respitte
was given by the means to have conversation with the Pagans, and yet remained
from the Emperor Tiberius until Nero, who was the first that persecuted the
primative church: yea this persecution brought great slaughter to the
christians, even to the principalles of the church, and Christ's Disciples,
having brought to perfection their race and course, and accomplished all those
things that appertained to their time, and for the which they had been
myraculously preserved. The Emperor Domitian continued this affliction, and by
him notwythstandinge the goodness of GOD wroughte a mean to cease and remove
all those torments, for that by the hate which Domitian boar to the doings
of his predecessor Nero, he with the Senate brake all the statutes and
ordenances of Nero: By which was ministered to the church good opportunity to
reenter into comfort and courage, bringinge some rest to the gospel, the
better to have it communicated in some sewertie, and to plant it with greater
power: So that in good view and consideration of these affairs and actions,
we may discern in these discourses of the christian church, a wonderful
favor and providence of GOD, seekinge on the one side to prove and examine his
church by a rigorous cross, shewinge her the traces and steps of her
Savior, to the end to follow him: and on the other side, he exhibited a
Fatherly love and incomprehensible providence, making her truly to se, that
neither the fury of the kingdom of Satan, nor the rage of his ministers, are
sufficient to supplant and root it out of the world: yea having on her part
the infinitte power of GOD, she shall stand eternally, and yet the world not
know the mean how she is preserved. By this mean also may be discerned how
readily and fervently the ire of GOD is kindled against the adversaries of the
gospel, seeinge that all the Roman Emperors which persecuted it, suffered
wicked and monstrous ends: As of the contrary, such as were moderate and
temperate, found favor with GOD, and were less punnished of the world,
laying them in comparison with Nero, Domitian and such other like Princes whom
the Devil held in his devotion to persecute the church. By these meaness the
Prymatiue church was mayntained sometimes in one estate, sometimes in an
other, until the reign of Julian the Apostat, who being a christian in his
beginning, was seduced by Libinius Sofista his schoolmaister to abandon
Christian faith, and restore Paganry, together with the sacrifices and
superstitions which had been abolished by the light of the gospel. By these
it is wonderful to see how christian faith increased, seeinge the
impedimentes of persecution that were raised against it: But much more are to
be woondered at the respytes, succors, and comfortes which even her proper
enemies ministered unto her, as well appears no less by the relation of
those mighty Princes and Emperors before declared, then also by the
persecution of this Julian, in whom Gods providence wrought no less benefitte
and favor then in any of the rest: seeing that notwithstanding this Prince
persecuted the church with greater art and hate then any of his predecessors:
yet God forbear not to raise her into an estate of great spiritual
prosperity, this tirant seeing as well in his life as his death, evident
tokens that God was his enemy. For, even in his time the gospel was preached
and received by the greatest part of the world, by which, the wisdom and
goodness of God disclosed manifestly, that that which floated and flourished in
despite of the industry, cruelty and power of the world, was come from
Heaven, from whence was ministered unto it all favor, succor and aid.

The Original of tirrannie and Idolattie, together with the punishments of
tirantes and Idolators: how Abraham was chosen chief of the Hebrews.
YOur letter, no less full of modesty and sweetness, then replenished with
doctrine and judgment, bringes no small delight to me, for that to your deep
science already in things, I find remeyning a zealous desire yet to know
more: wherein I can not but account it to belong to my office, to add to your
zeal and travel, my faith and diligence, though not able to teach you
further, yet, as touching the request of your letter, to show my opinion,
leaving it to be controlled by that favor and wisdom where with you are
wont to measure and judge the errors of your friends. But touching the
matter, as you have to remember that out of the race of Cain, issued Nembroth
the great tirant: Who, by his ambition and pride subdued all men and Nations of
his time, enforcing them to live under his tribute and customs: So, there is
no doubt but these tirranous spirittes are most hurtful to the world, and by
the Scriptue reputed as ennemies of God: For, their desire to hear rule, makes
them break all order of justice, bearing no regard to laws nor ordinances:
Yea, in respect to increase and maintain their principallitie, they give
suffra^ce to all men to be insolent, with liberty to commit disordered
actions. In ye time of Nembroth were many possessed with this wicked spirit of
pride and ambition, who assemblinge together conspired to build a tower of
incomparable rate of height and measure, to the end to perpetuat their name
and reputation amongst men. But God, beholding their arrogant intentions and
willing to manifest the wickedness of that tyranny, and presumption of that
pride breeding so many miseries and evils, let fall his anger upon them,
confounding in such sort the Tongs of the builders and workmen, that one
understood not an other, since they all spoke unknown and strange Languages.
Before the foundation of the Tower of Babylon, there was but one language in all
the world, God then inflicting upon the earth a wonderful punishment by the
confusion and diversity of speeches. But thus it happened that the first men
having lived but under the use and knowledge of one tongue, and now being in
confused and divided into many, dispersed themselves through the world, by
whose posterities have been continued all those diversities of languages that
now reign. This division of tongues was the cause that the Tower of Babylon
was not ended, by which occasion also, the Princes of the earth leaving their
tyranie, were driven to search new cou^treyes to inhabit every, one following
his language as an ensign sunder the which they might plant and multiply. By
this division of men and Countries, people fell into so great erors, that
forgetting the doctrine of God, Idolatri took his beginnig of infideliti.
together with the promises he had made to men, the most part of the world
became Idolators, declining to such superstitions as the devil invented daily
to advance his purposes. So that Idolatry took his beginning of infidelity,
and the wicked inclinations of men, deliting leave the right way and to follow
that that leads to perdition. To this was much helping the forgetfulness of
the truth, and the negligence of men caring not to follow religion and doctrine
and much less to teach it to others. An other original or fountain springes
of the love of our selves, called Selfeloue, together with an insaciable will
which men have to put themselves in liberty, inducing them faithfully to
search a thousand ways for their satisfaction, and by some mean to invent
abominable Superstitions, whereunto the devil is so ready to minister
assistance wythall the art and favor he can, that poor sinners, to make them
the more hardened and desperate, fixing upon certain faulse and deceitful
experiences, attribute in the end, dignity to any thing of the which
(according to their conjecture) they had received aid or answer. In other
places, they have a certain fear in their consciences which restraines them
to demand of God the things which themselves esteem to be wicked and
dishonest. By that it comes to pass, that they are pleased with the service of
these faulse gods, who care not but only to be served as gods, without
regarding whether the men be just or vnrightful. For seeing these dissembled
Gods be devils, in deed, and passible to all actions and councels of devils,
they are of common congruency, enemies of justice, and friends to wickedness,
those be the preparations that the devil finds in the hearts of such as he has
enchaunted, abusing them with persuasion that there is a god of battles, and
another of robberies, a God of drunkenes and another of whordome, all these
Gods being most delyted with such as most are given to dishonest acts,
infidelity also (the root of al sins) was one cause why those miserable
people were ignorant of the greatness and power of god: yea, they could not be
brought to believe that one God was sufficient to furnish perticulerly al
things necessary to the use of men and service of the world, of this came the
plurality of gods, men believing that they were restrained to precinct and
limit, and that every god had his particular estate to govern: Of which sprang
the first Idolatry, for some worshipped the Sun, with many other triffling
and dishonest things, and others did worship to deuilles which abused them by
illusions and oracles, yea sometimes by certain aparances of remedies tending
notwithstanding to their ruin. This blindness was suffered by the justice of
god to punish such as leaving the light, run after darkness, making themselves
judges of their proper affections, and ruled their hearts according to ye same
how good or evil so ever they were: in which respect god willing to punish
those vices and excesses, suffered the devil to raise faulse signs and
miracles, even to advance the destruction of such as fell into spoil by their
infidelity and multitude of their transgressions.

And albeit Idolatry was great before the flud, and that the world pursued
always his first corruption, being stirred up by the Devil who induced men
to a forgetfulness of God: Yet, the mercy of God who had not forgotten his
Promises made to mankind, so provided for the effect of his Promise, that he
chused a People particular to reestablish with him the truth of his Promises
and alliaunces: To them he gave a perfect light to guide them against those
Darkness and obstinacies which the Devil raised against them, he established
laws and ordinances touching the Service of Religion, with express
Commandment that they observe them, and be attentive to the word of God the
better to arm them against the suttleties, suggestions, and illusions of the
devil. So that there is (no dout) but this people was chosen to be a grain
wherein should be preserved the purity of the seed of the doctrine and ye
assurance of ye mercy of god, serving withal to declare how wonderful God is
in his works and to remain as a mirror to all nations to serve and honor but
one God, confounding al other Gods, as faulse and of the devil. In effect God
saw good to continue the root and stock of his truth to his people whom he
had chosen, to the end the world might know that he drue to him his people by
other means then did the devil, with whom it has been always familiar to lay
snares and subtle traps to entice the frayltie of men. Abraham chosen chief of
the people of God.
Over this people of god Abraham was chosen chief and leader, as before him
were appointed Seth and Noe. But Abraham being a Chalde, and living amongst an
Idolatrous Nation, God saw good to make a choice of him and call him to
himself, commanding him to abandon his country and kindred, and go whether
he would guide him, promising to make him great, yea, even a mighty ruler over
a large people. All this conteynes as yet nothing but mysteries of the divine
wisdom and of works of justice and mercy. For first, God chused for
chieftayne of his people, a man who may serve for example to all posterities
succeeding him, for Faith, Love, Obedience, Truth, Justice, Patience, Charity,
knowledge of Sin, and lastly for all, whatsoever may concern the Honor and
glory of God, and his Service. He was called of God to Serve as an example to
his new People, and all others, and in whom God would express with what
favor, support, and aid, he follows those that serve and honor him. To him
all Princes and principal guides of people, ought to confyrme and refer
their councels and actions, for God loves such as he as he was. But now to
return to Abraham. God commanded him to forsake his country and the
Religion of the Chaldees: Wherein first of all he showed how hateful that
people was to him for renouncing his word, yea the more fully to Punish them,
he took from them the Company of a Personage which had knowledge of this
Divinity and frueth of his word. This is it that the Prophet means saying,
We have Ministered Medicines to Babylon and yet she has received no Cure, and
after we have abandoned her every one. etc. Euenso the obstinacy of the
Chaldees against the Doctrine of Abraham deserved to be forsaken as a thing
abandoned of the Physicians.

Secondly it may be said that Abraham was withdrawn from his Country, for
that for the most part God bears unto his such proportion of favor, that he
withdrawes them from il companies, and consequently from the punishments and
corrections which he holds ready to thunder upon the heads of the wicked. By
that mean he drue Lot out of Sodom, and preserved Helias in the time of
famine, showing in them the great care and special providence he has over
those that serve him. Thirdly in this euocation of Abraham is taught how
needeful it is to such as seek to be of the number of Gods People, to be
divided and drawn from vices, and that they fix not upon the abuses of this
world, seeing they ought to be a People separate, and Subject to no Community
or traffyke with Sinners, and Idolators. For that cause the Scripture calls
the Children of God Banished and separate from all men. Esaias also Exhorts the
Faithful to retire from the Company of the wicked, but specialsy such as are
Gods Servants and Sacrifycators, ordeyued to accomplish the Statutes and
Commandments of God. Abraham issued out of the Region of the Chaldees upon
the assurance of Gods Promises to make him a guide and leader of a mighty
people, and wythall to purchase such renoume and favor, that who blessed that
people should be blessed, and who accursed them should partake with the same,
and that out of his seed should issue he that should bring felicity and
blessing to all the nations and kinreds of the earth. This promise is a
reviving of that which had been made to Adam and Heua, whereof the certayntie
seems to be so much the more great, by how much God assigns the Seed out
of the which should issue the Messiah and Savior of the World. By this may be
considered the great reward that such may hope for as follow the Lord being
called to the obedience of his Commandments, and are withdrawn from the
delights and vanities of the world to follow bitter things, and of hard
disgestion. For as God shows the favor he bears them choosing them for his
service and aduaunsing them aaboue all others: So does he also express the
particular care he has over his chosen, whom if he advance on one behalf, he
does also priueleadge on an other. But notwithstanding all those promises,
Abraham forbear not to endure much, and to bear his Cross with much trouble,
following always the eternal will to show that the bounty and justice of God
are pefect in all his works. And albeit he lived in great perplexity and
poverty and suffered many tribulations and persecutions, yet God delivered
him, and made him prosper that he was rich, mighty and victorious over his
enemies. This is the true Image of the way of God and truth, and to it God
calls us with milk and delytes, as nursses use to entice little Children, to
the end we know that all his ways are founded upon mercy and truth, and
that he is upright in his word to the just, leaving us to follow him by that
way, and obey him as knowing his will to be ready inclined to our health and
benefit the same being the true end and purpose for the which he has chosen
us to serve his turn of us. Persecutions are necessary for our felicities.
Touching the cross and persecution which Abraham suffered, they wear
necessary to his felicity. For God uses to prove our faith, to show by
effect what love we bear him, and what patience and Charity we have,
showing wythall how much the world is our enemy, declaring it self for such
one in all his actions, and that God only has created and redeemed us, and
only ministers all favor to us, to the end we should call him to our aid
in our necessities, and confess him, whereby the remorce and feeling we have
of his mercy may inflame us to yield him thanks. And that our faith being
tried by the fire of tribulation and temptation, the virtue of our patience may
increase and our hope grow stronger daily to resist Sin and the World,
under Assurance and Confydence of the Bowntie of God.

So that Abraham a man just was led in these Accidents sometimes in glory,
and sometimes in tribulation: by the Contemplation of whose life, all
Christians may know how God handles his chosen, and of what Condition he will
choose them, and with what courage he will have them learn to worship him.
Abraham issuing out of the Land of the Chaldees, Led with him Sara his Wife
and Loath his Nephewe, together with all their Family that was in Haram
Instructed in the truth of GOD according to the Revelations that had been
made to their Predecessors. And from thence he went into the Region of Chanaan
following the ordinance of God. The Chananites wear Idolators, and a Nation
more Dedicated to Vices then any Clymatte of the world. By which means
Abraham leaving one Country whose People wear nothing worth, was led into
an other where the Inhabytauntes were worsse, and all this by the will and
ordinance of GOD, whose Mercy does in such sort Dispose his Actions, that
what he takes from some by Justice, he geeues to others by his mercy: In
such sort that the End of his Woorks is always good, although the wisdom
of the world esteem it contrary.

This was one Singular ill amongst other Wicked things which the Chaldees
had, that beeinge Blyssed with the Presence and Industrye of a Virtuous
Personage, Preachinge and Teachinge them the Truethe: yet they made no account
of his Doctrine, but despised him and his aduertisementes. And therefore God
deprived them of that benefit whereof they had made themselves unworthy by
the resistaunce which they showed against his word.

Touching the Cananits as they were the most wicked race of the World, so they
had not as yet the knowledge of the truth: In which respect it pleased the
goodness of God to Communicate it to them by the mean of Abraham, whom he
led into their Country: which benefit turned afterward to their great
condemnation, by reason of their reuoltes, stubburnesse, and obstinacy, by the
which they provoked the Ire of God against them. Of the contrary the faith and
patience of Abraham was well proved amongst this rebellious people the more to
make him seek his succors in God, who had drawn him out of the Land of the
Chaldees.

God had determined to give the Land of Chanaan to the people whom he had
chosen in his presence, showing the greatness of his mercy toward such as
follow him, to whom he gives Land and Heritage. And of the contrary, to show
his Ire against sinners by the Punishment which he made of the Chananits and
other nations possessing the said Land. For this cause he willed that Abraham
after the passion of many tribulations should dye in that Land, to confyrme to
him his promise, and to impatronize him of that Region for and in the name of
such as should descend of him. And long time after, yea, when it was
impossible to men to occupy that Land, he gave that inheritance to the
Children of Israel, to show that he was just and that his Promises were
certain. So that Abraham being at Sichem a Town of Chanaan, God appeared to
him and Promised to give the said Land to his seed. There Abraham builded an
Altar and did Sacrifyce, calling upon the name of the Lord: There he endured
great Tribulations, in which was established assured testimony of his faith and
patience: and on the otherside the Lords goodness was with him, delivering him
of his troubles, and communicated that which should happen to his people,
reviving the alliance made with him: he assured him that in his seed all
nations should receive blissing, and promised that he should have a son by
Sara his wife being already aged. Thus the family of Abraham multiplied from
one day to an other, which he governed by the preaching of the word, and all to
entertain them in the observation of Gods commandments and in his fear: The
Lord then made alliance with him as well in his own name as for his successors,
containing these capitulations. First that Abraham and his, for following his
truth and the obedience of the same, should be his people, and he would be
their GOD. That the seed of Abraham should serve him and reappose their hope
in his promises made to them. That they keep the Laws which he calls
Justice, which he had given them. Lastly that he would be their GOD, and
protect and defend them in this world, and instruct them in the way to obtain
the life of the other world, pardoning all their sins in favor and
consideration of him which had been promised for the redemption of man kind,
and ordained to surmount the forces of hell, and conquer the Devil. In sign
whereof he ordained that Abraham should be circumcised together with all the
male children discending of him and his whole family, the same serving as a
monument and perpetual memory of the alliance made between GOD and them, and
of the spiritual generation of the seed of Abraham, whom GOD adopted for his
children in the name of him that was promised, by mean of which adoption this
spiritual people should be a continual enemy to the old Serpent and his
works. From that time the people of GOD more observed outward ceremonies then
they had done. For, besides the sacrifices which they made, they adjoined
circumcision, the same serving them as a mark to declare outwardly the
profession of their Religion, and that they should worship the only God which
had given creation, and had promised redemption of their sins.

The Author answers a congratulotion sent to him upon the gift of a
Bishoppricke.
I Have received your Letter, and do refuse the horse you sent me, not for
that he is unworthy, but because I am curious. reserving such as you are to
give me good counsel, and my other more welthy friends to minister to my
wantes: In adversities rich men must give remedy, and wise men minister
comfort.
For that adversity is truly used which expects his remedy of richmen, and his
consolation from such as are wise. And being in the pension of the Prince for
so many offices, and now raised to the commidities of a large Bishoppricke, I
see not how I can suffer want, nor my friends to wish me more, since to him
that is already satisfied there remaynes no necessity of further providence.
The wiseman is contented and expresses no want, but the mind of the foolish is
subject to care and thoughts never being satisfied though he flow in
fullness, Living in the flesh it is hard to suffice the desiers of the flesh.
so that his abundance breeds his extreme poverty and misery. That man
needs little that measures his fill according to the need of kind and not
after the rage of covetous. For, the nature of man desires little, but our
opinion is never satisfied, yea living in the flesh. It is hard to suffice the
desires of the flesh. It is no small perplexity to a poor man to ask that he
wants, but it is a great pain to the rich man to keep that which he has
too much, seeing to gather riches the rich man is all alone, but to disperse
them he has too much company. This is one other accident that fortune bringes
with it, that who rises a foot in authority, increases most commonly an
elne in necessity, for that now a days our chiefest travail rests not so
much to furnish our house, as to entertain and feed our pompes. And albeit
every one is bound to procure that is necessary for him, yet withal he ought
to take heed not to affect or aspire to superfluity: seeing if poverty prove
the patience of a good man, abundance carries light spirits into vain glory
and presumpcion: Yea, many there are who if they had not fullness of wealth,
they would not with such swiftness follow vice and sin, Riches are ready
instruments to vanity.
for that riches are ready instruments to vanity and apt cloakes to cover
foul actions. I allow not for all this, that men should be negligent to
provide things necessary for the use of this life, seeing the needy man can
never have too great contentment. The needy man can neues have to great
contentment.
But great is Gods goodness to that man to whom he has given acompotent
hauiour, enough to keep him from shameful poverty: neither suffering want for
the necessary supply of his life, nor yet wallowing in that abundance that
may lead him to his destruction.

I am told Sir, of the great pleasure you take, and the many rewards you have
given to the messenger that brought you the news of my election to a
Bishoppricke: Wherein I esteem your liberallitie much, but consent no whit to
the joy and gladness you feel. For that, if you knew as well as I what charge
lies upon the government of souls, you would be more sorry for my
insufficencie, then glad that I have accepted ye dignity, assuring you yt such
is the qualety of gouernemente of commonweals and specially that of the
Church, that being of many desired, it is of few well exercised. It belonges
to him that governs to be learned, the better to know what he does: Wise
to find out how he ought to do it: Discreet to attend and take the
opportunity, Respects of a governor.
and resolute in the action of justice without corruption or fear of any:
otherwise he shall but bring pains to his person, and leave danger to his
common weal. All these condicious may be of one man desired, but they are
hardly found to meet in many: For, to speak in truth and liberty, there is
no man so good, in whom is not some fault to be corrected, and many
imperfections to be remedied. And therefore for one man to call an other
virtuous without flattery, it is to give him the greatest title of the world,
seeing it is found by experience, that the name of virtuous, is of many
desired, but of very few deserved.

It is not without sorrow to good men to see many vain and glorious minds
now a days delited to be honored upon the superscription of Letters with
these titles, most high, most mighty, most magnificall, or most reverent,
esteeming it to dishonor if most virtuous be put in, and leaving that title,
not for a Noble man but for personages of mean estate. To such men I answer,
that to call a man most high, belonges to a King: to be entitled most mighty
belonges to a Viceroy, to bear the name of most magnificall belonges to be a
man of great estate: and to be written right Reverent it behooves him to be a
great Prelate: but to be called virtuous, it is first requisite that he be
good. Therefore in the account of reputation, it is more worthy to be called
virtuous, then Noble or reverent: It is more worthy to be called virtuous then
noble or reverent.
For that the one title discends together with the dignity, and the other is
the reward of ye virtue which we use: So that it falls out in good experience yt
this title of virtuous is of many desired, and not greatly deserved. I assure
you sir) I am already so full with the travel of government and to be a
Bishop, that if as I have determined it with reason, I could conclude it with
opinion, I would with as good heart refuse the charge, as others would accept it
with gladness: For that my natural inclination bears more to seek out the
sweetness of Philosophy, then to travel in the bitter perplexities of
policy. In this many will say I write against my self, for that such vain
worldlinges as I am employe not our skill and study to search only
mediocretie to live by, but to gather superfluities to serve our appetites,
following not reason but opinion. And many do I know in this world now a
days, to whom of that little they have there would yet remain some thing, if
they had none to content but themselves: but their ends tending more to
satisfy that which their neighbors may say, then to accomplish things which
they are bound to do: neither the inheritance of their parents, nor the use of
their friends can suffize their prodigallitie. And therefore both troublesome,
dangerous, and chargefull is the estate of Princes and great Lords.: For,
that to get riches they are alone, but the dividing and partition of the same
is subject to the will of many: Yea in that respect they are no other then
trivutaries and subjects, since that of all that they possess, most commonly
they have the use but of the least part. Wherein Marcus Aurelius writing to a
dear friend of his, uses this discourse. Many times it is agreeable enough
that a man do what he would, but never is it lawful to do that he ought
not: For, to make war against men, is oftentimes glory, but to be at
controversy with reason is always attributed to folly. There be many men
wise, but more be fools, and the greatest foot of all is he, who being at
rest in his house, searches with diligence elsewhere, troubles, trauayles, and
perplexities. For, that for the most part he reapes no other fruit of the
offices and estates which he searches abroad, then to suffer continually
pain, care, and grief at home: There is no doubt that to be Emperor of Rome
is not a greatness above all the estates of the world. But waighing with his
countenance and Majesty the cares and infelicities that are annexed to the
seat, there is far greater security to follow a private life, then to
manage the affairs and trauayles of a Kingdom. And because (good Pution) thou
art so near me in friendship and opinion, In adversities it is one comfort
to know the uttermost mishap.
I will debate it franckly with thee, though not so much for that thou desire
to know it, yet because it bringes ease to my heart to communicate my Fortune,
as in all adversities it is one chief comfort when men know the uttermost of
their mishappes: But thus was the case.

The Emperor Anthonius adopting me to his Son in Law, gave me to wife his
Daughter, and for a Dowry endued me with the Empire, two things very
honorable, and even so not a little troublesome: For that to the government of
the Empire is tied great pain and travail, and in Faustine my wife is great
difficulty of moderation and modesty. Herein thou have no reason to maruayle
so much of that I write to thee now, as to wonder with what discretion I have
so long time suffered it, assuring thee, that the trauayles of the Kingdom
shorten my life, and the liberty of my wife diminished mine honor. For, she
being the Daughter of an Emperor, the wife of an Emperor, having with all
the help of riches, beauty, and authority, she forbeares not to use the
privilege of her liberty not as she ought, but as she list.

Women rather desire liberty, then know how to use it.
This being a property anexed to most women rather to desire liberty, then
that they know how to use it. And that which worse is, she will never suffer
reformation of this error, without the prejudice of mine honor. So, that in a
form of life as this is, and with the fellowship of a Wife such as is
Faustine, it had been better for me to have taken the state of a labourer,
then to have been raised to the place of the Empire. For that when the
reckoninge is made, as there is no land so hard which the Plough does not
turn up, so there is no man so humble which will be commanded. I was never
so well served, as when I had but one Page, and now that I am Emperor, all men
call me servants, and yet I am made servant to them all. Wherein thou
may see a lamentable difference between that I was then, and the condition
I live in now: For when I followed the study of Philosophy I had contentment
of mind, where the pompes of the Empire so carries me into strange spirits,
that I have forgot the virtue and Science I knew, and now am trauayled in
infirmities which I can not avoid.

When I was a private man, all men held their eyes fixed upon me, and now
that I am a Prince, there are few that employe not their tongues against me,
the same well approving, that as in Princes there is always something to be
warned, so in Subjects are many things to be corrected. All this (good
Pution) I debate with thee, to the end, thou owe compassion to my estate past,
and bear pity to that I am now, having neither time to communicate with
those friends with whom I have been brought up, nor opportunity to seek my
solace in the sciences I have learned: For, of the one side the cares of the
Kingdom do carry me into thoughts and heaviness, and on the otherside the
liberty of my Wife leaves me in trouble of conscience.

Thus Sir, touching the congratulation you sent me for the Bishoppricke, you
are answered by Marcus Aurelius, by whom you see, it is more surety to the
man of religion and learning to follow the exercise of study, then to aspire
after government and rule: for that in the one he finds contentment with
stabilitie, where the other ministers nothing but passion, perplexity, and
perpetual subjection to revolution and change.

There are no greater riches then Honor, nor poverty more intolerable then
Infamy.
THese be the three things which above al others hold most affection in men,
and which every man keeps in greatest recommendation. Health of their persons,
plenty of wealth, and conservation of honor and renown. All which, as they
import not little to the stablishment of our worldly felicity, so to obtain
and keep them, I never knew any in whom remained a desire and delight in life,
who would not withal pass many perils to win them, and suffer no less
pains to wear them. To desire these things nature enclineth us, and no law
defends us, since without Health, without Wealth, and without Reputacion, life is
of no other use to men, than a tree which bringes forth goodly broad leaves to
shadow the owner from Sun and weather, and yeeldes no fruit to feed him and
his family. But of all these three, with all the rest whatsoever, that which
is and ought to be most dear, is the honor we have and the good renown we
have gotten: since honor only is the true stipend and effect of virtue, and all
other things are the rewards of Fortune. Yea Honor is so high and precious a
temper, Honor the true reward of virtue.
that without Health and Wealth it is much worth, where those two without that
loaseth their value. What has that man that has not honor? and what can be
wanting to him to whom is no lack of Honor? No man in office can administer
well unless he have honor, and in a common weal what can not that man do who
has reputation and fame? For, honor being^ the merit of virtue, and virtue
the ready instrument to get affection and love, he is most worthy of authority
whose virtue is best proved, and that man best hable to command over a common
weal, to whom the multitude gives opinion, judgment and estimation of honor.
The man of honor never dies.
The man of Honor (says Plato) never dies, where he that is infamous and
detected ought not to live: Wherein he made an example in Thelemon the good,
and Alcibyades the wicked, the one being the glory of Greece, Prou. 22.
and the other the scourge and persecution of Athens. Better is a good name
says the wiseman then many riches and better to have renown amongst the good
sort, then to be lord over ye whole world, there being no such riches under
heaven as to be well thought of of men. But such is the infelicitie of mankind,
that much less that the counsel of the wiseman is followed, seeing it is not
once remembered. For that, what of the right hand and what on the left, what
with conscience and what without, men take pleasure to banishe honor by little
and little from their house, upon condition notwithstanding to suffer wealth
and treasure to enter in great abundance. In cases of marriage, if the woman be
virtuous and noble, it is holden for no portion, al men having regard to the
value of her substance, and more embracing a thousand Duckattes in gold, then
two thousand good conditions in the party: Yea we see many maids now a days
rather chosen for their bewty then married for their virtue. But to those
matches GOD suffers to happen many crosses, because who in his choice has
more regard to wealth then to virtue, finds for the most part that which he
fears, and misseth that he desires. For, if she be rich, her pride and
stomach are intolerable, and if she be fair she will lead him in suspicion
of her lightness, if she be young and not instructed, her nature carries her
with a swift pace into disobedience and dishonest practices: And if she be old
without virtue, there is no more possibility to make her tractable, then
without water to quench a flame, whose nature is never to cease to burn as
long as he finds matter to feed his heat. So that to such as enter marriage
with those corrupt affections, as there is small merit of pity or compassion,
so most commonly they want no time to repent nor matter to complain upon. Let
your light shine before men says Christ to his disciples, meaning, that to the
establishment of their credit was necessary they had good renoume, shining by
their sincerity of life not only before God, but even in the faces of men, the
better to warrant their Doctrine. For that, as to a good and virtuous life
succeedes an honest and just renoume: So, That tale importes small truth, whose
reporter is of no credit.
to have that believed which is spoken, it imports much that he have credit
that speaks it: since in that tale is small surety of truth, in whose
reporter is no testimony of credit. In cases of partiality and faction, if
there be an hundred infamous men against one man of honor, his virtue only
will carry him to more authority in a common weal, then all the strength or
subteltie of the others without credit. The whole country of Egypt had
perished during the seven years of famine, had it not been for the credit and
opinion which Joseph had with Pharao. Destruction had fallen upon the City of
Jerusalem by the wars of the Machabes with their neighbors, had not the
reputation of Mathias the sacrificator ministered succor and sauetie to the
whole common weal. If Helie the Prophet had not ben well thought of with the
people of Jsrael, they had al become idolators, their inclination drawing them
universally thereunto. And in the great captivity of Babylon, had it not been
for ye estimation, credit, and holiness of life of Daniel, Ezechiel, and the
good old Tobyas, many Hebrews had become Gentiles, where by the virtue of
those men, many Gentiles were converted to the Hebrews. So that in the texts
of Jesus Christ, and the wiseman, is great congruencie of reason, seeing that
all these virtuous personages brought stay and comfort to their commonweales,
not by their wealth or huge treasures, but by their renoume and credit of
honor* Spectaculu^ facti sumus Deo, 1. Cor. 4.
mundo and hominibus: the other Apostles and I says S. Paul, are set as
spectacles from whence every one draws his impression, and as whites whereat al
men do shoot, and as guides after whom every one ought to go. By whom let the
Magistrates and governors of the earth learn to know what life they should
lead, what virtue they should use, and what credit they ought to have: For,
there is no man how simple so ever he be, who is not moved more with the good
example he sees, then with all the sweet words that can be spoken to him,
since amongst men more does provoke to well doing the action, then the word.
And therefore whether he be King that commau^ds, or Prelat that administreth, or
Magistrate that governs, or Preacher that instructs: let him first labor
to win opinion, to the end his doctrine may bring forth good fruit: For other
ways for one that prayseth that he says, there will be many hundred to blame
that he does, since the affections of men are more led by example, then by
persuasion or conference. Cepit Jesus facere and docere, the redeemer of the
world says S. Luke, was so auised in his doings, Acts. 1
and so wonderful in that he spoke, that he remained thirty years in
recovering good name, before he published to the world his Doctrine. Who lives
virtuously, although he speak never a word, yet he preaches enough with the
example of his life: where the evil liver how good so ever he be in tongue and
speech, defaceth his virtues with the infamies of his life. Yea his preaching
is but hipocresie, and his doctrine but error: since such as speak goodly
things and do them not, are like to a Harp which gives a sound to others and
understands nothing it self. The Turks, the Jews, the Indians, and
Chaldies, although they differ from us in sects and languages, yet there is no
difference in the desire of honor and good renown, as being inuerted in the
nature of man to desire to be free, and labor to be honored: For that of all
voluble things, there is nothing more dear and precious then credit and
renoume. And how holy and perfect so ever a man be, yet may he be subject to
contemn or reject the reverence that men bear him, and the presents that are
given him: but touching the credit of his person, and reputation of his good
renoume and doctrine, there are none that take pleasure to leave them, Good
examples draw more to perfection then speech.
and much less will suffer them to decline or diminish. For, otherwise there
would not be many followers of their life, and fewer to imitate their doctrine:
Since, good examples only draws to perfection, and speech and language be but
helpers to ye same. Yea, if in one man were met the forces of Sampson, the
wisdom of Solomon, Commodities coming by men of honor and virtue.
the courage of Caesar, the riches of Cressus, the science of Plato, and the
constancy of Cato. If, with all these, his person stood not in good renoume,
and his life commended for good example, he were no other thing then a painted
fire that gave no heat, or as a fair visor that covered a foul deformed
face. Men of honor and virtuous reputation have many great privileges, for
good men desire to serve them, and ill men are made better by their example.
Old men are assured by them, and the younger sort draw counsel from them. Yea
on them are fixed the eyes, thoughts, and actions of all sorts of people, in
whom their virtues have won such affection, that if they be detected of any
crime, yet it is accounted more to misaduenture then to sin, and being
accused of fault, the malice of their adversary is cifted, and they cleared by
the testimony of their proper innocence. For, this is holden a rule amongst
the multitude, that men of virtue and such as have fear to err, bear more
respect to honor, then either to life or goods: For that either early or late
the life dissolueth, and riches must be left, but in true honor and good
renoume are laid up our monuments of perpetuity and fame so long as we live,
and after our death they lift us to immortality: Hector of Troy, Achilles of
Greece, Hercules of Thebes, and Caesar of Rome, had their seasons and means to
determine their life, but to touch or take away their renoumes there was no
power to time or death. For that every one of them buried with him his
strength, his riches, and his life, but their renoumes remain subject to no
prescription, but as doctrines of perpetuity are closed up, Genesis 4^.
and reserved to serve the ages and posterities to come. Tell unto my father
all my glory says the Patriarch Joseph to his brethren, the first time he
saw them in Egypt: as if he had said, go up my Brethren into the country of
Chanan, and rejoice my Father, telling unto him the great favor that Pharao
bears me, together with the glory, honor, and renoume I have gotten through
out the land of Egypt. He did not recommend unto his Brethren to tell his
Father that he was on live, that he was married, or that he had children, but
only that he was favored and much honored, esteeming more (for our example)
a little good ronoume, then his wife, his children, his goods, or his proper
life. For that, in the first (being of virtue) is perpetual stabilitie, where
the others being transitory suffer reuersement and dissolution. When God
called Abraham out of his country to pass him into the land of promise, he
promised to make his name great, and raise his renoume above men on the earth.
For, my condition (says God) is not to have friends if they be not honored.
Wherein we may note that in recompense that Abraham abandoned his country, his
friends, his goods, and all other his long experienced felicities, yea being
ready liberally to sacrifice his only son. Yet God promised him not
patience, restitution of riches, nor long life, but only to give him honor, A
grace not small coming from the hand of God, and a blissing great to be
bestowed on men. For, to whom the Lord gives honor for his person and glory
for his soul, there rests no more to make that man happy in the world, and
much less to trouble God with further desires, since riches being to be got by
industry, Riches to be got by industry and fortune to be governed by wisdom.
and fortune to be governed by providence and policy, and since sickness and
health are subject to natural causes, and short or long life limited by the
will and resolution of God, what can be more required for the worldly glory of
man, then to have honor and credit, which is a treasure better resolved then
riches, and cares not what policy can do against it? it triumphs above
fortune, is not tied to the destiny of sickness, nor subject to the power of
death, but as a thing not transitory, it carries men to immortality, and
dies not til heaven and earth come to their account. Spoliauit me gloria mea,
and abstulit coronam meam de capite meo. Job. 1^
I know not says the holy man Job why the Lord has set me upon the
dunghill replenished with this deformity of botches, the same making
strangers to abhor me and mine own people to misknow me. But the thing
that I feel with most bitterness, is, that he has taken my Crown from my
head, that is my credit, and defaced my glory, which is mine honor and
renown. Job, in his affliction lost seven thousand sheep, three thousand
Camels, five hundredth yoke of oxen, and five hundredth she Asses, yet all these
temporal spoils brought not such grief unto him, as the loss of his renoume
and credit, for that in this miserable life, there is nothing can be called
loss, There is no loss in this life, but the loss of good name.
but when we lease good renoume. What has that man that has not honor? What
do we leave behind us, if we die not with renoume? Yea we live in vain if our
life be infamous, since a man of naughty reputation being slanderous to
himself, can not but be also hurtful to others. For that to such one the
good sort will give no faith, nor the wicked any obedience, no man will suffer
him as his neighbor, nor any choose him for his friend: Seeing, of that
quality are infamy and leprosy, that with their only conversation they
infect a man. The man infamous and dishonored, The infamou^ man not to be^
trusted.
stands so defaced in confidence and credit, that no man will trust him, and
much less to be taken for a public witness, wherein sure the Law has
great conformity with reason, seeing it is not convenient in wisdom,
equity, and nature, to refer our goods and causes to the trust and direction
of him, who can not keep his proper honor and reputation. Libera me Domine ab
homine malo, Psalm. 139.
and a viro iniquo etc. If I have any part in thee oh great GOD of Israel says
David, Ill renoume is accompanied with ill conscience.
I beseech thee defend me from him that is not a christian, and from a
christian evil renoumed, since, most commonly ill renoume is accompanied with
ill conscience: Wherein if any will say it is no general rule that infamy and
a corrupt conscience are coupled together (for that many are unjustly
sclaundered) it may be confessed, but with this addicion, that where the
conditions of the ill man are instruments to detect him, the virtues of the
good man keep him always from sclaunder. For, virtue is of that force, that
forth with she disclaymeth, and proves the fault not to be in the abuse of
the good man, but in the envy that is borne him. Jn die illa attenuabitur
gloriae Jacob, and marcescet pinguedo carnis eius. Esaias speaking of the
Sinagoge, cries out: Esa. 17 figure.
oh sorrowful Sinagoge and unhappy house of Jacob, know thou that when he
shall come into the world, that is so much desired of men, thy fat flesh
shall grow lean and all thy glory shall be consumed, because thou have been
a Rebel against thy King, and perverted the Law. By the fat flesh of Israel
was meant the Patriarchs and Prophets, and the glory of Jacob, was the renoume
they had by reason of the Scepter and Priesthode. And yet in place of this
fatnes, came feeblenes and leanes, and to this renoume succeeded infamy: For,
after the Passion of Christ they had no more Prophets, and much less gathered
honor or renoume, the words of Esaias being truly and fully accomplished, for
that after the death of Christ the City was destroyed, the temple reuersed,
the priesthood finished, the Scepter confounded, the law expired, and the
whole people so dispersed, that even till this day, they have not recovered
their honor, nor restored their common weal. Here it is not without mystery
that the Prophet said that altogether their fatness should not be consumed,
but that their glory should decline, and their fatness become lean: Giving to
understand that for their greater punishment, God would not altogether destroy
that people, but so appointed that through out the world, and to the end of the
world, they might wander in sorrow, fear, captivity, poverty, desolation,
dishonor, and infamy, neither observing Law, nor acknowledging any King. By
all these let us be taught how much we are bound to esteem honor, and with
what grief we ought to feel the loss of it, God oftentimes takes away our
honor for our offenses.
seeing that as GOD does give it of his special grace, so also he takes it
away oftentimes for our offenses.

The Author modestly reprehendeth his friend for not yielding to his request.
I Understand (Sir) that you make no less vaunt for denying my request, then I
was shamefast to desire you, which has given me some occasion of debate
eftsoon between your authority and my judgment, and your frowardnes and my
condition. The man that does ill is but simply wicked, but he that glories in
his ill, is not without a Sipirite of the Devil. For, as the Condition of the
Devil is inclyned to deceive, so the nature of the vain and Froward is
hardlye Corrected, and therefore to the Glorious and Obstynate manne it is in
vain to geeue Council, and much less to minister Correction, since where
reason yeeldes to self will, and Sensuality suffers no Council, there the
mind is turned into Partialytie and all the Senses resolved into Faction. I
say thus much upon the occasion of my Request to you to bear favor to my
Friend, to whom much less you Ministered any friendeshippe, seeing you would
not once vouchesafe to bestow an Answer to my Letter, an injury which I
have felt rather then Published, Considering that such wrongs as this is
ought either to be thoroughly revenged, or altogether Dissembled. I am not
much grieved for that I did entreat you, since the Law of Nature leaves a
Liberty for one manne to be beeholding to an other, and amongst friends
that request ought not to be intolerable which bringes as great necessitye
to be granted, as reason to be Demanded, and wherein the greatest Prejudice
is to him that denies it. But touching the wrong you offer to repulse me, I
will not enforce it with Argument and words, Since my heart is not unarmed
with Patience to bear it, Esteeming it to a true effect of my virtue to
suffer the Injury, since you make no Conscience to offer it: One of the
things wherein Caesar showed most Courage was, in that he seemed most glad
when the Senate had denied him any thing, Affirming that there could not
be a greater glory or Renoume to his Person, then when he was most
importunate to ask, they were most ready to deny, expressing his great Power
to forbear that he desired, and their slender reasons to reject him. The
Letter I wrote you contained things indifferent, neither unmeet to be
required, nor worthy to be denied, persuading you altogether to bear more
respect to my friendship, then remembrance to the injury my friend has done
you: Wherein the grief he published, and the request I made, ought sure to
work some impression in you, seeing that he is no other then a Tyrant, who is
not appeased by discreet Words, and mollifyed by pitiful Tears, that
suffizing to Atonement between man and man, He is a Tirant that is not
appeased by tears
which God holds for acceptable between him and Sinners. And albeit no man
ought to seek his Revenge, as by the same to throw himself into destruction,
Yet to him that is of base condition it is no dishonor to Revenge, where to
the man of might and Power, the most Honor is to Pardon. There can not be a
more high reueng then to forgive an injury-
For, that in the World, there is not a more hawtie kind of Revenge then to
forgeeue an injury by virtue: Notwythstanding I think there can be no rule
certain in the Action of Pardoning or revenging wrongs: For that oftentimes
the offense bringes with it that qualetie that it can not be Pardoned without
committing a new fault. But the offense of my friend, for whom I wrote,
being not of that Condition, deserved to be forgeeuen in common
Christianity, and to be dissembled of you bearing a Reputation to be
Discreet, Wise, and not Passioned. Suffer your self to be sought to, since
even the greatest Princes are bound to hear Suitors. Mislyke not
opportunities, when the necessity of the party deserves to be pytied, and
disdain not to receive good Council, since amongst men there can be no
greater Treasure. Otherwise, if you be Rigorous, hard and obscinate, albeit
you may have the Company of many Neighbors, yet assure your self to want the
Solace that is to be looked for in good friends. And so God give you that you
desire, and defend you from that you deserve.

A Letter aduertising Parents not to be Careless in the Education of their
Children, and that a man of honesty and virtue ought not to suffer ill resort
or lewd demeanor in his house.
WHen Rome stood in her best Prosperity, it was defended that none should do
Sacrifice in the Temple of Minerua but only the Matrons of the City: For
which cause they used to cover the Images of men at such time as the Women
prepared to their Action of Sacrifice. But afterward their curiousness was
corrupted by the wickedness of one Claudius, who watching his opportunity,
defiled the fair Matron Obelina as he found her praying alone: Wherein,
notwithstanding he was accused and detected of Sacrileage, yet he so solicited
for himself by cauteile and corruption, that for Money the Judges absolved
him, being promised wythall by his industerie to possess in that sort and
place the fairest Ladies in Rome, which accordingly he performed: So that this
wretched Claudius not satisfied with his proper Sin, labored to give mean of
offense to others. Wherein he brought more slander to the Romans for the
practices he made, then for his proper Transgression, for that the one was a
fault of nature, and the other a wickedness of corruption: By these I wish
yoou to be aduertitised and rebuked, that in your house your Children are not
only Dishonest, but Couers also to the vices of others, which can not be
without their great fault, and your just infamy, For the vices of the Child
the Father deserves rebuke.
for that in the vices of the Children is due cause of Imputation to the
Parents. If you know it and Dissemble it, your Offense is the greater and if
it be not yet come to your knowledge it tournes to your more Negligence and
Challenge: For that the Wife and honest man ought to keep more account of the
Honor of his house, then of the money in his Coffers, since Money may be
redeemed with Money, but the spotte in a house can not be repurged with all
the Treasures in a Kingedome. The great Sacrifycator Hely was not Punished
somuche for the Sins of himself as for that he Dissembled the vices of his
Children: which was justly laid upon him, for that the Father careful for
the virtue and instruction of his Children ought to feed their infancy with
Doctrine, and frame their youth with Discipline: Have regard to your honor,
and watch over your flock Corret your family, and abollishe from your house
infamy lest you deserve to be accused of all, and of none worthy to be
excused, assuring you that as a man of reason ought not to be called wise so
long as he suffers his son to live in vices. So if you apply not the
medicine in time, the disease of your infamy will grow incurable, and as a
Cancker, spread through your whole Posterity: It cannot be denied but
inclinations much hurt young people, even so I hold it the greater ill not to
haunt good and virtuous companies, for that a wicked inclination may be
resisted, but an ill Custom is seldom forgotten, since there is nothing takes
in us more deeper impression then the things wherewith we have continual
familiarity, So that the father that will well govern his Child, ought to
hold him short, and cut of the liberty of his fancy, seeing that youth is
not so tender to resist vices, as most hard and incapable to receive Council.
Many and many be the faults which men Commit in this world whose
punishments God transferres to others, except the offense of the Father for
the ill Iustitution of his Child, whose Abuses and Errors resolve oftentimes
to a Scourge of the Father for his negligence. For, how many vices the Father
has suffered in the son in his youth, so many sorrows shall afflict his old
age, as a due justice for that he was careless. There is no honest man has a
more cruel ennemie, The Father ought not to suffer his children to be
dissolute.
then that poor Father who suffers in his house dissolute children: For that
where the hurts we have by our enemies are causes to decrease our goods, the
vices of our children bring loss and spoil to our honor. And where it may
happen that an honest man may not receyne a blow of his ennemie once in his
life, the enormities of his own children are sufficient to make him dye every
hour: So that the perplexities we have sometimes by strangers are disgested
as things happeninge by strangers, as the wound that is outward may grieve
but not perish the intrales: But the displeasures passing in our house pearse
deeper, and as a martyr languishe the heart even to death: And therefore by
how much the Father bears pity to his wicked Son, by so much he uses
extreme cruelty against himself: yea that day wherein he ministers not
correction to his Son, that day does he justice of his proper person, and
sendes his renown to question. The Romans had a Law called Faelcidia, by
which the first offense of the Child was pardoned, the Second punnished, and
for the third he was banished: which Law if it were eftsoon reduced to
practice in these times, we should not see so many youth run hedlong into
vices, nor so many Fathers suffer blame for their negligence: But because
Fathers do not chastise, and mothers too much suffer, the child takes
boldness in vice, leauinge to the Parents occasion to lament, but no lybertye
of remedy.

Where you write to me that you are old, and that your infirmityes make you
weary, as though you lived to long: I wish you not to reckon your age so much
by the number of years you have lived, as by the many trauelles you have
endured: For that to sensuallitie, to live a hundred years seems but a short
time, and to the heart that is heavy and sorrowful, the life of a hundredth
momentes is too long and weary. It must not suffize you to seem to be old,
He only is old that puts end to his old corruptions.
but you must be so in deed, seeing he only may be called old who puttes
end to his old vices. For little does it profit to have your head Graye and
your Face Wrinckled, if your life follow young customs and your mind Feed
upon Green desires, the same being the cause why Old men weakened with vice
and Sin, are Subject to fear Death and to dye soon, being with nothing so
ill contented, as to be divided from their vices.

The Author writes to his Sister serving in Court: Partly he instructes her
how to live in Court, and partly satisfyeth her request under a short
Description of Love.
WEighing with the nature of the place where you are, the qualetie of the
affection I bear to you, I dout whether it were better to use playnesse
according to good meaning, or dissemble, and so leave you better contented.
For, by the office of nature I cannot but warn you, and yet to the place where
you are, nothing is less acceptable then to be instructed: the Court being a
place that sometimes covers or sees not the faults in their friends, or
else takes all things to blame, and finds nothing in their foes that they may
like. But being my Sister, I will use my authority, though not to please you,
yet to persuade you and acquit my self, being far from my profession to
deal in matters of love, I that have undertaken the direction of consciences.
And albeit my other travels and private exercise make me very insufficie^t to
debate with you to your full satisfaction, yet taking ye opportunity as it is, I
had rather put my imperfection vpo^iudgment, then leave you not instructed,
hoping you will no less answer for mine honor then for your sake you see me
ready to hazard it to Question. Where you write to me that he that presented
you with your last, Jewel was your friend and Lover I deny it, since there
is difference beetweene him that Loves, and one that is a Friend. For a
friend does always Love, but he that Loves is not always a friend: Which
may be well proved in your Ladies of the Court. For that in Service and
Amarous devotion you have many that Serve you, Follow you, and desire you, who
may rather be called your Lovers then your Friends, since they intend no
other thing then the practice of pleasure being as void of intent of marriage
as they are of virtue: Yea, having not the Spirit to judge of honest Love, nor
true intention to follow it, they bring oftentimes dishonor to their Ladies,
whose simplicity for the most part falls into Slander by the Sutletie and
malice of their Servants. Such one I fear is he that has beestowed the
Jewel upon you, which then you may best discern when you find him to
Promise much and perform little, assuring you that then he uses the Sleyght
of the Fowler, who with a Sweet Call bringes the Bird to his Net, and
deceaues her to her Destruction. Consider therefore the place where you are,
the Race that you come of, and what you pretend. The Court gives you Liberty
to do much ill, and little Instruction too Follow that is good: And if you
Stand not Fast upon those Virtues you Learned in the House of your father,
the place it self will infect and change you, since frequentation draws into
one fellowship and society of Estate, things that of themselves are different:
remember also that to such as desire to be virtuous the house of the Prince is
a schole house for their better instruction, and a place helping to their
advancement. Wherein if any miscarie, the falt may be more in their proper
negligence, then in the will of the Prince, since to maids of honor serving in
Court it is a greater advancement to be married by the favor and consent of the
Prince, then by ye patrimonies or portion which their parents can leave them.
I have oftentimes written unto you, that if devotion and conscience lead some
women into Religion, virtue and good name raise others to preferment in Court.
Therefore I advise you lay not up great confidence in your beauty, and much
less presume upon the greatness of your race: For in Court, for one Gentleman
that makes love to your persons, you shall find twenty that spend the whole
day to judge of your lives, since beauty without virtue, and high kindred
without good conditions, is no other thing then as a goodly green Tree that
florisheth with leaves and blossoms, and brings forth no fruit: or as a
stately carved Image, which men take great pleasure to behold, but are grieved
when they find it dead and without quality.

You and the other Ladies your companions would have me write what love is,
wherein it consistes, and what be the fignes and tokens of true love, esteeming
me a man of study, and an ancient Courtier. This office I might better turn
upon your selves, for that, your beauties standing in the eyes of men, leading
them to sue, to serve, to solicit and to love you, me thinks it belonges to
you to set down the description of love, and to me to tell you what sorrow is.
Seeing it is an action due to my place and age, to weep, fast, and pray, but
to you it apperteynes to dance, devise, and tryffle. Notwythstanding as I have
told you in short what a friend is, so I will not stick to fill up ye residue
of your desire, to debate briefly the nature of love, not that I would instruct
you, but to warn and advise you, hoping you will rather Love as a Christian,
VVarninges for a Lady serving in Court.
then as a Courtier. Wherein I recommende unto you chiefly to be wise in your
words, discreet in your actions, secret in your thoughts, particular in your
frendships, modest in your behavior, and above all follow the instructions of
your own virtues, and flee the example of such as draw to vice: Yea, have more
regard to your self then to any other person, since in the end your virtues
are sure of their reward, for that God will prefer you to Marriage, and put
into the mind of the Prince to endue you with worthy Portion. Take heed
therefore you be not light in looks, vain in life, lauishe of speech, nor a
scoffer at men, for that with Ladies of these Conditions, men of the Court take
pleasure to devise, but none will have fancy to Marie them. So that the best
dowry to advance the Marriage of a young Lady is, when she bringes in her
countenance myldnesse, in her speech wisdom, in her behavior modesty, and
in her whole life, virtue: For that there is no man, what vain and light
affections soever he have, but though he take pleasure to sewe and serve a
fair Lady, yet in case of Marriage, he will seek out Virtue, and reject
Beauty. But now to our purpose of Love: It is an opinion with you Ladies of
the Court, that Love, and to be a Lover, consistes only to be gaye in
apparel, to be set out in diversity of Coullers of Feathers, to be pensive,
to be passioned, to solycite, to behold, and often to entertain his Lady with
discourses of Love: Things no less vain and light, then most far from the
true property of love: Seeing of this qualetye is the good and true love, that
to him that has default of force, it geeues him strength, and in him that has
it already, it confirms it further. To him that is simple, What true love is.
it geeues Quickenesse of spirit: To him that has want of Courage it geeues
boldness and stomach: By it the Couetou^ man is made liberal, and it sets
open the Purse of the nigarde: So that in the heart where he is entered he
suffers no imperfection nor inciuility, but lifts their thoughts up to high
actions, Love bredes mani virtues
and searching that he loves, there are none perceives what he endures: when
we cast our eye upon a thing, there is differenc to praise it, and to love it*
for that the thing which we praise and love not, as soon as it is commended, it
is forgotten, but that which we love truly we lay up in the the secret corner
of our thoughts, we plant it in our will and bring it forth in the fruit of
our memory: It stands always before our eyes, and our eyes send it down to the
safe keeping of our heart: Love is best known to the heart that loves, and
he of himself only feels when he is content or miscontent, favored or not
favored, suspected or trusted, merry or sad, or in despair or assured: Yea
his passions are not known to others, if his affections be honest, for that he
will rather suffer in grief then give cause of offense, esteeming his meritte
so much the greater, by how much his martyrdom is painful, and his passion
so much the more worthy, by how much his intention assures his hope. To
instruct you in the signs of such as love truly, you must observe the
behavior of the parties when they depart one from another: For it is no other
thing the separation of two friends, then to divide one heart into two moities,
the same most commonly appearing at the time of leave taking, when in the one
is disclosed want of words, and in the other abundance of tears: you shall
know likewise that love that is accompanied with fastness, when the party
enterpriseth great things and esteems little those of base importance, love
always enabling his subjects to high actions, and raising their thoughts to
great purposes. Properties in a true lover
Zo that the heart that loves lokes not to be commanded, but learns to win
merit by prevention: he offers no excuse, but is ready to execute: he is not
required to be liberal, but finds out wherein he may be aceptable: he suspectes
not his mistres, but takes all to the best, he believes no report, since he is
assured of her virtue: he is not importunate, but makes his hope his felicity:
if she but begin to like, he puts wings to his affection, yea he makes her ye
image of his thoughts, and lives wholly dedicated to her devotion. And therefore
if he love dearly, hd lives in thought to please, in care to offend, in desire
to suffer, and in fear to disclose, and loving much he gives much, thinking it
no liberality if he refuse any thing, since if he have once given his will and
consent, it is nothing to give withal his ability and wealth: and being
possessed by another, he must think he has nothing of his own: In like sort the
true lover studies to be circumspect in behavior, esteeming it a sweet
felicity to have his thoughts and delytes private: he is modest in countenance
the better to bleare the eyes of spies, and please the mind of his mistres.
And he is patient to suffer, esteeming him not worthy of reward unless he
endure to the end. And where true love is, there wrongs must be borne, and no
words delivered to the dishonor of his Lady: By whom if any occasion be
given, yet he must always have this lesson, that patience is a virtue, and
secret scilence does best solicit, since the true Trumpet of love, is not the
Tongue that speaks, but the heart that sigheth. Yea as the Tongue is
restrained from speaking, but not the heart from Louinge: So I hold it better
to love with sewertie, then to deceive with sweetness, since in the one is the
virtue, and bringes his reward, and the other being the vice, is sure of his
Punnishement. And so good Sister, if any your Servants in Court judge me a
lover by this short discourse I have written, I pray you tell them that being
a member of the world, I have a property in worldly actions, and perhaps had
been as worldly as the best if Philosophy had not drawn me from the world.

To a Noble man, in Consolation for the death of his Daughter in Law.
THis has been always a true observation from one time to an other, that
before any great chance or accident, there were forshewed certain strange and
prodigious signs, which as the Gentiles interpreted according to their
Superstitions, so it belonges to us Christians to take them as Aduertisementes
and warninges: Seeing they are Messengers and Heraldes of God, not to amaze and
confound us, but to warn and advise us, he delyting more to see our lives
amended, then to punish us according to our faults, according to that
comfortable text of David, Castigans castigauit me dominus sed morti non
tradidit me: So liberal is the mercy of God my Savior toward me, (says
he) that albeit he has threatened to strike me, yet he has not so much as
touched me. But coming somewhat more particulerly to your estate and my
purpose, yt late importunate travel which you took in the marriage of your
sister: your great and heavy misfortune in ye burning of your house and castle,
the late disagreement and faction between you and your brethren, and this
lamentable death of the Marquis your Daughter in law, seem to me to be three
plagues most pitiful to hear, and grievous to endure: deserving no less
compassion, then the ten scourges wherewith Egypt was afflicted, for that the
one were thundered upon a king tirant, and the other ministered to a christian
knight. Yea the plagues of Egypt were dispersed through the whole land, where
your griefs are altogether within your heart: by means whereof, where before you
were holde^ but as a christian, you are now of a co^fessor made a martyr, not so
much for ye adversities yt are happened, as for ye patience you use, bearing
those crosses according to virtue, and not as man unfortunate. if you were
persecuted as Noe was of ye Idolators, or as Joseph by his Brethren, or as the
good man Job by his friends, it could not be but very grievous, though nothing
dangerous. For that as in the Palaice of Princes who is most Favored of the
Prince, is best esteemed of the People: So in the house of God his preferment
is greatest, whom Christ does most chastise, since to none other end are the
Corrections he geeues us then to put us in Remembrance and prepare us to
one pefection. God suffered Tobyas to be Blind, Susanna to suffer Sentence,
and Daniell to be Imprisoned, not for that he would them ill, but to erpresse
the Love he bare them, this beeinge one property in Gods Affection to
Chastise those that he Loves and leave others to their Destruction. Who is
not afflicted bears a sign that of god he is much forgotten.
There is no greater Temptation then never to be Tempted, and no more sorer
Punishment, then of GOD never to be Corrected, since who receaueth no
Afflictions in this World, bears a Sign that of GOD he is much forgotten:
Yea, the Perplexityes wherewyth GOD vysiteth us ought rather to be called
Aduertisementes: then Punishementes: For that they are Disciplines necessary
to our amendment, and not Stumblinge Blocks to make us fall further. This
made Dauyd say, Omnes fluctus tuos induxisti super me. Psalm. 81.
All the trauelles and Dangers Oh Lord, which thou weart wont Indifferently
to impart to many, thou have now reduced and returned upon me only. Job
having lost his Goods, his Cattle, and his Children, Job. 6.
said and demanded of GOD, In misery it is one comfort to know the utter
most of our mishaps.
Haec sit mihi consolatio vt affligens me dolor, no parcas, Greater
Consolation could not the Lord send me in this World, then Punishing my
faults, to spare no sorts of sorrow upon me, for that in a calamity it is
one comfort when men know the utter most of their mishappes and that they can
not be Puninished further. Mihi absit gloriari, says Saint Paul, Nisi in
Cruce Domini: Esteeming it no greater glory then to endure troubles, as by
that means to come to communicate with the glory of Christ. It is good the
LORD lay his hand upon us, for that by it we are led to humylitie, and
taught to enter into the consideration of our selves: And the Reward and
Recompense that God Mynistreth to such as Obey and serve him, is to suffer
them to be Traueyled in Afflictions, Thorough exercise of adversities men are
made humble.
since he knows that there is no better Passage to the Eternal Glory and
Felicyties of Heaven, then to bear the Cross of Trybulation here in Earth.
For, through Exercise of Adversity men beecome Humble, and being often
tried they are the better Justified, as the Metal that passes thorough many
Fires ryseth more to his fynenesse and Perfection. For my part (Sir) albeeit I
have not the facultye of a Prophette, nor the inspyration of an Apostle: Yet I
dare assure you, that if in Patience you receive all your perplexities, you
shall receive your reward with others whom GOD has made happy by Troubles:
To the most, afflictions be but warninges.
being no other thing the Trybulation of the Just, then a warning of our
faults, and an aduertisemente of that we ought to do. Wherein speaking more
particulerly, I say, that to be Sorrowful for the death of your Daughter,
you have reason according to Flesh and Blood, as well for the Opinion of her
Virtue, Beauty, Age, and Kyndred, as in regard of the dear affection you
bare her. But if you consider wythall your Office toward GOD, you have to
think, that seeing he has so ordained, the best Sacrifyce you can Offer,
is to rest satisfied with his will: Not to Murmr of that is done, since of
necessity it must be so, nor debate with him why he has done it, for that
in his purposes is great Wisdom, which in the end bringes forth all things
for our best. You must think (Sir) it is a voyage that must be performed by
us all, and being a Tribute so due, he is unthankful that pays it with
grudging: Since for this debt we are taken out of al Debtes, and being
cleared of all Bonds, we remain for ever most happily laid up in the Free
felicities of God. It was a Law amongst the Lidians, that the Father Burying
his Son, was not forth with comforted till ye year was past, The heart that
is newely grieved takes his best comfort when he has time to lament his
loss.
as thinking it too soon to put consolation to so great sorrows: since the
heart that is but newely grieved can not better be comforted then to have
time to Lamente his loss: For that as men in Sorrow feel their harms more
grievously, then that at the first they can geeue place to Comfort: So there
can be no greater ease in the perplexities of Fortune then when they see
others Communicate in compassion with them. This I say, for that where you may
think I have written this Letter too late, you may wythall know that I did it
rather of Industerie, then of forgetfulness: Wherein because the Experience of
the Disposition of hearts heauely Laden with Sorrow, made me somewhat
doubtful, whether out of hand I should comfort your green greeues, or
defer them until by time they were more apt to receive Consolation: I
thought it not un necessary to suffer you to Wave in your heaviness, till
your Tears somewhat ceassing, your heart might be also reduced to Capacity
and Judgment. In cases so resolute as Death, Men are not to use desperate
Sorrow, since there is no Remedy to recover the loss, but rather to
dissemble the chance by discression, having more need of Magnanimity and
great courage to Dissemble a misefortune, then to assail an Enemy. So that if
your Daughter be dead, your Complaints are in vain, since Sorrow is no
Remedy to restore her, and in Accidents without help or hope, Necessitye
drives men to Comfort themselves, onelesse they think it a Remedy to their
Losses to resist the Eternal will and providence of God: In the mighty
Alexander it was hard to Judge whether of these two things were most to be
esteemed, either his high Fortune, or his great Discression, for that with
Fortune he subdued Kingdoms, and with Discression he suffered and dissembled
mishappes: Euenso having so well overcome many Perilles according to the
proportion of your place, wherein as you behaved your self as a valiant
Knight: So in these storms of nature, flesh, and blood, I wish you consider
what belonges to the law and modesty of a Christian: Wherein then do you best
express your self a Christian, when for your misfortunes you give thanks to
God, and not complain of him, taking that is happened not as a punishment in
his displeasure but as a token of the remembrance he has of you. Ezechiell.
222.
Take heed the complaint of Ezechiell be not meant by you, Fili hominis. etc.
I have put the house of Israel (says he) into a furnace of the Captivity of
Babylon, hoping that being within the fire of tribulation, she would resolve to
pure Gold, or fine Silver: But she is converted into Leather, Lead, Brass, and
Iron, This is the meaning of the lord by this figure: that man is converted
into Lead, who being put into ye furnace of tribulation, cannot only not be
amended, but from one day to another grows worse and worse: That man becomes
Iron, to whom God having sent some small punishment to advertise him, in place
to be amended, he ceasseth not to complain: He is turned into leather, who
outwardly seems to be of holy life, and when any tribulation happens, he is
found an hipocrite. And that man is resolved into brass who in condition is
intractable, and in conscience negligent. So that with just cause we may say
that far greater is the number of such as in Tribulations are Converted into
Iron, Leather, Brass, and Lead, then of them that become either Gold or
Silver. God keep us from such Transmutation, and geeue you Grace to make a
better profit of your tribulations, giving thanks to God, and dissembling
them before men, remembering that the patience of Job was the cause that God
restored him to double of that he had taken from him.

A discourse written to a great Princes, of the virtues and life of the Noble
Queen Zenobia.
Having already satisfied three parts of your Majesty's letter, there restes
only the service of the fourth, containing the life and virtues of the great
Queen Zenobia: Wherein as your Majesty's authority to command is full of
virtue, wisdom and grauetie, so it belongs to me to obey with faith,
diligence and truth, esteeming it much to mine honor to be commanded by your
Majesty, in whom this is no small testimony of virtue, that, albeit having
authority to command as a Queen, yet you will use request as a private
person, which to your servants is no small honor, and to your self no little
glory. For, that amongst other merits of Princesses, charity makes them most
acceptable before God, and familiarity gathers greatest affection with men.
And because to Princes and great Lords we must minister our reasons by weight,
and give our words by measure. I will in the history of Zenobia use the
authority of credible writers, hoping it shall not be the less agreeable to
your Majesty, nor the more vnplausible to the reader. And if as the historians
make her a Gentile, she had been a Queen Christian, her life had been no less
worthy of imitation, then by her virtues she has left immortal praise, both
for subduing most part of the East Empire, and resisting the infinite ambicion
of the Romans. Zenobia then being the widow of good Odenatus Prince of the
Palmerins, and mother to the natural heir of the kingdom, for that her son
was yet young, she took upon her the institution of his youth, and regiment of
the Empire. Wherein finding in her first government, certain Provinces to draw
to revolt, she opened her treasures, she assembled her forces, and went in
person into the field, where, in the age of five and thirty years and widow,
being regent of the whole East Empire, she was also captain general of the
army, doing such exploytes, that her enemies stood in fear, Virtues in the
Queen Zenobia.
and all the world in wonder of her. She was so wise to suggest a plot, that
there was never found error in her counsel, and so resolute to execute, that
to her enterprises there seldom followed ill success, yea her expedicion
prevented the providence of her enemies, being for the most part in their
trenches before they could think of her coming. She was so discreet in her
words, that having once spoken, she left nothing to reply, but every one to
wonder at her judgment, (the majesty of her countenance amasing strangers,
and much assuring her own people.) She was so just of promise that whatsoever
she levied by loan or credit, there was no other surety required then the
reputation of her own word. She was so liberal, that she never gave less
then to suffice ye wants of him to whom she gave, and withal to leave him able
to live without necessity to ask again. She was mild in case of submission,
and severe where she found obstinacy, conquering the affections of good men by
her clemency, and abating the pride of rebels by the discipline of her sword:
by which, her security was more in the affections of men, then in their armor
or weapons. She was familiar with all sorts, but so particular in friendship
that there were none knew the secret of her counsels till she saw time to
publish them to al. And though she would communicate with many, yet she
reaposed in few, for that being hable to control their counsels, she would not
stand subject to their directions, and sounding them, she remained judge of
their wits and opinions. Only she was ambicious, for that not content with the
title of regent, she made her to be called Empress, and administering the whole
in charge, travail, and pollecie, she thought she could not be unworthy of the
title, name and dignity. She never cared to ride in Coatch, but took pleasure
in Horses of service, and them could she manage with the best. When she went
abroad to see the order of her camps, she was always armed and accompanied
with guard, having only the name of a woman, and delites and will of a valiant
captain: Which she performed with such good example, that the chieftaines of
her army never did exploit wherein she managed not the place of the leader,
atchieuing no less with her hands then even he that did the best: A thing
very incredible to one of her sex, but not impossible to her virtues and mind.
The writers describe her to be of goodly personage, Description of Zenobia.
her eyes black and of quick motion, her forhead large and of good aspect,
her mouth little, and lips red, her teeth white more by nature then by Art,
her face of complexion perfect white and red, her stomach raised, and her
wit most ready and excellent, wherein she was helped by a deep knowledge in
the Greek and Latin. Yea, in her personage she bare such estate and majesty,
and in her countenance such affability and sweetenes, that, if she were feared
by mean of her severity, she was eftsons loved by reason of her beauty. In all this pomp of beauty, bounty, authority, riches and power, she was never
suspected to be dissolute, nor found affected to vanities, esteming it to
belong to ye dignity of her place and virtue, to show no less integrity in
example, then to be void of lightness in life. Oftentimes her husband Odenatus
has been heard confess, that after she was once conceived, she would never
suffer his actual company, for that it brought stain to her chastity,
holding it to belong to women to marry more for the respect of procreation and
children, then to accomplish their pleasures. She did eat but once a day and
spoke little, which made her body disposed, and her mind lively. She could
drink no wine, but was so curious to seek for pleasant waters, that for the
price she might have provided the most precious wynes. As Soon as the kings of
Egypt and other Princes conspiring understood of the death of her husband, they
dispatched Ambassadors, not so much to visit and comfort her, as to offer
league and confederacy with her, so redouted was she by reason of her rare
virtue.) Aurelius at that time being chosen Emperor of Rome, made great
provision to pass into Asia, to make war upon Queen Zenobia, being an
enterprise not of the least importance to the Romans. Wherein he found such
smarting effect of her virtue, and invincible valiancie of her soldiers, that
he saw great difficulty to conquer her by Arms. And therefore assayed the
remedy of sweet words and promises in this short letter following.

Aurelius Emperor of Rome, and Lord of all Asia, to the honorable Queen
Zenobia.
Aurelius the Emperor of Rome writes to the Queen of Zenobia.
ALbeit to women standing in disobedience as thou do, it can not but be
unworthy to minister requests: yet considering clemency is a virtue nothing
inferior to justice, I thought good to offer to thee the choice, assuring thee
that if thou will take the benefit of my mercy, I will give honor to thy
person, and pardon to thy people. The gold, the silver, and thy other treasure
remaining in thy palace, shall not be diminished, nor thy self divided from
thy kingdom of Palmerine, which I give thee during thy life, and after to be
disposed at thy pleasure, under this condition that thou resign thy other
kingdoms and Provinces in Asia, and acknowledge supremacy in the Empire of
Rome: and of thy people of Palmerina I demand no other obedience, then as
confederates and friends. So that, if under these conditions thou will dissolve
thy Camp, thou shall receive reconcilement to the obedience of Rome, and
retain certain men of war sufficient for the surety of thy person, and
service of thy Realm. Of thy two sons left by Odenatus thy husband, thou
shall keep (...) with thee him whom thou love best, and send ye other to me,
not that I will lead him prisoner, but keep him as a pawn of thy behavior.
And for the prisoners retained on both sides, they shall be redeliuered in
enterchange without ransom. And so I acknowledge thee happy more by fortune
then by virtue. This Letter bringing no amaze to the mind of Zenobia, she gave
present answer as follows.

Zenobia Queen of the Palmerines, and Lady of whole Asia and the kingdoms
thereof, to Aurelius Emperor of Rome greeting. etc.
THat thou give to thy self the title of Emperor of the Romans, The answer
of Queen Zenobia to the Emperors letter.
I hold it both just and convenient: But to make thee Lord over the realms of
the East, I say there is neither reason nor right: Since thou art not ignorant
that those kingdoms are due to me only, the one part discending by right of
progeny, and the other I have won by my prowes and virtue. Thou say that
if I yield obedience to thee, thou will give me recompense of great honor, and
join forgiveness to the faults of my people: There can be no necessity of
pardon, where is no fault committed.
to the one I say there is no necessity of remission, where has been no fault
committed, nor in thee is any power to forgive, against whom could be no
possibility of offense. And for the other, it could not be either honest or
just, that being as I am absolute to command over Asia, I should as private be
brought to the service of Rome. Thou offrest to leave me possessed of the gold,
the silver, and my other treasure within my palace: wherein I can not but
wonder with what grace thou can aspire to dispose the goods of an other as
thine own: things which thine eyes shall not see, nor thy hands touch, for
that I hope that before thou come to be the executor of my goods in Asia, I
shall make liberality of all thy riches in Rome.

Touching the war thou have areared against me, it is iniust before the
immortal Gods, and most unreasonable in the reason of men: seeing thou
fightest not to resist an injury but to invade an innocent: And I take arms
to repulse a wrong, and defend my right. So that thy coming into Asia is but
to ravish the goods of an other, where my sword is drawn to keep innocents
from oppression. Think not that the name of the Romans is terrible to me, nor
that the face of thy huge host can amaze me: for, if it be in thy hand to give
the battle, The success of wars follows the innocence of the quarrel.
in the Gods is the authority to dispose the victory, and the success of
wars for the most part follows not the number and courage of the soldiers,
but has regard to the justice and innocence of the quarrel. That I attend
thee in the field, is no small glory to me, where thou inuading a wydow,
reapest nothing but shame. The cause of Widows are protected by the Gods, to
who^ it belongs to abate the pride of the rauishor, and retain to themselves
the revenge of desolate persons. But if the Gods suffer thee to be victor,
and that the fury of thy ambicion take away my life and goods, yet in Rome it
shall be published, as it is in Asia known, that Zenobia is made a sacrifice for
the defense of her patrimony, and to preserve the honor of her husband.
Therefore cease henceforth to threat, fear, or flatter me, since I am resolute
to offer under one devotion, my life and my kingdom. Wherein in doing as much
as I am able, I do more then I ought, esteming it better to leave a monument of
my virtue, then to live with shame. And if my fortune give me up into thy
hands, she world shall bear me witness that though my body be led captive, yet
my heart shall not be vanquished: to send thee my son to lead with thee to
Rome, is so far from his profit and my reputation, that I hold it necessary
to break thy request, though in thee was no conscience to make it: For that I
hear thy court is replemished with many vices, where my palace is furnished
with sundry Philosophers, from whom my children draw doctrine one part of yt
day, and exercise the knowledge of arms the other part. And so I repose more
in my virtue, then thy fortune is able to do for thee. This answer bred such
passion in ye mind of ye Emperor, that within thirty days he forced ye city
by assalte, and took ye Queen prisoner, whom he led to Rome, not with inte^tion
to execute her, but to adorn his triumph, suffering her to follow his Chariot
barefoot and chained with her children: which was a spectacle grievous to many,
but of great compassion even to the Ladies of Rome, who after ye ceremonies of
the triumph were past, made great reverence and resort to her, honoring her
with their service and presents of no small price, thinking them right worthily
bestowed, for that in ye person of that Queen they judged were assembled, the
fidelity of Policene, ye beauty of Helene, the chastity of Lucresse, the
constancy of Penelope, and the knowledge and Science of Cornelia. Thus your
Majesty has the discourse of this noble Queen, in whom ye matter that most I
find worthy of compassion, is, that her fortune was not equal to her virtue.

Touching diseases and the discommodities which old age brings.
IT is a virtuous disposition to yield compassion to the afflicted, but nature
most of all challenges it of those, who having proved an estate of necessity,
have found comfort in others. And albeit kind has brought forth no man
without an inclination to infirmities. Yet God being privy to the weakness of
his creatures, has appointed to every calamity his proper cure, and raised
one man to minister comfort to an other: which makes me now have recourse to
you, not so much to complain my griefs which you were wont to ease, as to
lament my old age which is not to be shifted of. Cicero, in his discourse De
senectute, ministers great consolations, and speaks many things in the
praise of old age, but he appoyntes no remedy, not for that he would not, but
because he thought it was incurable. Wherein speaking for the generality of
men, I think there are none who had not rather have one remedy, then all his
consolations: That comfort is vain that takes not away the grief.
seeing those comfortes which take not away the grief are improper and vain,
not unlike to a medicine which is sweet to the taste of the patient, but
remoues not the pain of his disease. In his argument also of Tusculane
questions he goes about to prove that a wiseman has no feeling of sorrow and
grief, and if he suffer any, he has mean to shake it of by his virtue. But
who feels in deed the calamities of old age, is further pinched then that his
wisdom only can cure them, or his virtue avoid them, since old age bringes
forth nothing but infirmities, grief, and sorrow, no more then the black
thorn, The fruits of old age are infirmities, grief and sorrow.
who, how so ever he is grafted will yield nothing but pricks: So that let old
men have more recourse to medcines to qualify their aches, then to
Philosophers who yield nothing but words.

Cicero proves that old age is good, by the Scipions and Metelles, and in the
persons of Fabius and Crassus, with many other Romans at that time in great
honor. But I think he meddled only with their felicities and prosperities, and
touched nothing of the chollors and perplexities which travel such as fall
into the last age. Adam was wise and well esteemed, and yet he saw his two
children one kill an other. Noe was just, and yet in his time the world
perished and he scorned of his proper children. Abraham was a faithful
servant of God, and yet he was divided from his country and wandered in pain
and poverty. And Jacob was a great personage and rich, but his children
selling him that was most dear to him, made him complain of the wickedness of
his days being then a hundredth and thirty years. All these were Patriarchs
and beter favored of God then either Metellus or Fabius, and yet there is no
doubt but with their great age, they were passible to tribulations and
passions, old age being no other thing then a vessel whose licour being
run out, Old age like a dry vessel.
the Caske becomes dry, and withers. And albeit those good men have not been
alone in their pains and afflictions, for that it is common to all such as
live long to suffer the diseases that age brings: Yet I compare not our
travels in this our life, with the temptations of the holy Patriarchs and
Martirs, who illumined by the holy Ghost, have suffered persecutions for the
militant Church: For that God did so deal with his servant, was in an other
respect, to prove their faith, patience, and constancy, to the end by their
example, we might have mean of conformity thereunto.

But if those peculiar and elect personages have been traveled with the
dollors of old age, much more are the perplexities of others, in whom flesh and
nature bear more dominion, and spirit and grace have less force. The sentence
of Job condemning himself to live little and that in great anguish, is executed
daily upon every one of us, but specially upon old folks, whom we see carry
an ordinary subjection to poverty, diseases, death of friends and parents,
to miseries, infelicities, with many aduersaties naturally tied to the
affliction of age according to the sentence of Job. Yea old age is no other
thing then the example of sorrow and care, Old age no other thing then the
example of sorrow and care
the effect of sickness and infirmites, the retraite of thoughts and dollors,
the image of calamity, the spoil of mirth and solace, the very figure of
hell, and for the rest, nothing but fleame and choler.

But where Cicero pretendes a praise of old age by reason of the temperance
that is in it not to be subject to pleasures with other vices of youth: Old
men forvvard in will, but weak in action.
It may be asked him whether old men use this temperance for want of will, or
for lack of power, old age for the most part bearing a vehement inclination to
things whereunto the body has least possibility of action. And albeit
temperance shines with a clear light in many old men of respect: yet we see in
most of them such a dry desire and devotion to the sportes and actions of
youth, that being not hable to execute their will, yet they declare what they
would do, if there were not infirmities. So that I see not how that body can
be temperate whose mind is not qualified, nor that person to be restrained
whose appetites are at liberty, It is none other thing to commau^d the body,
then first to conquer the affections.
seeing it is no other thing to command the body, then first to conquer the
affections. Therefore let it be a shame to an old man to have desire to that
which the force and strength of nature deny him to execute.

What reckoning of temperance is there to be made in old men, since their
stomachs being weak they are the more subject to surfeit: their minds fiery,
and their bodies dry, Su^fets and other innituities in old men.
their substance is nothing but fume: their years make them credulous,
suspicious, ambicious, malicious, covetous and forgetful, carrying them withal
into every passion of nature, and that more by the fury of their age (being a
burden intolerable) then that they weigh things according to justice, order
and reason: Men in many respects and at many times more light in sense and
judgment, then settled in grauetie and counsel, borowing credit by their
years, and wanting that experience which many young men have of less
continuance. It is an ordinary speech with many of these old men, that if they
were to begin again, and that in their youth they had known that which the
success of years has brought to them, they would live after an other
government, and do otherwise then they have done. So that for one young man
that has not done that which he ought, there be many old men that would do
more if they could, to whom it is proper to show a will above the power and
possibility of their bodies, even like to a Drayne Be, whose sting being shot
yet he flies up and down homming as though he were hable to do more harm.

Cicero in vain prayseth old age for his nearenesse to the other perpetual
and happy life, as for the hope they have to visit the spirits of good men
already laid up in rest: Seeing we see all men eschew that journey, being more
natural to the creatures of nature to prolong life, then to be officers in
that fatal visitation. Yea Cicero himself, sought to avoid it when he was
surprised by his enemies, who compelled him to go that journey which he had so
much commended, and so little desired. The greatest fear that old men have is
to die.


It is in vain to desire longer life when we see nothing but present
certeintie of death, and yet the greatest care of old men is to keep them
from death, and their greatest fear to fall into his hands: Yea it is this
care that depriues them of the residue of the felicities of this life: For that
the desires of the flesh are so sweeee and importunate, that naturally we
desire to establish a perpetuity of our being here, though it be contrary to
the eternal ordinance, and impossible to the power of kind and nature. For, by
how much we seek to make our life long, by so much do we shorten it: and by
how much we think it increases and aduaunceth, The life of man but a buble
of water.
by so much does it decline and abate, the life of man being none other thing
then as a bubble of water, which swelling with a vain wynd, vanishes even
when he is at his greatest.

If an old man will use the authority of his age, he is intolerable, and
every one escheweth him: and of the contrary if he play the young man, he is
an ill example, and every one mockes him. The old man is to do no service, for
that he has no power: neither is he to be served for that he is troublesome
and passioned. He is no companion for young men, for that to his years
belonges too great ceremony, and even to old men he is troublesome by the very
properties and impediments of his age subject to hemming, spitting, coughing,
and many other loathsome dispositions. If they be poor, their parents
disdain them, and being rich, they are thought to live too long for their
heirs and successors. They spend much and get little, they speak often, and do
seldom: Yea their covetousness increases with their years, which is the
greatest corruption that can happen to man. Old age the co^sumption of the life
of man.
So that I see not by what reason Cicero could so much commend old age, being
the very dregs and consumption of the life of man whom he makes subject to
all diseases: which makes me of opinion, that if there be any age in man
worthy of praise, it is more due to youth then to old age: For that the one is
fair and the other deformed: Differences between our old age and youth.
the one is sound, and the other diseased: the one disposed, the other froward:
the one strong, the other weak. And youth is apt to all exercises, but the
delites of age are resolved into plaintes, passions and dollors: So that, ye
one being necessary, and the other intolerable, the one full of grief, and
the other free from passion: I see no particular dignity due to old age other
then in reverence, and much less how the consolations of Cicero can minister
remedies, since most old men do feel their infirmities with more grief and
bitterness, then that words only can give them remedy.

One friend writes to an other of the rage of Envy, and the nature thereof.
SVch is the infirmity of the present season that men of virtue rising into
favor, find envy to hinder their merit, Envy an enemy to virtue.
and malice to minister recompense to their painful deserts, envy being
always such an enemy to virtue, that where it can not oppress it, yet will
it lie in wait to suppress the glory thereof. There is no felicity so well
assured, nor estate so modest, which is not subject to the invasion of envy:
For that envy being none other thing then a branch of injustice, Envy a
branch of injustice.
it stirs up the thoughts to wicked purposes, and arms the hands to actions
of iniquity. The envious man has no respect either to the virtue or fortune
of any, but to the good things that are in them, not rejoicing so much in the
goods that are his own, as in the damage and hurt he does to others: his
office stretching chiefly to desire that no good thing happen to an other.
Yea, he will not stick to suffer hurt himself upon condition to make his
neighbor feel more harm, according to the Poetical example following,

Jupiter, disposed to survey the estate of the world, A poetical example of
an inuious man and a covetous man.
sent down for that purpose one of his Angels disguised in the form of a
man, whom he ordained to fall first into fellowship with two men trauailers on
the way as it seemed, and in that respect not the less convenient for his
company. They performed together many days iourneys with those delites and
fortunes which happen to such as wander countries. In the end the Angel having
drawn from them all those things he required to satisfy his desire,
disclosed unto them whose messenger he was, and having power to dispose of the
liberality of Jupiter, he said that for their good company he would give
them present recompense. Whereupon he willed them to ask what they would, and
who made the first demand should not only have fully all that he required,
but the other should have forthwith double as much. The one of these two
trauaylers was a covetous man, and the other an envious man, between whom this
offer of the Angel bred no small contention. For, the covetous man, who
dwelles always insatiable in the desire of gain, would not make the first
demand, having regard to the words of the Angel promising double to the
second. The envious man, on the otherside, whose condition is to desire that no
good happen to an other, used scilence, determining rather to loase the
benefit of the first demand, then that his companion should enjoy the double
of his gain. Oh infinite malice and corruption of men in whom even the
certainty of benefit breeds emulation: the one not contented to have more
then he looked for, and the other not satisfied though he had all: the one
afraid to demand least his friend should find favor, and the other disdayning
that the benefit should be divided: The one greedy to get the profit of both:
the other for spite brought mischief to both. The one wretched in scilence,
the other miserable in envy. The one devilish in covetousness, the other
accursed in hatred. The one insatiable in desire, and the other infinite in
malice. They both had appetite to drink, and yet both languished in thirst.
They both saw likelihode to get, and yet both suffered loss, not for that they
needed, but because their corruption so required. For, being in this conflict
who should ask first, and that of necessity a demand must be made, the
envious man, thinking by the sufferance of a simple harm in himself, to bring
double hurt to his fellow, desired of the Angel that one of his eyes might
be put out, wherewith at the instant he lost one eye, and his companion was
made blind of both. So that where the one refused to be satisfied with that
which sufficed, the other was raised as a scourge of his insatiable desires,
and the one as wretched in spite, as his companion in covetousness, the one
became the just instrument of revenge to another: A justice of due force
against such as strive in the quarrel of envy and covetousness, both which,
being contagious infections in the nature of man, the one poysoneth his soul,
and the other consumes and dries up his body: of all other vices in the world,
envy is the most ancient, of most custom, Envy a vice most ancient.
and of greatest continuance, yea even to the end of the world. It took
beginning in the serpent. It was familiar with Came. It has continued from
Adam to all the posterities of Jacob and Esau, Saul and David, and Job and his
progeny with many other, whose mutual persecutions moved not so much by their
great kingdoms, riches, and principalities, as for the envy they bare one to
an other, (envy being of a nature to conspire against the virtues) Fortune,
and glory of others: So that greater is the grudge that deriues from envy,
then ye dispite discending of injuries: For, it happens oftentimes that the man
that is wronged, does either dissemble or forget: But who is settled in envy,
leaves nothing undone that may advance the revenge, (envy being none other
thing then a disdain and contempt of an other man's glory,) as was well
expressed by the factions and quarelles between Caesar and Pompei, who fought
not so often for any private injury offered by either of them, as for the
mutual dispite they bare to their common fortune and glory. (Envy always
bearing more malice to ye virtues and glory of men, Envy bears more malice to
the virtues of men then to their goods.
then to their fortunes or goods): It is a canker that spreds into al
co^plexions, and a blood sturring in all sorts of men: For if he be a good man,
his virtues make him subject to envy, and if he be wicked, his vices make him
envious, The best remedy against envy is to forbear to be virtuous.
so that of what temper so ever our condition is, we are either disfauored by
envy, or else we persecute others for envy. And therefore ye best remedy
against envy, is to forbear to be virtuous, or at least to estrange our
selves from prosperity that no man contemn us, and live contented with
adversity not disdaining ye happiness of others: we need have no enco^bra^ce with
ye proud man so long as we make our selves equal with him. We need not be
infected by the lechour, if we hold no conversation with him. It is hard to
avoid the eyes of the envious man
We need not fear the quareller, if we expostulate no words with him: nor
be in danger of the covetous man, so long as we ask nothing of him. But it
is hard to avoid the eyes of the envious man, for that if we climb into favor,
he will epsy us, and if we fall infortune he will make us contemn and murmr.
Yea, there is no Sea which he sails not over, no kingdom which he inuades
not, no power to resist him, nor man hable to avoid him. It bears no regard to
the mightiest Prince, nor pity to the meanest subject. It favors no man for
his force, nor flattereth any for his beauty. It spited the wisdom of
Solomon and riches of Cressus. It despised the liberality of Alexander, and
prowes of Hector. It controlled the eloquence of Cicero, and envied the fortune
of Augustus, and bare malice to the justice of Traian. All which grave and
noble personages were not so replenished with graces and dignities, Envy
denies to give renoum to such as are dead.
as pursued with nombers of envious eyes: Yea envy does not only persecute men
that live, but it denies renoume to such as are dead. Envy to virtue,
jealousy to favor, and adversity to prosperity, are so joined together by
nature, that the one follows the other as the shadow does the man. And as
nature and conscience carry us to owe compassion to such as be poor and
miserable: so ambicion and corruption lead us in envy against those that
stand in fortune and favor. This being one proof of the malice of the world,
that to such as are down, none will lend their hand to help them up again,
and to those that stand in grace, many are the espials to bring them out of
favor. Therefore let such as are rich and mighty be assured yt by how much
great they are in place and dignity, by so much more are they subject to
suspitio^s and envy. There be certain Brotherhods of envy whose principal
office is to bury men quick, and uncover bodies that are dead, and to those
brotherhoodes belong these lyberties and prerogatives: They say no ill of the
poor, but speak at large of the rich: Custom of the en^ious (...)
They minister no succors themselves, and restreine others from Charity: They
have minds void of all compassion, but ready hands to receive all that
comes: They never speak without murmr, nor use scilence without pretense of
malice: They are suspicious of their enemies, and Traitors to their friends:
They seek not to salve what is a miss, but are diligent supplantors of men of
virtue. Lastly, all that they say is spoken in malice and murmr, but they do
nothing according to truth and good meaning: That more safe were it to hold
conversation with a Tyrant then with a man possessed with envy, for that the one
takes a way but the life, and the other persecutes the renoume and glory: The
tyrant has couller of justice to all that he does, but the envious man under
pretense of service and frenshippe supplantes the merit of the virtuous even
like the Snake who lying secretly under the grass, shootes out his sting when
he is least feared: Hermocatus the last tyrant in Scicilia at the very instant
of his death, Recommended unto his son, that he should not accustom himself
to hatred or malice, but rather labor to live so well, that his virtues might
make him envied, since to be malicious expresses a spirit of the Devil, but
to be despised for virtue, is a sweet passion and not without his proper
comfort. And so he willed his son not to leave of to do well for any murmr
or spite of the people: For that besides that virtue was a thing that was
hable to give him immortality: To virtue also was joined this operation, that
when she gives out her beams and brightness, even her enemies are confounded,
or at least yield to her glory: For virtue taking courage of her proper
riches, Virtue has no need of praise.
cares not for the favor of the multitude, for that she has no need of praise.

One friend reproves an other, for that of a Gentleman, he is become a
merchant: This Letter tends to the rebuke of Covetousness.
I Have hitherunto made it seen to ye world that I loved you with great
jealousy, not for that I saw you ill inclined, but because I feared you
should fall into ill Council, the time ministering to wicked spirits great
facility to abuse such as stand not environed with good advise. Wherein as I
have always lived in care and study of your well doing, esteeming it so much
the more to my felicitye and comfort, by how much I saw you happy in virtue
and fortune: So your outward towardness to all good things took away all
suspicion of ill desires, even as in green leaves appearing in the outward
branches, is good testimone that the tree is not dry or dead within. But as in all other things of the world, so in the customs of men chiefly is found most
detection, incertaintie, and change: which being true in you, in whom was least
necessity, so to you more then any other is most justice of reprofe: for that
the familiar respect and conjecture of your life promised on thing, and the
inward operation of your mind practiced an other. Oftentimes have I told you
that, to forget to revenge injuries and remember to requite benefits received:
to bear favor to good men and give justice to ill men: to bestow good
tournes upon such as are present, and speak well by those that are absent:
Means to wake a man be called good.
And to esteem little the losses of fortune and to make great account of the
reputation of honor: be things necessarily due to that man that amongst the
good will be holden for good. But to be rash to revenge wrongs, and unthankful
to minister recompense, to oppress just men and advance the wicked: to
backbyte such as are out of sight, and not be liberal to those that are
present: And to bear heauely the chances of fortune, and weigh in light
balaunce the loss of honor: Are dispositions improper to good men, and guides
that fail not to lead their folowers into perpetual contempt and infamy. Of
this last sort, I will not accuse you for that my affection caryeth my judgment
into parcialitie: neither can I excuse you, unless I will be guilty in the
office of a friend, considering wythall the report that goes of your late
change from a Gentleman following service, to a Merchant, making bargains: a
thing so much the more grievous to your friends, by how much it is slanderous
to you, and so much the less honorable for a Gentleman, by how much it is an
office Compounded upon the spoils and ruins of good men. Accursed is that
office wherein you desire to live pore, to the end to dye rich. And ten times
accursed is that trade by the which one wicked man seeks to accomplish his
Covetousness to the prejudice of many good men: I will not upbraid you with
your predecessors, to whose virtue and glory you do manifest injury: But I
can not but advertise you of the infamy which your covetousness will leave to
your succession and posterity: wherein albeit to one so careless of his honor,
there is no hope that council can be acceptable, and that the covetous man in
his own weening seems to have no necessity of advise: Yet I wish you
remember that as the rasor though he be te^pered with his due proportion of
steel if he pass not by the grindstone to give him an edge, is unapt to cut.
So there is no man so ripe in forecast nor ready in wit and policy, who from
one time to an other stands not in need of direction: Yea, Many things are of
that qualetie that the wisdom of man suffizeth not to assure them.
many times we see wise men fail and err, not for want of wisdom, but
because things are of that qualetie that the wisdom of man suffiseth not to
assure them. And therefore it beehoues men not to be Obstynate in will nor
Particular in Opinion, but too join to their doings the Aduertisementes of
others, For the better sewertie and success of their business: consider that
the theatries or scaffoldes of this world whereon we Children of vanity do
walk, have their foundations upon sand, and therefore their strength is but
frail. Yea, though the pillors be of Gold, and holden up with Images of
kings, God has communicated all things to men saving immortality.
yet they are subject to shake and fall even into the same golphes and bottomes
which in other ages have devoured the treasures of their predecessors. God has
communicated all things to men, saving immortallitye which he has reserved to
himself for that he does never die, and has set men in an estate of casualtie
and frayltie, for that in the end all things take end: Only the good and
ill renoume of men aspire greatly to perpetuity, Good and ill renoume live
ever.
for that they stand free from fortune, and prevail even over the
remembrance of time: The persons determine, but their renoume lives ever: the
bodies resolve to dust, and out of that is raised an air which blows abroad
the reports of their lives: Let no man believe in the world, for that it has
a custom to hyde under a litte Gold, a great deal of Dross: Deceits of the
world.
under a resemblaunce of truth, it leads us in many deceiptes and to our very
few and short delytes, it ioynes infinite greifs and displeasures. To whom it
shows most favor in him is most peril of destruction, For that the
allurementes of the world be but baytes to beguile such as byte them, and who
serves the world in disdain and mockery, finds his recompense most just and
true, where to him that loves it indeed, it ministers rewards in scorn.
Finally in our most sewer sleep it awakes us with greatest peril: And when we
think our estate best established, it is then we are nearest our overthrow
and ruin. How many have we seen that with no small care have traveled all
the days of their life to enriche their son whom they loved best, and yet
there comes an heir whom they thought not vppsn, who with great delight
reioyseth in the fruit and use of all their paynefull travels: It is a just
Sentence, that such as have beguyled many, Gods justice goes by measure.
should reap the recompense of their abuses, since Gods justice goes by
measure, and has regard to the equity of things without Parciallitie to
persons. It is no indifferency that that which a wicked Father has heaped for
on heir alone by the prejudice of many goodmen, should be enjoyed by him many
years: for that the line to measure all things ought to be equal, and goods
gotten by shyfte are for the most part lost with shame: the same falling out in
common experience, that what the wicked Father wins with study and sorrow, the
vnthryftie son wastes in Solace and Negligence. The prodigal son scorns
at the sighs of the covetous Eather.
And what the one Plants in toil and care, the other remooues in ease and
welfare, being a Law in Gods justice that the Prodigal Son should scorn
at the sighs of his Covetous Father. You seem (according to the figure of the
Scripture,) for the silling of one Patte of Water, to wade continually wetshood
in the lake of this miserable World: You dry up the noritour of your brain
with the fume of sighs: You break your body with the toils of this life, and
adventure your honor to fill but one Jar or Pitcher with Water: and yet,
like as for the time you live, it will not quench your appetite, so in the end
you will be driven to dye of Thirst, and the Pot which with so great pain
you have filled in your life, shall after your death be broken against the
walls of a prodigal heir, He is not rich that possesses much.
who will laugh to see it run as a river, and rejoice to water the streates
with the Riches that you Locked full dearly in your sewrest Chestes. Remember,
that he is not Rich that possesses much goods, but he whose desires are
satisfied, and his mind contented. Covetousness makes the horders to be hated
and liberalitye draws love to the spender.
The liberal man lives in best security, for that his liberality continues
his friends, and reclaimes his enemies: And Gold and Silver give better
renoume to those that spend them, then to such as hoard them up, for that
covetousness makes the hoarders to be hated, where liberalitye draws love
to the spender. By these I wish you to be advised, that gain and getting are
weak pillors to uphold good name, Honor and covetousness of themselves
contrary.
for that Covetousness and honor are of themselves contrary, and can hold no
congruencie together in one man. All the vices of this world have in
themselves some taste, except Covetousness, which bringes grief for the
goods that others have, and Jealousy and suspicion for the riches that are
even under our own hands. For, to be rich, it belonges also to have the
fruition of riches, the same giving pleasure to such as can take it, as the
possession serves to such as can use it. The perplexities of the covetous man
are to suspect his Servants, Perplexities of the covetous man.
and distrust his kindred, to set Espyalles over his Wife, and doubt his
Children, to be fearful of the thief, and to be Jealous even of his own
shaddowe: Yea he is so miserable, that he settes more guard of his money then
of his person. He takes no pleasure but in casting his Reckoninges, in Compting
his Silver, in Selling his Wares, and in multiplying his Commodities, esteeming
it as his Paradise, to be always gayning and never spending, to be always
winninig and never loasing, to be always receiving and never lending, and to
be always getting as though he should never dye. But when there is question to
disburse money, though it be for things necessary: Oh, then he is as far
from modestye, as he is full of malice, accursing to the Devil both Wife,
Children, and Family, and in that Passion he esteems such to deceive him
most, in whom he has greatest reason to repose Confydence, and who in deed
are the best Stewardes, and Husbands of his commodityes. So that if Covetous
men would Consider what a sweet thing Lyberalitye is, they would turn their
desires to gain much, into a disposition to geeue more, for that, it is not of
so great value that which the Liberal man does geeue, as is his recompense:
Seeing that for the pleasure he does to any, he is to Redemaunde the Trybute
of his Liberty. Yea, the Liberal man is the Lord over those People where he
lives, and the leader of all such as have to do with him: Dispraises in the
covetous nigarde.
For that their Recompense being certain, there are none will deny him their
Service: Where, to the Nygarde and Covetous man, where one will hear him,
many will fear him: where none will speak to him, many will avoid him:
Where none will geeue him any thing, many will practice against him: Where none
will visitte him, many will abhor him, where none will employe him, many will
accurse him: Yea, who will Demand any thing of the Covetous man that denies
all things to himself? or how has he a mind to succor Strangers that is
not touched in Conscience to suffer his own to Starve? Many Covetous men do
we see now a days to whom God geeues Power to get Riches, Pollecye to keep
them, Hearts to defend them, Life to possess them, but not Lybertye to
rejoice and use them: So that though they be Lords over the Riches of others,
yet they are Slaves even to that which themselves Possess. Wherein I am of
Opinyon, that by so much more Excellent is Honest Poverty then Cursed
Covetousness: By how much the Poor man is contented with Little, Poverty
more excelent then Covetousness.
where to the Richeman a great deal seems nothing. And therefore what mind
can be more Miserable then to sighe for the goods of an other, more by
desire then by default? The greedy mind caryeth no Disposition to Spend
upon his Parents and friends, seeing, he accomptes that Stolen which he
employeth of himself: Therefore it is a false Witness to call the covetous
man rich, since it is not he that has riches, but rather riches are masters
of him: For the which he takes no small pain to get them, uses as great care
to keep them, and suffers no less grief to forgo them: Yea I account not
the covetous rich men so happy, as the pore labourer and deluer of the earth:
For that with his mattocke the one draws relief and noriture out of the
earth, and the other wretchedly hydes in the earth his treasure and felicity,
and how secretly so ever it is hyd, yet he stands not so suspicious of any as
of himself: For, if he have two keys to his Chest to keep his money from
stealing, he suffers ten cares in his heart to keep him from spending: So
that the care being great to keep, and the grief no less to loase, I wish
all men well advised how they begin to get, since to save a little of their
wealth, they are subject to put in hazard much of their honor. Therefore who
will be revenged of a richeman, can wish him no greater passion then to live
long: For that greater is the penance by his long life in covetousness, then
any other revenge that can be taken of him. Great is that ambicion, and
slanderous that covetousness, which neither for shame of the world, nor for
fear of death is restrained or moderated, and ten times great is the abuse
of him, who having no necessity, seeks to exchange contentment for care,
solace for sorrow, liberty for bondage, pleasure for pain, and watching for
sleeping: Yea accursed is that man that falls from the reputation of service in
wars, to the profession of broakage in martes and Marchaundise: And
forbearing to climb hills and mountains to resist the enemy, is contented
to keep the valley, and Rob his Countrymen that be passengers: even like to
many old men, who when they wax weak in force without, seek to grow strong
in malice within. By these (Sir) I wish you to consider what Dampnable office
you have taken in hand, and into what discredible Opinions you are grown, with
bringing to your friends no small grief, and to your self a lamentable
infamy. I advise you, for end, to change your mind, seeing it is easier to
suffer yt want of wealth the^ to dissemble the abuse of honor.

A Letter in consolation declaring the discommodities of anger, and the
benefits of patience.
I Would you were as good a Physician as I know you to be a true christian:
then would you either use the proper remedy to infelicities, which is
patience, or at least shake of the heaviness of your misfortune, which justly
beecomes a wiseman: For, as to all natural infirmities afflicting the body,
physic is able to aforde cures proper and convenient: So, when tribulations
happen and the mind, is traveled, the man of God will not contest or argue
why he is visited, but look up to the will of the Lord, with, whom our
medicines are already compounded, though not sweet and pleasant to our
taste, yet necessary and profitable to our salvation and health: And albeit
oftentimes he deals not with us as we would and look for, yet we find from
time to time that he trauelleth to our remedy, and knowing best the humor that
offendes us, he can in due season apply the medecin that best works to our
delivery: And therefore when we are in tribulation and seem to ask of God in
vain, we ought not forthwith to enter into murmr, but to weigh with that
little he denies us then, the many graces he has granted us before, (it being
to great an unthankfulness to forget the many blessings we have received,
and being denied but small things, to raise great complaynies against him.)
But as a mischief known of before and diligently looked for, is not so
grievous as when it comes upon a suddeyne: So for that I have always known
you to be resolute in the chances of time and fortune, I hope you stand now
in least necessity of Council, when there is most occasion of courage or
virtue, esteeming it all one to foresee a mischief, when you are sewer of the
remedy. And yet because Afflictions are the true Touch stoanes to try the
Affections of Friends, I thought good to offer myself to Communicate with
you, not in direction, for that I know you hable and well advised, but in
Council, which being faithfully given, ought to find no season unapt to be
received.

Every new mutation of mind bringes with it a new care.
Like as in experience of Worldly things, every new mutation bringes with it
for the present a new care, and leaves notwythstanding the mind in greater
sewertie at last: So, for your part, if you knew the necessity of afflietions
and your own debilitie: If you considered well, of fortune, and her chaunges:
If you weighed men with their malices: And discerned between the world and
his allurementes: you would not suffer heaviness for that which is necessary,
nor seek your succoures in things that entertain your misery, since it is
more miserable to be with out virtue, then to be afflicted: Such is the subtle
malice of the world, that the less heed men give to it, the more does it
prepare to strike them, to the end to give them afterward a greater wound.
Many men sound and disposed, dye sooner of diseases newely grown, then the
weak that have languished many years in their infirmities: And therefore,
seeing it is most sewer that the wretched man can not pass without myserie,
he is more Wise that can taste his trauelles by little and little, then he
that tries them al together: For that, many things are Eaten by morsels,
which if they wear Swallowed together, He is wise that feels his travels by
little and little.
would bring Peril of Stranglinge: Even so at sundry times we suffer many
perplexities, which if they should travel us all at once, our frayltie wear
too weak to resist them, for that they would devour us all in one day. So
that seeing God has so ordained that what we hold our selves most sewer of,
we see oftentimes suffer most Peril. Why do we complain of want of rest
when we have undertaken a Journey weary and troublesome? Why do we think
much to stomble, having chosen a stoanie way? How can we think to sleep
in security, when in the seames of our Bed be sown thoughts and cares?
Lastly there is no reason to think we should be free in Heaven, seeing we
stand bound to the World. There is no more Power in fortune to assure
things, then in the Sea to be calm, being Subject to the Wyndes. And no
more Authority has she to dispose things then the simple Maryner, that
committes his Sails to the Wind, which dryueth his Ship not whether he
would, but whether the Waves and Wind do shooue her. It is an infallible
rule, All natural things are subject to change
that all Natural courses are Subject to mutation every year, and all
Worldely men that hunte after Fortune, are sewer to suffer Eclipse every
moment. So that seeing Natural things (being necessary) can not reteyne
always one essence and being: It is most just that the goods of fortune
perish which are superfluous.

I am sorry for your miseaduenture, as if it had happened to my self: And
more sorry that I can not as I would make known with what heart I bear
compassion to you: Since it is one principal office amongst Friends to
Communicate in fortunes, and though their persons be divided, yet to exercise
Community of council, comfort, and remedy. So that having no possibility
to come to you (standinge Subject to the Service of the Prince:) and less
expectation of relief (being not hable to minister to mine own wantes) I
thought to use the industry of my Pen to declare the disposition of my
heart, hoping you will accept that that is, and look for no more then may be:
and where in giving you advise to make no reckoning of that is happened, you
may perhaps take occasion to think, that either I know not the grauetie of
the chance, or else that I esteem you to have want of judgment. I cannot but
confess to hold this opinion that albeit you are subject to passion as a man,
yet your discression makes you hable to suffer and dissemble according to
reason and wisdom: For that, as in many injuries there is more security to
dissemble then to revenge: In many injuries there is more security to disse^ble
a wrong then to reunge it.
So when the might of our adversary preuayles above our power, the best
Council is to suffer, seeing there is no possibility to revenge. Therefore,
if in the present wrongs you suppose you have received, you will consider the
office of a Christian, and forget the Passion of a Persecutor, you will not so
much beeholde the malice of him that pursues you, as the justice of God that
suffers it, in whose presence you stand so guyltie and laden with Sin,
that this Affliction ought not to seem heavy, considering the grievous
merittes of your life past. For, if we weygh in one Balaunce, our old
offenses, and the Punnishements we feel, we shall find our pains far
inferior to our wicked merittes, and our offenses rather touched with a mylde
justice, then strayned to a due Correction: We may note also in Gods manner of
visitation, a merciful difference he uses between the Reprobate, and People
peculiarly chosen to himself: For, to the one their myseries are but Stumbling
blocks to make them fall further: And in the other, they work repentance with
many other perfections: Sewer, it belonges not to Christians to murmr at his
Cross, nor grudge to bear it, seeing his hand is not heavier then his mercy
plentiful: Yea he visits the afflicted with the same comfort that the
Physician does his Patient, and succoureth the distressed as we see he
relieueth the dry and thirsty ground with the dew and drops of heaven: So yt
let every one acknowledge that ye tribulations which God suffers, are not
blocks to make us stumble, nor heavy burdens whose weight may make us fall,
but they be furnaces necessary to refine our faith, and instruments working
to our perfection, wherein who remaynes not constant to the end can not be
made pure metal: For that to be afflicted, and not to suffer with patience,
bringes forth no other fruit then as metal thrown into the fire, and not
passing through all his heates, comes out covered more with dross then pure
Gold: And albeit I cannot deny, but to be angry is natural, and most sorts
of men holding more of Flesh and nature, then of spirit and grace, do draw
most that way where they find the appetite to have most power of action: Yet
for that anger has his difinition and parts, respecting time, Every revenge
ministers occasions of further cruelty.
occasion, and other circumstaunces, I thought good to offer you a short
Description: not thereby to leave you in any affection to follow it, but to
lead you out of the way of those inconueniencies which he bringes with him,
hoping you will forbear eftsoon to pursue him whom you suppose to have done
you so great a displeasure, What anger is
seeing every revenge nourishes occasions of new Cruelties, and therefore more
sewertie to some men to dissemble, then to execute. Anger is no other thing
then a wicked desire of revenge, an enemy to all good Council, and a
corrupter of every good condition, Yea, that which we call anger, is no other
thing then a vehement desire of revenge, sometimes, respecting the occasion that
is given, but for the most part pushed forward by a wicked mind of the party
whom he possesses, Discriptions of an angry man.
and when the punishment exceedes the fault, then it has changed the qualetie
of anger into an habit of revenge. The man that is angry, believes no advice
of friends, and is careless even of his own estate: He is suspicious of all
men, and suddeine in his actions, his face is fiery, and his hands ready to
strike, his thoughts are malicious, and his tongue trained to all speeches of
dispight and reproache: He is dispossessed of all temperance, modesty, and
reason, and runs as one Possessed with a wicked Spirit to all acts of
Cruelty, injury, and tyranny. Anger caryeth with it these wicked conditions,
that for once that we Lend him our will, he will be always after Lord over
all our doings, and do all things that he list against our will. All men
Posseste with anger are like to a Lamppe, who by the superfluity of Oil
geeues no light, but castes out certain sparckling snuffes and flames. But in
a Magestrate or man of Authority, there is nothing that more discovers his
virtue or vice, for that though he have occasion to rebuke offenses, yet he
has no permission to show himself passionate. It is a just thing that such
as offend the Laws, should receive the Punishments of the Laws, but yet such
ought to be the moderation of pains, as that they aspire not to the degree and
effect of revenge: since all men feel with more grief the violent rygoure
that is done them, then the judicial Punishment they receive: So that a man
to restrain or correct his Anger, No greater triumph then too conquer
affections.
is not only a virtue, but a grace supernatural, for that in worldly things
there can be no greater kind of Triumph, then every one to have the victory
of his own heart. And albeeit Anger is then somewhat tolerable, when the
occasion is just, yet being a vice so imperious in man, I would not wish any
sufferaunce geeuen to it, for that all that comes of it is wicked, and of his
proper Nature hurtful. There be many things which in the beginning we have
Power either to receive or refuse, but if Anger have once taken Possession of
us, it Sinkes (as a Stoane thrown into a River) and stays not till it come
to the bottom of our hearts: and if reason rise against it. It will not be
removed, for that it has taken too deep root in our thoughts and will. The
same being the cause, that all things that Angry men do, are of necessity
blind and foolish, for that it is not a thing easy that a man troubled with
anger, should have use of reason: And doing things without reason, he does
them without art, and so by consequence without rule, wisdom, or discression.
Let every man therefore, Labor to hate Anger for the discommodities that are
in it, and learn to be temperate, Repentance the very stipend and effect of
malice
wherein is the true virtue and contentment. He that absteynes from speaking
villainy, is most wise, since Repentance is the very stipende and effect of
Malice, and there is seldom any thing uttered in Malice, which tournes not to
the hurt of the speaker. We find by experience that to a man in Choler, it
is a Principal Remedy to Correct his tongue, and delay a little to do
Revenge: For, men speak and do many things in their Anger, which they wish
afterward had never passed their thoughts. The man that is wronged, is not
forthwyth to be dealt withal to pardon the injury, but rather to delay and
respitte the revenge: For that, Where is no capacity of council, there
persuasions are in vain.
a man dwelling in passion is not apt to pardon readely, if first he be not
appeased. And therefore to seek to reduce a man to reason, so long as he is
possessed with the heat of his fury, is but loss of diligence: For that having
no capacitye of council, persuasions are in vain, and where there is not a
spirit tractable, there can be no possibility of reformation, being better to
suffer his fury, then to minister advise, for that bathing in the heat of his
anger, he stands more need of a bridle then of a spur. Therefore whosoever
has conversation with a man chollerike, stands in more necessity of polecie
then of power, for that anger being to be appeased by discression, receives no
medecin if it be not perfect in time, place, qualetie, Time reformes more
things then reason.
and every other circumstaunce conducible to purge but not to pain. There be
more things which time moderates then that reason accordes, as are seen in
the experience of many great quarrelles of many great personages, whom neither
friends could entreat, nor enemies fear, nor Gold could allure, nor other
presents reclaim: And yet, after time have had his Course, there has been
found a facility in that which before seemed difficult and desperate. Time
has power to change parties and passions, Time has power to moderate passions.
and to new men, to give new affections, by which it happens, that he that
suffers with the time, shall see burn the heart of his adversary in the same
fire wherewyth he supposes himself is consumed: the wise man has his tongue
in his heart, but he that is angry and furious has his heart in his tongue: The
one is angry for that he suffers, and prayseth all that he speaks, but the
other is grieved when his Tongue Runs at Lybertye, and reioyseth most when
he suffers most: Yea, Patience is the invention of God, and leads men to
bear all mutations with courage and constancy, and in Calamities not to be
unfurnished of Remedies.

A discourse of the Ages of man's life.
THere has been an Ancient Question, what be the Ages of man's life, and
whether there be six or seven of them, wherein (the better to be resolved) we
must presuppose, that this word age is understood in two sorts, as the age
of the world, and the age of man. The age of the world bears number and
reckoning, both according to the Poets, and collection of the christian
authors: the poets make four ages of the world, the first of Gold, the
second of silver, the third of brass, the fourth of Iron. The first inuentor
of this particion of ages, was Sibill of Cuma, from whom the Latin Poets draw
their conjectures, as appears in Ovid in ye first book of his Metamor. where
he discourses upon the four Ages, when, and how they passed. And according to
the account of the christians, there be viii. ages, that is to say, seven before
the coming of Christ, and one since. But because our question concerns
nothing the ages of the world, we will leave them at liberty, and reason only
of the ages of men. Whereof I see not how it is possible to speak resolutely,
for that it is a thing not certain in it self, and hanges altogether upon
the authority and opinions of ancient writers, of whom we have to believe
best, such as bare most credit. First it is affirmed by many that there be
these seven ages in the life of man, infancy, puerilitie, man's estate, youth,
grauetie, old age, and state decrepit: they restrain one part of these ages to
a certain number of years, and leave the rest without limit.

Touching the opinion of the number, it semes to hold some similitude with
reason: for that seven is a number universal and accomplished. And in that
number if we account the seven Planets, the moving of whom causes the
generations and corruptions in the earth. By greater reason under this word
seven we may also apply ye course and continuation of the time: for that by
the same science and reason that the ancients reduced the Planets into seven,
and they to enclose in their motions, the revolution of times: even by the same
may we also establish seven ages, which may comprehend the life and continuance
of man. There were others that set down but six ages, Infancy, Puerilitie,
Man's state, Youth, Grauetie, and Old age: of this opinion is Jsidorus, whom, by
reason of his authority, we will follow for the present, confessing
notwithstanding that in some respects there may be seven ages in the life of
man. But this last opinion semes most reasonable in this, for that it speaks
more distinctly of the years of the ages, then the other that establishes
seven, for that it can not debate destinctly of the years of youth and man's
state. Infancy.
In this sort is the reckoning of these ages. Jnfancie, which is the first age,
begins even from the birth of man, and continues til seven years be
accomplished, it is called in Latin Jnfantia, for that in that age all things
are holden childish that he does, not having any liberty of speech, nor other
thing to express his perfection.

Puerilitie.
Puerilitie, being the second age, continues from seven to fourtene years. The
Latins call it Pueritia, for that it is an age pure, and not stained with any
abominable vice, being as yet not defiled with unchaste mocions, nor disposed
to the vile pleasures of the flesh, as afterward it is. Of this beastlines
and vile humor of the flesh, 2. Cor. 6.
the Apostle makes plain description when he bids us shoonne fornication: For,
all other sins that man commits, are without his body, but he that commits
whoredom, sins in his body, and against his body. This age then is very
pure, as being not so hable to the beastly actions of the flesh as is the other
that succeedes, which is Man's estate, according to the text in Genesis, Gene. 8.
saying: the senses and thoughts of the heart of man, are given to ill, even
from his Man's estate. But for all this we must not think that Puerilitie is
exempted from the vices and sins which generally defile man: For, that which
comes from the heart, corruptes man says the Lord, and therefore since this age
is not free from lend words and wicked thoughts, it can not be altogether
pure: So that to exempt it altogether from sin, is too great an error. And
where some hold that children being somewhat grown, have no sin, but begin
to sin at fouretene years when hair begins to appear in their natural
places: It were an opinion to be suffered, if men committed sin in no other
members then in their parts of generation. But who doubts that stealing,
lying, and swearing be not sins, whereunto young children above all other
vices are most inclined: So that we may say that this age is exempt only from
the sin of the flesh, but not from other corruptions. And albeit it be pure
and clean from vice in his beginning, yet that innocence continues not till
the end of the age, and procedes for that in the beginning they have not the
use of discretion, and by that want, no power to do good or ill, as to be
esteemed ill or good: Seeing the good and the ill are measured by the
discretion of the doers, for that according to Aristotle, all the operations
and mocions of man proceed of the understanding and will. And therefore it is
hard to judge of the works and dispositions of little children, till by
increase of years they enter into the use of reason, a time when they have
ability to do well or ill: The same being the cause why the Cannon speaks
not indistinctly of all children, but only of such as are somewhat raised into
years and age: For, it impugnes nothing the opinion of such as say that little
children are without sin, but means expressly of such as are ten or twelve
years of age, who in deed are not exempted from sin.

Man's estate, which is the third age, Man's estate.
begins at fiftene years, and continues till eight and twenty, according to
Isidores opinion. This age, the Latins call Adolescentia for two reasons, the
one for their possibility and nearenesse to engender: the other for that they
increase and rise into strength.

Touching the first, it is referred to the beginning of this age, wherein young
men approach the power of procreation, which was further from them in their
childhode as has been said. The second consideration beholdes chiefly the
end of that age, according to the opinion of many, who hold that man
increases till twenty, or two and twenty years, which is the end of Man's
estate. But Jsidorus says, that Adolescentia lasts till eight and twenty
years, notwithstanding man does not always rise in increasing till then, and
yet it seems that, that age took his name directly of increase, for that then
man comes to his perfect growth.

In the ages before rehearsed, Jnfancie and Puerilitie, man grows still, yea
and in one part of the third age, which is Adoloscentia: But in ye ages
following he grows nothing for that he has taken his perfection before. And
therefore, seeing all growing ends in Adoloscentia (for after that age man
increases nothing) the name of increase or growing does most properly
appertain to him.

Youth.
Youth, which is the fourth age, enters at nine and twenty, and ends at
fifty as Isidore affirms. The Latins call it Inuentus, by reason of the
helps and aides that the world has of men of that age, as in deed that title
is most proper to him by reason of the force and virtue which men of that age
have. In the former ages, men are not knit, nor have their forces accomplished:
But in this age they have their full strength, and are well hable to endure all
impositions of pain, burdens, or travel.

In this is discerned the difference of the two opinions, the one establishing
seven ages, and Isidore reckoning but six. Such as make a number of seven,
divide youth, adjoining unto him an other part which they call Virilitie. But
according to Isidore there is but one age, and that is called Youth, which me
thinks is not to begin at the end of Man's estate at eight and twenty years as
Isidore holds: But it were better to determine Man's estate at one and twenty
years, a time wherein he has taken his groath, and thereto establish the
beginning of youth, which is to last until thirty years or there about, and
after it may succeed Virilitie, which may endure until L, where Jsidore
establishes the end of youth. According to this order the names of the ages
may go properly with them: For, Junentus takes his name of this Latin Verb
iunare, signifying to aid or help, and in that age men are most convenient to
be employed, and of most ability to give aid. And Virilitie deriueth from
this Latin Noune Vires signifying strength, as an age wherein men being
complete, are in there greatest force. And so as the youngman is good to
minister aid and help, so in the man accomplished is good ability to do
things of himself: For to have necessity of aid, is referred to the forces
yet weak and not accomplished, but to do any thing of our selves is a true
sign of strength fully furnished. Besides, it is of common proof, that a man
comes not to his full strength till he be thirty years old, and therefore by
good reason that estate of age may be called Virilitie.

But Jsidorus, thinking not to separate virilitie from youth, sets down other
terms and limits to ages, establishing the end of Man's state at eight and
twenty years, and not at one and twenty, and appoynting the beginning of youth
at nine and twenty, (a season that best makes perfect the strength of men) he
puts no difference between virilitie and youth.

The fifth age is called Grauetie or Vnweldinesse: Touching this age, the two
opinions aforesaid do differ in name only, Jsidore calling it vnweldinesse, and
the other giving it no title at all. They both seen to take the commodity of
the Latin word, the one calling it senectus and the other seniam,
notwithstanding it concern diverse ages. This age of vnweldinesse begins at
fifty years, and ends at threescore and ten as Jsidore holds, who calls it
vnweldinesse, because the quality of heaviness or weight, makes fall all things
lower. And as in the other four ages before, men grow either in stature or in
force: so in this age their strength seems to determine, and their bodies and
parts begin to decay, and decline to debilitie: For, until fifty years man
mayntaines always his strength and stature, but after, he begins to feint as
one that had run his course, and does nothing but heap infirmities and
weakness even until death. According to the opinion of such as establish
seven ages, this estate of years is called old age, whereunto Isidore consents
not, but calls that old age which begins at threescore and ten, and continues
til death though man live never so long. So that all the other ages are
restrained to certain limits of years, but this last age is subject to no
term, for that the day and hour of man's death are not known. Jsidore,
(speaking of this age) says that old age being the sixth age, can not be
limited nor made subject to term, for that there is attributed unto it the
residue of the life of man which passes the first five ages. But touching all
that has been said heretofore, that every age of the life of man has his
certain terms and limits except the last: It is to be understand that al is
spoken of the ages of men of our time, and not of such as were before the flood,
since in those seasons, the age of men were a thousand years. Neither do we
mean the men of the second age, which begone from the flood until Abraham:
for that in that age there were men that lived six hundredth years, and some
four hundredth, as appears by the Doctrine of Genesis. And yet those men
says Jsidore, had no more age then we, and all their years limited to a
certain time and term, except the last age, whereunto could be ascribed no
certainty of term, for that (as it is found in Genesis) some lived longer
then others: and therefore their ages were not compted in that form of years
that we reckon ours: For, we take the beginning of our fifth age, which is
called Vnweldinesse, at fifty years: Which could not be in the men of the
first times, seeing the fifth age presupposes in us a debilitie of strength
and natural operations: a thing which could not happen to the first men, for
that if they had begone to decline at fifty years, they could not by any
possibility have endured so long, seeing there were of them that lived more
then fifty years. So that we may establish the fifth age of those people to
begin at three hundredth years or there about, aspiring very near the third
part of their life. In which respect, this fifth age having an other beginning
in them then in us, I thought it not out of purpose to touch somewhat those
ages which had not the same terms whereunto we are subject at this present.
Here must be considered the account that we apply to the third age, and
other ages since until David, in whose time men lived no more then they do
now according to his own testimony the days of man are threescore years,
Psalm. 89
and if any live till fourscore, the residue of their life is but grief and
travel:

Touching the ages of the men of the first and second world, we can not
speak resolutely, nor of the terms or limittes whereunto they were referred.
One reason is, for that those things were not continued until these later
times where were authors and writers to record them, And withal for that those
things which were once past, and no more in nature, the writers had no great
care to dispose them to monument. To this may be also added an other reason
more peremptory, that notwithstanding the authors had will to describe
particularly those things, as they had done the ages: Yet they had no mean
thereunto, seeing experience shows us the ages which are proper for
procreation, in what season man forbeares to grow, in what time he is in his
flower, and when he begins to decline. By which the wisemen took mean not
only to Baptize and distinguish the ages of man, but also to limitte such as
were subject to term. From the first and second age of the world, we are
assured that the age of men was divided into six as it is now. For, the men
of that season felt the same mutations that we feel, and did not engender in
all ages, and yet in certain ages they were hable to procreation. They grew
into stature and strength until certain times, and afterward their growing
ceased. In a certain age they were in their flower, and in an other they began
to wither and decline. But we know not in what term nor in what time they
suffered these mutations, as now experience in our selves makes them easily
known to us. That was the cause why the wise men of those times could not
limit to certain terms of years, the ages of men of the first and second
world, as ours are. Moreover if any will dispute that there is more reason to
establish seven ages in the life of man, then six, for that the Scripture
makes mention of senectus and senium, that is old age, and state decrepit: it
may be answered, that the Scripture appoynts no more ages to the life of man,
then does Jsidore: For, these two words senectus and senium, as the two later
ages of man which Jsidore calls by other names, naming vnweldinesse that which
the Scripture calls old age: and old age, that which in the Scripture is
called state decrepit.

There is also an other reason agreeing with the opinion of Isidore, that
senectus and senium be not taken in the Scripture for two ages, but for one,
and that to be ye powder or oust of the life of man. Old age says Isidore,
which is ye sixth age, is not limited, for that all that remains of the life
of man, (after the five first ages be past) is laid and referred to old age.
Touching the state decrepit, it is the end of old age called senium, as holding
upon the train of the sixth age. This last opinion semes not the least likely,
and most conformable to the saying of Isidore, by whom is not meant that the
decrepit state is the uttermost end of old age: For so should it be one self
thing with death, and hold no part of life: but it is meant that the state
decrepit makes one part of the life of man and of the sixth age, according to
the testimony of Jsidore. So that we may conclude that it is not an age
distinct and absolute, but part of an age, being (as it were) the dregs and
powder of old age, and generally of all the life of man. And for death, much
less that it is part of the life of man, seeing we hold it a just mean of
privation of life. But if any disposed to cift straightly our opinion, will ask
this question, that seeing the state decrepit is one part of our life, why we
make not an age of it as we do of the other parts of the life of man. It may
be answered that by so much is the question vain, by how much the matter is
impossible: For, all the other ages are subject to beginning and end, and are
determinable to a certain content, proportion and number of years. And touching
old age, albeit his end can not assuredly be determined, yet it is known in
what time he begins, which is about threescore and ten years. But the state
decrepit draws an other course, as having neither beginning nor end certain
and terminable, and therefore can not be called an age distinct, and of it
self: The same being easily seen in this, that it contains that residue of
the life of man, wherein the body is made unwieldy with many infirmities, the
which appears after a man be entered into old age and not before,
notwithstanding we seem to feel and suffer vnweldinesse. So that, that part
of the life which is so grievous, has no certain beginning, seeing those
infirmities come sooner to one then to an other, and endure either more or
less according to the complexions of persons: and therefore that can not well
be called an age complete, but rather part of an age.

This estate decrepit has been referred with great reason to the years of
old age, being the last and extremest of all the other ages: For that, there
remaynes no other thing to such as are come to it, but death. And for that such
as live so long, are naturally subject to many grieves and sorrows, some men
have called the end of this last age senium: An opinion fully conformable with
the Scriptures: For, as it is here alleged that the state decrepit is the
last part of the life of man and follows old age. So the Scripture accomptes
the continuance and proporcion of our life to threescore and ten years,
referring the residue but to travail, and dollor. So that this part of the
life so ouerladen with infirmities is that which we call state decrepit, and
the Latins senium, being in deed the last age called old age. The best
days of the life of men says Virgill, are those which pass first: after the
which succeed infirmities and diseases, yea and old age, which leads with
him fearful death. Thus does Virgill call old age a state troublesome and
afflicted with infirmities, wherein if he had known the state decrepit to be
separate from old age, and that he had taken it for an age of it self, he had
given it community with those ils and infirmities whereof he speaks, and not
to old age, for that it is in the last and most extreme age that those miseries
happen to man: Yea he makes no reckoning of any age after old age, for that
next after it he makes account of death. The same proving sufficiently, that
the state decrepit is not an age separate and distinct from old age, but
contains a part of the same, which agrees with the opinion of Isidore, and
holds consent with the scriptures and with the Poets. In all which is no
difference nor distinction between senectus and old age.

A continuing of the discourse begone, wherein is brought in an other opinion.
WE have already showed two opinions touching the ages of the life of man,
whereof the one appoints seven, and ye other establishes but six. But now
will we adioyne an other which sets down in the life of man, but five ages;
that is to say, Jnfancie, Paerilitie, Man's estate, Youth, and old age. Of this
opinion is M. Terentius Varro in his Book of the original of the Latin
tongue, and is also alleged by Seruius in his comment of Virgill upon the
fifth Book of Aeneidos. This opinion agrees with the former and four first
ages, which four there is no mean to impugn, seeing they have taken their
names of the four diverse estates which we feel in our life. The first age
is, when by reason of our very few years and indisposition of our body, we have
no use of reason, nor full knowledge of things: this age we call Jnfancie or
innocence, Infantia.
as an estate wherein man knows not yet what sin is.

There is an other age wherein albeit man has a certain use of reason, yet by
reason of the inhabilitie of his person, he is not yet hable to procreation:
Puerilitas.
this age is called Puerilitie or Childhode continuing from eight years to
fourtene, and it is the second age.

There is an other age which gives to man the use of reason, and power of
procreation, his body being not yet risen to his greatness and perfect force,
but grows still in strength and bigness: This third age is called Man's
ectate, Adolescentia.
for that in it we take our greatness and stature although we grow still in
force.

There is an other age wherein man has his strength accomplished and is apt to
all actions possible to be done in any age whatsoever, this age is named
Youth. Inuentus.
And for that these four mutations are so manifest, they are all resolved and
concluded in these four ages, notwithstanding they have not said so of the
ages following, and from thence is derived the diversity of opinions.

M. Varro reckons but old age after these four ages before recited, Old age.
taking youth (as I think) for ye age wherein man is perfect in his forces, in
his stature, and in his virtues natural, referring to old age all the time of
declination or decaying of the natural forces of man: So that according to
Varro old age should begin at fifty years, and endure until death. This
opinion diffreth from the former, in that the first puts virilitie amongst
the number of ages seperating it from youth, where this encloseth it under ye
name and title of youth according to the judgment of Jsidore. And yet this
opinion is contrary to ye former, which makes old age and state decrepit two
ages agreeing with the resolution of Jsidore, who accomptes old age for the
last age, and takes the state decrepit but for one part of it. Notwithstanding
Varro diffreth from Isidore, who, after youth establishes the age of grauetie
or vnweldinesse, of the which Varro makes no mention, following therein the
first opinion, which touches nothing that grave and heavy age.

Which of these opinions is most worthy.
ALbeit there is never one of these three opinions which bringes not with it
his mean of defense and justification, as being al grounded upon causes
which have their proper appearance and similitude with reason: Yet there is
difference of authority between them, one being more antentike then an other:
the same being the consideration why I hold the second best approved, and most
reasonable.

Touching the first opinion establishing two ages of old age, and state
decrepit, it is contrary to all good authors, who have always taken old age
for the last age of man, not meaning that the state decrepit was an age
distinct, but a part of old age. Wherein if it be alleged that the decrepit
state is not taken for the last part of the sixth age, for that it has no
beginning limited, nor any end determiminable, but that it is taken for the
last age, which is limited in his beginning, notwithstanding it has no end
determinable, as beginning at threescore and ten years and lasting until
death, and that this age also is that which some call old age. It may be
answered that taking the terms and limittes in that sort, thee agree with the
first and second opinion touching the two last ages, and that there is no
difference but in the names. So that we may conclude that the second opinion
is more auayleable then the first, for that it consents in names of the ages
with the good authors and Poets. Wherein truly for things that lie in act and
have been invented, those opinions that hold most conformetie with the
judgments of good authors, ought to be reputed as most true. The third
opinion aduouched by M. Varo, albeit it be in some sort supportable, yet
Jsidore satisfies more at full, for that he puts vnweldinesse for an age
between youth and old age: For, first in that age men feel a manifest
mutation which deserves well to dear the name of age: Seeing that properly
old age may be called that time wherein the judgment of man begins to
fail and diminish, both by ye greatness of age, and indisposition of the body
and person.

Touching youth, it is the flower of the age of man, since in that age he is
man complete, and perfect in his forces, actions, and natural operations: but
that age being past, al things that are in man begin to decline. Then it is
that the force of the body, and virtues natural begin to wear and wax weak:
Of which decay proceeds also a diminution of judgment and understanding. All
which are discerned daily by ordinary experience, besides the reasons and
arguments conducible to prove them: For, first experience shows us that as
man falls in corporal strength, so his judgment begins to grow weak and
frail: but the sense and understanding remain in puretie and virtue. The
reason is, for that the strength of the body and forces natural, are powers
material, and subject to alteration and change. But the sense and
understanding being not material, can not therefore fall into mutation but by
some accident, and by the alteration of the body, according to the Doctrine of
Aristotle, that the understanding waxes not old, although the body does. And
therefore there may be sometimes wherein man may loase all his corporal
forces, before the understanding taste of any such infirmity: But to say that
that time may be reduced into an age to call it old age, it can not well be
so, for that the sense and understanding are weakened in old age: So that,
that age may be called vnweldinesse according to the Etymelogie of Isidore
saying thus: Some think the Latins called old men senes, because of the
debilitie of sense falling upon old men whom the greatness of age makes rave,
and subject to incertaine fancies.

The natural Philosophers say also that fond men and idiots have for the most
part their blood cold, as men wise and well compound have it hot and sturring:
the same being the occasion that old men having their blood cold, and young
children in whom it is not yet hot enough, are not resolute in their
judgments: so that it is no great error to compare together old men and
children, as equal in temperature. For, doting old men are foolish by the
greatness of their age, and in young children is no power of judgment by reason
of their minority. Secondly, this second opinion which establishes only six
ages is most commonly approved of wisemen, and agrees with the judgment of
Jsidore that the Philosophers have distinguished the life of man by those six
terms. Thirdly this second opinion has a similitude with the names which the
Greeks have attributed to ages, calling that which follows youth Presbiter,
and in place of old age they use geron: so that Presbiter is an other age then
old age, as also Jsidore calls it Vnweldinesse. And sure those that stand in
that estate and proportion of age, may be called neither young nor old, but
occupy (as it were) a mean degree between both according to the opinion of
Jsidore speaking thus.

The sixth age says he which is called Vnweldinesse is referred to such as
enter into old age, and is as the dekaye and declination of youth falling into
old age, and yet in true property is neither old age nor youth, but it
contaynes even the self same which the Greeks call presbiter. This age begins
at fifty, and ends at threescore and ten: Wherein if any would dispute by the
words of Isidore, that the age of Vnweldinesse follows old ages, and that
it is an estate most near unto death by this Latin text of Jsidore, qu(...)
(...) senioris est graui^^s, etc. using the comparatiue se^^^ris. It may he
answered, that senioris is taken here for one, that approaches old age, even
as adolescenti^ in Latin signifies one that is yet in his childhode and not
yet so sufficient as he whom the Latins call adolescens.

This phrase and manner of speech is common, and used for the most part amongst
the Latin authors and Poeta as Ovid, Terence, with many others: So that we
may hear apply senior to one that grows near old age according to this
judgment of Jsidore. He that the Latins call senior (says he) is yet in his
greennes, and has not shaked of the dispositions and disportes of yourth, by
which occasion Ovid says such men are between young men and old men. For
according to the Latins, adolescantiar means not him that is more then a
young man, but signifies such one as is not yet entered into Man's estate, even
as senior resembles him that has not yet challenged old age.

The conclusion of this discourse, wherein the author is resolved that there
be but three ages.
THis has been the chiefest industry of the Philosophers treating of ages, to
establish how many there were, and how long every age that was to be limited
might endure. But the Poets haiel gone further, as dividing every age into
their parts, assigning properly his beginning, his middle, and his end,
according to the Doctrine of Aristoris that all things are drawn into those
three. These may be referred to Puerilitas, Adolescentia, and Iuuentus,
assigning to every part of them their names, as in the pertition of
Adolescentia, we may use the first estate, the perfect estate, and the state
declining.

Touching Juuentus, which begins at eight and twenty years, and continues
till fifty, containing in reminder two and twenty, there would fall to every
part seven years, and some what more. And so the seven first years:
continuing till two and forty, or thereabout, may be referred to youth
perfect or thoroughly grown. And the seven last years continuing to fifty, are
attributed to youth declining or decreasing.

These ages thus distinguished by parts and manies, are divided even as is the
life of man, which is reduced into these three years, beginning, midst, and
end. The beginning contains the first part of the life, in the which man
rises still growing and increasing. The second part which is the mean, that
largeth that estate of man that is fully grown which appears in his middell
age. In the last part lies the state declining, as in which man begins to
decay and loase his natural force. This distinction is also observed in all
ages: For, they have their beginnings, which is the first part, And the
midst, being an estate best disposed: For, then is man his his flower and
perfection, and the body has then his best perfection, when man is established
in his middle age.

This manner of division of ages into three, is very familiar with the authors,
who assign to even part his particular names. The three names before recyted
have taken their beginning of M. varo to whom Seruius wroat them upon the
fifth book of the Eneidos of Virgill: But others using common phrases call
these parts by these names, first, middle, and last, amongst whom Salust
says that Mithrodoces coming to the Crown in his last puerilitye, killed
his Mother that age lasketh seven years, beginning at seven, and continuing
till fourteen, and so dividing it into three parts, every part conteynes two
years, and somewhat more: and therefore we establishe the last Puerilitie
between twelve and thirteen years, that is to say about four Months within
the twelfth year, and it may continue to the end of the fourteenth month in
which age Mithridates began to reign.

Some call verdure or greenesse the beginning of all ages, and that by the
resemblance of trees, who first appear green before they hear frente: and in
experience and operation of nature we see every beginning of the age is green
and lively: to the same meaning speaks Virgill, who deserybing the state and
state and constitution of the body of Euriatus, says he was excelent in beauty
and in ye greenesse of youth, as if he had said he was in his first youth: This
distinction is not observed only in ages, but also in the four seasons of the
year, that is in spring time, in summer, in Autumn, and in Winter. All which
seasons suffer their division into three parts even by the same means that
the ages are distinguished. For, in common speech, we grieve unto Summer his
first beginning, his midst which is called the heart, and the later part of
Summer. This division caryeth great congruencie of reason, for that every
season of the year comprehendes three months, and the course of the Sun by
three signs of the Zodiac. The beginning of Summer which is in the first
month, is called the first Summer, because he is as yet but newly challenged
the Middle part which is in the second month, is the heart and perfect part of
Summer as ^eing then in his greatest force and virtue. The end and third part
of summer which is in the third month, is called the latter part or
declining time of summer, as in which season the heat vanishes and leaving
the property of summer, it is converted into the nature of A^tumne, the same
happening also to all ye other seasons of the year according to the consent of
the Astrologians, who speak of the seasons according to the nature and
property of the Signs, by the which the Sun passes during the said
seasons which causes the diversity of tunes. And as there his three Signs in
every season by the which the Sun passes in three months: So have the
Authors attributed three names to every season according to the three Signs
which reign in the same: As in summer there be the Signs of Cancer, Leo and
Virgo, whereof the first is moving, the seconds fixed, and the third common.
The first as called moving, for that the season is changed into it by
conuertion of the spring time into Summer. The second is fixed reteyning
firm aboade and stabilitie, for that whylest the Sun is in this Sign, the
Summer remains in his offense, and is not changed into any other Season. The
third is called common, for that whylest the sun is there, the season holds
of the nature of Summer which passes, and inclines to Auntunure which
comes. The same may be said of other seasons, and they resembled in
convenient property to the ages of man's life.

Consideracions for Judges cryminall, expressed in a famyliar Letter from one
friend to an other, wherein is used a necessary Authority of a Philosopher.
CIcero in his discourse De amicitia, holds this opinion Si omnia facienda
sunt quae a mici vellent, tales non sunt amicitiased coniurationes. If we
should accomplish all things (says he) as well good as ill which our friends
require of us, such friendship might rather be called coniuration of the wicked,
then confederation of the good. For, albeit the law of friendship is hardly
restrained to limit: yet, it is an error to make it an office passible to all
actions without distinction of things, and consideration to the qualety of
persons. Yea we must love our friends no further then the Alter that is, for our
friends we must not corrupt religion nor conscience. Scaurus and Cattiline the
tirants of Rome, There can be no amity vvher is no virtue.
and Brutus and Cassius the murderers of Caesar held great league and
confederacy together, but in no sort they could be called friends, for that
there can be no true amity where is no virtue, and that friendship is most
accursed and infamous, where men become friends to the end to be enemies to
others. I am bold (sir) to use this entry into the answer of your last
Letter, by the which you seem to put me in remembrance of your friendship and
my ancient fidelity, having occasion now more then ever as you say to make
trial of your friends to see if they will favor your absence with the same
affection wherewith they were wont to faune upon you in your presence. For my
part, I esteem my self of no less fidelity then you suppose, and do confess
the honorable friendship you bear me, but under this condition, yt you do
nothing worthy of rebuke, The magistrate ought too do nothing of dishonor.
nor unworthy to be defended, since in a magistrate albeit there may be many
things to be amended, yet he ought to do nothing worthy of dishonor nor to
deserve blame. It brings no small grief unto me to hears what faltes are
heaped against you touching your government in those parts, assuring you that
if you had received Council of the Doctrine of the Philosopher, Science and
experience the two principal pillors that uphold commonweals.
you had not brought such passion to your friends, nor to your person such
infamy and peril: Men that manage estates, or take charge to govern commonweals, ought to be circumspect in that they do, and skillful to understand
what they judge, seeing that science and experience are the two principal
pillors that uphold commonweals: we see many who albeit have red over the
whole Volumes of the Laws, yet when they leave the universities and come to
administer affairs of estate, they discover no small imperfections: For that
he deserves not fully the name and reputation of a Counselor at Law that
knows only the body of the law, but he which can apply it in time and place:
Seeing that to learn science a certain discourse of time suffiseth, but to
put it to conference and use, there is requisite a deep and assured judgment.
And therefore all human Laws being grounded more upon reason then opinion,
it happens oftentimes, that the man of the Country replenished with
experience, holds better course in government and judgment, then the graduat
raised to degrees of learning by the customs of the university. But now to
debate with you somewhat more particulerly, as I have always held you in the
opinion of a man wise and learned, and also a judge and counceller resolute:
So, by your late abuses in those parts, heaped against you in great slander
here, I am either otherwise then I was wont to be, or at least you are not the
same that I have always esteemed you, seeing that having commission from the
Prince to chastise a sedicious Rebel both in body and goods, you are accused
to have abused your authority with suspected favor to his person, and corrupt
affection to his house and goods: having been so long a Councellor, No
Rebellion excusable.
it is time for you to know that no rebellion is excusable, no though the
oppression be intolerable, and it is as due justice in the Prince to execute a
Rebel as to defend an innocent: seeing he does but blow the Brande of
sedicion upon the head of the doers and so burns them with their proper fire.
Oh that pardon is wicked which bringes with it the hazard of a Country, That
pardon is wicked which bringes with it the hazard of a country.
as on the contrary, most happy is that punishment wherein is wrought the
safety of the state. To disobey the Prince, for not to break or pass the
law, or to infrindge the law to obey the Prince, be things that happen,
albeit they ought not to be done: But (according to the property and effect of
your action) to disobey the Prince, and be hold to break the law: I know not
how better to refer it then to mere contempt and folly: For that in all ages
and estates, that has been a just observation of the law, when he that was a
Traitor to the Prince, and a troubler of the Realm, was executed both in
goods and life, and his house rased. But you have not only favored the life
of the Rebel with a suspected respyte of his person, but also as one entised
with the beauty of his fair house, you have not defaced it as a monument of
his offense, but seemed to reserve it for your special use and profit:
Wherein you are far from the direction of the Philosopher. Nunquam deb et
fieri iuditium in conspectu obiecti de quo iudicandum est. If it happen (says
he) that any fair or rich thing fall into falt, let it not stand before the
eyes of the Judge when he is to pronounce sentence, lest a covetous compassion
of the thing prevail above the virtue of equity and reason: Homer recytes,
that amongst the princes of Troy, there was great question, whether they should
send hoame again fair Helene to her husband or not: In which dispute (such
was the incertayntie of their affections) they condemned her being absent, but
eftsoon reabsolued her when she stood before them bearing such compassion to
her present beauty, that they had no power to do justice: Josephus likewise
in his discourse of the wars of the Jews, says, that the good Emperor
Tyrus having subdued the Country of Judea, and taken the great City of
Jerusalem, when he beheld with judgment the rich and stately Temple of
Solomon, the presence and majesty of the thing carried him into that
compassion, that muchlesse that he suffered it to be defaced or razed, seeing
he gave strayt order that no pillage or spoil should be offered to it, till
he were gone out of Asia, and returned to Rome. In like sort it is written in
the first Book of the Kings, that God commanded Kings Saul to arise and
put to the Swoorde the Prince of the Amalechytes, and all the men, women and
Cattle with out exception which he found: But Saul being subject to a
corrupt Pytie, killed only all the lean, weak and deformed Cattle, sparing
such as were fair and fat: For which disobedience the Lord was moved to
Anger, and the King depryued of his kingdom. The good consul Marcus
Marcellus seeing the Noble City of Sarragoce Burning, Commanded to Quench
the fire, esteeming it great loss to Burn things so fair and goodly. But if
these Noble men and also your Lordeshippe, had well studied the rule of
Aristotle, That the thing rich and fair ought not to stand in the eyes of
the judge at the time of Sentence, their error had not been so gennerall, nor
your fault so apparent, with whom, seeing you are equal in offense, it is good
reason you Communicate in pain and Punishment: Wherein it can not grieve me
a little, that having in your hand the sword of justice, with creditte to
examine and execute, you have turned your duty into disobedience, and your
office into negligence, the same geeuing occasion to the Kings officers here,
not only to accuse you, but Judge you unable to weelde authority, and not
worthy of place in the administration of affairs: Esteeming you no better
then a Traitor, for that you have forborne to Punish Treason. But the
mischief being happened, I wish you remember that in cases of offense, the
next way to reconcilement, is the offer of Satisfaction or Submission, Assuring
you that to a mind so gracious as is the kings, there is no offense so great
which can not be either Pardoned or excused: Wherein as most of your friends
here, are traveled to lament your misfortune, so for my part, you shall find
me to labor to restore you to favor, not doubting but if you will express
true Repentance, I will procure you Frank and ready forgeeuenesse.

A discourse of the antiquities of CORINTH, with an Exposition of the Proverb,
Non cuiuis contigis adire Corinthum.
THere is in the greater Asia, a Province near to the confynes of Greece,
called Achaia of Cadmus who first Reigned therein. It makes a tourning in, or
strait of the sea, near to the mount Asinius, where be two goodly Havens in
old time named Tritonius and Magus, ready succoures for ships coming from the
East as wherein they may enter safely, and ride without peril. The ancient
Historiens appointed to record the monumentes of the Golden world, write, that
Acolus of Greece, Siciphus a great robber.
had a son called Sisiphus, of great and subtle experience all the days of
his life in robbing and stealing, and of a wonderful boldness to any
unlawful enterprise. This man for the security and retraite of him self and
his companions, builded a Fortress as a Harbourugh to receive his spoils and
pillages. He planted it at the foot of the Hill Jsosinius right upon a point
of the Sea, to the end if he were pursued by sea, he might seek his safety on
shore, and being invaded by land, he might have safe passage by Sea. This fort
he called Ethrure which signifies in the Syrien tongue Strength, or defense.
For, to the same he brought all his spoils, and out of the same he issued
always to do his robberies, but practicing that trade both by sea and Land
for the space of six and thirty years, in the end he fell into the
correction of justice and paid the due retribution of his merittes together
with his co^federats, the fort also which they had made for their defense being
defaced and rased: Not many years after, were dug in the same place by pore
Mariners, certain Caves for their retrayte, and also to give succor to
passengers sailing that way, the same bringing no small relief to strangers
and great commodity to the poor Mariners: It happneed about that time, that
the prince Corinthus only son to the king Orestes being driven out of his
course by tempest and rage of Sea, arrived at that port much distempered and
weary, and was received of the pore Mariners to his great relief and comfort.
This Prince Corinthus was young, valiant, disposed, and very rich, and from
his youth trained by his Father to scumme the Sea and commit Islands to spoil:
By mean of which tyrannies he was always subject to many enemies, who gave
him occasion to make there his retrayt, and reedefye the fortress of Sisiphus,
finding in that place many things to the opportunity of his trade, he made
the forte of a great thickness, and entrenched it with a most stately wall,
building many small howses for habitation and resort of people calling it
Corinthe of the nature of his own name: So that, the great and famous City of
Corinthe, tyrants first builded it, tyrants always governed it, and
tyrants lastely destroyed it. The beginning of the riches and wealth of
Corinth, proceeded of the spoil of the famous and goodly City of Tyr, which
much about that time was reuersed by the great Alexander, the Cytizens
repairing to Corinth and carrying with them such great foyson of Marchaundise of
Asia and Greece which made Corinth boch rich and renoumed. The Salamins, the
Athenians, and the Corinthians, people very ancient and famous, had long time
amongst them great difference and wars, and all for that the envy of the one
could not endure the glory of the other, albeeit the estate of Corinthe
continued longer then the two others: For, first Athens was destroyed by
Ptholome, and Salamana by Arfctades, and lastely Corinthe was reuersed by the
Consul Scaurus: It was the chief and Metropolitan of all the Province of
Achaia, wherein was always holden the resort or Residence of the Prince: And
in it was always kept the Stamp or Mynt of all the Money that Served the
Province. It happened to Corinthe, as oftentimes it chances to other great
Commonweals and Cities, that sometimes it was governed by Kings, sometimes
by Tyrauntes, and sometimes by Popularytie: Amongst whom though there was
diuersitye of state and dignity, yet they suffered no difference of rule and
Pollecie, for that the Common Weal was always under Tyranny and oppression.

Amongst others, there was in this City a rich Tyrant, famous, and full of
vice, named Herius: He builded in the midst of the City a most sumptuous
Temple, and Dedicated it to the Gods Venus the Solicitor and Patron of Lovers
and fraule Loves, within which Cursed. Temple were enclosed more then five
Hundred of the fairest maids of Asia, whom their Parents did there Consecrate
to the Gods Venus, to the end they might be Lovers and stales to draw
Lovers to them, holding her for most Religious and Holy, which was most Amarous
and dissolute. And upon Condition that they issued not out of the house, every
one of them had liberty to Sin, accompanying with whom she lyked best, and
in what sort she would: so that their Religion consisted not to be good
Women, but to be most kept in and and not go abroad, using their pryuate
howses, not to straytnesse and chastetie of life, but to a liberty to sin
without controlement. This Law was well observed amongst them, that if any of
them were disposed to take a Husband, she should first gain her marriage
portion by the sweat and infamy of her body, having withal this foul
prerogative, that being married, she might also call unto her ye company of a
friend, for that, being consecrated to the Gods of love, they would not lose
their names nor practice of lovers: Their filthiness was so great yt they could
brook no society of a wife or wyddow in that Colleadge: but received all
maids, who in short time, of virgins dedicated, became women abandoned. They
were Cunning in music, and studied stories and books of love, which to their
beauty and youth, gave such further power of entisement, that there were none
escaped their hands which were not either plumed or plucked.

The Hystories bear witness, that there was no people nor Province in all
Asia, where was greater resort and Traffyke of all Marchaundise then at
Corinthe, and where was better Woorkemanshippe of Gold, Silver, Leather,
Brass, and other Metal: And about the City great abundance of Corn,
Wine, Oil, Honey, Saffron, Sylke, Linen, and so many sorts of commodities,
that the inhabytauntes would vaunte that it was a Regyon more convenient for
the Gods, then worthy of men. And for Flesh, Fish, and Spyces coming as
well by Sea as Land, it was so prodigally furnished, that it made the
Citizens swell in vice and sin, and gave occasion to strangers to be more
effeminate and delicate. And therefore as well by the occasion of the Gold and
Silver that there was stampped, the Skarlet, Silk, and fine coollered cloth
there made: as also the liberty of vices anexed to the place, there was such
haunte and frequentation of diverse nations, that in greatness, Corinth seemed
a second Babylon, and in abundance an other Memphis. The liberty and
freedom of the place drew many not only out of Asia but from the furthest
part of Europe, to inhabyt at Corinth, to whom was given such reputation of
wealth and dignity, that if there were any man in any part of Asia very welthy
and rich, he was called by a common phrase a Corinthian. Also in this city
dwelt and dyed the most fair and famous Curtisan Lais, whose love was the guide
that led many notable men to their destruction. Of this woman it is written
that she was of goodly personag, her aspect sweet and drawing, her speech
gracious and pleasing, her hair aberne and disposed into locks, honorable in
liberality, sumptuous in attire, temperate in reasoning, and grave in
aunsweres, and lastly altogether given to amorous conversation, by occasion
whereof she was sought unto not only by the great princes of Asia, but by even
the mightiest potentates of Europe, making greater industry to be received in
to her service then to achiue any great enterprise. Amongst others the
Philosopher Demosthenes, practicing a Covenant of Love with her, and she
Demanding a greater sum of money perhaps then agreed with his habylitie, he
answered that he would not so dearly buy the hazard of his person and
honor in a thing which he shall no sooner have done, the^ he feels thesting of
remorse and repentance.

In the consideration of all these things it may be presupposed that the
Proverb took his invention by one of those three reasons. The first, that as
the City of Corinth was rich and plentiful in variety of marchaundise,
furnised with vitteiles, and full of vices: so it happened that many or the
most part of such as drew thither out of diverse and far countries, either
they dyed by the way, or perished in the Sea.

The second, by reason of the fame of Lais remaining there, many princes and
great Lords of sundry regions coming thither for her service, returned so well
plumed, as she had whereupon to smyle, and they good occasion to complain.

The third reason may be referred to the Temple of the Gods Venus beautified
with five hundredth fair amorous maids, to whom many resorting, many perished,
and many biting of such baytes, many swallowed up the poison of their
destruction, and left behind them their life and goods. So that we may
conclude that of these occasions roase this common Adage, Take heed of going
to Corinth, beware what you do at Corinth, for Corinth is not for all men. As
also the Proverb, Non omnium est adire Corinthum, Sprung either by the danger
to come thither or by the occasion of the amorous Lays dwelling there or by the
rereligion of the Temple of the infamous maids, or lastly by the liberty of
vices suffered in the City.

That we ought rather to present before God the love which we bear him, then
the services we do to him.
Ecce quem amas infirmatur.
LAzarus, one of the notablest of Jerusalem and a secret Disciple of Jesus
Christ, and brother to Martha and Mary, being grievously sick, his sisters
wroate to Jesus Christ a letter, containing only these few words, Lord he whom
thou love, is sick: At the contemplation whereof Jesus Christ, not without
great contrariety of his folowers, and no small peril to his person,
determined to go and comfort the two desolate sisters, and raise again
Lazarus, amazing the world with a miracle right high and execellent: And albeit
the Pharisees were in conspiracy against him, and the Jews troubled: albeit his
Apostles were in fear, and his Disciples not well assured, yet immediately
after he had considered of the Loving Words of the Letter, he forgatte all
fear and turned the prepresent view of so many perilles, into an inward
feruencie of zeal and love. And albeit in cases of peticion, it can not be
amiss to use persuasions of devotion at large: Yet God knowing the qualetie
and intention of the heart, requires not so much copye of speech, as humilytie
of the Spiritte, as appears by the manner of this Letter, which neither in
the beginning nor in the end, nor in the matter, contained but the words
aforesaid: giving us to understand, that having our love once fixed in God, it
suffiseth to make unto him only a sign, without troubling him with
importunity of words, since such as be true lovers and practisers in ye
matter of love, ought more to think then speak. Great is the difference
beetweene the love which we bear to Jesus Christ and that he bears to us,
as is well proved in the zeal of these two holy women, who durst not
communicate with Jesus Christ the love that they bare him, and much less the
affeciton of their Brother: only they referred him to the love which he bare
unto Lazarus saying, He whom thou love etc. The better to make us know that
if the Lord did not put in the Balance of our justice, some little peyse or
wayght of his love, he would give us but a little, seeing our love is so small
a thing. The vain lovers of the World have this custom, to reproach the
affection they bear one to an other, which much less that it is tolerable
amongst the servants of God, seeing they ought to make so small account of
their love, as not to demand any thing they pretend but by the mean and
virtue of his love: For, so high and sovereign is ye commandment of the love
of God, that only in this mortal life we can not scarsely learn it, and in
the other world of joys fully accomplish it. Exodus
Facti sumus vt immundi, et omnes iusticiae nostrae sum quasi pannus etc. Esaias
speaking of the multitude of his sins, and his little merit, speaking also in
the person of sinners, cries out: The sinagogue and I are unclean and great
sinners, and what good works so ever we seem to have done, after they come to
be examined in the sight of God, they bear such staymes, infection, and
corruption, that we find our own shame to present them before him. Wherein
the Prophet has great occasion to exclaim that al our desires and affections
are fleshely and corrupt, seeing that with the self same heart wherewyth we
ought to love God, we love also our Children, our neighbors, and our
Parents, Yea sometimes we transfer that affection to our unlawful
friends, seeking out of one moulde to draw an apple of Gold, and boollettes
of earth. But the love which God bears us is not of such frail condition,
seeing (as has been said) he loves us with the selfsame zeal he loves
himself, so inuoluing us in his proper affection, that as of himself he is
but one, so he has but one self and infallible affection, notwythstanding,
such as he favors most, he follows with a strong zeal, and the others
with a love not so fervent. So that it is good we stand at this resolution
that when the Lords calls us to account, we do not recommende unto him the
services we have done, but rather to put him in remembrance of ye great
affection we have borne him. For otherwise if he bestow on us one only
day of life, it is sufficient for the hire and recompense of all our
transitory time.

Eme a me aurum ignitum vt locuples fi^s Says God to the Bishop of Laodecia,
as it is set down in the text of the Apocalips: Thou which art poor and
haste a desire to be Rich, J advise thee to come and buy of the fine Gold
which I have freshly purifyed and drawn out of the furnace, and do keep it
within my treasury. What means this that the Lord has spoken, that who
will not renounce all that he Possesses can not be his Disciple, and yet
he inuites us to his shop to buy fine Gold. And albeeit he Command us
to buy any thing, why must it necessaryly be Gold? though the Ware we buy
be Gold, why ought it to be so fine: and being so fine, wherefore persuades
he us to buy it only of him? And coming to buy it of him, why does he
Sell it so flaming and Burning? And although we must buy it Burning, why
has he not set a Price and Weight if of? And seeing he inuites men to buy
it, why does he not set it out with more praise and Commendation? But such
are the gracious means and bounty of the Lord, the he speaks not to us as
a Master to his Servants, but as a Brother, vsinge the Nature and Phrase of
a very famyliar and gracious friend. By this we have to consider that by how
much, Gold is a thing most esteemed, best beeloued, and of all other Riches
with greatest importunity desired, by so much love is the virtue that most
delyghtes us, that above all other we honor, and that more then any other
does content us: For the heart that is inflamed with the love of God, makes a
base Estimation of all the other Riches and Treasures of the World: And of all
the Particular things under Heaven, love could not be better resembled then
to Gold, nor Gold more Equaly Compared then to love. For a there is nothing
how rich so ever it be which is not to be bought with Gold, so if love be
the worker, there is nothing so hard and difficult, which by the operation of
love is not made easy and passible: where by it follows that the heart which
is wounded with love, takes his rest and solace in service, and in reaposing,
takes pain and travel. And therefore he that loves and makes difficulty to do
that he is commanded and searches excuse in things he is required, that man
deserves not to be called a lover, but a scorner: such one has no heart of
Gold but a mind fashioned of Dross and fylth: Seeing that in the house of God,
and where his love is in office, there ought to be no Excuse of things
Required, nor Denial to do that is commanded. Oh that God gives a great
grace to that man on whom he beestoweth a heart of massiue and weightye
Gold, as of the contrary, wretchedness is his portion whose heart is vain,
light, and hollow: against such men the Prophet bears witness. Cor eoru^
vanum est, Psalm. 5.
For that the heart is the furnace wherein are framed all our desires and
passions, and the fordge whereon are Beaten all our trauelles and actions. God
says then that that which he sells unto us, is no other thing then gold
enflamed. that is Gold Purifyed and Burning: Wherein is. geeuen us to know,
that from that instant that the Love of God has touched our heart, it will
always burn, it will always pray, it will always sight, and it will never
cease to love: The love of God beeinge of such Qualetie that in what mind so
ever he makes his aboade, he will not suffer to remain any ill, wickedness,
or idleness. Gold enflamed is sewer the love of the Lord, seeing that with
his sparcklinge flames it kindles our understanding, enflameth our heart,
warmeth our will, and burns to ashes our offenses: Yea, at the heat of that
fire the elect are warmed, and the reprobat smothered: but the zeal of the
lovers of the world is not Gold enflamed, for that it is entangled with this
property, to Burn without warming, and to make Weary without resting, it
scorcheth and not purifyeth, it terryfyeth and not assures, and kills
without remedy. The metal which is sold in the shop of the world is not
Gold but Lead, is not substance but scumme, yea it is rather dross then
Gold, seeing that such as love with the affection of the world, are even
those that come out of it in the end most smeared and corrupted.

The love which the Lord sells is not only Gold enflamed, but very well
refined and proved: The first proof passing in himself in the tree of the
Cross, and received Confyrmation by the Martyrdom of Saint Peter and others,
by whose passions and torments the love of Jesus Christ was well ratified and
approved: Quando apostoli ibant a conspectu concilij, quoniam digni habiti sunt
pro nomine Jesu co^tumeliam pati. Right worthily was approved within their
hearts the love of Christ, seeing they went to their execution better contented
and glad, then all the Princes of the world, when they go to receive the crown
of a kingdom Right well was approved the love of Jesus Christ within the heart
of S. Paul, when he said ego Paulus vinctus in domino, holding him self more
happy to be fettred in chains for the love of God, then if he had been raised
to the greatest principality of the earth.

Touching the love of the world, frail and vain, with greater reason we may
call it reproved then approved, seeing one man loves not an other but for
respect of interest and commodity. So that as the servants of God love him
with all their power, including no other reason then the consideration of his
greatness and mercy: So worldly men love one an other no longer, nor no more
then there is possibility of gain and recompense, and therefore deserves to
be called and affection reprobate, for that it bears regard to the benefit and
not to the matter. In this part of the text we have also to consider, that the
Lord wills us not to buy gold of any other then of him, offering it to us of
him self both purified and burning, and all to instruct us, that it is he only
of whom we are to obtain grace to love him, and love to serve him. Besides,
this gold of the love of the Lord will not be communicated to us for nothing,
least we should esteem it little: Neither is it to be sold to us at a dear
price, to the end we refuse it not, and much less will it be prised, because
it is without value and estimation: only all that is required of us, is, that
we retribute unto the Lord, love for love, and give our affection in recompense
and change of his. And seeing our love is ambicious and blind in worldly
things, and altogether carried to light and strange desires: Let not that man
think he gives little, who unto Jesus Christ gives his whole heart. And he,
since he sells not to us but love sincere and holy, let us not in enterchange
return to him affections fained, infected, and doubtful: great is the zeal
of Christ, who being love, and the better to lead our affections, he teaches
us how to love. The Lord make us as we ought to be, to the end we may the
better minister to his commandments and service: and seeing he is the true
Lord that has made us of earth, and referred us eftsoon to the destiny of
the earth, and that we have nothing to give in exchange for his love of gold,
but a small affection, and that cankared and infected. Let us beseech him, that
our corrupt dross may be made acceptable to him, and his precious and purified
gold become profitable to our salvation.

A short Letter partly in rebuke and partly in persuasion.
WHen the misery of others will not make you keep a mean with your fortune,
nor the experience of harms past, touch you in example and warning: I see no
other safety remaining, then may be hoped for in a ship, who tossed with many
storms seeks her security where the sea goes most high and raging. But
being happy in friends, you live careless of chances, esteeming your self
subject to the sentence of Solomon, that that which the evil man fears shall
assuredly happen unto him. I understand by your messenger the state of your
perplexity, together with the possibility of your peril, if present policy
be not used: for the which I am so much the more sorry by how much our friendship
is ancient, and so much the less careless, by how much it ministers
interest to our common alliance: (Two qualities of such fast conjunction, that
nothing can dissolve them, for that alliance is congealed in the blood, and
friendship makes his knot in the heart: as touching the regard of a friend, I
marvel I have not heard of you thus long; for that amongst friends, when their
persons are divided, the next office is to communicate by intelligence: but
remembering that forgetfulness is a sweet error, I have long since cut of all
expectation to hear front you, specially since you have dedicated your self
to sanctuaries, churchyardes, and churches of refuge, where I think you
establish your resort not so much for devotion and remorse, as to give cooller
to some abuse and wrong. Remember that to offend God, and disobey justice, is
an act so duly deserving punishment, that there is no doubt of the revenge,
though not upon the person of the imediat offender, yet upon the posterity
and generation of his house: this being an infallible rule in the revenge of
God, that when he deferreth, he strikes with more vehemency, redoubling the
blow according to the time he spares to strike. I pray you tell m^, if it be
ill done to hurt an other, why is it your practice, and if it be a virtue to
make restitution, why forbear you to satisfy the wrongs you have done: For
my part, I can not account it either to honor or valiancie for a man, to put
him self in necessity for the safety of his person, eschewing the face of
justice: no more is it wisdom in any man to offer his life to peril in hope
of remedy. I doubt whether at this instant, you stand in greater necessity of
counsel then of relief, for that they be two miseries that go jointly with
afflictions. Amongst all your other friends debating of your fortune, I pray
you think yt to give you counsel I am very young, and to minister to your
wants, I am a religious man: And yet, by ye virtue of our frie^dship, I ca^ not
but send to you, though not to satisfy you, yet to show my self careful,
hoping, that seeing my faculty stretches no further, you will accept my good
will, since that who gives what he has, can show no greater liberality.

Touching your business, I wish you to withdraw your self from thence, and be
more familiar here, by which mean you shall be further divided from your
adversaries, and find your judges more favorable, the same being also a degree
to appease the minds of your enemies if you cease to search them further, that
being the greatest revenge you can give to make small estimation of your
enemies. There is no love that wears not, nor hatred that ends not, if we
give place to time, and cut occasions from us: For, as tract of time carries
with it a law of forgetfulness of things past, so when the lover discontinueth,
and the enemy is absent, the love is turned into forgetfulness, and the hatred
into a mountain of smoke. Who will be free from blame, must not only forbear to
do ill, but eschew the suspicion: even so to purchase quiet, it is good to do
no wrong, but to keep us from quarrel, it is necessary to cut of occasions.

By the importunity of your request to solicit your cause, you seem to hold
my friendship suspected: Wherein your error is so much the greater, by how much
you know your business finds favor by my diligence and industry. And your
self can give good testimony that from the beginning my friendship has been
greater then your merit, and in my care and counsel have consisted the whole
course of your well doing: so that I wish your condition better tempred, then
to be bitter in hatred, and suspicious in friendship. You ought to know that in
all things there is mean, but in the conversation of a friend, with whom this
is chiefly to be observed, either altogether to forsake him, or wholly to
trust him, assuring you that yt man is no friend that retayneth distrust,
seeing friendship requires faith and merit. Amongst true friends nothing ought
to be rejected, nor any thing to deserve suspicion. And albeit it is not out of
policy to stand in distrust and doubt of our enemy, yet so simple ought we
to be toward our friend, as in his bosom to power our secrets, and not to be
Jealous of any counsel he gives, since true friendship can brook no
distrust, and where is no treason, there can be no possibility of deceit.

A Letter of a dainty Lady fallen sick for the death of her little dog.
MAdame, taking the opportunity as it is, I am bold to write to you, not so
much to comfort your sorrow, as to rebuke the occasion, esteeming me so much the
less apt to minister remedy, by how much your disease is particular, light,
and fantastike. Amongst such as are sick, it is a ready degree to amendment,
to reappose hope in their Physician: even so where the cause is more then
natural, there the office of the Physician is but vain, for that the patient
languisheth more by opinion the^ by infirmity. It ill becomes the Physician to
laughed at the grief of his Patient, and yet the cause being found vain and
easy, there is no reason he should make sorrow where the cure is neither
desperate nor doubtful: and more does it concerme the comfort of the sick,
that he be merry with the passion of his Patient, then to dissemble a heaviness
in that which of it self is both light and frivolous. It has been always a
condition of the world that where some perished, others found safety, where
one received honor, an other suffered infamy: And where some find cause to
smile and laugh, others are followed with tears and weeping, al proceeding of
the instabilitie and change that follows all the things of the world. And as
in one place of the sea we see the water calm and mylde, and in an other full
of tempest and storm: and one part of the land disposed to diversity of
weathers, and an other quarter all clear and resolved. So it happens many
times to the Children of men, that according to their diversity of
complexions, they bring forth variety of Passion, some suffering sickness, when
others enjoy health, many subject to malencolly, when others delight to be
merry, and sundry feel the headache with laughing, when the rest get sore eyes
with tears and weeping. So that it being a thing sure, that calmes succeed
storms, and storms follow fair weather, it is good that none swell and rise
high in prosperity, and much less be doubtful in adversity: For that in the
end there is no perplexity which wears not, nor any pleasure which loaseth
not his proper quality. And as all things are to be taken in one of these
three sorts, either to lament them, laugh at them, or dissemble them. So, good
Madame, your Passion (rising but for the loss of your little Dog,) deserves
more to be laughed at then dissembled, seeing that as you loved it vainly, so,
though you weep for it, yet your sorrow can not be but light. Our Moother
Eve sorowed for her son Abell, and Mary Magdalen wept for her sins: but you
bearing little compassion to your present offenses, and less consideration to
your virtues past, forbear not to shed tears for the loss of your little
Dog. A passion heretofore never expressed by any, and much less convenient
to your reputation and grauetie: For that to great Ladies striving to be holden
modest and virtuous, it ought to be a chief care to avoid the imputation of
vanity and lightness. And true tears being no other thing the drops of blood
which distill from the heart by the eyes, there is nothing wherein we can
express better effect of true affection, then to weep for the loss of our
friend: For that the sorrowful heart being enclosed within the intrailes, having
neither feet to go, nor hands to make signs, he manifests by mouth that
which he loves, and by his tears makes declaration of his pain. By which
argument (good Madam) I say it can not be but you bear no small affection to
your little Dog, seeing you mourn for him with so great appearance of sorrow.
The tongue publishes nothing but our thoughts, but in the tears is expressed
the true property of our affection, whereupon it follows, that though in
men and women be found sometime a custom of feigned words, yet, it can not
be but their tears for the most part are true and simple. And therefore it is
a false testimony against women to say that their tears be always feigned,
although in this they may dissemble, when they weep for one thing, to say it
is for an other, being a property very familiar with the most of them to have
two coollers to one meaning, and (as the saying is) to bear two complexions in
one face. This I have said for the defense of your sighs, and in favor of
your tears, which I think you have shed with small devotion, although with
very frank and good heart, seeing (according to the reapport) you have been
ever since travailed with an Ague, and exercised in those passions that keep
you continually in your Bed. But to use plainenes (according to my
profession) I can not marvel so much at your tears, as I am sorry that so
small a thing should make you to weep, being a thing more virtuous to lament
your sins, then to be heavy for the loss of your little puppie. And I can
not with patience believe, yt being as you are, both noble and honorable, and
therwithal reputed wise and virtuous, you have bestowed your love on a thing so
vile and base seeing that such are they that love, as is the thing that they
love: For that so great is ye force of love, that he that loves, suffers
conversion into ye thing which he loves, and therefore to love things
reasonable belongs to ye affections of men, but in loving things brute and
insensible, we cannot but be made like unto them. Your friends here bear some
shame, yt you have chosen so base a subject to govern your affection, and (not
without reason) do your enemies smile, and your friends mourn at it, for that it
is contrary to the virtue and reputation of any, either to fix their eyes, or
occupy their thoughts, but where the heart may be well employed, and the love
gratified. The best part of the body is the heart, and the most precious jewel
of the heart, is the affection, which if it be not well employed, the party
may esteem himself unhappy, for that in that man there can be possibility to
live well, in whom is no proof or mean of honest affection. What property of
love should you bear to your little puppie, from who you could draw no other
pleasure, then to array your garments with hairs, to make a noise in your
chamber when you would sleep, to fill you full of flease, and to be always in
fear to be stolen from you, all which conclude against your wisdom, for
mourning for a thing so harmefull and of so base importance. To love a little
dog, a Monkie, a Parrot, or other singing Bird, is not ill, nor dishonest, if
your affection be joined to this condition, not to follow them otherwise then
with your eyes to behold them, and your ears to hear them, not esteeming them
worthy of other affection: Seeing that of such things we may make our service
and solace without jealousy to keep them, or compassion to loase them. Yea to
make sorrow for such trifles, excedes the limits of an honorable Lady, and is
contrary to the office of a good Christian. Wherein, if I were the judge before
whom should be debated the love you bear to your little Dog, and the
transgressions of your life, sure I could not but laugh at the folly of the
one, and weep for the Offenses of the other. It is Written that the great
Alexander buried his horse, the Emperor Augustus his Parrot, and Prince
Heliogabalus made a grave for his Sparow. at whose obsequies he prayed, and
caused the body to be embawmed. If you had hard or read of these, it may be by
their example, you would have built a a tomb for your little Dog, although I
account to worse purpose the tears you have let fall for him, then the
sepulchers and ceremonies which those Pagans made for their dead beasts. And
so good Madame, God give you a spirit to weep for your sins, and a mind to
leave of to mouone for things vain and transitory.

To an old Gentleman enamored of a young Lady: this letter touches the
perplexities which amorous Dames give to their servants and friends.
AFter so long scilence, I would some better occasion, had been given, then to
recontinue our ancient quarrel, wherein is no expectation of other effect,
then happens by the Surgeon when he comes to reaue in an old wound,
which, by how much more it has discontinued the use and service of plaesters,
by so much does it bring pain to the patient, suffering the new opening of his
hurt. And albeit amongst friends there can not be a more necessary action
then to minister counsel, the same being the first effect of that faith and
virtue which ought to be considered in the election of friends. Yet, to some
men it is hateful to be counseled in things contrary to their will and
affection, esteming it better to dwell in the lust of their particular desires,
then to be warned, even as the miserable patient finds it sweeter to give
liberty to his wound, then to suffer it to have cure with a little pain in the
beginning.

But, for my part, having joined always our long friendship, an honest care of
your weldoing: I can not hold my self discharged in office, if I debate not
franckly the estate of your ancient abuses, although there remaynes no
expectation of other fruit then happens to the Surgeon, who coming to
uncover an old wound long corrupted, seems griuous to his patient. I perceive
by your letter you are falen into a practice of new loves, which being a new
hurt to your old wound, you seem also to demand a new remedy at my hand, as
though I had the faculty, both to let blood and close up the vain. I would I
were with you, for that having liberty to communicate, there may be many
things spoken, which are not convenient to be written. But more do I wish that
you would have used me in an other office, since for matters of love, you are
not now in age to follow it, and much less is it consonant to my grauetie to
give you counsel, my habit, my authority, and my place being all against it.
It is not to you and me to whom it belongs to solicit in love, and much
less are we subjects wherein he takes his delites, grace and recreation. For
that you being laden with years, and I tied to my profession, in you is
expressed too great debilitie, and in me no less want of liberty. Believe not
that your love, is true love, but rather sorrow, not joy, but perplexity, not
delight, but torment: not co^tentme^t, but grief: not honest recreation, but
very confusion: Seeing that in him that is a lover, must be looked for, youth,
liberty, and liberality. Straw that is rotten and become doung, is better to
fat land, then to lay upon a house: and in a body broken and aged, is more
use and service of sorrow and infirmities, then possibility to suffer, bear
passion, and solicit in love: For that to Cupid and Venus are not acceptable
any sorts of people, but young men to serve them, such as are liberal to
spare for no cost, patient to endure, discreet to speak, secret to conceal,
faithful to deserve, and constant to continue to the end. It is a misery to be
poor and proud, to be reuengefull and dare not strike, to be sick and far
from succor, to be subject to our enemies, and lastly to suffer peril of life
without refuge. But for an old man to be in love, is the greatest wretchedness
that can travel the life of man: For, the pooreman sometimes finds pity,
but the old lover stands always rejected. The coward finds friends to bear
out his quarrels, but the amorous old man lives always persecuted with
passions. He that is sick lives under the climate of Gods providence, where the
amorous old man is abandoned of all succor. He that is subject to his enemies,
is not sometimes without his seasons of consolation and quiet, where, to the
old lover is no time of truce nor hope of reconcilement. Lastly there is no
peril of life so desperate which may not be forseene or suffered: where the
estate of the amorous old man is joined always to danger. He is always vexed
with scorns of his Lady, defaced by his neighbors, robbed of his servants,
and serviceable even to the seasons and appoyntments of Bawdes, who are not
without their pouders whose property is to trouble his sleep on the night,
and keep him jealous on the day, leading his mind in Ague fits, sometimes hot
and sometimes cold, sometimes glad, and sometimes sorrowful, someiimes
doubtful, and sometimes assured, and always in expectation but never
satisfied. By mean whereof I hold all the faculties and sciences of the world
possible to be learned, but the trade to love, which Solomon was too ignorant
to write, and Ovid not hable to set down in rule and precept. For that it only
is a doctrine that ought to be drawn out of the schole of the heart, and guided
by true and perfect discretion. There is nothing that more requires
government then the practice of love: seeing that in cases of hunger, thirst,
cold, heat, and all other natural influences, they may be referred to Passions
sensible only to the body: But the follies and faults that are done in love,
the heart is subject to suffer, feel, and bewail them, since love, more then
all other things natural, retayneth always this property, to exercise
tirannie chiefly against the hearts of his subjects.

The better to establish stabilitie, assurance and constancy, it behooves such
as do love to be equal: For, if she be young and he old, if he be private and
she a wanderer, if she a nigard and he prodigal: If he civil, and she rude:
if she discreet and he foolish: if lastly he love and she hate: There is no
doubt but imperfect loves will resolve into iarres, contencions, and continual
disquiets. For that, where is not conformity of condition, there can be no
contented love, no more then where is no true faith, can be no true operation
of good life and manners. It is impossible to an old man and a lover to be
without sorrow or suspicion: For that jealousy is joined to love as the Briare
is to the Rose, and passion follows old age, as the shadow does the man.
Why should then a man of your age containing more then threescore years,
plucked with aches and pinched with the gout, seek the company of a young,
fair, and amorous Lady, who will study more to plume upon you, then to please
you, esteming you for no other use, then to minister to her wants, give cooller
to her lightness, and protect her abuses? For, being not able to please her eye,
you must perform her prodigalities: and being impotent to delight her, your
office must be to suffer an other to supply that which you are not hable to
satisfy. Why desire you the company of a friend, seeing between you and her
can pass no other community or conversation, then to read Ridles and dreams,
and tell tales, complaining that of the day you have no stomach to meat, and
on the night you do nothing but account the hours, and exercise hateful to
women, and a custom intolerable such as have been enured to men of better
complexion? Why seek you a friend, seeing you have no power to entertain her,
no patience to endure her, nor age to possess her: For that amongst women this
is infallibly observed, that if their friend be poor, they disdain him, if
he be waspish they seek to vex him further: and being old, they scorn their
age, and seek their recompense of others? What fruit look you to draw from
a friend, seeing you are not hable to tell her in order the passions you endure
for her, nor the felicities you wish to her: Al women for ye most part
enclining to this glory, to hear of the torments of their friends, and to
see their servants labor to be serviceable. How can you desire the society of
a friend, seeing, if you write not to her on the day, you are sure to find her
froward at night, and bestowing no present upon her, she will return
recompense to your coffeehouse: For being not courted with songs and
letters to extol her beauty, and not visited with presents to please her
ambicion: Oh it were more safe to behold a Cockatrice, then hope for pity in
her face. Why desire you a friend, seeing you must deny her nothing she
demaundes, nor mislike with any displeasure she does to you: For, women being
denied (not considering their own unworthiness) conster it to the despite of
the party for whom they prepare revenge, And if you make not their displeasure
your felicity, they will charge you with want of love, and affront you with
toys to your perpetual disquiet. Why keep you a friend, to whom you must not
minister according to your port and hauiour, but according to her folly and
ambicion: For, a friend marcenarie in love, is not subject to allowance, and
much less regards the proporcion of him that entertayneth her, but being
compounded upon insatiable humors, she is never satisfied, till she see him
utterly spoiled. Why require you a friend, seeing you must not fail to thank
her for the favors you receive, and hold it a duty to bear her displeasures:
For, in them though there be but little merit, yet they look for great
recompense, and if they do nothing but vex you, yet you must judge all to the
best, and take nothing to blame. Why seek you a friend, seeing when she
flattreth you most, it is not to content you, but under this intencion to draw
something from you: For, women to work their desires, can turn them selves
into so many subtelties and sugared humilities, as the Camelion into coollers,
or the iugler into strange devises to deceive the beholders. And if you have a
friend, you must enforce your self to laugh even when the dollors of your
Gout prouokes you most to cry. And before you have had full possession of her,
she will cast you up laden with sorrow, care, jealousy, and all other
troublesome infirmities, and for recompense join her self to an other with
whom she will laugh to see you poor, impotent, deceived, and spoiled. And
therefore to one of your age and subjection to sickness, it were better to
delight in the conversation of some honest companion to cherish and recreate
you, then in the company of a young Lady to make your days troublesome.

Samocratius, Nigidius, and Ovid, have written many volumes of the remedy of
love, wherein they rather taught remedy to others, then found any them selves,
for that they all three died in persecution, not for the abuses they committed
at Rome, but for the loves they practiced at Capua. Let them say what they
will, and surmise that best may please their fancy, but according to
experience, the best remedy in love, is to eschew conversation, and avoid
occasion: for that of many that follow him, there are few free from his
bondage, where such as abandon him live always in liberty. Take heed
therefore you dwell not long in that temptation, seeing it is not convenient
for your soul, your body, your honor, nor profit of your house, assuring
you that more shall you hasten your death by the perplexities of your
Mistress, then by the torment or dollor of the Gout. And so I pray you keep
me still in your favor, and command me always as your own.

A Letter aunswering certain particular requests from the Court, and that it
is not convenient to visit often those women whose husbands be absent.
IT is written, in praise of the liberality of Alexander the great, that one
Byance a poor soldier of his, asking some small portion for the marriage of
his daughter: he gave him a City rich and populous. The greatness of the gift
so far exceeded the capacity of ye poor soldier that the desired
Alexander eftsoon to consider better what he gave, and to whom he gave it: For
(says he) it may be, your greatness takes me for an other then I am, or at
least understands not what I demand: To whom the king answered. Take what I
give thee and be contented, since if thou be Byance that ask, I am Alexander
that gives. In like sort the great Queen Cleopatra, albeit she was of
amorous life, yet otherwise she exercised great liberalities, never giving to
any man so little which was not sufficient to relieve his present wantes, and
keep him from misery all the rest of his life. These two examples I have used
(sir) to publish your liberality, that sending to you for a small thing, you
returned my messenger so laden with rewards, that the world may see, that if I
have the poverty of Byance, in you is expressed the liberality of Alexander:
And by the testimony of this letter, all men may approve my demand, and give
commendation to your bounty, seeing I showed no ambicion in my request, nor
you expressed want of liberality in your recompense. You write ty me to
advertise you how the Lady Angelo my neighbor and your Aunt does: since the
departure of her husband I have not seen her, nor mean to go to her, It is
not convenient to visit often an other ma^s wife in the absence of her husband.
unless she send for me: For that, to women whose husbands are absent, albeit
we are bound to aid them, yet we have no license to visit them often: A wife
being the dearest of the two things (according to the common saying) which we
ought not to lend, nor commit to the trust of any other.

Lucresse, living private during the absence of her husband, fell by force into
the rape of Tarquinius, by which vile act, Rome suffered sclaunder, the wars
brake up, Lucresse killed her self, and Tarquine was destroyed. So that to the
wives of our friends, it is sufficient to minister to their wantes if they have
need, or protect them, if there be cause of oppression, without visiting them
often, and much less to entertayne discourse with them. Seeing the malice of
men is so great, and the honor of women so delicate, that in often resort the
world takes occasion to raise brutes, and their husbands not without
advantage to be discontented. I have spoken to the Chauncellor about your
business, wherein though you prevail not to your desire, yet there shall be no
fault in my solicitation. In him that has business in Court, ought never to
be want of patience, nor too great confidence or trust: For that in Court,
rewards go not by merit, but by affection, and the success of suits is more
led by Fortune, then by wisdom. In Court, we see many reasonable causes that
be just and indifferent reuersed even when they are at point to be resolved:
and others of no expectation or hope of end, to be dispatched to the liking
of the party: So that in Court let no man reappose confidence in the favor of
an other, and much less despair, if to his suit be joined delay or denial.

I have often dealt with the Coronell to receive your Nephew for his
Liefetenant, and being so often denied, I take it for a discharge no more to
trouble him: For, it is a hard thing to a liberal mind and a shamefast face,
to be a suter to him in whom is no merit to be entreated, but specially when
he tourneth our importunity to his glory, and makes us ashamed of our
request: In which respect there is nothing in this world which I hold more
dear, then that which is bought by suit and request: seeing that more does
that man give which for one hour employeth the shame of his face, then another
that for any other thing shall give all his goods: the same agreeing with the
opinion of Plato, that as great is the contentment which a good heart takes in
giving, as it is grief to him that entreteth and is denied: For that in
giving, the one buyeth the liberty of an other, and in receiving, the other
puttes in subjection himself and all that he has. Touching the money you sent
me for your books, I have returned it again by the bearer, praying you to
think that the pleasure which one friend does for an other ought not to be
paid with ready money, but with retribution of equal recompense or value: And
by sending to me so little money so far of, the world may think, that either
you suffer want of friendship, or in me is lack of liberality. The frendshippe
grounded upon covetousness is ended by covetousness, and therefore amongst
true friends, there ought to be no end in friendship, nor limit in
liberality. Where you write to be advertised of the affairs of the Bishop
of T. I answer that it is no small pain to have to do with men wanting
government, and of no will to put their minds in quiet and tranquillity.
Seeing that in whom is no controlement of tongue, nor bridle to restrain their
self will, in them is for the most part sufficient occasion to trouble whole
Commonweals where they dwell, and to themselves to bring no small contention.
Yea, there cannot be a greater disgrace in a man, then to be discontented in
himself: For albeit no man in this world can live contented on all parts,
yet, we may either quite exempt our selves, or at least avoid many of those
troubles and displeasures which of our selves we search. There be many people
of this nature, not only not to eschew harms and inconveniences, but also
will put wings to their fortune, and run to seek them before they be ready
to happen. More is the necessity of industry to restrain and stay such men
from doing harm to themselves, then for avoiding hurt to others. Of that sort
of men is the Bishop of T. who bears his great affairs, as the Sumpterhorse
does his burden, who whylest it is in laying on his back stands still and
sturreth not, but if you offer to take it of, he yearkes and flinges as though
there were peril toward him. Your L. may be sorry for the loss of our dear
friend, F. M. who losing his life, has left his friends void of the society
of a noble Gentleman: assuring you that if he had believed my advise, that
misefortune had not happened: For that I always told him that a faction of the
communalty, is no other thing then a hollow Echo, which resoundes with a voice
and sound clear, but can not be found, nor bears no substance. And
therefore to men that travel in the action of great affairs, it is no
wisdom to reject the Council of friends, for that otherwise who will not
take moderate correction, shall be sewer to suffer penance of a blouddie and
vyolent force.

A discourse touching such as are in the Ministry and profess Religion.
Qui perseuerauerit vsque in finem saluus erit.
SAint Matthew in his xxiiij. chapter, promises this comfortable recompense to
such as follow the service of god in religion, that who perseuereth to the end,
shall be saved, and receive for reward the everlasting joys of heaven.
Wherein albeit the redeemer of the world taught his Disciples to be Christians
(and that in renouncing their proper wills) and tied them straytly to the law
and observation of his commandments: yet, by the doctrine of these words,
we see it does little avail all that they can do, if they persevere not to the
end. But to make more plain and easy to the understanding of men, these
words of Jesus Christ, we must first presuppose that as many vices are
disguised with the similitude of virtues, so, in many virtues, is a plain face
and appearance of vice, as patience, constancy, magnanimity, benignity, long
suffering, humility, and force, the truth and property of all which being
known, we shall find that every one is subject to his particular and diverse
diffinition. The virtue of patience is no other thing, then a heart martired in
sorrows and passions, The virtue of patience.
expressing notwithstanding in his outward actions, a spirit of contentment
and gladness, and not only bears his present perplexities, but also is
prepared to the passion of al such as may happen: of this sort was the patience
of Tobias and Job, in whom much less that there could be discovered any estat
or show of their griefs, but as true examples of patience, seemed to take
pleasure in their adversities, even as the Salimander that delyts to bath his
limbs amid the flames of most whot burning fire. The virtue of constancy is
then declared, The virtue of constancy.
when a man neither by trouble, disgrace, or misfortune changes not his
heart from the devotion and business he follows, as was expressed in the
perseueraunce of the happy Joseph in Egypt, and the assurance of that affable
Moses in the Desert, In whom the offer of Beauty and what else appertains
to the sweet desires of the flesh, had no power of Temptation in the one: nor
in the mutiny and murmr of so many factious people, was possibilytie to
wythdraw the other from the service he was called unto. That is true
Magnanimity, when the heart of one man alone dare enterprise upon grave
things both dangerous to begin, and very hard to execute: Magnanimity.
the efect of this virtue was well expressed in the Prophet David, when he
assailed and vanquished the Giant, and in Elyas when he roase to confound
Jezabell,

The virtue of Benignetie or myldenesse of heart, Benignity or softnes of
heart.
is joined to that man, who seeks not nor will not render ill for ill, no not
so much as to recompense a wrong received, with injuries or vile words,
according to the myldnesse of Micheas, who suffering an outrage of a blow on
the ear, the injury was afterward revenged by a Dog. The virtue of long
sufferance appears in that man, Long suffering
that is neither weary nor vexed, though his troubles and perplexities
increase, and his helps and remedies diminishe and are far of: according to
the experience and testimony of S. Paul, who was traveled with many malices
and dangers in the world and that for many years. The virtue of meekness,
Humility.
or humility, follows that man whose heart is resolved into such
tranquillity, that he is not moved for any injury he hears, and much less
disquieted for any vice he sees. With this virtue was endued the holy man S.
John Evangelist, in whose humilytie and myldnesse of mind, is an example to
all Christians to yield to the adversities that the enemies of God impose
upon them, hoping for that comfort and reward which that holy man did find.
The virtue of force.
This is a true effect of the virtue of force, when a man stands so resolute
and valiant in mind, that neither by Temptation he waxes weak, nor by
importunity of travel, he forbeareth to do good: Of this virtue were notable
and holy examples S. Anthony, and S. Hillary, suffering great Temptations in
the Desert, and yet not forbearing even there to do great services to God. But
for that our principal intention is, to entreat of the excellencies of
perseverance, adjoining with all, what necessity we have of the virtue of
force, it is not impertinent that we touch somewhat the opinions of the
Philosophers, and also what the holy Fathers thought particularly of it. S.
Augustine says, that no other thing is the virtue of force, then a Burning and
vehement affection traveling a free and liberal mind, passible to all
things, whether their qualetie be hard or easy, until he attain to that he
desires, or possess the things whereon he has fixed his affection and
zeal. Cicero, speaking of force, attributed firmness and constancy to no
other thing, then a determination of a valiant mind, who dissembleth that
which he desires, and suffers things that he would not. Macrobus refers
to no other thing the virtue of force, then to the heart of a man Heroycall and
valiant, whom prosperity cannot raise into weening or fircenes, nor adversity
makes weak or faint in courage. Aristotle gives this judgment of the virtue of
force, that it is a certain strength and courage of a mind resolute,
Adversity is no other thing the^ the reward of some dishonest act.
which esteems adversity to be no other thing, then the stipende and
recompense of some dishonest act. Lucius Senequa, attributes so much to the
excellency of a man hardy and valiant, that he makes it more easy to take a
City well guarded, then to vanquish a mind environed with force and virtue.
Saint Hierome says, that no other thing is the discourse of this life, then a
high and publyke way, on whose right hand marches the valyant and hardy man,
on the left part, the coward and faint hearted, and between them, goes he that
we call strong and resolute. Plato is of opinion that the prerogatives of
constancy and force, are to moderate anger with meekness, malice with love,
adversity with perseverance, and fear with patience. S. Gregory refers the
virtue and operation of constancy and force, to vanquishe the flesh, to
resist appetytes, to despise delytes, to affect things of hard enterprise, and
not to eschew those that are perilous and paynefull. So great is the qualetie
of this virtue of force, that it is necessary to all the other virtues: For, if
it minister not to justice, Temperance, Chastetie, and wisdom to come to
their ends, they would easily loase their operation, and suffer conversion. So
that to enterprise any good work, wisdom is necessary for the beginning,
discretion to manage and guide it, and constancy to bring it to execution. The
good luck and felicity of the good Pilot consistes not altogether to guyd
well the Helm, but rather that he bring it to aryue safe at the Haven. Even so
Jesus Christ promyseth not the Kingdom of Heaven to such only as are
Baptized, nor to him that is called a Christian, and much less to any that
for a time does the Works of a Christian, if he persevere not in his Service.
For, the Crown of Tryumphe, is not bestowed upon him that goes to the
Wars, but is worthily reserved for such as obtain the victory. Even as in
the like resemblaunce, it is a vain Labor to the Husbandman to manure and
sow his Land, if afterward either for fear to be tyered, or in doubt to be
made weary with travel, he forbear to labor in Harvest, and forgets to
bring his Corn home to the Barn. Likewise if a Poor man making some voyage,
and doubting to find the way hard, or uneasy, or his Journey long,
retourneth, geeuing over that he has begone: Let him assuredly look to loase
that he has spent, and wythall to forgo the purpose and expectation of his
Travail. He that Labors by the day, is not paid his hyer for that he
brynges only his Mattocke into the Garden, but workyng from Morning till
night, he is woorthye of his Wages and has it. The wife of Loath was
transformed into an Image or stoane of Salt, for that she turned her head to
look back to Sodom contrary to the Commandment of God, saying, Go
always forth right without loking back: The same being an example and
doctrine to instruct us how wretched the world is, and having once forsaken
it, we ought not so much as once Look back to it, and much less reappose
Confydence in it.

Great was the constancy of Moses and Aaron, in not condiscending to the
Requests, Presents, and Threats, which the great King Pharao practiced, to
have them abide in Egypt, and not to draw from thence the People of Israel,
with whom I agree, that in cases to return to the world, and give over any
good thing that we have begone, we ought to reject the prayers of our friends,
and much less to be moved with any other temptation. Of this is a good example
Joseph the son of Jacob, who being sold into Egypt, and in great
opportunity to possess the beauty of the queen, would not for all that
defyle his conscience, but had regard to his constancy, and bare care to the
reputation of his master. By his example let us be warned that greater
necessity have we of resolute minds to resist vices and present sins,
together with the offers and temptations that are ministered, then to repulse or
defend an enemy that assayleth us. Many were the persuasions of the Brethren
of David, to have the king to return to his house and go no more to the
Wars, but much less that their importunities were sufficient to make him
give over Arms, seeing he redoubled his courage, and eftsoons assailed the
great Goliath: Geeuing us to know thereby, that we ought rather to loase the
lives that we have, then to leave of the good we have beegonne. Much was
esteemed the Constancy of Nehemias and Esdras, in the Buylding of the Temple
which they made at Jerusalem, in which work many threatened them, they
suffered many passions of injuries, and were by many ways dysswaded from their
enterprise. Wherefore let the Servant of god hold it for a sign that he does
then some good work, when the wicked wythstande or contend against him. Great
was the Constancy of Mardocheas uncle to the Queen Hester, when he could not
be brought to do worship nor any humylity to proud Hama^, a grauer of Idols,
and great enemy to the Hebrews: by whose examples we are taught that it belongs
to us to estra^ge our selves altogether from those men, that diswade us from
our salvation and inuit us to sin: No less was the constancy of the holy
woman Susanna in disobeying the wicked judges, desiring her to defile marriage,
and consent to their cursed lust. Whose virtue may serve as a doctrine to all
Christians, that neither for fear of Punishment nor by force, none ought to
commit any great transgression, seeing God keeps a guard and reckoning as well
of our honor as our life, and is as ready for our defense as he was to preserve
the chastetie of Susanna. All these examples I thought not amiss to reduce
into discourse, to the end that good men might strive still to pursue the
service of the Lord, and the wicked be afryayde to turn back: Wherein let
all men hold this for a faith and law infallible, that the Lord never
forgets him that serves him, and much less is far from those that follow
him, according to his providence over the Prophet Daniell, who being out of his
Country, and by the sentence of tyrants thrown into the Den of Lions,
abandoned of all succor of men, was not forgot of the Lord, who sent his
Prophet Abacuke, not only to visit him, but also to comfort and refreshe him
with meat. By this also we may infer, that if we forget not to serve God, he
will not forget to minister remedy to our distresses, as knowing right well the
little we have, and the less we can do. And therefore let us not give over
to Serve him, and much less forbear to follow him, seeing he does Capitulate
with all men, that if in his Service they do that which they may, he will
recompense them with the effect of all their desires. So that, how lame, weak
or frail so ever we be, we ought not (in the action of Gods service) say, We
can not, and therefore we will not. For that we have a Lord so good and easy
to content, that he takes us not as we are, but has respect to that we desire
to be.

Agreeable to these, S. Barnard uses this text. Debilis est hostis, qui non
vincit nisi volentem, as if he had said, the Devil of his nature is weak,
and the Lord holds him so restrained and unable, that he has no power to
vanquishe any, but such as cannot resist him. At the Gates of the heart of a
Christian knocks Jesus Christ, and also knocks the Devil and offers to
enter, so that in that case, we cannot deny, that it is not in our hand to
receive the one, and rereiect the other: And therefore neither has the Devil
any prerogative to enter one house unless we admit him, nor the spirit of God
does depart out of our heart, if our selves make not the way for him: O
miserable man, what shall become of thee, when the Lord calls thee to
reckoning, saying he has entreated thee, and thou have not followed him: He
has admonished thee and thou have not beeleeued him: he has called thee, but
thou have not answered: he has spoken to thee but thou have not known him:
Yea he has touched thee, but thou have not felt him. God, speaking to David
(as he was wont to communicate with his friends and servants) says: I hold
not so great a care over my Elect, when they eat, when they sleep, or in
their other actions: as when they sigh and weep: Yea, if they will call upon
me in their tribulations, and somewhat attend me, I will draw them out of their
troubles, not only comforted, but also to their honor and Estimation: Wherein
we have reason to know that God loves us above all others, seeing he byndes
himself to do more for us then all the world again. For, according to the
property of the world: our frindes help us to spend the goods we have
gotten, where the Lord aids us to bear the trauelles we suffer. And
therefore the servant of God ought to consider, that when Jesus Christ says,
Beati qui lugent quoniam ipsi consolabuntur. He establishes not a happiness
and felicity only in that men weep and mourn, but refers it to
consolation, that they exspect of their tears. So that to the wise and good
Christian, it is not so much to behold the Temptation which of the enmie he
suffers, as to consider the recompense which of the Lord he expectes. The
simple husbandman, when the season and the weather agree, is not affrayde to
cast his seed into the dust of the earth recommending the increase to the
Lord, and dare not true Christians commit their estate to the hands of God
their Cretor in whom remains the everlasting providence over all. And seeing he
is the truth wherein men ought to believe, and the life in whom we ought to
live, and lastly the way by the which we ought to walk, he inuiteth us thereby
to believe him, and so to possess our desires: to live in him, to the end we
may be made happy by the benefit of his promises: and lastly to walk in his
ways to the end he may guide us, and if we stumble or fall, he may lend us
his hand eftsoons to remount us.

Non sumus sufficientes cogitare aliquid ex nobis, tanquam ex nobis, sed
sufficientia nostra ex deo est. We have no license says S. Paul, to think or
presume any thing of our selves, and much less sufficient by our industry
only to do any good work. But this ought rather to be our belief, that if we
do or know to do any good, we have power thereunto by the grace of God: like
as also if we err in any thing, it comes for that we having forgot God, he
forgets us and tournes us over to our proper errors. And therefore, that
Christian, that begins any thing in confidence of his proper force or power,
has great reason to live in suspicion of himself, and set good guard of his
doings: for though it be in the cunning of men to give the battle, it rests
only in the wisdom of God to dispose the victory. So, that who determines
to serve God, and unfeignedly repose confidence in him, has no necessity nor
reason of fear of himself, or to be hurt by any other: For that, so great a
providence has god over his servants, that though he suffer them to be
tempted, yet he consents not that they be vanquished, if it be not of their
proper will. The Devil obtained license of God to tempt Job, but it was given
him under this condition, that though he afflicted his body, yet he should not
touch his soul: Whereby we may note, that our Lord showed not so much the
love he bears to his servants in taking from them their perplexities and
trauelles, but rather in dividing them far from sins. In like sort the
Devil gat leave to deceive the wretched Achab, by the mean and industry of
false prophets: In which two examples, we may see what difference is used
between the friends and enemies of God: seeing to such as serve him, he
suffers that they be tempted only, but to those that offend him, he gives
leave that they be beguyled. Grant therefore Oh good Jesus and love of our
souls, that we may rather be tempted, troubled, persecuted, and vexed with the
happy man Job, then beguiled, vanquished, and abandoned as was the wretched
king Achab. If it be familiar to the men of the world to pass from place to
place at their pleasure under protection and safe conduit, In greater assurance
do walk all such as love and serve God. For that he has promised by his
Prophet Micheas, that who shall lay hands upon any one of his Elect, shall
touch even the Apple of his eye, keeping such a merciful providence over them,
that if he suffer them to slide into sin, he is ready forthwyth to minister
his grace. And therefore such deserve not to be called Christians, and much
less to bear estimation in the ministry, who forbear to serve the Lord for
fear to be tempted, or that they doubt of his succors, seeing (according to
the testimony of David) God bears to his chosen such property of affection,
that he pitcheth his Tents round about them to defend them, his ears are
open to hear them if they appeal to him in their adversities, and he
accompanies them with his holy Angel, to the end they err not, he beholds
the calamities they endure, and yeeldes compassion to the complayntes they
make, accordinh to the comfort of the Psalm, O culi domini super iustos, et
aures eius ad praeces eorum.

Still touching the discourse of Religion and of the professors of the same.
ANd albeit these words of our Lord, That who perseuereth not to the end shall
not be saved, are general to all Christians, yet they concern most chiefly
such as be of the ministry, who being called to an estate so holy, by how
much they are chosen as men most necessary and worthy by so much more do they
offend the majesty of God if they renounce or leave it: Redite domino deo
vestro, says God by his prophet, If you promise any thing to your God, look
to offer it and give it. For a man having once past his promise must consider
that to do any thing is an office and action of the will, but the
accomplishment thereof, is of necessity. The Church compels no man to take
baptism, but after we be once received she has power to constrain us to live
like Christians: Euenso, there neither is nor ought to be authority to enforce
one an other to change habyte or enter the ministry, but being once possessed
of the orders, we are bound to keep our profession. Yea, it belonges to the
ministers of the Church to know, that the perfection of religion consists not
only to take the habyt, to forsake the world, and to be enclosed within the
precinct of his vycarage and Churchyard: But with all to him appertaynes the
passion of pains, troubles, and injuries, and to strive, to resist his
affections, and lastely to be constant with his brethren: For that, to live in
order is a thing easy, but to persevere to ye end is entangled with great
hardness. Non cessamus pro vobis orare vt dignos vos faciat vocatione sua: we
pray to the Lord continually says ye apostle, to ye end you may be made worthy
of his ministry, yt is yt you be thought meet to be called by him, and that
he call you as he is wont to call those whom he loves. God inuiteth all, God
calls all, and entreats them to serve and follow him: But amongst all
others, those whom he calls particulerlye, those does he hold up with his
hand, and if he suffer them to slide, he is ready to help them up
again. Such as be called of God persevere to the end, but those whom the
Ennemie leads, return eftsoons to the World. Great is the comfort of
such as are come into Religion guyded by the hand of God, seeing it is
aduouched in the Scriptures that the holy Ghost led Jesus into the Desert, and
the wicked spirit carried him up to the Temple, not with intention that he
should Preach, but rather to throw himself headlong from the place. There
were many other places in Jerusalem more high, then that which the Devil led
Christ unto, but he desired nothing more then to make Jesus Christ fall from the
pinnacle of the temple, by yt which we are instructed that greater vaunt does
the Devil make, to make one of those fall which are consecrated to Christ, the^
a hundredth of such as Profane and wander in the World. And therwithall we
are taught that the fall which the servant of God makes in the ministry, is
dangerous to the soul: doubtful to his conscience, and most slanderous to
the common weal. It is written in the discourse of the lives of the fathers of
Egypt, that one of those holy ancients saw in a vision the assembly of Devils,
and hearing every one report the diversity of illusions, wherewyth they had be
guiled the world, he saw their Prince make greater gratulation and recompense
to one of those ill spirits that had deceived a virtuous man of the Church,
then to all the rest sturring thousands to transgression and sin: two of ye
children of the great sacrificator Aaron, were burned for no other occasion,
then for that they had transgressed in one Cerimony of the Temple: And albeit,
in the congregation there were (no doubt) greater sinners then those two
Children: yet God saw cause to punish them, and dissemble with the others, the
better to make us to know, that the estate of the ministers is of such
perfection, that that which to the world is esteemed ceremony, the same to men
of the Church is rule and precept, and the breach of it, a sin mortal So
that until the Church militant be ended and that we go to enjoy the Church
triumphant, of necessity dross will be mingled with gold, chaffgo with corn,
the thorn grow with the Roase, marrow joined to the bones and good men be
consociat with the wicked: yea, and this is no small wretchedness, that many
times it is more hard to endure a wicked man in the ministry. then all the
temptations which the illuding spirit can stir up there. Vtinam recedant qui
conturbant nos: Would to God (says S. Paul) such as trouble our common weal,
were divided from our company: the man of the Church being wicked does this
hurt in the congregation, either to prouok others to sin by his example, or
at least to stir them to murmr by his vile persuasions: seeing the pot that
boileth to much, casts out his fatnes: the troublesome sea reuerseth the
ships: the vyolent wind renteth up trees by the roots: and fluddes over
flowing their channels, spoil the corn: Even so the minister which is not
studious, or geeueth not himself to prayer, or lastly occupies not his mind
with some exercise of the hand, much less that he preuayleth in his function,
but is an instrument of evil to such as he can make like to himself: the first
curse that God gave in the world was to the envious Cayne, saying, Quia
occidisti fratrem tuum, eris vagus, et profugus super terram. Seeing I have
bestowed thee upon the earth, and thou have there defiled thy self with the
blood of thy Brother, thou shall have my curse to go as a vagabounde in the
world, and live discontented: according to which words of God to Cayne, (I
say,) that for a man of order, it is an other Paradise the tranquillity that
he finds in the exercise of the ministry: But to him that has a will
corrupted, it is a Hell to be subject in that place. Sewer in good
consideration, there is not under Heaven the like tranquillity as to be in
company of good men, and to pray to God in society of such as be virtuous.
And as Christ would never have given to Cayne so great a curse, if he had not
committed so vile a Treason against his brother: So, the Lord never suffers
that any minister, or man of the Church wander or go as a vagabound through the
world, but for the punishment of some notable offense he has done in the
church: being in the favor of God, we are come into the Church, and being in
his disgrace, we are discontent and disdained in the same: whereupon it follows
that the minister well instructed lives always content, where such as are
dissolute travel for the most part in sedition and Emotion. And therefore to
those may we refer the malediction of Cayne, who wandering prophanly from place
to place, seek out new companio^s and conversation to entertain the time with
idle and dissolute exercise, and turn their function into a form of evil
life and example: upon him does fall the malediction of Cayne, in whom remains
a mind wavering and inconstant seeking change of church and cure without
occasion, and desires to live under new Bishops and ordinaries, not with
intention to amend his life, but to seek out where he may live in greatest
liberty: Yea, such one finds no time nor place better agreeing to him, then
where he may live out of subjection of superiors: upon that man is thundered the
malediction to whom it is troublesome to pray, grievous to study, and hateful
to instruct and preach: but rather as a man repenting his vocation, wandreth up
and down ill contented, showing wicked example by his complayntes: And lastly
to that man is referred the malediction, who is factious in his ministry, at
contention with his bishop, and seeks occasions to return eftsoons to the
world, procuring business to solicyte, and being denied license to follow his
worldely causes, he is full of murmr, and obteyning leave, he runs
headlong to his own destruction.

The end of this discourse rebuking such ministers as are wanderers.
MAny be the means which the Minister (within his Church) has to serve God
wythall: For if the humor of Pride reign in him, if envy disquiet him, if
Gluttony tempt him: if Ire provoke him, or the lusts of the flesh prick him:
vices albeit hable to move him, yet of no power to make him fall, neither can
he so easily resist them, having conversation in the world, seeing he is no
sooner tempted, then subject to fall. The building without his covering
shrinketh easily, ye Marrow without the bone is soon dried up, the tree
without his bark is subject to renting, and the man of the Church, leaving the
Church, runs easily to destruction. If Dina daughter to the Patriarch Jacob,
had not gone from the place where her Father bestowed her, neither had Emor ben
killed, nor she defamed. If wretched Judas had not swarued from the colleadg of
Christ, nor divided himself from the company of the Apostles, he had never
done ye sin, whose vileness carried him to a desperate death. By which notable
examples, all men of the Church ought to be warned not to leave the
profession whereunto God has called them, nor to be divided from the Company
of whom he has made them members. For that much will be to his profit the
good examples which he shall take of some, and of no less avail the wholesome
counsels which he shall give to others. By mean whereof, the man of the Church
deliting to wander up and down the world, if he consider uprightly of things,
shall find that for the most part he retorneth to his ministry, more envious,
more ambicious, more moved, more pensife, and less devout, then when he went
out: and so shall he always feel within his sorrowful heart great occasions of
remorse, and no less cause of complaint against himself. Beware therefore you
men of the church of the illusions of the Devil, and that he entise you not
out of your ministeries under cooller to do some good: Seeing if he once
prevail so far as to separate you from the fellowship of good men: he will
by little and little infect you and make you of the number of the wicked. For,
the sheep that straieth from his flock, the Wolf deuoureth him: the Pigeon
that flies far from her houfe is a pray to the Faulcon: the trauailer that
goes alone, is subject to robbing: the rivers that come out of the sea to the
fields, do hurt, and the Minister that is divided from his congregation,
bears peril of destruction. Peccatum peccauit Jerusalem propterea instabilis
facta est: the wretched City of Jerusalem heaped sin upon sin (says the
Prophet) whereby God enjoined her to penance to be always errant and a
vagabond: even so then does the Minister commit sin upon sin when he
forgets the profession he has made. Retorning eftsoon to the dangers of this
miserable world, the affliction of such men is, that they live always in
perplexity, and never contented with themselves. So that the servant of God
professing Religion, ought withal to make this promise never to change it till
he exchange his life, neither abandoning the estate he has taken in hand, nor
forgetting whereunto he is bound. Assuring himself that where in his
Ministry he shall find tranquillity, and small occasions to sin, the world
will give him nothing but disquietnesse, with great liberty to offend, and
little help to amend his life. S. John Baptist was commended of God
particulerly for his perseverance in straytnesse of life, and the great courage
he showed in Preaching according to this question he made to the Hebrews, what
are you come (says he) to see in the Desert: do you think that the son of
Zachary is a willow leaf moving with every wind: Christ commended not Saint
John, only for that he went barefoot, lived solytary, fed upon Locustes,
ware nothing but Cammelles skin, and slept upon thorns: But he allowed his
constancy for that he would never go out of the Desert entering therein even
in his youth: In which respect we have to believe, that in so many years, and
in such sharp deserts, Saint John endured great hunger, extreme cold, many
temptations, grievous sicknesses, and infinite cares: Of all which afflictions,
Christ makes not such express mencio^ as of his unfeigned constancy: many
(says the Apostle issue out of the lystes to just, 1. Cor. 7.
and many gee to run the caryar, but in the end, he that goes best caryeth
away the price, and who aryueth soonest, gayneth the wager: Euenso (you
ministers of the Church) forget not so to run the cariar of this mortal
life, that you aryue in time to win the reward. This council which the
Apostles gives, is not of will, but of necessity: For that better should it be
to the man of the Church never to have entered religion nor taken the habyte,
if he persevere not in that he has begene, and is careless to keep that he
has promised: In the last supper that Christ made with his Disciples, after he
had said unto them. Vos isti qui per man sistis mecum in temptationibus meis,
gave them then his comfort, Et ego d^spono vobis regnum. Seeing you and no
other have continued with me in my trauelles and troubles, following me also
in my greatest dangers: Be you assured, that your place shall be prepared at
my table, and I will beestow you in the height of my glory, to the end you may
there have the fruition of my Divinity. This truly is a most high and great
mystery for the Apostles, to follow Jesus Christ, having abandoned parents and
friends, country and goods, yea, and renounced their proper wills: God
thought them not worthy of recompense so much for that, as for that they
perseuered till the end: he says not to his Disciples, you are only they
that are tempted, but you have remained with me in my temptations. Wherein he
gives us to know that in the other world none shall have place at the table of
God, but such as persevere in him to the end. One of the priueleadges which God
gives to his friends says David, is, that no temptation shall have power to
change their minds, nor any adversity be hable to make them give over the
good they have beeginne until the end: For that the gift of constancy is of
many desired, and of few obtained. And therefore to beeginne a good work is
the custom of good men: to pursue and follow it, is the office of the
virtuous. But to lead it to his end and effect, is a pryuileadge mearly
appertayning to those that be holy and Religious. And to speak the truth, with
what industry so ever we enforce our selves and under what weening so ever we
presume: yet to resist an ill, we are to tender of heart, and far to moveable
of condition. So that right happy is it with those that shall hear Christ say,
You are they that have perseuered with me, and therefore you are regenerate
and shall enjoy with me for ever the perfect joy and felicity.

A resolution of certain famyliar and natural questions: with apparent
conjectures and tokens of death.
I Would your importunities were as just, as my excuses are reasonable, so
should the contencion be easily resolved, whether be greater my faults, or
your complaints. In him that makes request, it is easy to find words to
speak, for that he speaks in desire: but to whom the suit is made belongs
great discretion, for that all denials are hateful, not so much by the merit
and consideration of the cause, as for that the affection of the suitor may be
corrupt: Which I do not allege here to the proof of your fault, for that in
our friendship should remain no faction: nor yet to justify my excuses, if
they bear not both reason and innocence. Assuring you that seeing it pleases
you to make a trial of my wit, more for exercise, then possibility of
knowledge: I will join my self to your fancy, not so much for necessity, as
to keep use of my imperfection.

why men bear greater bodies then women.
You ask me wherefore men contain greater corpolencie and substance of body,
then women? I say it procedes of the heat which is more abundant in the one,
then in the other: For, heat being of a nature td increase and swell, gives
unto men a greater perfection in stature and nature, then to women whose humors
being tempered with cold, makes their bodies less substantial and of more
infirmities.

The fire and the air incorruptible.

The earth and the water subject to corruption.


You would know how it happens, that of four Elements, the fire and the air
are incorruptible, and of the contrary, the earth, and the water are subject to
corruption. To this I said, it is of necessity that all things entangled with
corruption, are first made cold: but the fire cannot suffer cold, for that it
is an enemy to cold: and the air, albeit sometimes bring forth cold, yet it
is always full of fire. Where, the earth and water, having their temperature
of cold and heat, are subject to corruption by the nature and quality of
their composition. Why men shyuer, and are cold after they be delivered of
their urine.


You ask whereupon it comes that oftentimes we shrink and enter into a
cold, after we be delivered of our urine. The reason is this: so long as the
urine being hot, remains yet in the bladder, neither the bladder nor the
parts about it, can feel any cold, but the bladder being discharged, all the
said parts are eftsoon filled with an air more cold then was the urine (for
there is nothing void in nature.) And that air occupying the place of the
urine, causes naturally the shiuering and cold that we feel. You would know
how it happens, that when we fare very cold, and coming hastily to ye fire to
seek warmth, we feel a grief or ache in our finger ends: Why men warming
them suddenly feel a grief or ache in their finger-endes.
and warming us by leisure we have no mocion of pain. This may be answered by
experience, that when we pass out of one countrary into an other mutation is
great, as may be seen in trees, who being plied and bowed by little and little,
break not: but strayning them by force, they rent in two: even so the heat
that is within, holds the cold out, repulsing withal the moisture, and so
one contrary is resisted by an other. The same being the cause, that receiving
warmth by little and little, the heat within comes out and is not hindered by the
cold, which causes the less sense or feeling of pain. But in receiving
suddenly the warmth of the fire, we do by violence draw out a great heat, and
by the repugnancie that it finds with the cold not fully gone, bringes no
small pain to the party. You ask me by what reason most women, the first and
second month that they are with child, have that disordered appetite to eat
coals and other strange things. Why women lust after strange things when
they are newly conceived.
The reason of that appetite is, that nature has drawn down all the blood of
the woman to help to form the fruit in her womb: Which blood being
corrupted, makes also the stomach pertaker of his vice and corruption: By
which occasion the stomach being pressed with such matter so corrupt,
requires all meats that are vain and loathsome, ta:+king his lust and desire
to many things according to the qualety or impression of the matter wherewith
he is charged. For, if it abound with an humor malancholike, which is black,
it forms an appetite to coals and such like things, if it suffer abundance
of sharp fleame, it breeds a lust to things sharp and eger, the like
judgment being proper for all other humors.

Why women and Eunukes have a shirle voice.
To your demand why women and Eunukes have their voice so small and shirle: I
say it proceeds of the quill or pype of their wesand, which being strait,
cannot be enlarged by reason of the humor whereof it is full: and heat only
has power to make it wyder: For as we see out of little and small phyfes, come
a voice clear and shirle: And out of small trunks the lowdest sownd: Even so is
it of the pype of the wesand, which, by reason of his subtlety is called loud or
shirle.

You ask me why such as contain but mean stature, are for the most part
more wise then those that have great bodies. why little men are most wise.
That may be by this reason, that in a little body, ye senses and spirits are
always better united and co^pact then in a great, where in a greater by reason
they suffer more separation and liberty, they cannot express so great virtue
and effect as in the lesser body, whose littleness keeps them better to their
natural properties and actions, according to the judgment of Homer, who in
his description of Ulysses, maks him of little stature, but of much excellency
of wit, and of the contrary he sets forth Aaix, with body and members of great
corpulency, but very simple in mind and judgment. why poor men get children
better accomplished the^ others.
Where you ask me how it comes to pass, that for the most part peasantes
and pore men of the country, get children well accomplished and wise, and of the
contrary, to men of great wisdom and opinion succeed children that be Idyots
and without judgment: I take it to proceed of this. The simple man and he that
follows the toil of his husbandry, when he is in the exercise of generation,
thinks of no other thing but of the pleasure in the act, by which this seed
is more perfect, as having the full consent and force of all the spirits
vital, animal, and natural, the same breathing into his Children, minds
subtle and resolute. But with the wise men it is otherwise: For, they having
continual exercise of mind, keep their thoughts in impression and
contemplation of some particular things, either concerning honesty, profit,
or matter of enterprise, whereby as it is not possible that in the act of
generation, their natural seed should be accompanied with the forces of all
the spirits, and specially of the spirit animal, which engenders such
cogitation in persons: So of necessity to the children which they get are
referred more imperfections then to others. You would know why a stone,
Difference beetweene the qualetie of a stoane and wood thrown into the water.
a piece of Iron, or other such like thing being thrown into the water, sinketh
forthwith to the bottom: where of the contrary, a piece of wood, how great so
ever it be swimmeth always upon the upper face thereof. Tocuhing the property
of the wood, I think it may be referred to the little holes that be in it, which
being full of wynd and air, so hold it up, that his weight cannot work his
natural condition: but stones and Iron compounded of bodies more close and
heavy, and suffering no conduit or place for the air to enter: of necessity
sink down, as having no impediments till they come to their ceinter. To this
may be adjoined the experience of such as are drowned, who the first day,
fall to the bottom, but afterward remounte above the water: For, after the
Body be rotten, the Weysande and all other concauyties are filled with Wind
and air, by whose propertye they are blown up and seen floate upon the
upper most of the Water: For this cause there have been certain Pirates, who
used to cut out the weysande of such as they slew in the Sea, to the end
their bodies were not thrown up again to the disclosing of their vile act: By
this reason also eggs that are not broken or corrupt sincke fortwyth to the
bottom being thrown into a river: Where such as are rotten floate upon the
water, for that the humor that is within being corrupted, whereof comes the
alteration of lovers.
makes place to an air that enters which keeps the eggs swimming. You ask
me how it happens, that lovers often times express in their utter parts a
passion of cold, and sometimes a feruencie of heat, seeming to suffer those
same fits and motions which we see asscribed to Agues. Touching this demand,
albeit you might be better satisfied with your own experience, then with any
resolution of me, who have always professed the science of humanytie, and not
the study of folly: Yet, according to our method of natural reason I may thus
far presume to your instruction that lovers plunged in the passion and
perplexities of love, their natural heat with drawing to the inner parts
leaves the extremities of the body cold as deprived of all their hot
substance: the same converting them into minds uncertain, tormented, and
traunced: But when they are brought into hope of obteyning, their natural
heat eftsoon retorneth outwardly, and disperseth through all the extreme
parts of the body which by this refreshing of the blood, becomes red and of
pleasant temperature: For that cause it has been an use amongst Paynters and
grauers of Images, to draw Cupid sometimes sad, and sometime joyful, giving
him withal the form and proportion of a Child, for that light love is an
affection great and vehement, and yet lasts not long: Whereto the love
virtuous and honest is joined continuance and constancy, as appears in the
friendship between friend and friend, the affection of the Father to his
Children, and the observation between the husband and his honest wife. But
touching unlawful love, as it breeds oftentimes in peesons not well known
one to another, and therefore, has no great stability, and less continuance:
so, the love honest taking his greatest consideration of the merit, qualety,
and virtue of the party, remaynes always moderate and temperate, why lovers
are stricken by the only sight of their Ladies.
where the affection that dare not be justified is full of violence, fury, and
passion. Where you would know whereupon it proceeds that lovers are stricken and
made slaves and bondmen, at the only regard and sight of their Ladies: I
answer, according to the opinion of some, that as the true seat and
testimony of love, consists in the eyes: and no part of man more truly
expresses the inward affections of the body then the eyes: so love being a
certain affection, and good will, is naturally bred of a thing like to
himself. For, such as love search nothing but recompense of affection, and by
consequence the house and seat of affection, which is the eyes, by whose mean
they are made certain of the love which remains within. You ask me, why
lovers pass most part of many nights with out power to sleep: you must
consider yt this great affection draws the whole man to it, Why Lovers
sleep not a nights.
and so enta^gleth him with confusion, that he retayneth no contemplation of
things necessary or profitable: This affection is that selfsame love, who
much less that he will suffer his subjects to live in rest, seeing as a
Canker he increases more and more to the confusion of all their delyghtes,
felycitie, and contentment, and therefore he is place amongst the natural
diseases afflicting the tranquillity of man: There is also an other reason,
which is drawn from the cares and thoughts which Lovers have: For, those
malenchollyke contemplations mingled with passions of choler and heaviness,
do heat and dry up the party.

Restrayning by that means his course of sleep, which proceeds of vapoures
cold and moist: the same being also the cause why old men wake more then the
younyounger sort, as being Converted into more cold and drought.

Why Louess complain for small causes.
Where you demand why Lovers fall into great complayntes for small causes: you
must consider, that because Lovers (above al other sorts of men) are naturally
suspicious, and carried into mutation for small things, like little Children:
They are by that mean seldom without heaviness and sorrow of heart, and
therefore, so much the more Subject to complaynt, by how much their minds
live always traveled in trouble and Jealousy.

You ask me how it happens that Lovers, in the presence of their Ladies,
Why Lovers lose speech in the presence of their Ladies.
lose liberty of speech, and do oftentimes forget that which they had studied
and well considered to speak: It may be, that infyrmitie proceeds of the
trouble of the mind engendered by a look or glaunce cast by stealth upon the
thing that they Love, and standing so amazed in mind the tongue has no
facilytie to the action of his duty, seeing the beginning of the speech
deriueth of the mind or spyrit to whom the tongue serves as an interpretor to
express his conceytes. This happens also to many, who called to question in
the presence of a Prince or magestrate, fall oftentimes into a passion of
stutting or meare scilence, specially if they be traveled either with fear
or falshod of conscience.

Why Lovers are shamfast to diclose their affections.
To that you ask me why Lovers are shamefaste to discover their affections: I
say, that men have certain appetites natural and necessary as to drink and
eat, which of necessity they must satisfy to preserve life, and avoid death:
so they have other affections which albeit are natural, yet not necessary but
superfluous, vain, and withal dishonest, from those are deryued many
disordered appetites, as is the rage of love, which is an affection blind and
engendered of Idleness: and for that it bringes unto men an estimation of beast
lines and dishonesty: The most sort seek as much as they can to hyd their
love, Why Louerr discern not the falts of their friends.
and under figures and apparances to live in expectation of that they desire.
You ask me also how it happens that lovers discern not the vices and falts
of their amorous friends. That must needs be an error deriuing of their proper
affection which deuides them from their true judgment and senses. For lovers
(as says Plato) are like to such as hunt after estats and offices, or to those
that are given to wine to whom al estats are welcome, and al wines seem to
give a pleasing taste: besides, according to the philosophers, al great mocions,
hinder those yt be less. So that love having occupied the chief and most
principal mocions of the spirit, troubles for the most part the virtue and
original of the senses: the same being the cause (with Plato) why lovers are
made blind with the sight of their Ladies, Why men be hoarse after they have
slept.
and according to the same ye poets have fained Cupid without eyes. And where
you desire me to give a reason why men be hoarse and of corrupt voice after
they have slept, I think that impediment comes no otherways, then by a
replexio^ of humors caused by a rawnes or indigestio^ of meat, ye same
occupying ye upper parts of ye body, and makes ye head dull and heavy:
therefore, the pipe of the weysand being full of the said humors they must
necessarily be impedimentes to the voice, and make it hoarse and hollow: Thus
much touching the Exposition of your Philosophical demaundes.

And now where you require me, by a special and lardge request, to Communicate
with you, what I have hard and read either in Phylosophye or Physscke, by what
apparent signs and tokens may be judged whether one that is sick shall dye or
live, for that (as you say) you have a daughter in danger, and would gladly
know her destiny. The resolution of this demand albeit appertains more
properly to your doctor of Physic, then unto me that am a Divine, studying
more how to Preach then to judge of complexions: yet, seeing you will have my
opinion, I pray you let me debate with you as a Christian, that as God has
nombered the years of our life, and set down a limit which no man can pass,
so if it be his good pleasure, your Daughter shall yet live, but if he think
it convenient for her Salvation, he knows best when to call her to him: For,
it is not only he that geeueth life, but he is even the self life: And
therefore according to the office of a Divine, more then in the council of a
Physician, I wyshe you to put her in remembrance of her mortalitye, and
prepare her to God, in whom and none other, all good Christians ought to
beelieue is power to change our life and translate us to himself: Many and
many have I known abandoned of the world and extremely past succor and
help of man, have yet received restitution of God, and lived many yers: and
many again recovered of sickness and past all apparaunce of danger, and yet
paid their tribute to nature when was no expectation of death: A thing that is
not to be construed to the well or ill handling of the Physician, but to be
referred to the providence of God which has so ordained it. The king Ezechias
was given over of the Physicians, and the son of the host of Samaria was
dead: Signs and tokens of death in a sick man.
but at the commandment of God the Child revived, and Ezechias was
recovered. But leaving those Testimonies of Scripture to a further leisure, let
us gather some opinions of the Philosophers, who with many ancient Physicians,
have set down in writing certain notable Signs to discern the peril of
Death in such as are Sick: Plynie in his seventh Book, and one and fifty
Chapter says, that a man being sick of any sharp infirmitye, as of a Frenzy,
if he fall sometimes into a suddayne mirth, or burst out into great laughing,
that Patient expresses great tokens of present death: if any be sick of a
corruption of humors malencholike, and set himself to behold or stare much
upon another without sturring his eye of long, such one is not far from
death. If a man be sick of a Fever collerike or sharp, and his pulse move
uncertainly, sometimes quick and sometimes slow, such one no doubt enclines to
death. Who is sick of a burning Fever, and uses sometimes to draw up the
sheet, or double ye clothes of the bed, or pluck of the thrumbes of the
same, in that man is great conjecture of the end of his life. One that has
lain long sick, and begins to shut and close his eyes often, and set his
teeth and mouth, carries great appearance of death. He that is stricken with the
plague, and being half awake, and begins to rave and murmr to himself,
caryeth manifest conjecture of death. If any above the age of fourscore years
fall into a greedy hungar to eat and drink without measure, it is a sign
they have not long to live. A young Child being sharppe in wit and ready in
aunsweres, or that he show in that tender age a discression accomplished, in
that child is no judgment of long life.

These be the conjectures of the Philosophers, which I have gathered more to
content you, then that I assure them to be infallible, aduising you for end, to
recommend your daughter to God, who only has power to dispose all things by
the same prerogative whereby he has made them of nothing.

A discourse of the Canonisiing of the Pagan Gods, and why they are holden for
Gods, together with an exposition of sundry poetical inventions tending to the
same.
I Have sent you herwith my judgment touching the original of the Pagan Gods,
both what they were, and why they were canonized and worshipped as gods, hoping
you will read it, though not for any merit of my travel or diligence, yet for
that you shall see disclosed the errors of the ancients, and have cause to
acknowleadge the goodness of God, that has made you live in a time of
Christianity and not to believe as a Pagan.

And so falling to the matter, we will begin at Jupiter and Saturn his father:
The original of Saturn.
Saturn was the son of the king Celius and Vesta his wife, and brother to
the mighty tirant Tytan: who at the persuasion of his mother and Ops and Ceres
his two sisters (much mislyking that one so rude as Tytan should by the right
of Maiority, ascend to the succession and Crown of Celius) yielded the
kingdom to Saturn his younger brother, under this covenant notwythstanding
that he should slay all his male children, to thend the issue of Titan might
eftsoons repossesse the crown after the death of Saturn. By this contract
Saturn was invested in the kingdom, and stood peacible king, to whom Ops his
wife and sister brought forth a son, which he caused to be slain according
to his promise: after this she was eftsoons delivered of a son and a daughter
at on burden: the son was called Lidamas which name ye poets changed
afterward into Jupiter, Jupiter and Juno borne both at a bourthen.
feyning that name upon a Planet which they erected according to their fancy.
The daughter had to name Juno: Ops desirous to save the life of her son, gave
him secretly to Vesta her mother: and presented only the Daughter to Suturne.

Vesta caused Jupiter to be nourished, and being grown to some stature and
age, she sent him to the^ of Crete or else a people called Coryuantes, a nation
warlike and inhabiting certain mountains in a separate corner of the kingdom:
after this, contrary to ye knowledge of Saturn, Ops brought forth another son
called Neptune, not for that it was his proper name, as Cicero says, but the
superstition of men, making him a God on the Sea, imposed upon him that name
of Neptune signifying a swimmer.

At another birth Ops brought forth two children Pluto, Neptune and his name
disguised Pluto borne.
and Glanca and showing only the daughter: she bestowed Pluto secretly at
nourse: Isidore says the Pagans endued him with that name, for that they hold
him as God infernal: the Latins called him Dis pater, as Father of riches: and
some named him Orcus, as deuourer, for that the earth swaloweth al, and
redeliuereth again that she has taken.

But Titan understanding that his brother Saturn had broken promise and
corrupted the contract, began to gather malice and dispyte against him, and
accompanied with the forces of his children called also Tytans, took the
kingdom from Saturn and imprisoned him together with Ops his wife: which
coming to the knowledge of Jupiter, being a young and valiant Prince,
descended to the succors of his Father and Mother with the strength of the
Coribantes amongst whom he was trained: and joining battle, Jupiter obtained
the victory and with honor was the deliverer of his Parents: of this quarrel
came the fable of the wars of the Giants: At that time Saturn being
forewarned by an Oracle to take heed of Jupiter his son, for that he had
intention to kill him and expulse him the kingdom, devised to destroy Jupiter,
who understanding the Conspiracies of blood against him, came with a great army
against his Father whom he vanquished in battle.

Saturn, being without courage eftsoons to recover his kingdom, fled into
Italy: Saturn taught the people of Italy the toil of the earth.
and there taught the people of that country to sow and plant and labor ye
commodities of ye earth, and for recompense, that brewtishe and rude Nation,
living before with roots and wyld fruits, honored him as a God: Jupiter married
his sister Juno.
Jupiter reigning peasible king, took to wife Juno his sister, and conquered
many countries, not so much by force and strength at arms, as with the
excellency and subtlety of his wit: For, he disclosed chiefly and communicated
to diverse People and Nations great secrets of nature, and ordained laws and
sundry good fourmes of polecy: He invented many arts profitable and necessary
for the use of man's life: by mean whereof he roase into great renoume amongst
men, and also took upon him the name and title of God, which he easily
achieved, for that that breutish and simple people not knowing how to join
worthy recompense to so many benefits and helps to their living, Jupiter-
worshipped as a God
which they had received by his means: began to worship him, thinking that to
be the most honorable degree of service they could do to him: And for the
better establishment and perpetuity of this divine honor: when he contracted
alliance or confederacye with any Prince, he enjoined him to build a temple
in his name: as did the king Celius, who erected a Temple, and dedicated it to
Jupiter Celius. The king Molion set up another, and consecrated it to Jupiter
Molion: With many others builded to the monument and reputation of his name:
about that time the brethren of Jupiter sommoned him to partiton of Patrimony,
whereunto he agreed, and dividing the kingdom by lot, the west part fell to
Pluto: The Isles and banks of the Sea happened to the portion of Neptune: and
to Jupiter descended all the confines of ye East: Of this partition sprung the
fiction of the Poets, How Neptune and Pluto had their names.
calling Neptune the God of Seas, and Pluto the God infernal, for that the west
or falling of the Sun is more dark and clowdy, and also more base and low
then the East. Here grew also the first fiction that Jupiter chased his father
into hell, for that Italy where Saturn was retired, stands West in respect of
Candia, and is more dark.

We will not now stand upon the discourse of other names which were
attributed to the Gods, together with their numbers, and whether they were
before or after them, the same serving to small end to our present purpose, but
will eftsoon return to the east part which was the portion of Jupiter: For
the opinion of the Poets grew by this, and they gave it out for a Doctrine,
that the firmament or heaven fell to the part of Jupiter, the rather for that
Jupiter remains for the most part since that pertition in the mount Olimpus
of Thessalia, which the Greeks called heaven, as they did also name all other
mountains of the like height and hugenes of Olimpus.

And because king Jupiter was the most lecherous and dissolute Prince of his
time, Disclosing of the transformation of Jupiter.
and descended oftentimes from his mount Olimpus to accompany some fair Lady
wherso ever he found her, and for that he disguised himself in to many
sleightes and subtleties proper to beguile women, the Poets feigned that he
took other shapes, and transformed himself into many strange figures and
forms: as when he converted himself into a shower of Gold, to lie with fair
Dana, it was no other thing as Isidore says, then a great mass of Gold which
he made slide in to the hands of her keepers, to betray the chastety of that
fair Lady. When they make him to transform himself into Amphitrio, it was no
other thing then the consent that Amphitrio gave him to lie with his wife and
that for the reward of a great sum of money. The Metamorpheses yt he suffered
into a Bull to steal Europa, was no more but ye Image of a Bull painted on the
sails of the ship, wherein Jupiter bestowed her when he took her away. Such
like were ye transformatio^s of Jupiter, wherein may be discerned the
simplicity and great blindness of such as worshipped that licencious king for
a true God governor of heaven and earth, he that was the most unbridled
brydled and dissolute man, and most drowned in his proper lusts of all other
in his time.

And seeing upon him they imposed the title of God of al gods, by him we may
judge the qualety of the other gods, of whom the most part called him father,
as in deed most of them issued of him: as Phoebus the god of science: Mars the
ruler of battles, Mercury the infuser of cloque^ce, Bacchus the image of
epicurity, Vulcan the spirit of fire, and Venus the vain idol of love: others
there were that were his parents, as Pluto prince of hell, Neptune the directer
of the waters, Ceres the disposer and blisser of corn, and Diana the figure
and example of chastety: The vanity of the Pagans touching their gods
And so reckoning by degrees, they established particular gods, to all things
that might be imagined, esteeming one God to be insufficient to reign alone
and to lead the vnuersall world within the power of his government: yea they
adjoined to this Idolatry ye worshipping of certain beasts, planets, and
trees, by reason of the properties they saw in them: the Egiptians as Iueuenal
says were so far drowned in this superstition, yt they worshipped as gods
Onyons and Leeks, attributing much to their felicity and happiness who had of
those plants in their gardins: and as the ignorance of those blind people led
them to do honor and sacrifice to such things as to gods, so they held it for
religion to give obedience to them, holding such accursed as were not forward
in the service and ministry of such vain and triffling things: M. Varo
writes that Brasillius the Philosopher found at Rome MMD. CCC. Gods, which
caryeth no small possiblity of truth seeing the abuse there was so great and
general that they gave cerimony, worship, and sacrifice as to a God, to all
things whereof they had received any benefit, or that they supposed had any
power to keep them in fear. Tullus hostillius third king of Rome, Flora a
public curtisa^ honored as a God.
being vexed with a fever tertia^ which had turned his complexion to a pale
and yellow, did sacrifice to his ague the sooner to make it to leave him. Flora
a public curtisan, and a woman whose body was abandoned to all lust and
allurements of the flesh, was canonized, and honored with an Image or figure,
for that, of all the goods she had got with the filthy sweat and travel of her
body, she co^stituted ye Senate to be heir: they gave her divine honor, and
celibrated her feast every year, wherein as a special cerimony, there was
liberty to al you^gme^ to be naked and to exercise their pleasure with ye first
woman they found. S. Augustine writes that the consuls and wise men of Rome,
took council to abollishe that vile and abominable custom: But albeit for
certain perils and impediments they durst never execute it: yet to deface the
memory of that lewd woman, and give greater appearance to their supersticions,
the named Flora the Gods of flowers.

Amid these great darknesses and obscurities of ignorance, wherein this people
of the Gentiles was plunged: The philsophers acknowleged god.
there were many notwithstanding, in whom was some impression of light, and
possessed with those natural judgments and reasons which drew them out of that
blindness, as in deed all the schole of philosophy generally acknowledged one
author and mouer of al things, from whom, as out of a spring proceeded al ye
vniuersallity of things, The faith of particular Philosophers and Poets
touching the omnipotency of God.
and were fed and enterteind by him as the true and sovereign governor of the
whole: of this knowledge Socrates was not deprived, who being at point of
death, said he was willing to dye, to confess on only Lord to whom he had
always labored to do service according to the power of his humayne frayelty
never having intention to offend him.

Aristotle, at the article of death recommended himself to the sovereign
Creator, saying, Oh cause of all causes, have pytie on me: Plato and Cicero in
their treatises of commonweals, were of the same opinion: it was the faith of
Virgill that al proceeded of God, and that as well ye heaven and earth, as the
air and water, are full of his greatness, acknowledging by that the essence of
one only God.

Cicero speaking of the nature of Gods, and Varro in his vain Etimologies,
being albeit both Pagans and much addicted to their ceremonies, scoffed
notwithstanding at the feasts and assemblies which the populer sort made to
honor their Gods, partly through ignorance, more by flatterye, but most of all
for fear. It is no need here to prove by the doctrine of the scripture that
all those Gods were but illusions and dreams, proceeding of the invention of
man and abuse of the Devil, seeing that since the son of the everlasting
truth is appeared, which is the son of the only God, all these damnable
superstitions are not only discovered, but by the beams of that son shining
in the minds and eyes of men, they are put to flight and vanished as the
clouds give place when the son approaches. They are fallen into ruin, as
buildings ill founded, and meeting the firm vessel of the word of God, their
tickle ship driven by the wind of abuse and deceyt, is confounded and swallowed
in the golphe of Christian religion. Thus much for the first point of your
demand, which I doubt not is either sufficiently answered, or at least
nothing left doubtful.

There rests now to touch what opinion the Poets and other ancients had of
these Gods and the plurality of them: As Hesiode, Archilachus, Horace,
Menander, Esope, Apuleius, Ovid, and many other writers of great grauety and
authority, who published not their inventions and fictions to other effect,
then to disclose to men the means to become more wise, and draw to a more
Civil form of life in the world. For which purpose, they spread many fictions
and fabulous metaphors, tending to sundry arts and professions: For fables
(according to the opinion of Apthonius and Hermogenes, have taken their name of
Fari in Latin, signifying to discourse and speak: so that a fable may be
taken for a discourse feigned, inducing oftentimes, under an honest recreation
and delitfull resemblaunce, the readers to consider the morrall sense and
doctrine hyd under those fabulous discourses, which discovering the customs
and conuersasions of men, they do also impropriate many things to the actions
of men, extolling men of virtue, and imbasing such as seek their felicity in
vices, and are (as it were) men of nothing.

There is the first point to be considered by all men of judgment in the
reading as well of Ovid as of other Poets: And for the second, it is to be
noted, that when there was any man excellent whether in sciences, or in arms,
or in influency of wit, or had some other singular or soueraygne qualety, which
made him serviceable to his common weal, such men the Poets called the
Children of God: and when they dyed, they held them transformed into Planets
and Stars, the same to stir up others the rather to virtue: if any man
brought forth any act of virtue or singularytie of what nature or moment so
ever it were, they extolled him to the heavens, as appears in the glory which
they gave to the Philosopher Promotheus, Promotheus the first that showed to
the Egiptians a form of civil life.
who, for that he was the first in Egypt that showed unto men a form of
Ciuylity, instructing them to live like men, and shake of that beastly
ignorance wherein they were resolved: They feigned that he had stolen the fire
from heaven (which is wisdom) to communicate it to men: for that Atlas was a
great Astrologian, they feine that he holds up the heaven. And because Jupiter
and his race were also singular in that science, they ascrybed their names to
principal Planets: In other places, the Poets seeing the hearts of men, after
they had once received the impression of errors in their brains, to continue
hardened and obstinate in their false imaginations: feyned that Dewcalion and
Pirrha had converted stoanes into men: But as Paulus Perusus Writes, those
simple People had red in the ancient histories of the Greeks the particular
deluge that fell in Thessalie, during the which, the people of that country
sought their safety in the Hill Pernassus and other high mountains, remaining
there in great amaze amongst the rocks, forrestes, and caves, without any
courage or disposition to descend eftsoons to the plains, and follow ye
commodities of ye earth til by Dewealion and Pirrha his wife (skilful in the
course of the stars,) they were satisfied by natural reasons that those great
waters were caused by certain constellations and influencies, and that it would
be a very long time before the like imundatio^ happened.

Proper fictions of the Poets for many things.
The Poets also, when they went about to advance chastety, fained a
transformation of persons chaste, into trees always green as the Olive and
Laurel, into the which were transhaped Lotus and Daphe, signifying by that
continual greenesse, virginity undefiled: and so following those fictions,
they compared men both good and ill, to many trees according to the good and
bad properties they had.

In like sort, they feyned that all youngmen dying in the flower of their age
and having any sparcke of virtue, were transfigured into flowers green tender,
and delicate, withering forthwith. Ovid makes Hyacintus (a young and forward
prince) to be changed into a Flower: And so says he of Adonis, Narcissus,
Ermaphroditus with others: And of the contrary, when he sought to blame and
deface vices, the better to make men abhor them, he transformeth men
dissolute and licencious into brute beasts* the same agreeing with the text of
Boecius, that who lives beastly and according to the inclinations of beasts,
may be holden transhaped and changed into beasts: The Giants, for that they
were men proud and intractable, denying the truth and power of their Gods, and
raised war against them: were by ye fiction of the Poets, co^nuerted into
Apes, truly resembling, that wicked men and such as by presumption and
haughtiness of heart, will not acknowledge their Creator, but hunt after
brutallity, are not improperly compared to beasts, retayning no other thing of
men, then the outward figure, as we see in ye similitude and proportion of
Apes: with this opinion agrees Cicero, who holds the wars of the Giants
none other thing, then a life disordered, unbridled, and out of reason:
thereupon came the Metamorphoses of Licaon into a Wolf. For, being king of
Arcadia he was so tirannous toward his people, that they drew into revolt, and
by the Council and aid of Jupiter, he was constrained to retire into the
Forrestes, Praying by rauyne and stealth upon Passengers, as the Woolfe does
upon the Sheep.

The Poets also paynting forth any cruel tyranny, feyned Tyrauntes
transchaunged into Hawks of pray, as Dedalion whom they make converted into a
Bitter: And for such as dare not iustefye themselves in the face of the world
by reason of their life abominable, they feyne them converted into Birds and
foul that fly not but by night.

Such one was Nictimenes, transfygured into an Owl, the caryers of news and
Tales were changed into Crows and Ravens: Men Effeminate employing their time
to Frissle their heir, Perfume their Garments, and behold their face in a
Glass, are lykened to the Seamews and Cranes, which are always pruning their
Feathers,

And to detect the abomination of pride, presumption, and vaineglory, they
brought in ye daughters of Cinaca, who for that they were the Daughters of a
Rich and mighty Father, dispysed all other that were pore: But God made their
pride subject to such justice, that their poverty and misery brought them in
the end, to lie always at the gates of the temples begging alms, and so
(according to the fiction of the poets) they were turned into stons serving as
ye stayrs, or steps of the temple: Such as drowned or strangled themselves
represented the insatiable desire of the covetous who albeit have all they
desire, yet they rest not contented, but in following the infinite motion of
their appetyte, they find their own destruction by despair, feyning, for an
example of that figure, Mydas to be converted into Gold: For a spectacle of
envy, and the works thereof, they paynt out Aglauros: For a pattern of
whordome, they bring in Circes, who was a whorso excellent in beauty, that she
enchaunted all such as beheld her according to the fiction of Horace: And
because bawdes and whoremongers, always attending on the train of publyke
women, are like unto swyne, the Poets feyned the followers of Ulysses to be
transfigured into swyne: To blase prodigallity and such as were too much given
to their delytes, they painted Acteon turned into a heart, who was so much
drowned in the pleasures of hunting, that in the end his Dogs devoured him.
Epicures, and such as seek so much to please the lycorrous taste of their
mouth, that no riches can suffize them, they feyne in the end to eat one an
other as did Erisichcton, whom they feyned to eat himself under this figure
that he consumed the money which the whoremongers gave him to lie with his
Daughter: They feyne also this Erisichcton to be the son of Proteus a God of
the Sea transformed into sundry sorts of Creatures: signifying thereby the
lyghtnes of our affections, who by their inconstancy are changed into many
forms of appetyte sometimes desiring one thing, and sometime an other:
swelling sometimes with pride as a Lion, and sometimes taking the form of a
Heart by reason of their weakness and fear: and in the practice of sleyghtes
and subtleties, are turned into the similitude of a Fox.

These be the names that Ovid sets before the eyes of men, as wonderful
examples of things which happen in the world, as you and all readers of stayed
minds may find by the discourse of his Book of the Metamorpheses: wherein you
may perceive that the auncientes as well philosophers as Poets, when they began
any work of importance, they called upon the aid and favor divine: according to
the Testimonye of Pliny in an Oration he made in the praise of Trayan, wherein
he commended the Custom of the ancients to make invocation before the beginnig
of their work, and Judged that there could be no assured nor wise beginning
of any enterprise without the special aid and council of God.

Ovid was not ignorant of this custom, and being a gentleman Roman, he was
also an Astrologian, Philosopher, polityke and excellent Poet, as it is well
expressed on his Books of Metamorphoses, and specially in the first which
conteyneth indifferently both Philosophy, and excellent Poetry: In the second
book he declars himself a perfect Astrologian, giving no appearance to have
any opinion that he was a man living as he feigned nor that he had any children,
charyot, or horse. But under this fabulous description, he declares the
natural course of the Sun and of the firmament, together with the natural
effects that follow of them: wherein to rebuke such as are ignorant, and of
little knowleadge in the Science, he bringes in Phaeton king of the Indees, who
having a high pride and weening in his knowledge (albeit by the judgment of the
Historians, he was very vnresolute and simple) led diverse people into error by
his Laws and statutes corrupt, which was that fire of error wherewith he
burned all the earth: Some fained him to be the son of ye sun, unto whom
they approiated al me^ of singular wit, and held him as God of sciences. But
the occasion that the Poets took was upon his death, which happened in the
voyage he made upon the river Pano, leading a great army by water by reason of
the great heat, and there was divinely killed with an arrow or bolt that fell
from heaven.

But to return eftsoons to Ovid, it must be considered, that seeking to
establish in his work an end and purpose, which was to show to al good wits
that should come after him, the excellency of his conceyt and wonderful
invention of his Metamorphoses (which with good right may be called the mother
of Poesy) and also his resolute knowledge in all disciplines, together with the
copy and variety of his doctrine, joined to an exact judgment in policy and
histories: knowing he was a man, whose frailty bare many impediments (without
the aid of God) to execute and perfect the purpose he had taken in hand: began
his work by a form of invocation to God, saying. Oh mild gods I beseech you
(seeing al metamorphoses and transformations proceed of you) to assist me, and
so bliss me in the beginning that I may have grace to continue to the end,
being thereby the better able to recompt the things that are happened from the
beginning of the world unto our time, and so disce^ded into the parts of his
argument as is expressed upon his works. Thus you have the contents of your
commandment and my promise, which I have sent you not contrived of myself,
but as I have sought them amongst the writings of learned men, hoping they
will satisfy you the better, since I was careful to write nothing which is not
justified by good authority.

A rebuke to ambicion under the speech of a savage man uttered in the Senate of
Rome.
SO much do your importunities trouble me, that I wish to be either further
from you, or at least that my condition were not so private, seeing that to the
nearenes of the place, you join your authority, and make all things serve to
your occasion to trouble me: If you claim me to your devotion in respect of
your merits, you bring stain to your liberality, since to exact recompense,
is a manifest exprobation of benefits received: and in a demand so suddein, so
great, and concerning so many even of the greatest, there can be no less falt
in you to tempt my patience, then rebuke in me to hazard my ignorance, To exact
recompense is an vpbreading of benefits received
for that he that is the executor of the falt, is less guilty and blamable,
then he that gives the occasion. But seeing you prove me in a matter so high
and jealous, I will (to avoid particular challenge) send you my opinion, under
this discreet and excellent discourse of a vilayn published in the presence of
the whole Senate of the Romans, and recommended to posterity in writing by M.
Aurelius, wherein if you find your self touched with your proper errors, have
regard to the reasons of this rude Orator, and be no less reformed of your
covetousness, then he made the Senate ashamed of their ambicion and Tyranny,
assuring you that as ambicion is the beastly nourse of covetousness, and both
they creep in in these days under a form and manner of severity: So it can
not be but that man which desires power, is an ill mayteyner of Justice, and
he that thirsts for glory, runs with great swiftnes into actions of
injuries and oppression. Ambicion the nourse of covetousness.
And therefore who aspireth to glory and seeks his praise of wicked men, must of
necessity be like unto them. But now to our villayne, who speaking in a time
when Rome was changed in Customs and Civil virtues and peopled more with
flatterers then men of simplicity and truth: you must also imagine him to stand
at the bar in this description, his face little and thin, his countenance sharp
and pearcing, his couller black and swarffy, his hair disordered and staring
his eyes rolling and fiery, his bearde long and thick, his eyebrowes clowdie
and hanging, his neck and stomach all hairy, his girdle of bulrushes pleated,
his shoes of the skin of a wild Boar, and holding in his hand a great
staff or troncheon: And being entered the Senate in this hydeous figure, he
protested the reasons of his coming with no less boldness and majesty of
countenance and spirit then his presence and garments were monstrous and
terrible. The oracion of the savage man
Oh grave fathers (says he) yt in your lives and fu^ctio^s were expressed such
effect of piety, and co^passio^ as your outward presence declare merit of
reverence and appara^ce of equity: the^ to my complaints should be joined
present pity and grace, and to mine inoce^cy, just favor and clemency. I
salute you with that affection which the oppression of my country can best
aford, and with that heart which you have torn in pieces with long miseries and
exaction, I beseech the imortall Gods, so to inspire you with a spirit of
justice and clemency, that the errors of your government may be redressed: and
to give to my tongue that moderation and wisdom which is convenient to lay
before you the calamities of my country, the liberties and ancient prerogatives
whereof, God raises one murderer against an other
have suffered a sinister and unworthy change: not by your might, nor by our
weakness, not by your policy, nor by our negligence, but by the offenses we had
done to our gods, whose justice is terrible where they find obstinacy and
hardness of heart, yea to the reprobate they raise one murderer to kill another,
one wicked city to afflict another, and one proud nation to chase and persecute
another. Great is your glory for the triumphs and victories you houe got in
other countries: A thing very familiar with men ambicious whose desires tend
all to oppression and al their felicities resolved in tyrannies: but greater
shall be your infamies in the ages to come for the cruelties you have done,
seeing there is no offense which at one time or other suffers not his proper
punisheme^t, nor any injury without his assured subjection to justice. No
offense with out his punishment.
So great is your extortion to ravish the patrimony of your neigbours, and your
pride so unbridled to command over foreign regions, that neither the Sea
suffiseth to conteyne you in her bottomes, nor the Land hable to assure you in
her huge valleis and plains, which intolerable ambition brings with it this
unfeigned reueng, that as without reason you have thrown others out of their
Countries and howses, so the Gods will arm others with good equity to remove
you from your proud estate of Rome and Italy: A revenge infallible for such as
rauishe the goods of an other.
For the Law is infallible, that who by force rauisheth the goods of another,
by good right loaseth that which he holds of his own: yea, such is the
measure and manner of Gods Justice, that as all that the wicked man heaps up by
Tyranny in many days, suffers spoil and is consumed in one day: So, of the
contrary, what so ever goodmen loase in many years, God can and will restore
it in one hour. And therefore it is no small consolation to men vexed and
afflicted to remember that there is a Just God, to whom is referred the revenge
and Justice of Innocent causes, the certayntie whereof entertaynes their hope,
and keeps them from thoughts and acts of despair: And as when wicked men
prospere, it is not for that God wills so, but for that he suffers it, so to
such as dissemble in complaints, and suffer with expectation, he has
appointed the time of their delivery, when their injuries shall be redressed,
and all their mourning turned into mirth and comfort, and they set as Judges
over the Tyranny of their enemies, whom they shall see burn and consume in the
fire of gods justice: Let no man therefore marvel, why God takes not from the
wicked man forthwith that which he has gained by violence and extortion:
seeing that dissembling with them, he gives them time to assemble and heap
great things, to the end that when they are in their most securytie and
delyght, he might show his power to their general confusion: For this is one
property in the judgment of God, yt who does injury to an other without
reason, against him shall be raised others in whom it shall be holden good
equity to reuerse their estates and pull them quite down: Sewer it is
impossible that the virtuous and valyant man should take taste in any thing that
he holds wrongfully of another: For that, to remember by what means it is got,
is enough to take away all contentment of the thing: VVher the conscience is
not quiet, the residue of the man is nothing but martyrdom.
seeing where the conscience only is not quiet, there the residue of the man
is nothing but martyrdom and passion. Oh, that is the greatest infamy that can
happen to men, to hold in their hearts so many dear desires, and to abandon
their hands to such liberty of action, that they make the misery of others a
riches to themselves, and killing their neighbors, they think to wipe away the
offense by washing their hands in the blood of such as they have slain:
wherein it has no great reference whether he be Greek or Barbarian, absent or
present, dead or a live, since it is most true that such are and shall be
accursed of God, and hated of me^, who without further consideration, exchange
renoume for infamy, confound justice with tyrany, pervert equity with iniquity,
abuse truth with falshod, and be careless of that that is their own, and sigh
for ye goods of another: let no man have more resolute intentio^s to gather
riches for his children, then to get renoume amongst the virtuous, since it is
a rule infallible that of the wicked gain of fathers, Of the wicked gain of
fathers, comes just loss of their children.
comes just loss to the children, but where virtue is in action, there has
renoume his perpetuity. And let no man esteem himself happy, for that he has
more the^ others, or that for the same he is more worthy of honor, seeing if
withal he open not his eyes to discern his proper errors, where the wicked
lift him up with a wind of vainglory for his great power and patrimony, he
shall find himself the slave of his proper riches: For, little does it profit
to have countries large and of long circuit, or howses of sumptuous presence,
and bestowed full of wealth, and to have his mind commanded with cares, and
all his desires still corrupted with covetousness, which can not but draw infamy
to the getter, and yet serve little to the sweet sustenance of his life. Oh
that you Romans were as covetous of your proper honor, as you are greedy of
the goods of others, then should not the little worm of Ambition so fret the
felicity and rest of your life, nor the miserable Canker of infamy devour
your good renoume. Most of you in appearance seem to hate pride, and yet none
follows humilitye: All condemn dissolutnesse, and yet who is continent? You
all praise patience and yet none of you can suffer: you all accurse
intemperancie, and yet none live in order: All blame Idleness, and yet in none
of you is any example of travel: All speak against Brybing, and none are free
from stealing. Lastely every one of you with your Tongue is a publisher and
blaser of virtues, and withal your other members there is none of you which
does not administer to vices: yea, even this Senate (before whom I stand) are no
other then tormentors of men that love and live in rest and quiet, and violent
thieves, whose fury feeds of the sweat of other men's labors. I pray you what
action had you being borne upon Tyber, to seek to set out and dilate your
limittes even to our river of Daunby, where we lived in peace? We have lent no
aid nor favor to your Enemies: we have conquered none of your Provinces:
neither is there any ancient law to prove that the noble and warlike Germany
ought of necessity to be subject to proud Rome: yea, if we had touched one
another in neighborhood or nearness of Countries, it might have geeuen some
occasion of quarrel, for that amongst borderers it is familiar to entertain
variance: But much less that we offended in any of these, seeing we have no
sooner hard of your fame and renoume, then we have felt the scourges of your
Tyranny, the name of the Romans, and the Crueltte of their Judges aryuing at
one instant in our Nation. Oh wonderful iniquity of men, when he that
possesses much, tyranniseth over him that has little: and he that has little
bears envy to him that has much: wherein the Law being led by affection,
and Justice measured by opinion: It coms to pass that unbridled covetousness
debates with secret malice, and pryuate malice geeues place to publyke Theft:
which, because no man calls into just examination and trial, it resolves
into this inconvenience, that the covetousness of one wicked man is
accomplished by the preiudcie of a whole nation: But if you call not into
reckoning your extortions past, and reform in time your present ambition, it
can not be, but either the Imortall Gods will enter into Judgment of your
abuses, or the world will cease to be a world, seeing there can not be a thing
more Just, then the Gods to make you Slaves by Justice, as you have made your
selves Tyrauntes by force. Think not therefore that because you have made your
selves Lords of Germanye, that it is happened by any singular industry of
War, but by the Judgment and sentence of the Gods: who, for that we have
offended them, have ordained in their secret Counselles, that to chastise our
vices, you should be raised as execucioners: wherein if for our wickedness, the
Gods have withdrawn their favor, what hope remains to you, whose vices keep
them still in anger: And if for a scourge of our sins we be made subject to
these myseries, what other expectation appertaynes to you then to suffer
infinite calamaties having so infinitely offended the Gods, that neither the
life of you nor your children is hable to satisfy your faltes. Think not that
either for the terror of your mighty armies, or the brute of your huge
treasors, or that you have the aid of more mighty Gods, or because you build
sumptuous Temples, or offer therein great sacrifices, that you are ye more
victorious, seeing that by how much we favor and cherish virtues, by so much
have we part and community with the Gods: If the glory and tryumphes of
Conquerors consisted not but to have subtle and pollitike wits, Captains well
experienced, soldiers serviceable and valiant, and Armies compounded upon
great nombers of men: It would be an easy matter to bring all these to the
wars. But by experience we see that in men is no further power then to give
the battle, and to the Gods only belongs the arbiterment and consent of the
victory.

In such a large distance of places, in wars so painful to march, in a
country so subtle and subject to ambush, and a people so rude and intractable,
I see not what might move you to make a conquest of Germany. Seeing if the
desire of our wealth carried you into that enterprise, in good reckoning, there
has been more money spent to conquer it, and more allowance made to mayntaine
it, then the revenues of Germany amount unto, yea perhaps it may be conquered
before the charges be satisfied. If you say you entered into the conquest for
none other end then to make Rome the sovereign Lady over Germany: Your
vanity was great, for that it little profits to hold the walls, and
fortresses of people vanquished, if the hearts of the inhabitants be estranged:
If you say you did it to amplify and make great the bounds and confines of
Rome, that seems also reason both frivolous and vain, because it is far
from the office of men wise and valiant to increase in countries and
Patrimony, and diminish in honor and virtue. If you made invasion upon us,
to the end to reduce us under good laws and customs, and exchange us from
tirants and people barbarous. How is it possible you should prescribe rules to
strangers, seeing you make no conscience to break the laws of your
predecessors? and no more ought you to correct others, that suffer so many
vices in your selves, then it is meet that the lame man take him that is blind
to lead him. If all these be true what other minds can you allege to push
you forwards to vex us in Germany, then that you made it lawful for all men
to rob, to kill, to conquer and to spoil, and following the general
corruption of the world far divided from the love of God and good policy,
you set men's minds at liberty every one to take what he could, and kill whom
he would: Whereunto this intolerable inconvenience is adjoined, that to al
these grievous evils that are committed daily, neither those that govern will
give remedy, nor such as are vexed dare complain. For, your judges are so
partial and far estranged from piety and justice, that the miserable people
oppressed, hold it a less evil to suffer their tribulations at home, then to
lay them before you here in complaint: The reason is, for that in their own
country if may be they are pursued but by one, but here in the Senate they
have the disfavor of all, the more, if he that complaynes be poor, and the
party that does the wrong be rich: For that in this Senate suits are not
dispatched according to the equity and innocence of causes, but according to
the wealth and authority of the party.

Having made us subject to your obedience, it is withal good reason you keep
us in justice, and minister to our country peace and tranquillity. But alas it
is all in the contrary, seeing such as you send to us do nothing but ravish our
goods, and the Senate here robs us of our renoume, saying, that since we are
a nation without laws, without reason, and without a king, we deserve not to
be otherways reputed and used then slaves, according to the custom of people
barbarous unknown. Wherein in this only I may say you are justly confounded,
for that such as we are, we are created of God: we lived at home contented with
our own, and had no strange desires to seek out strange countries, and
therefore with greater reason we may esteem you men without reason, law, and
equity, seeing that not content to be contained within the compass of Italy,
you stretch out your murdering hands to shed innocent blood through out all the
world. Where you say we deserve no better then slaves, for that we have no
Prince to command us, no Senate or council to govern us, nor armies to defend
us: I may answer, that seeing we had no enemies to anoy us, we lived without
care to arearearmies: every one being contented with his portion and fortune,
there was no necessity of a proud Senate to decide our controversies: And
being as we were, popular, and equal, why should we consent to have Princes, to
whose office it appertains chiefly to suppress tirants, and suffer those
people that live in peace and tra^quilitie. And where you say that our country
had no form of common weal nor policy, but that we passed a conversation
like brute beasts in mountains and Caves: You are in this as well as in the
rest far deceived, for that we never suffered in our country any that
practiced untruths, mutinies, or factions, and much less could we endure any
that brought from strange countries, garments or other wares to make us proud
or effeminate, but being modest in attire, we were also temperate in diet
without expectation of better entreating. And albeit we knew not what were the
sweet smelles of Asia, nor meddled with the gold of Spain, nor tasted of the
oil of Mauritania, nor sipped of the wynes of Candia, and much less could
skill of the purple of Arabia: Yet, for all these we lived not at home like
brute beasts, nor yet forbear to manage a common weal: for that such spiced
trifles as those, bring more occasion to stir up vices, then to breed or
nourish virtues. Right happy and well governed is a common weal, not that
wherein be many Traitors, but that which entertayneth men virtuous: not that
which abounds in riches, but that which florisheth in innocence and
integrity: not where live men rash and wilful, but where bear rule such as
are of peace and judgment.

And therefore to the policy of Rome which is rich, we owe pity and
compassion, and to the government of Germany because it is poor, you ought to
bear justice with favor: Wherein if the same contentment which we brook in our
poverty, had also remained to you in your wealth and abundance, we had been
without cause to complain, and you without spot or blame of conscience.

I have yet many things to say, which in this perplexity of mind, I have no
fear to speak, since you had no shame to do them, for that a fault public
must not suffer secret correction. A public fault must not suffer a secret
punishment.
Did it not suffice you to take from us our ancient liberty, and to
ouerwhelme us with intolerable subsidies and payments, but the more to
entangle us with all kinds of miseries, you send us officers so covetous that
they are all transformed into private gain, and judges so ignorant that they
are not hable to comprehend our statutes, nor make us understand your laws.
They punish grievously the poor, and dissemble with the faults of the rich:
they take all that is offered in public, and refuse nothing that they can rake
in secret: they consent to many offenses, because they will have occasion to
be greater gayners: and under cooller that they are of Rome, they have no
fear to rob all the world. When will cease your pride to command over
strangers* and your covetousness to spoil your neighbors? If we be
disobedient, or that you suspect our loyalty or service, proceed to the
dispatch of our lives, to the end we may be delivered of pain, and you live
without jealousy, assuring you that your swords can not be more cruel in our
bodies, then are your tirannies in our hearts. If you lay thus many burdens
upon us for our children, load them with Irons and take them as slaves,
because you can lay no more on them then they can bear, but of commandments
and tributs you have given us more then we can suffer: if you do it for our
goods, we give you liberty to take al, for that we have not your condition to
delight to live poorly, for fear we should not die rich. Oh to what extremetie
has your tirannies brought us: seeing all the remainder of our miserable
nation have sworn together, never to accompany with our wives, and to kill our
proper children the rather to deliver them of your cruelties. And therefore
holding it more honorable that they die with liberty, then to live in
servitude and captivity, we have desperately determined to suffer from
henceforth the violent mocions and furies of the flesh, and so to sequester our
selves from the use of our wives to the end they may be barren, thinking it
better to live continent for twenty or thirty years, (the residue of our time
here) then to leave to our children an inheritance of perpetual slavery. For,
if they have to suffer, those calamities which their sorrowful fathers have
endured, it were not only good not to let them live, but wtal it were better to
consent not to have them borne. The land that is conquered by force, ought to
be governed with more clemency and mildnes, for that those that are miserable
captives, when they see favorable justice administered, they will both forget
the tirannie past, and better prepare their hearts to the perpetual servitude:
which if it be so, why do your officers in Germany drive us to complain, and
your Senate at Rome so slow to give remedy, that before you will admit an
offense to the question, the whole common weal suffers danger. If a poor
man come to demand justice, and have no bribes of gold, silver, wine, purple,
and other precious things to disperse. At the beginning he shall be entertained
to spend all that he has, through a vain hope to obtain his cause. And being
entered, they consume him by delays, and whilst he has means to bear out
the charges of the suit, they assure him that he has good right, but when his
liberality fails, they pronounce sentence against him, and so where he came
to complain but of one, he returns accursing all, crying to the Gods for
justice and pity. I will disclose some part of my life the better to make you
see the calamities of my poor countrymen.

I live by Acornes in Winter, and fish in Summer, sometimes bearing of burdens,
and sometimes digging up of wild Roots, and that more for necessity then
pastime, passing the most part of my miserable time amongst the mountains,
void of the comfort of my Wife, and company of my friends, and not for other
reason then to keep mine eyes from the view of so many murders of good men, so
many oppressions of the poor and innocent, and so many other calamities
afflicting my poor Country, that neither finding justice there, nor hope of
redress in this Senate, I am entered into this banishment from the society of
my house and comfort, deliting more to wander alone through the wooddes and
valleys desert, then to be made sorrowful always with the sighs, complaints,
and lamentations of my neighbors: For, being a borderer in the Forests and
wooddes, the wild beasts forbear to hurt me, if I refuse to do them harm,
where the Romans in my country, although I do them service, yet will they not
spare to torment me. It is no doubt a great perplexity to endure a change of
fortune, but far more intolerable is the grief, when the pain is felt and
can not be remedied: so that great is my evil, when my destruction is subject
to such a remedy, as such as can help me, will not, and those that would,
can not.

Oh, it is time you had some sense of the miseries we feel, seeing that if in
reducing them thus to memory, my tongue faynteth, my eyes grow dim, my heart
vanishes, and my flesh trembles: Much more grievous is it to see them in my
country, to hear them with mine ears, to touch them with my finger, and to
taste them in my heart: yea the iniquity of your judges is so great, and the
justice of this Senate so partial, that it exceedes the faculty of flesh and
blood to endure the one, and is hateful to all good men to hear of the other.
And therefore in the account of all that I have said I grow to this
conclusion, that one of these two things are to be done, either to chastise
me if I have lied, or, if I have told truth, you to be deprived of your
offices, wherein for my part, if you think my tongue has taken an unlawful
liberty to publish the roundnes and simplicity of my heart, I stretch out my
self before you in this place, and do offer my head to the Axe, assuring my
self of more honor by my death, then you can merit fame or renoume by joining
so many miseries to my wretched life. Here the savage man gave ^ to his
Oration, leaving the Senate in such remorse for the oppressions of Germany,
that the next day they established other Judges over that part upon Daunby,
and proceeded to punish the corruption of others for perverting so noble a
common weal.

Behold here (sir) what holiness flowed out of the mouth of an Ethnike, from
whom I wish you with other judges mercenary as you are, to fetch your
directions to reform the Provinces committed to your government, and with all
to discover the subtilties, corruptions and iniquities of inferior officers
subsisting in Cities and commonweals. For, who would set him down to
describe faithfully the deceites, the delays, the perplexities, and dangerous
ends of suits, he should find it a subject not to be written with ink but with
blood: seeing if every suter suffered as much for the holy faith of Christ, as
he endures about the travel of his process, there would be as many martirs
in chaunceries, and other courts of justice and record of Princes, as was at
Rome in the times of persecution by the old Emperors: so that as to begin a
process at this day, is no other thing then to prepare sorrow to his heart,
complaints to his tongue, tears to his eyes, travail to his feet, expenses
to his purse, toil to his men, trial of his friends, and to all the rest of
his body nothing but pain and travel. So, the effects and conditions of a
process are no other, then of a rich man to become poor: of a spirit
pleasant to settle into malencholly: of a free mind to become bound from
liberality, to fall to covetousness: from truth to learn falsehode and
shifts: and of a quiet man, to become a vexer of others. So that I see no
other difference between the ten plagues that scourged Egypt, and the miseries
that afflict suitors, then that the calamities of the one were inflicted by Gods
providence, and the torments of the other are invented by the malice of of men,
who by their proper toil, make themselves very Martirs.
