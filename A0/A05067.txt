A Treatise against the Proclamation published by the King of Spain, by which
he proscribed the late Prince of Orange: whereby shall appear the sclaunders
and falce accusations contained in the said proscription, which is annexed to
the end of this Treatise.

PRESENTED TO MY LORDS THE Estates general in the Low Countries.

Together with the said Proclamation or Proscription.

Printed in French and all other Languages. AT DELFT.

A copy of the Letters which my Lord the Prince of Orange, sent unto the Kigns
and Potentates of Christendom. (*)
SIr, I doubt not, but that your Maiectie has bin advertised of a certain
Proscription, which the King of Spain, has appointed to be published againct
me, because he has caused the same to be spread abroad in all languages, and
has sent it also into diverse quarters of christendom. I and all my very good
friends have thought, that I could not sufficiently defend mine honor (which
I am advised and purposed not to hazard or indaunger for any thing) but by
setting a just defense, against this unjust Proscription. In regard whereof, I
have presented unto my Lords, the estates of these countries, my answer:
which answer also (for the maintenance of mine honor and reputation,
amongst the Princes and Potentates of Europe, who in respect of their
preheminences and dignities, are the succors of poor Princes and distressed
noble men) I have bin bold to send unto them, and to you (Sir) particularly,
most humbly beseeching your Majesty, that, after you have seen it, you would
yield like judgment thereof, as it has pleased my Lords the Estates, who
have bin most faithful witnesses of all mine actions, to do, and to esteem
and judge thereof also (as it shall please your Majesty to take knowledge of
it) by their advise and counsel, which also is annexed to my said defense. And
because (Sir) your Majesty may think it strange, that the King of Spain,
having heretofore violently taken from me all my goods, after that I had put my
gouernementes into the hands of the Duchess of Parma, then the Gouernesse of
this estate, and had withdrawn my self into the country of Germany, the
place of my nativity, where I kept my self peaceably among my brethren,
kinsfolks and friends, as also I had fully purposed so to continue: and that,
having at the same time, conveyed or carried away from the schools, my son
the County of Bueren, and both contrary to the privileges of the country,
and against his own oath causing him to be carried prisoner into Spain, where
he is as yet cruelly kept captive: and besides, having procured me to be
condemned to death, by the Duke of Alua his own officer: because (I say) your
Majesty may think it strange, that for all these reasons (which were
nevertheless very great and weighty) I have not hitherto published any
defense, which was directed to the said King, or might directly concern him,
which thing notwithstanding I do at this present and declare thereby, that the
faults, wherewith the King of Spain minds to charge me, belong unto him
self. I do therefore most hu^blie beseech your Majesty (Sir) that before you
judge of this my writing, you would consider the quality both of the crimes
and faults, where with I am charged by this Proscription, and also the
quality of mine own person. For, if the King of Spain was content to
withhold from me my son and my goods, which he has in his possession, and
further to offer (as at this present he does) five and twenty thousand crowns
for my head, and to promise to make such noble as should murder me, and to
pardon them all the faults whatsoever that they could have committed before
that time: no man should think it evil in me, that I have attempted by all
the means I could, (as in deed heretofore I have done) to preserve my self
and mine, and to enable my self what I could, to enter again into that which
is mine own: and that I have followed that order and course of life that I
have done. But further the King of Spain, having all the world through
published, that I am a public plague, an enemy of the world, unthankful,
unfaithful, a traitor, and a wicked person: these are such injuries (Sir) that
no gentleman, no though he were of the basest of the king of Spaines natural
subjects, can or ought to endure: in so much (Sir) that though I were one of
his simple and absolute vassals, who owes homage unto him by honor, yet so it
is, that by such a sentence, and so unjust in all and every part thereof: I
also having bin by him, spoiled of my lands and Lordshippes, in respect of
which, I should heretofore have taken an oath unto him, I might have held my
self absolved and free from all my bands toward him, and have assaied also
(which thing even nature has taught every one) by all the means I could to
maintain mine honor, which ought to be to me and to all noble men, more dear
than life and goods. Notwithstanding, seeing it has pleased God, to show me
this great grace, that I am borne a free Lord, not holding of any other but of
the Empire, as do the Princes and other free Lords of Germany and Italy: and
further seeing that I bear the title, and have the name of an absolute and
free Prince, though in deed my Princedome be not very great: yea whatsoever
it be, I not being his natural subject, neither having held any thing of him,
but by reason of my Seignuries and Lordshippes, ships, of which
notwithstanding he has wholly dispossessed me: it has seemed unto me, that I
could not defend mine honor, and satisfy or content my near kinsfolks,
sundry Princes (to whom this is my honor that I am lincked) and my whole
posterity, but in aunswering by public writing to this accusation, which in
the presence of all christendom, is published and set out against me. And
though I have not bin able to do it, without touching his honor, I hope
notwithstanding (Sir) that your Majesty will impute it, rather to the
inforcement, that the quality and hainousnes of this Proscription has laid
upon me, than to my nature or will. For as concerning this point, that some
men may think it strange, that I do after this sort defend my self,
seeing that I have sometimes heretofore held of him sundry lands and
Lordshippes, for answer thereto, I will most humbly beseech your Majesty,
to consider the hainousnes of the injury, that is done me, which a right noble
man will never in deed abide: also that I am not his natural subject, and, as
concerning my fees and pensions, that he has spoiled me of them. But suppose
that I had always enjoyed them: yet so it is, that the same law which he
uses toward others, should not be denied to me. In the letter sent to the
French King, it is vvritte^: He holds of your Majesty.
He holds of the French King in loyaultie and homage, and even as the vassal
does of his Lord, the County or Earldome of Charollois: and yet for all that
he ceasseth not, to make war against the crown of France, yea he never
leaves of continually to practice and devise, somewhat against the same. He
takes this as a sure foundation or rule, that, being a sovereign governor in
some other place, it is lawful for him, to revenge him self of the wrong,
which he pretended was done unto him, by the late French King Henry of most
noble memory. When he made war against the Pope Caraffa, because as a
vassal he held of him the kingdoms of Sicilia and Naples, he published his
defense, by which he maintained, that he was absolved from his oath, because
that the Pope kept not him self, within the terms or points that the Lord
owes to his vassal, according to the feodall laws which are mutual, and
respect as well the one, as the other. Now (Sir) there is nothing so natural
or kindly, as, that every one should in his own cause, receive the very
selfsame rule and order, that he would have an other man to receive or allow
of. Wherefore he should not think it strange, that I, being so maine ways
reviled and iniuried by him, and not being his subject, that I, I say, do aid
my self, with the means that God has given me, and with which he has bin
willing to help him self against his Lords, who have not offended him in
any thing whats^euer, that draws nigh to the wrong which I have suffered at
his hand: yea he should not think it strange, that I use against him that
reprochefull note, hy which he assayeth to mark as it were in the forehead,
both me and my race. And because my Lords the Estates, (who have more nighly
known the truth of all that is contained in this my defense, and have
approved the same) have yielded unto me sufficient testimony enough touching
my life past: I do most humbly also beseech your Majesty (Sir) in approving
this same mine answer, to believe that I am not, either a traitor or wicked
person, but that I am, (thanks be to God for it) a noble man, of a very good
and most ancient house, yea a good man and true in every thing that I
promise, not unthankful, nor unfaithful, nor having committed any thing,
whereby a Lord or Knight of my state and countenance, may receive any
reproach or shame: most humbly beseeching you, to hold and account me, in the
number of your most humble servants. And thus having most humbly submitted
my self unto your Majesty, I will pray God (Sir) to give it, together with
perfect health, a most blessed and most long life.

At Delft in Holland, the iiij. day of February 1581. Your Majesty's most
humble and obedient servant, WILLIAM of NASSAV.

A declaration made by my Lord the Prince of Orange, to my Lords the Estates
General of the low Countries.
MY Lords, ye have heretofore seen a certain sentence in the form of a
Proscription, which was sent by the King of Spain, and afterward published by
the appointment and order of the Prince of Parma: and how by the means
thereof, mine enemies have against all right and reason attempted, grievously
to touch and to taint mine honor, and to cause my former actions, to be
thought evil and wicked: wherein I have bin very willing and desirous, to take
the advice and counsel of sundry notable personages, and men of great name
and calling, yea of the principal counselers and wise men of this country.
But by reason of the quality and form of the said Proscription, and the
heinous and grievous crimes wherewith I am charged, although in deed
wrongfully, I have hitherto stayed: notwithstanding I have bin advised and
counseled by sundry my friends, that I cannot otherwise defend mine honor,
but to show by public writing, how unjustly I have bin accused and charged
with many faults: and also how I have bin openly iniuried, and maliciously
slaundered. According to which advice and counsel (my Lords) seeing that in
this world, I acknowledge you only for my superiors, I offer unto you this my
defense, written against the reprehensions of mine adversaries, by which I hope
that I have not only discovered all their deceits and slanders, but also
lawfully justified, all my actions past. And because, that their principal
mark and purpose is, to seek out all the means they can, to take away my
life, or else to ca^se me to be banished out of these countries, or at the
least, to diminishe the authority which it has pleased you to give me, as if
obtaining that thing once, all should fall out as they would wish it: and on
the other side, because they slander me, that by unlawful means I keep and
hold my authority, I beseech you my Lords to believe, that albeit I be
content to live amongst you, so long as it shall please God, and to continue
toward you my faithful service: yet notwithstanding, that mine own life,
which I have dedicated to your service, and my presence in the midst of you,
are not so dear unto me, but that I can most willingly abandon and forgo my
life, or else withdraw my self out of the country, when you shall think or
know, that either the one or the other may any manner of way serve your turn,
to purchase unto you a more assured liberty. And as concerning the authority
which it has pleased you to give me, you know my Lords how many times I have
besought you, to content your selves with my service, and to unburden me
thereof, if you should think that it would stand well, with the good estate
of your affairs, which thing even as yet I do demand of you, offering
notwithstanding (as I have always done) in all that wherein it has pleased
you to command me, still to continue to employe my self in the service of the
country: in regard of which I esteem nothing of all that is in the world, as
I do more largely declare the same unto you in this my defense. Which if you
shall judge it convenient, I beseech you to think it good, and to take care,
that it may be brought to light and published, to the end, that not only you
(my Lords) but also the whole world may judge, of the equity of my cause, and
of the unjust dealing of mine adversaries.

Presented by my Lord the Prince of Orange, to my Lords the Deputies of the
Estates general, and of the Provinces united together, being assembled in the
town of DELFT, the xiij. of December. 1580. Underneath was written, II.
HOFFLIN being present.

The answer of my Lords the Estates general, made to the former declaration.
THE Estates general, having not many days since, seen and read a certain
Proscription, published by the enemies, against your Excellencies person, by
which they charge the same with heinous crimes, indeuouring to make it odious,
(as though by unlawful means, and indirect ways, it had usurped the place
and degree, wherein it is set and established) and to deliver your said
Excellencies person over for a parie, and to take from it the honor thereof:
having in like sort seen and viewed, a defense set out by your: Excellency,
against the said Proscription, find, by the truth of that which has passed
in these countries, and which is known and manifest also, to every one of
them, in respect of them selves, that the said crimes, faults and reproaches,
have unjust lie bin laid upon the same. And as concerning the offices, as well
of Lieutenaunt general, as of the particular gouernementes, they affirm that
his excellency, yea even then, when he was lawfully elected and chosen, did
not accept them, but at our instant request, in which also he has continued at
our entreaties, and that with the sound contentment and satisfaction, of the
whole country: and the said Estates do yet again beseech him, that it
would please him to continue therein, promising him all aid and assistance,
without sparing any of the means they have, and also to yield unto him
ready and willing obedience. And because they know, the faithful services,
that your Excellency has yielded to these countries, and those also which
they hope, in time yet hereafter to come, you will perform: they offer unto
him, for the assurance of his person, to maintain a company of horsemen for
the sauegarde thereof, beseeching him to accept it on the behalf, and at the
offer of those persons, which think them selves much bound to the preservation
thereof. And so much as touches the said Eslates (who think them selves also
charged by the said Proscription) they mind shortly in like sort to justify
them selves, so far forth as they shall think it convenient.

So concluded in the assembly of my Lords the Estates general, in the town
of Delft, the xvij. day of December. In the year of our Lord, 1580. By the
express determination of the said Estates. Signed I. Houfflin.

AN APOLOGY OR DEFENSE, OF MY Lord the Prince of Orange, County of Nassau, of
Catzenellenboghen, Dietz, Vianden, etc. Burchgraue of Antwerp, and Vicount of
Bezanson, Baron of Breda, Die, Grimberghe, of Arlay, Nozeroy, etc. Lord of
Chastelbellin, etc. Lieutenaunt general in the low Countries, and Governor
of Brabant, Hollande, Zeeland, Vtrecht, and Frise, and Admiral, etc.
Against the Proclamation and Edict, published by the King of Spain, by which
he proscribeth the said Lord, whereby shall appear the slanders and false
accusations, contained in the said Proscription.
THis is the thing which I have always prayed unto God for (my Lords) and
desired withal my heart, that he would grant it me, from the time that I vowed
my person, and all the means that I have in the world, for the recovering of
your liberty, and the safety of your persons, goods, and consciences: if I
say, I should at any time have preferred, that which respects my self
particularly, before your health and wealth generally, that I niight in this
behalf, bear an eternal punishment, which I should have drawn upon my self, by
mine own good will and accord: But on the other side, if that which I have done
heretofore, has bin by me attempted and taken in hand, only for the
preservation of your estate: and that I have borne, a great part of the
burden of this present war, only for the common safegarde of the country:
and that the hatred conceived by certain wicked persons, against the country,
against godly people and honorable personages, having bin for a certain time
dissembled and covered in their hearts, comes wholly and that at once, to
vomit and cast up it self upon me only, rather then upon so many good people,
and specially upon the general estate of the common wealth: then I say this
has bin the thing that I have greatly desired, that, if my good will had bin
such toward you (my Lords) your chilrden, your towns and communalties, as
in deed it has bin, I might one day carry away, a solemn testimony
thereof, as well for the peace of mine own conscience, as for the defense of
mine own honor, before all the people of the earth, and before al posterity.
And now I do greatly rejoice my self, and yield immoatal thanks unto our
good God, and I have great occasion of contentement and quietness, seeing that
he suffers me to be made so rare, and so noble, and so excellent a mark
thereof, by this cruel and barbarous Proscription, yea such a one, as the like
has not bin heard in these countries, commended amongst all people and
nations, for their singular and incredible courtesy. For albeit that nothing
be more to be wished of a man, than the race and course of his life, to be
sound, blessed, prosperous, and upright, without any dashe, blow, stumbling,
or any wicked incountring notwithstanding if all things had fallen out unto me,
as I would have wished, and that I had not incou^tred, with the hatred of the
Spanishe nation and his adherentes, I should have lost the gain of this
testimony, which my very enemies have yielded me, and which I take to be the
most excellent flower of glory, that I had bin able to have desired, to have
bin crowned with, before my death. For what in this world can be more
acceptable, and that specially to him, who has enterprised so great and
excellent a work, as is the liberty of so good a people, oppressed by so
wicked people, than to be deadly hated of his enemies, yea such enemies, as are
withal the enemies of the country, and by their own very mouth and
confession, to receive a sure testimony, of his faithfulness toward his own
people, and of constancy, against tyraunts and disturbers of common peace? in
so much, that the Spaniards and their adherents, thinking in deed to do me
displeasure, have done me many pleasures, as by this infamous Proscription,
they have thought to hurt me more than before, and yet they have made me more
rejoice, and given me more contentednes of mind. For I have not only thereby
received that profit, but they have opened unto me a more large field to defend
my self, than I durst ever be bold to desire, that so I might cause all the
world to know, the equity and justice of my enterprises, and by it leave unto
my posterity, an example of virtue meet to be followed by all those, that
would not dishonor the nobility of their auncesters, from whence we are
descended, and of whom, not so much as one only, has at any time favored
tyranny, but all they have loved the liberty of the people, amongst whom
they have borne office and had authority. I have no occasion to complain,
that I have not had heretofore, matter large enough to speak of my self, and
to reprove the foul and hayuous, faults of mine enemies: but neither would
shamefastnes suffer me my self to sing and set out mine own praises, which
surely is a hard matter not to do, whatsoever modesty a man pretend in such a
matter: neither would public honesty permit me, to enlarge my self to
rehearse the faults of mine enemies, liking much better to bury some part of
their grievous enterprises under silence, than in publishing them (albeit in
truth) to cast my self into danger, to incur the suspicion to be a
slaunderer. Seeing than (my Lords) that in this Proscription, the question is
not only to tax any person, and barbarously to make it a pray, but also it is
known to every one, that by my wounds, they mind to wound the common wealth
and the state of all these countries: as also this is no more now performed, by
small diffamatorie libelles, made by people of no account, and whose injuries
done against me, should no more move me, than the tongue of some little serpent,
which a man must rather break in pieces with his foot, than endeavor to fight
against it with weapons: but that men of so great countenance, should so far
and so vilely debase their greatness, as to busy them selves, faslie to
backbite and to slander, it has seemed unto me altogether necessary to
speak, to the end that our common country (for which I am ready to give up my
life, as I have already lost my goods) may not feel her self damnified or
hurt by my silence, and that on the other side, these famous titles, of so many
Countries and Kingdoms, stretching them selves so far as over Africa and
Asia, may not dasell the eyes of many, who judge the affairs and matters of
this world, rather by shadows, appearaunces, and outward shows, than by
strength and soundnes of reason. I know notwithstanding all this, that those
which persecute me, have in many points advantage against me, and principally
in two points: the one is, that they make a show and boasting, of their great
qualities and estates, which do infinitely exceed my condition: the other
(which is also a natural thing to al men) willingly to open their ears to
evil speeches and slau^ders: for I have oftentimes heard, the most elegant of
all the Poets, to have very well said, that there is not in any feast any sauce
so sweet, to the pallet of the mouth, as evil speech and backbyting is to
the ear: and on the other side, that nothing is heard so much against the
heart, and with so great grief, as the speech of him that prayseth him self.
Of these two points, that which brings pleasure is given to mine enemy, and
I have for my share, that which is hard and vupleasaunt almost to the whole
world. But I hope, that by the mean of your favor and usual good will, that
neither the one nor the other, shall bring me any loss or hurt, seeing that so
it is, that this long time sithence you have tried, that these great and famous
States, if they be spotted and tainted with tyranny, can not gain much of
free hearts and noble courages. And on the other side, knowing the ordinary
trade and course of my life, who love not more to blame an other man, than to
praise my self, yet if it so fall out that I do, either the one or the other,
as it is a very hard thing not to do so (albeit that it shall be with the
greatest modesty that I can) and if there be any thing that may seem not very
seemly, it shall be long to you (my Lords) to attribute the same, rather to the
necessity so to do (which mine enemies have laid upon me) than to my nature,
and by that means to unburden me, and to lay the fault wholly, upon their
own shamelesnes and importunity. And I will pray you (my Lords) to remember,
that I am falsely accused to be unthankful, unfaithful, an heretic, an
hypocrite, like unto Judas and Cain, the disturber of the country, rebellious,
a stranger, an enemy of mankind, the public plague of the christian common
wealth, a traitor, and a wicked person, that I am set out to be slain as a
beast, with reward to all murderers, and to all poysoners which will attempt
the same, leaving you to judge (my Lords) whether it be possible to purge my
self from such slau^ders, without ripping up in some matters, the ordinary
course of my life, and without exceeding my custom, in speaking of my self
and other men. In the mean while, I am so assured of the justice of my cause,
and of my soundnes and faithfulness toward you, and on the other side, of your
equity and roundnes, and of the knowledge that you have, how and after what
sort all things have passed, that I demand no other thing of you, but only
that you would judge, and take notice of this matter, and determine thereof for
your own good, health, and preservation, that which the laws, freedoms,
liberties, and privileges of the country, command you, according to the
hope that the people has of your wisdom and vprightnes: which thing also I
pray you to do, yea I earnestly beseech you, by all holy and sacred things,
and that by the oath and band which you bear to the country, certainly
assuring my self, that as in many other matters I am less than mine enemies,
so that I shall be in this behalf so much the more their superior, as that by
all means and crafts they have purposed, to violate, break, and suppress
your laws, your privileges, and liberties: whereas on the other side, I have
with a good heart and all faithfulness, employed my self to maintain and
preserve the same. And albeit (my Lords) that I am not in such sort an enemy,
to my renown and own good name, but that I take delight and pleasure (as also
I hope my actions and deeds deserve the same) to be in good account among all
the Princes, Potentates, and commonweals of the world (excepting only
amongst the Spaniards and their adherents, who perseuering in the pursuit of
their tyranny, I desire not either grace or favor, or any free^dship at their
hands) not withstanding, seeing that you are the men only in this matter, to
whom I have taken an oath, to whom alone I count my self bound who alone also
have power to approve or improve my acts and deeds: I shall hold my self
very well satisfied, when on your part I shall have received a testimony
comfortable and agreeable to my intentes and purposes, which have always bin
joined with your good, profit, and service: and I shall patiently suffer other
people and nations, to judge thereof according to their passions and
affections, or rather (which thing also I more desire) according to equity,
right, and justice, having first put of all prejudice, and freed their own
understandings from the thick clouds of these greatnesses and glory, which
might heretofore have somewhat dazeled them.

Now if mine enemies (my Lords) had come directly, to the point and matter of
the Proscription, setting out the reasons, upon which is grounded, this
barbarous sentence (which sentence in deed does overmuch declare their mind
very base and much degenerating from the virtue and courage of their
ancestors) I had not used likewise any circuites or compassinges of words,
but had at the very entry declared, both what mine own innocence is, and
how weak and ruinous their foundations and groundworkes are. But seeing that
to make me odious, they have better liked, to set, even at the entrance,
before the eyes of all the world, a heap of injuries, and in the course of
this speech, without purpose to interlace them, speaking so shamelessely of
me: I suppose, that it is necessary, yea in deed most just, that I answer to
such slanders, to the end that some being moved or persuaded by such words,
may not yet receive this my defense, with a heart more estraunged from me, than
the law allowed amongst people, and justice it self requires.

As concerning then this heap of injuries, by which I am so shamelesly rent in
pieces, and which being taken out of this Proscription, nothing shall remain
therein but a smoke: you see (my Lords) how plain and without painting
colors the defense is that I use. If you knome me to be such a one, as mine
enemies publishe me to be: if I carry either in my body or in my soul, such
colors as the forger of this writing says, that he has painted me out
withal (for my Lords ye have known me from my youth, and I have not spent my
age else where, but with you) shut immediately your ears, and refuse to hear or
understand, so much as one word coming out of my mouth. But if on the other
side, I have all my life through, bin more honest, more sound, more continent,
and less covetous, than the authors of this slanderous writing, and then he,
which has published the same, to wit, the Prince of Parma and his
predecessors, whose factes are ouerwell known by histories: if I say, you
have known me and mine ancestors, more virtuous people than these (for I
speak not as yet of the King) and their ancestors, then believe, that as they
falsely slander at the very entrance, so they shall be no more meet to be
believed, in all the rest of their shameless accusations. For, to what end I
pray you, serves this recital of so many injuries, but only to show unto
the world, that my enemies are skillful to slander and backbite, and that he,
whom yet through Gods goodness, they have not bin able to murder, neither by
poison, nor sword, nor yet to deceive by promises, nor yet busy him with vain
and uncertain hopes, they do assay at the least to wou^d him, with the venim
of their tongue, accustomed even from their youth to so infamous an occupation?

Of the good turns which some say, the lord Prince has received of the
Emperor Charles.
They at the beginning make a recital, of many good turns which I have
received fro the Emperor, in respect of the succession, of my late Lord the
Prince of Orange my cosen, that the King made me of his order, Lieutenaunt
general in the government of Hollande, Zeelande, Vtrecht, and Burgundy, and
one of the counsel of Estate. To what end are these things alleged? to
declare that I am greatly bound to the house of Spain, and that I can not
shun this, but that I must be condemned of ingratitude: and moreover,
Accusation of ingratitude.
that by reason of the oath that I had taken, and of the lands and
Lordshippes, that I hold in homage of the said Lord, I am bound to procure,
the profitt and advancement of his affairs and matters, thinking to make me
likewise culpable and faulty of unfaithfulness. Accusation of unthankfulness.
Verily I confess and agree, with the King and the whole house of Spain, that
nothing is so much to be condemned in this world, as a man defiled with these
two spots and stains, to wit, of unthankfulness and unfaithfulness, and he
that has spoken these two injuries to a man, he has said as much to him and
against him, as if he had charged him with all the accusations and slanders,
that wise people and fools, discreet and indiscreet, could rake together:
and specially look, by how much a Lord is of a more noble and famous house, by
so much the more shall he be dishonored, if he can be convinced of these or
such faults: and I refuse not to be hated of all the world, to be rooted out
of the earth, and that the memory of me and mine should be withered for ever,
if I may be found such a one. But that shall be with this condition also, that
if I declare, that there is no Prince in the world, more ungrateful and
unkind toward a poor Lord, than he that accused me and would condemn me,
is against me and mine: that the unfaithfulness also which he has used in
respect of me (for I will not yet speak of the open violating of his faith
toward the country) is incredible, that then (I say) he also may be subject
to the like condition and state, and may be holden for such a one as he is,
amongst all living people, and all posterity to come: and I shall think the
punishment more great in his behalf, than he thinks any in mine, as may
appear by that, which he makes show to seek for by this tragical
Proscription, the which through Gods grace and goodness, does no more astonishe
me than a vain vision or dream. First (my Lords) I protest, that the
remembrance and memory of the Emperor Charles, shall always be in an
honorable account with me, as well because of his acts, as that it pleased
him, to show me so much honor, as to have nourished me in his chamber, by the
space of nine years, to whom also I yielded and performed, most faithful and
most willing service. But if he, who by reason is most bound of all men to
maintain his renown, come to accuse me of ingratitude and unthankfulness, as,
that I have not acknowledged the good turns, which he says, that I have
received of the Emperor: I beseech you to hold me excused, if being
constrained for the defense of mine innocence, I declare, in respect of good
turns alleged, that I have not received any at all from him, but that in
doing him service, I have received most great losses, as you shall plainly
understand, if it please you to hear me patienly.

Now then he says, that in respect of the succession of the late Lord, the
Prince Rene my cosen, An answer to the accusation of ingratitude.
the Emperor handled me favorably. But wherein? First, there was never any
Lord as yet found so evil advised, that would pretend right against me for
succession in so much that if the Emperor has not hindered me in that, what
has he done for me, that a judge, the greatest enemy I could have, would not
have done likewise? Was there yet any party found so rash, that durst offer
him self to speak against it? And though I had had adverse parties, if my right
were so clear and so well grounded, that nothing was ever yet hitherto able to
be alleged against it, which was able to darcken it, or to shake it: and that
herevppon the Emperor had given forth a decree for my profitt, what has he
done for me, but administered me justice, and would not take from me that, which
the laws, reason, and very nature it self did give me? But if it please you
(my Lords) to consider the nature and quality of this succession, you shall
find my right and title to have bin such, that the Emperor could not have
deprived me of it, or taken it from me, without an extreme injury, and a most
manifest wrong.

There were in the succession, two principal members or branches: The first
was, The succession of Nassau and Challon.
that which came by our house of Nassau, which my Lords my predecessors, the
graundfather and great graundfathers, uncles by the fathers side, and cosen
german by the fathers side, enjoyed: that is to say, the goods which at this
day belong unto me, in Brabant, Flaunders, Hollande and Luxenburgh: the other
was, the succession of the house of Challon. As concerning the succession of
Nassau, which men commonly call Breda, because it was the principal place of
my Lordshippes, and where I and my predecessors had held our chambers of
accountes, counsel, and principal instructions pertaining to us and ours, who
was he that might molest me in that, unless it were my Lord my father, who
was the uncle, and I the cousin germain, of my Lord the Prince Rene, the only
son of my Lord Henry, County of Nassau, my uncle, and the brother of my
Lord my father? But so far of is it, that I was hindered in that succession,
by my said Lord and father, that he him self took pains to come and
solicit the matter, that I might be put in possession thereof: neither was
there ever found man so shameless, that would set him self against it, but
Schoore the President or judge, who in the counsel said, that the son of an
heretic ought not to succeed, because that my Lord my father, following the
examples of good Kings, as of David, Josias and others, had reformed the
Churches of his countries, which he held and had in Germany, and had purged
them from abuses, according to the word of God, and that by the permission and
sufferaunce of the Emperor. And notwithstanding all this, the counsel
ceasseth not to give advise, and to determine the matter according to reason
and equity, as in deed it could not otherwise do, seeing that they had
maintained my Lord the County of Kingstain mine uncle in the succession of the
County of Rocheforte, although that he him self were a protestaunt. Seeing
then that this was in question (if that may be called a question, which was in
our own house, as whether that the succession aforesaid, were adjudged to the
father or to the son, pronounced notwithstanding always according to the
laws) none beside could justly pretend any right thereto.

As concerning the house of Challon, first it cannot be said in respect of the
Barronies which I peaceably hold and possess in the Duchy of Burgundy,
The Barronies of Burgundy and of Daulphine.
and in Daulphine of Vienna, that I am therefore bound to the Emperor, for he
had not any more power therein than I, all being under the power of the
French King, who alike seized, the County of Charrollois, apparteyning to the
Emperor, and my Barronries, when war was moved between them two, in so
much that I can not be otherwise bound unto him therefore, but in this, that I
was contained in the treaty of peace made at Sessons, which was the last
duty that he could yield, to the memory of my Lord my cousin, who but a
little while before died, in the same expedition, and that on foot, at the
siege of Saint Disier, after so many deeds of arms done for his service. And
less has he bin able to favor me in my Princedome of Orange, where he had
nothing to see too nor to do, no neither he, nor any Prince, whatsoever,
Princedom of Orange.
I my self holding the same in a naked, bare, and absolute Sovereignty: which
thing few other Lords are able to say. And there is no Prince, in respect of
my said Princedome, whose amity and good grace I stand in need of, but of
the French Kings, who I hope will not touch that, that belongs to a poor
Prince, who is his most humble servant, because reason suffers not that,
beyond which reason he will not go, and also because of the loyal and
faithful services, that my predecessors have done to the Crown of France,
and the Duchy of Brytannie (whereof he is descended and is the heir) with
great dangers of their lives, great expenses, and infinite travails.

There remains then that which belongs unto me, in the County of
Burgundy, and whereof, I have bin so long time, so unjustly and tyrannouslie
spoiled and dispossessed, which by means of lone and borrowing, yields unto
me, even to this present time, two millions at the least of loss But I would
in the first place, that they should remember, wherefore the County of
Burgundy, is called Franck or free, to wit, amongst other reasons,
Possessions in the Fra^ck or fre cou^tie
because that the freedom and liberty of the Lords, and such as hold
possessions in the said country, is, that they have power, by will to
bequeath and to dispose of their goods, how and to whom, they shall think
good, without being either for their wives or their children, or other heirs
whatsoever enforced, otherwise to dispose of their goods, but in such sort,
as shall be agreeable to their own will and pleasure. Seeing then that so it
is, that my Lord the Prince Rene, moved of his own good will, did (without
any other respect that he had to me, who was at that time a yonnge child
li^ing in Germany, under the power and discipline, of my Masters and
Governors, and he having no other respect but that I was his cousin german)
did, I say, appoint me his general heir, which thing also he did, according
to the power that he had, even by the laws and customs of the country: I
say that if I ought to yield thanks to any, it is to the memory of the
said Lord Prince, who being the eldest of our house, meant also, that as I
should succeed him in the order of age, so I should come in like sort to
succeed him in his goods and possessions. I perceive not then as yet, even to
this present time, that I am any thing at all bound for this succession, to
the house of Spain, neither is there any man in the world, that can say it
with ttueth.

But the Emperor gave a grant unto the said Lord Prince, by will to bequeath
it, The grant
to whom he should think good: and by the power of that grant the Prince
chose me for his heir. This (my Lords) makes very much for me, and can at no
hand serve mine enemies turn. For when the Emperor yielded to the grant, he
knew not who should be nominated heir by the Prince, neither was it known of
any man, until the day of the opening of the will, which was done in the
presence of Marie the Queen, after the death of the said Lord Prince: in so
much that the Emperor co^senting to the grant, seeing that his purpose was
not to advance me, I do not think my felse to be bound unto him, because
the favor which was showed unto the Prince (which notwithstanding every mean
person whatsoever, may easily obtain, by ordinary letters out of the
Chauncerie) was not showed on my behalf, or in respect of me. Besides, to
judge of the grant, by that which afterward insued thereupon, should be to
judge against the rules, which so oftentimes I have heard the Emperor repeat,
who said, that Counselles ought to be examined, liked or disliked, by the
causes and not by the effects. But let us put the case, that he had not had
the grant, yet nothing was appointed by the will of my Lord the Prince Rene,
but according to the laws, as has bin before said.

Testament military.
But what will they answer, when besides all these reasons, I shall say unto
them, that the testament or will of my Lord my cosen is a military testament
(which thing also they cannot gain say nor darken) yea, and that made, with
very great solemnity, ripe judgment, and in good season: made I say, and
grounded, by express terms and words, upon this, that the said Lord Prince
(who had before felt, what were the dangers of war, in so many expeditions
taken in hand for the Emperors service) was now on the way, to go to a war
so dangerous, and that with so great a Prince as King Frauncis was. And though
I be not a great Doctor in the laws, yet so it is, that I do very well
remember, that I have heard sundry learned persons disputing of this matter,
in the presence of my Lord my father, who affirmed, that not only military
testamentes or wills, but also little scrippes or scrolles, to be of such
value and force, according to the laws of the Empire, that if a man of war,
or a soldier, had before his death made or given the least mark of his will,
yea the least sign that a man can imagine or think of: as if he had but
traced or drawn with his blood upon his targett, his name whom he will
institute, ordain, and appoint, to be his heir: or with the print of his
halbert or of his sword, had written the same on the ground, that that decree
of his last will, is inviolable, and to be preferred before al other
ordinance, according to the ancient privileges of those, which are honored
with the warlike chain or collar. How much more then was this privilege, dew
to so valiant a Prince, and to so noble a Knight? For the question is not
here, of some one simple mark or other, but here is a testament or will well
and advisedly made, and that not in haste or by a simple soldier wounded, and
being ready to die, but by a virtuous Prince, and one worthy of immortal
honor, assisted by his counsel, and somewhat forward in his way toward the
expedition, and the things bequeathed not to a stranger, but to his cousin
german, and not to an importunate flatterer, but to a young child being
very far of from the Emperors army, which went to beseidge Saint Disier,
and purposed to do the same even to Paris. But here is an ordinance I say,
made not without the knowledge of the Emperor, but by his own grant, yea an
ordinance according to the laws and customs used in all places. This then
being so strong, it was not in man's power to reason against it, and much less
to make it void, unless by some one way or other, which should have bin over
tyrannons, and which (it may be) might have brought more hurt than profit, to
the renown and credit of the Emperor, specially if he had meant to offer any
other thing than reason. And as there have bin amongst my predecessors some,
who have in deed found means and ways, to cause unjust and ungrateful
persons, who kept their goods and possessions from them, to yield them the
same: so I hope, that God will yet show me this grace, to have a blessed issue
against him, who has unjustly spoiled me of my goods, and would barbarously
take from me my life also. But seeing that I am enforced, yet to speak of the
succession, I would feign have some tell me, whether the Emperor suffering me
to enjoy the succession, has given it me of his own or no: for if I have
received nothing from him, but that which before appertayned to my Lord the
Prince Rene, I perceive not how the King can in any manner vpbraide me, that
either he, or the Emperor his father, have given me any thing, unless this be
liberality, to give largely of an other man's goods.

But on the other side, albeit that at this present time, I say nothing of the
wrongs that have bin done me in the say de County, in which I have such
rights and preheminences, and whereof they have spoiled me, and whereof I
speak nothing at this time, leaving to debate and reason thereof, till arms
and weapons shall have yielded me more reason, than the injustice of him that
keeps all from me: this I must needs speak, I had no sooner taken hold of
the succes^ion of the Seignurie or Lordship of Chastel-bellin, The Lordship of
Chastel-bellin.
but I was even as soon spoiled thereof, which is of so small value, that at
this present there are due unto me, three hundred fifty thousand pounds of
arrerage, by reason thereof. And this is the heap of injustice that they
charge me with if I have done any. The Emperor was requested by my Lord my
father, that at the least I might, according to the laws, be first restored
unto the possession, in which my predecessor had bin, but he would not suffer
it: only he suffered me (being nothwithstanding spoiled) to follow my right by
justice and law, wherein he left me at the least, some gapp, because he did
not let me, from debating my right against him, when the cause was called forth
to the parliament of Malines. But the son (who notwithstanding dare vpbraide
me with his good turns) seeing the cause ready to receive judgment, the very
selfsame day that the process and controversy should have bin cleared, and
the advice of the President and Counselors was already registered, and I had
aduertissement given me, to seek and provide for silver for the Judges fees:
he I say, forbad his court to proceed any further, and left the process
hanging upon the hook or file, where it remains yet to this present. You
see (my Lords) that justice was well ministered by him which had sworn the
same to me, and to the Barons of this country. And these be the great
aduauntages and profits, that I have received from the house of Spain: this is
the foundation and groundworke of al their reproaches: and upon this is this
infamous frame or building of Proscription, stayed and settled.

But if on the other side, I should come largely to lay out, how much the
house of Spain is bound to my predecessors (for concerning my self I will as
yet say nothing) I am afraid to enter into so great a sea, which I can not
pass over in many months, wherefore I will touch only the principal
matters, leaving unto you my Lords and to the readers, the particular
searching and finding out of the said bounds, in the histories and ancient
records of this country.

He that of the house of Austriche, first came into the low countries, and
that a long time after that my predecessors held therein, both Counties and
Baronneis, was the Emperor Maximilian, then Archduke of Austriche. Now who
knows not, that the County Engelbert my great uncle, was he who maintained
and vphelde the said Emperor, My Lord Engelbert County of Nassau.
employing his goods, his life, and his wit, for the presetuation of him? Was
it not the County Engelbert, together with my Lord of Romont, that obtained
the victory of Guinegaste, having by his courage kept the footmen together,
when as the horsemen had broken the rank and order, by means whereof, the
great conquest of King Lewis the eleventh was stayed and let, which thing did
afterward, assure Maximilians state and condition? Was it not he, which upon
his return out of prison out of France, found Maximilian wonderfully
troubled in Flaunders, against my Lord of Rauestain, and those of Bruges, who
also prevailed so much by arms and by counsel, that a truce and conclusion was
made, who was once again the cause, to uphold and mainteyne the said
Archduke, and who in like sort caused the accord made with the inhabitaunts
of Bruges, to be mainteyned, whereof even yet at this day, there do remain
notable marks and tokens, both of his fidelity, and of the thankefulnes of
the inhabitaunts of Bruges? It is the very same Engelbert, that subdued those
that rebelled against him, about the borders of the Rhine, and established the
said Emperor quiet in his countries of Oultremeuze: that I may speak no more
of the dangerous voyages attempted for the said Emperor, as that voyage into
Brytan for the treaty of marriage between the said Lord Archduke, and the
Lady Anne heir of the Duchy, and afterward twice Queen of France, which
matter he so well followed, that all was agreed and further proceeding should
have bin made therein, saving that my Lord John. Prince of Orange, father of my
Lord Philibert, The said Cou^tie Lieu tenant general from the time of Duke
Charles.
dashed all, and procured the marriage of the said Ladies cousin german, with
Charles the French king. And the merits and valures of the said Lord County,
were in those countries so great, that he was made Lieutenau^t general through
out the low country.

The successor and heir of the said Lord County Engelbert, and of his
goods which he had in these countries, was my Lord the County John of
Nassau, My Lord Henry, Cou^tie of Nassau.
his brother, and my great uncle, and after his death, there succeeded him my
Lord the County Henry my uncle, the eldest son of the said Lord County
John, and his heir in the goods and possessions he had here in Brabant,
Luxenbourg, Hollande and Flaunders: and my Lord the County William my father,
was his heir, in the goods and possessions which he had in Germany.

No man can deny, that in his time there was any Lord in all these
countries, who labored more in the service of the Emperor Charles, than he.
And to the end, I be not ouerlong in reciting that which is so well known, I
will only in a word tell you, that it was he, that put the imperial crown
upon the Emperors head, having so earnestly followed this matter, even then,
when the Emperor, in respect of his young age, and by reason of his absence
(for he was in Spain) was not able to pursue the same, that he persuaded the
Princes Electours to prefer the Emperor before the French King, who
earnestly labored to obtain the said election. And as every one knows,
that this imperial crown was the bridge, which afterward made a passage to
the Emperor, to obtain so many conquestes: so none can deny, but that the
acknowledgement thereof, ought to be given to the said Lord County. But can
any man show me at this present, so much as one mark or note of recompense,
or one only good turn that our stock has received from the house of Spain?
Men may see in sundry places of these countries, pieces of ordinance, with
the arms of Hungary upon them, which the King of Hungary gave to my
predecessors, in testimony and remembrance of that their virtue and strength,
which they had employed and showed in their service against the Turks,
certain of which pieces were violently taken from me, and carried away by the
Duke of Alua, out of my house of Breda, when he played the tyrau^t in this
country, and yet some of them remain there to this day. Which thing I put
down to declare, that so long as these pieces shall last, so long also shall
the notes and marks of my ancestors virtue endure, and there shall remain
also, a notable testimony which the King of Hungary has given them. But, as
my predecessors have bin so noble, and by the grace of God, and the good
government of their things, were never yet poor: so they never yet demanded
any thing of the Princes of these countries, neither yet received any thing as
of free gift, and yet I am sure, that the imperial Crown at the least,
deserved some one recompense or other. I confess that the succession of
Challon, and of the Princedome of Orange, was a great increase unto our house,
but if we be bound to any for that, truly it is to the great King Frauncis, who
gave in marriage to the Lord mine uncle, the sister of my Lord the Prince
Phillibert, the daughter of my Lord the Prince John, who was nourished and
brought up with Queen Anne, the Grau^dmother of the said Lord King, and whose
Cousin the said Princes was. And thus you here see (my Lords) the honesty and
good behavior of this Monarche of France. The Emperor got and received his
crown by the pains and tranayles of my uncle: Frauncis the King (who knew
all, that the said Lord had done, for his Competitor, that is, for him that
sought to be Emperor as well as he) ceased not for all that, to give him this
Princess in marriage, who was not the supposed heir only, but the very heir
in deed of my Lord the Prince Philibert, the said King confessing, that he
ought not to be displeased with him, who had constantly followed that part
which he took upon him to follow: In so much that I may say of him, as the
Historiographers of his time said, that it was an assured testimony of a noble
and liberal heart in the Prince. And albeit, the Emperor had granted some
thing, to the memory of my Lord the Prince Rhene, The Prince Rhene.
and that (according to the last appointement) he had granted some
extraordinary privilege and benefit unto his will: should this I beseech you
be a sufficient recompense, yielded to so faithful and so excellent services as
he had performed, who was so valiant and so courageous a Prince, and had done
for him so many duties, having by force of arms, not only recovered for the
Emperor the damage of a battle lost, but also having again conquered for
him the Duchy of Gelderlande, and in fine he him self yielded up his spirit
at the Emperors feet, and that for his service?.

What shall I need to speak of Prince Philibert, who alone obtained for him
Lombardie, and the Kingdom of Naples, and with my Lord the Duke of Burbo^,
assured him of the state of Rome, and took the Pope for him as a prisoner: and
to be short, has given him a heap of all excellency and blessedness? And
yet now his son will come, reproching the remembrance of such Princes, and
will say, that the Emperor has executed justice to their successor and
cousin. Now if they of Nassan had not lived heretofore: if they of Ora^ge, had
not done so many deeds of arms, before that the King was borne, he would not
have put so many titles in the beginning of this Proscription, by which he does
falsely and slaunderouslie pronounce me a traiterous and wicked person, which
as yet never has fallen out, and I hope never shall fall out in any of my
race. But let them answer me, by whose commandment the Cardinal of
Graundvelle, impoisoned the last Maximilian the Emperor, whilst he was the
King of the Romans, I know what he told me concerning that matter, and that
afterward he was so afraid of the King and the Spaniardes, that he was
altogether fearful, to make profession of that religion, which he knew
notwithstanding to be the best.

He proceeds and says, that he has as it were in order of succession, An
objection touching the benefits and honors bestovved by the king of Spain
upon the said Lord Prince.
continued and increased more and more my state and countenance, having made
me of his order, afterward Lieutenau^t general in the government of
Hollande, Zeelande, Virecht, and Burgundy, of his counsel of Estate, and that
he has bestowed upon me sundry good turns and honors. As concerning
benefits, I can not at any hand confess it, unless a man will call the
great expenses that I have bin at, as well for the service of the Emperor, as
of the King, benefits. For they which lived at that time, and specially in
the Kings time, may well remember, how the Court always was greatly
accompanied, with the nobility of sundry and diverse nations, and for the most
part, with the nobility of Germany. Now, every one knows, that my house
lay always open, and that ordinarily I was to make the discharge and
defraying of all charges, bearing the expenses of the Court, with a very
little allowaunce and order, that was made on the Kings behalf. Every one
knows also, the great and excessive expenses, that I was of necessity to be
at in the voyage, in which both against my will, and likewise against sundry
protestations made to the Emperor, and also to the Queen of Hungary, I was
constrained, to carry the Crown of the Empire to Ferdinando the Emperor, and
hereunto I was the more unwilling, because it seemed not reasonable unto me,
that I should carry from my Masters head the crown, which in times past had
bin set thereupon by my predecessors. After this, I made the voyage into
France, wherein I was sent for one of the pledges, appointed for the
establishement and execution of the peace made at Chasteau in Cambresis, which
brought unto me also great expenses and extreme charge, in so much that I can
in these three points (unto which add also the charges that I was at, in the
last wars, and specially those at the town Philippe and Charlemont, where I
was general) verily assure you, that I spent more than fifteen hundred
thousand Floreins, and yet notwithstanding, the Chamber of account or
Exchequor, may easily assure men of this, that I never had so much as one
farthing, in recompense for these services: yea that being Lieutenaunt general
of the army, I did not receive for all charges, but three hundred Florins a
month, which was not sufficient to pay the sernaunts that pitched my tents:
yea also if the Queen of Hungary were yet alive, she could well remember, that
which she spoke unto me, when the Emperor (perceauing him self to be in the
greatest extremity that ever he was, partly by the power of Duke Maurice, and
of William the Lantzgraue, and partly by the powers of the French King) made
the peace of Passau, The peace of Passau.
with as great loss to our hou^se, which served him with our great loss and
charges, to preserve the Empire for him, as it had before obtained the same for
him. For, albeit in an open assembly of the Empire, the Emperor, being by the advice of the Electours set in his throne and Imperial seat, had judged, and
that by a definitive sentence, that we should have the County or Earldom of
Catzenellenboghen, with more than two millions of Florins for arrerage, he
made notwithstanding his peace with our loss, putting, by the agreement of
Passau, our adverse parties in the possession thereof without any recompense
given to us. Which thing I propou^de not at this present, to stir up again
any contention, seeing that our house has since that time, agreed, with the
most famous house of the Lantzgraues of Hessen, whose good kinsemen and
servants we are: but to the end we may make the whole world to understand,
the great benefits that we have received, from the house of Spain, and that
every one may know, who it is that by good right is to be taxed for
ingratitude and unkindness. And this (my Lords) is not the like first part
that they have showed us. For my Lord the Prince Rhene, being at that time the
eldest of our house, pursuing so courageously the war of Cleue land, the
Emperor promised him, that he would never conclude peace, with the Duke of
Cleue land, Peace made with my Lord the Duke of Cleue.
but upon condition, that he should leave unto us peaceably, the third part
of the Duchy of Iuilliers, which appertayned unto us, by the succession of my
Lord, the County John of Nassau my great uncle, and Margaret the Countess of
Iuilliers and of Marck: notwithstanding, perceauing him self to be the
Conqueror, he made peace with him as pleased him, forgetting that this
victory, was obtained to his hands, by the travail and valiantness, of my
said Lord and cousin.

The honors.
As concerning the honors, which he says he has done me, I will never deny,
as I have said heretofore, but that the Emperor did greatly honor me,
whilst he nourished me and made me of his Chamber, by the space of nine
years, and afterward in my two first wars, having appointed me and given
me charge over all his ordinance, in these countries. And albeit, that I was
not then one and twenty years old, yea though I were absent from the Court,
at my Lordship of Bueren, notwithstanding (the Duke of Sauoie attempting a
voyage) the Emperor him self chose me for general of the army, albeit that
the Lords of the Counsel, My lord the princemade general of the army at the
age of 21 years.
yea and the Queen her self, did present thereto sundry other persons, whose
capacity and understanding was very great, as my Lords the Counties of
Boussu, of Lalaing, Martin van Rossem, old Knights and Soldiers, and the
Cou^ties of Arenbergh, of Meghem, and of Egmont, who was twelve years elder
than I. All this notwithstanding, albeit that no man named me, (as afterward
they affirmed to the Emperor) by reason of my youth, yet so it was, that it
pleased the Emperor to choose me, for the reasons which then he declared, and
which the Queen of Hungary, enforcing me to take the charge upon me, caused
me afterward to understand, which also I like better for this present time
to conceal, than to declare, least I might seem, overmuch to praise, prise,
and esteem my self. I say yet more, that it pleased the Emperor (my Lords)
then to cause me to come from the camp, when he declared unto you, the will
and purpose that he had to put over his kingdoms, into the hands of his son
the King, and it pleased him yet further so much to honor me, that he would not
perform this solemn act in my absence, yea he presented him self amongst
you in your assembly, leaning upon me by reason of his infirmity, which thing
sundry at that time thought was a very great honor unto me. But be it so,
that since that time, the King had bestowed upon me some honors, yet I cannot
see, how after any sort he can prevail or get any thing thereby, seeing
that contrary to all right and reason, yea contrary to his own oath, he has
gone about to take them from me.

As concerning the order, if the Emperor and the College or company of the
Knights thereof, have given me their voice, I am no more bound to him
therefore, than to other Knights, seeing it was necessary for him to allow
of that, which the College approved, even as he him self knows, that we, in
the last assembly of the order, held in these countries, did, by plurality
of voices, without his advise, and against his will, choose sundry Knights of
the order, and caused them so to be received and accepted. But be it, that I
were indebted to him therefore, yet so far of is it, that he may reproach or
vpbraide me therewith, that on the other side, he him self is to be therefore
greatly charged. The privileges of the order.
He has sworn, and it is also contained in the points that concern the
order, that the Knights of the order, should be judged by their brethren, that
is, them of the same order. Verily, it was never in the power of Duke Philipp
surnamed the Good, to enforce my Lord John of Luxenbourg, to forsake the oath
which he had made, to the King of England, the said Lord of Luxenbourgh,
committing the determination of the matter in controversy between them, to
the College and company of the Knights of the orders. But the brethren,
which the King has appointed to my Lords, the Counties of Egmount and of
Horns, to the Marquis of Bergues and of Montignie, for their trial, were
porters, petiefoggers, and people of no account, by which also he has caused
me to be condemned, against all order and course of law, even as I have
heretofore protested, and have alleged the insufficiencies thereof, in the
presence of all Europe. In so much, that he him self having done against his
own oath, and against the orders and articles of the College or company, he
is at no hand to be heard, in such reproaches as these are, wherein there are
found the ingraued marks, of his own oath being violated and broken. And
beside, if I ought to yield thanks to any of the order, for the gouernementes
and other dignities that I have, it must be to the Emperor, whose mind it
was, and who had so decreed the same, before he would depart out of this
country, having before known the duties that I had performed, and my
faithfulness, namely in respect of my services yielded, in the government and
guiding of his army, wherein I have for witness, my Lord of Neuers, and the
late my Lord of Chastillo^ Admiral of France, who in deed made us afterward
to know, that he was our adverse party: all which notwitstanding, they gained
nothing (thanks be to God) upon me, but I builded in despite of their beards,
the town Philippe, and Charlemo^t, albeit that the plague, did very strongly
afflict our army.

As concerning the government of Burgu^die, I can certainly assure al me^,
that I have not received any thing, The government of Burgundy.
but that which my predecessors have at all times mainteyned, as appertayning
unto them by inheritance, and in deed my Lady Philibert of Luxenbourg (my
Lord the Prince Philibert her son being in Italy) caused the Estates of
Burgundy to assemble and meet, in the Town of Nozeroy. And because that some
thought it not meet and couenient, because my said town was upon one of the
Frontiers of the County of Burgundy, she answered, that she meant to
maintain the possession, of the Lords of the house of Challon, who were by
inheritance Governors of the County of Burgundy. But be it whatsoever it
be, the behauiours of the King toward me do sufficiently declare, that he can
not object unto me these honors, which against all rules of honor, he goes
about to take from me, together with my life and goods, having by violence
taken from me mine own Son, against all law, either of God or man, yea
against the privileges of the country, which he swear to observe at his glad
entrance into it.

As concerning the chardge and office of Counselor of Estate, Counselor of
the estate
I have sufficiently enough declared in my defense made heretofore, in the
year sixty seven, that the Cardinal and others practiced this matter, that I
might be called thereto, thinking thereby to cloak and cover them selves,
only with my authority before the people, and therefore I ought not to think
my self bound unto them for this, because, that in doing this they sought not
so much mine advantage, as their own profit. But if they be deceived of their
hope, they must attribute it, either to their own want of capacity, as not
being able wisely enough to order and direct their enterprises, or else (which
in deed is more true, for they did not want wit and understanding) that their
wickedness was grown so great, so apparaunt, and so palpable, that no man was
able to endure them, but that they were cast out of the country, as a venime
or poison, yea as a public plague.

Now, for as much as they have not only directed themselves against my
person, Of the last marriage of the said Lord Prince
accusing me of unthankfulness and unfaithfulness, but even as rage and madness
does equally byte the whole world, as well the innocent as he, whom men judge
culpable: so their petulancy, and disorder has bin so great, as that they
have desired, to touch and taint the honor of my wife, by the blame which
they suppose to lay upon my last marriage: I know not, whether I may judge
them more to be condemned in impudeucie, or in beastlines, whilst that these
skillful men, who boast them selves to be so good painters, know not as yet to
practice that lesson, which is so often said and repeated, by the meanest
scholars that be, that is, that he that prepares him self to speak evil of
an other man, ought to be exempted from all crime and fault. For this argues
great impudency and rashenesse, if men know their notable faults, and yet
will notwithstanding pass over their own thorns and thissels, as if they
were roses: or if they know them not, what beastlines and blockishnes does
this argue, not to perceive and see that, which every hour of a day offers
it self, to their eyes and sight? They see every day before them an incestuous
king, which is one only half degree, nigh unto Jupiter, the husband of Juno,
his own sister, and yet they dare reproach me, with a holy, an honest, and a
lawful marriage, made according to Gods word, and celebrated according to the
ordinances of the Church of God. And again I am here enforced to beseech you
(my Lords) not to think of me that, which as yet you have never seen in me,
to wit, that by their wicked speeches, I am moved, to lay open these
abominable biles, and to set before the eyes of all the world, the
benummednes and hardness of such consciences, as these men carry, but rather
that it would please you to impute it, to this rage and desperate madness of the
enemies of God, of the enemies of all Christendom, and your enemies
particularly, who are inflamed and set on fire against me, for no other reason,
but for this, that they know, the great care, diligence, and faithfulness, that
I have had for your preservation. He then, that has married his Neice, dare
reproach unto me my marriage, a marriage I say, very lawful and according to
Gods order. He I say, dare vpbraied me with my marriage, who (to the end he
might obtain such a marriage) has cruelly murdered his own wife, the
daughter and sister of the kings of France (as I understand they have in
France, The murder of the Queen of Spain.
informations and instructions concerning that matter) yea his lawful wife,
the mother of two daughters, the true heirs of Spain, as I doubt not, but
that the Crown of France (the which heretofore has given the Crown of
Castille, to a bastard of whom Philip is descended, dispossessing a tyrant
thereof, though he were lawfully borne thereto) shall have no less power, to
maintain and keep it for the true heirs, if God which is a just Judge, and
never suffers such wickednesses unpunished, do not take vengeance of it in
his life time, depriving him of his estate, which thing he has most rightly
deserved, although he had not committed any other fault but this incest,
accompanied with so abominable a murder. But you will say, he had a
dispensation for it. From whom? From the Pope of Rome, which is a god in earth.
Verily I believe that, for the God of heaven would never have consented
thereto. But what was the groundworke and foundation of this earthly, heavenly
dispensatio^? For soth this, that he must not leave so goodly a kingdom
without an heir: and mark wherefore there was added, to the former horrible
faults, a most cruel murder, the father unnaturally murdering his own
child and heir, The murder of the Prince of Spain.
to the end that by that means, the Pope might have a gapp open, to give a
dispensation, for so execrable an incest, abominable to God and men. If
therefore we say, that we do reiecte the government of such an incestuous
king, the slayer of his son, and the murderer of his wife, who can justly
accuse us therefore? How many Kings have there bin, which have bin banished
and driven out of their kingdoms, which had not committed such horrible
crimes? For as concerning Don Charles his son, was he not to be in all
likelihood, our Lord and Master? And though the father could allege against
his son a just cause of death, did not this matter belong unto us, who had so
great interest therein, rather to judge thereof, than to three or four Friars
and Inquisitors of Spain? But it may be, that he made conscience to leave him
for his heir, whom he knew to be borne in unlawful marriage, because that at
the time, that he seemed to marie the daughter of Portugale, the mother of Don
Charles, he was married to the Lady Isabella Osorius, The marriage of the K. of
spain with the Lady Isabel Osorius.
by whom also he had two or three children, whereof the first was named Don
Pedro, and the second son was named Don Bernardino: of which marriage Rigomes
the Prince of Yuoli, if he were living, could give a good and sufficient
testimony, for he was the procurer thereof, whereby also he obtained that
great credit, and so much goods in Spain, the which they do at this present,
unkindly suck and draw from his widow, as it were with a sponge. Now, if
he have so well behaved him self, in that supposed marriage, that marriage also
which he has made with the daughter of France, has not as yet bin more
happy. For beside the murder of the Queen his wife, it was also made noble,
by an adultery, excelling all other adulteries, that is, that he kept
ordinary and common household, with the Lady Eufrasia, The adultery with the
Lady Eufrasia.
who being become great with child by him, he enforced the Prince of Ascoli to
marie her, and at the end of a certain time, the poor Prince (as the
ministers of the Kings tyranny say) died for grief, because, that having to
strong an enemy, he was not able to remedy this, but that an other man's
bastard should be his heir. But they that speak more certainly of this
matter, affirm, that he received a morsel more easy to swallowe down, than
to digest. And yet he, who is decked with a crown of three such marriages,
being I say, him self three times such a husband, dare vpbraide and reproach
me with my marriage.

But suppose that he were not so defiled, and that we might count him for a
guiltles person, yet for all that I fear him not, as though he were able to
reproach me with any fault, and thanks be to God, I have not done any thing,
but very advisedly, and that by the counsel of sundry honorable, wise, and
discreet persons. Neither is it needful, that he should travail much in that
matter, wherein he has no interest, but to behold and see, and of which also
I am not bound, to yield him any account or reason. For as concerning my wife
that dead is, she was alied to Princes of very great credit, to wise and
honorable Princes, who I doubt not, but that they are fully satisfied in that
behalf, and if I would enter further into that discourse, I could easily make
it to appear unto him, that the most skilful of his doctors condemn the same.
As concerning the marriage, by which I am alied at this present, albeit that
they the son of the said County Ottho, married the Lady of Leck and of
Breda, from whom also, I am in the right male line descended, and that in the
fifth degree. May I therefore by any good right, be called a stranger? And
that I may say nothing at this present time, of the goods which I have in
Burgundy, where I have (thanks be to God) a very good portion, ^haie I
justly be counted a stranger? And I leave it to you (my Lords) to judge, who
know better our laws, than any people of the world, how our Ancestors
have used it, time out of mind, and whether the Lords of Rauestain, or
Luxenbourg, and of Saint Paul, of Neuers, of Estampes, and other Lords,
holding Counties and Baronneis in this country, were accounted for strangers,
and whether yet at this day, you account not as naturalles of the country all
those, which possess such Lordshippes, so that they will take part with these
countries: and have we not for that in deed an express law amongst us, as
well in Brabant as in other places? For, as concerning the title of the Duke of
Brabant, County of Flaunders and others, which he bears and braggeth of,
albeit I confess these dignities to be great, yet not withstanding, if he and
his Spaniards know it not, they must learn this, that the Barons of Brabant,
with the good towns and cities of the Country, have in deed (when the Dukes
of Brabant have so far forgotten them selves, that they have passed the
bounds of reason) very well taught them, what was the power of the Barons,
and generally of the Estates of the country of Brabant. Now it is manifest,
that I am descended from such Lords, as for sundry ages together, have
possessed the principal Baronneis and Lordshippes of Brabant, Flaunders,
Hollande, and Luxenbourg. But I hope, that my Lords the Estates, have so well
begun to declare unto him, how much he has failed in his duty: and also
that the said Lords will hereafter take him forth so good a lesson, that the
poor people of Sicilia, Calabria, Lombardie, Arragon, and Castille, will
learn by our example, that this tyrant ought not to be suffered on the earth:
yea that the poor people of Granata them selves, will know, how they ought
to handle such a tyrant, who in the time of the war with the Moors, caused
to be imprisoned, about an hundred merchants, inhabitauntes of Granata, all
of them being Christians, of which the least was worth, fifty thousand
Ducates, and afterward, by a hurly burly amongst the people, caused them to
be slain, putting into his coffers all the goods of those poor people. And
to be short, my Lords the Estates (God ayding them) will teach them, how such
must be handled, that will falsify their oaths made and given to so good a
people, at their joyful entrance.

But (my Lords) if I come to proceed further, and should begin largely to
lay out before you, the long time past, in which my predecessors, had not
only their beginning here, but were also Lords, and possessed great goods,
titles, and dignities in these countries, I might say unto you, that at the
time that his predecessors, were Counties of Habsbourg, and remained in
Switserlande, mine were long time before Lords of the Country of Gelderlande,
whereof yet at this present, there are remaining the arms of our house of
Nassau, for the arms of the Duke of Gelderland, and we have not (as it were)
passing by it, kept the said country in possession, but, after that my Lord
the County Ottho, had married the daughter and heir of the Voght or Regent of
Gelderlande (for so did men name at those days the Lords of Gelderlande)
which continued from the year 1039. until the year 1350. my predecessors
were the Lords, Counties, and Dukes of the Country of Ghelderlande, The
Counties of Nassau, were the Cou^ties and Dukes of Gelderland from the year
1039. to the year 1350.
as yet even to this day men may behold the monumentes and marks thereof.
And I assure my self, that so far of is it that he, that calls me a
stranger, can show such marks, that he had his original and beginning from
these countries, that on the other side, his raze in the said time, was
altogether unknown, in the said country.

And because that he imployeth him self, to make a false, foolish, and
ridiculous declaration, containing as he says, the progress and proceedings
of my enterprise, because that many amongst you, when these matters were
begun, were not of competent age to understand the same, or else because you
having not then intermedled in the public affairs, could not well see how
all things were directed and governed by the craft of the Cardinal and his
favorers, and by the counsel coming out of Spain, The inhabitants of the
low countries counted for the Spaniards subjects and sclaues.
which always meant to command this country, as it had done others, Spain
it self being in their opinion the head of our Lordshippes, and we their
subjects and sclaues, I will for these causes recite unto you, how al things
have bin governed, by these goodly heads and wise brains (who suppose that
the rest of the world are as beasts in respect of themselves) until they had
brought us within two fingers breadth of our destruction, and of a miserable
bondage, if God by his providence had not watched over us, and had not
delivered us from their cruel counsels and bloody hands. Nota.
And, as I have here need, I do once again beseech you (my Lords) of your
patience, to continue well and quietly to hear me, as you have already done,
and I doubt not, but that as many among you have seen the whole, or else some
part of my acts and behauiours, or else have understood it from their
fathers, and other good people, which have bin witnesses thereof: so having
heard me, ye will as easelie judge my words to be as true, as those of mine
enemy are false and shameless. I will not (my Lords) recite unto you any
thing of that, which I have seen in the Emperors time, not because I did not
perceive sundry matters set out and practiced by the Spaniardes, The natural
disposition of the Spaniards was al vvais cruel, but yet kept under for a
time, by the wisdom of Charles the Einperour.
which I approved not as good, and of which I did not sufficiently conceive,
that the disease in process of time, might grow so far, that in the end it
should be very necessary to use, a strong and powerful medicine, and to
purge the country, from these pernicious and hurtful Spanishe humors. But
because I was not able then, by reason of mine age and the little experience I
had, to know the deep malice of the Spaniardes and their adherentes, I could
hardly persuade my self, that we should be enforced to bring, a whot iron to
this cancker of Spain, or else to come so far, as to root it out. But after
that, together with my age, I began to be of a more settled and sound
judgment, I had in in deed a contrary opinion, and delivered the same to
sundry others, which never knew to think, that the rage and cruelty of the
Spaniardes, could proceed so far: for nothing fell out, by which I might
have very particular knowledge, of their cruel, covetous, and proud natural
disposition, but I certainly and assuredly looked for the same long time
before. I will therefore let pass that time, which comes not also at any
hand to be compared, in any manner of disorder and tyra^nie with that, which
has since fallen out in the time of the king his son, not that the
Spaniardes were then better, than they are at this present: for, amongst the
Indies and in other places, where they commanded absolutely, they yielded to
evident a proof, of their perverse, natural disposition, and tyrannous
affection and will. But their ambition and pride, was in some sort restrained,
by the good affection that the Emperor bare to the subjects of this country:
and because also, that these provinces were full of brave Lords, wise and
valiant men, savoring of their ancient nobility, (and would to God they had
children like unto them) which served in steed of a bridle against their
insolency, and of a countermure against their pride and rashness. I will then
come, to the time which insued, because also that he, who was the heir of the
goods, though not of the virtues of the Emperor, is he that comes to assault
me, after an order more than barbarous and tyrannical.

The Emperor of most noble memory, and the Queen Marie, seeing their
affairs and businesses so impaired by the means of a clean contrary issue,
of the wars of Germany (which fell out otherwise then the Pope and the
Spaniardes had promised to them selves) whilst that the French king, was
joined in league, with some of the chief Princes of Germany, The Emperor
discharges himself of his kingdoms and Lordships, and commits them to his
son.
his Majesty I say, was enforced to agree with his enemy, his affairs
standing in such condition, that despairing of his ability to keep his own
countries, he purposed to withdraw him self into Spain, and there to lead a
private life, after that he had veelded up all his kingdoms, Lands, and
Lordships, and had laid them upon the person of his son. And albeit, that
the King, because of the condition of his own estate, had need to uphold his
subjects, in good will and affection toward him, (of which thing also he had
most express commandment from his father) seeing, that of the means and
valor that they had, there did wholly depend, the sauegard of the country,
and the maintenance of his own honor: yet, whether it were by reason of the
nourishement which he had in Spain, or by the counsel of those, which then
did, and even to this time have possessed him, I know not, he has always
fostered in his heart, a mind to make you subject, to a certain simple and
absolute bondage, which they call, a full and whole obedience, depriving you
altogether, of your ancient privileges and liberties, that they may dispose
of yon, your wives, and your children, and handle you, as his officers have
done the poor Indians, or at the least as they do, the people of Calabria,
Sicilia, Naples, and Millaine, whilst they remember not, that these countries,
are not countries atcheiued by conquest, but come for the most part by they
way of patrimony, or else such as willingly gave up them selves unto his
predecessors, under good and lawful conditions. But it is likely that he did
it by the advice of such, as served the Emperor his father, and the King his
great uncle, in steed of a foundation, the better to rear up, the building of
the kingdoms and Lordshippes, to which we see, the house of Austriche has
atteined, it being at this day, without all controversy, the greatest, and the
mightiest of all Christendom. And this affection in him, was not but to much
made manifest, immediately after the departure of the Emperor, The Kings heart
alvvais enemy to these countries.
as if the Lords that then lived, did yet remain amongst us, they could
yield you sufficient testimony thereof. For even so soon as he was
constrained to enter into war with the French king, considering the power of
his enemy, ad also the wise aduertisements of the Emperor, if he had had but
one only spark of good and sincere affection, toward these countries, he
should at the least have maintained, his subjects in good devotion and
affection toward him. But in the midst of his great affairs (so disorderous
and unruly was the desire he had to play the tyrau^t) he gave forth a most
plain and most certain demonstration of his evil will. The Emperor, who (my
Lords) knew better, then any Prince or man of the world, the arrogant and
proud nature of the Spaniardes, and it may be also, the inclination of the
King his son, The Empesrors counsel given to the King his son.
and on the other side, the state of this country, and whatsoever might
destroy and preserve it, did seriously advertise his son, that if he kept his
pride of Spain, he should diligently foresee, that he were not the cause, of
the utter ruin and destruction of this estate, which could not long suffer and
endure, this same proud government, which the Spaniardes exercise in every
place where they can. And he gave him this exhortation, in the presence of the
late my Lord the County of Bossu, the father of him that last deceassed, and
in my presence also, and in the presence of sundry other Lords of his
chamber, of which some are yet at this day living. But neither the authority
and commandment of his father, nor the profit of his own affairs, nor
justice, nor his oath, (which yet notwithstanding does keep in the most
barbarous nations) were able in any thing, to moderate and restrain, the
natural disposition and affection that he had, to tyra^nise over us, but on
the other side, as though he had bin above all laws, privileges, and
liberties of the country, yea and above equity and justice it self, he has
broken all bonds, that he might outrage in all manner of unreconcilable hatred
and cruelty.

The aid called Noeuenale.
At the same time, you (my Lords) granted unto him the aid which was called
Nouenale, by means of which aid, and by the valiauntnes and wise government
of the Lords and nobles, of this our country, and of sundry brave Lords and
soldiers of Germany, his affairs were so well and so blessedly guided, that
after the winning of two battles, the taking of towns, and prisoners of
great calling, and that in great number also, he enforced his enemy, to accept
a peace, as unprofitable for the French king, as it was honorable and
profitable for the King of Spain.

And if it be lawefull for me to speak any thing of my self, if he have but
one drop or spark of gratitude and kindness in him, he can not deny, but
that I was one of the principal instruments and means, to cause him to come
to so excellent, and to so profitable a peace, having privately treated
thereof, with my Lords the Constable, Montmoranci, and the Marishall of Saint
Andrewe, at the instant request of the King, who assured me, that the greatest
service that I could perform unto him in this world, was to make a peace, and
that he purposed to have it whatsoever it cost him, because he meant to go into
Spain. But so far of was it, that either he or his counsel, consisting of
Spaniardes, and of certain other persons of this country (who always
continued in hatred against you, your liberty and the whole land) did take in
good part, either this so good an aid, or the happy execution that insued
thereof, that on the other side, they judged this succor and aid, to be a
fault of hie treason against his Majesty, and for the which you (and above all
other, the late my Lord of Lalaing) had incurred, by good right, the sentence
of punishment. The late L. of Lalaigne and all the Estates appointed to death
by the Spaniardes.
And why so? Because you (my Lords) would not agree to any thing, without the
assembly of the Estates general, and because you meant, to cut the talents of
these harpies and Rauenours of Barlemontes, and such like, when you decreed,
that the money should be distributed by your commissioners, according to the
conditions propounded unto them. Behold in deed two great faults, the one
for soth was, to demand a meeting and an assembly of the Estates. For in
as much, as it serves for a bridle and a bar unto tyranny, it is a crime, so
much the more hated of tyrau^ts (who are the deuourers of the people, and
enemies of their subjects, and of their own crown) as this noble assembly,
is loved, honored, and reverenced, of true Kings, true Princes, and such as
are the good fathers of the people, because it is in deed the true foundation
of an Estate, the assurance of the common wealth, and the only peace and
quietness of Princes. The other fault will never be pardoned, for these byters
of the people, living with the blood of poor people, have so long time made
account of their theeueries and sackings, that they suppose their spoils, to
be as good, and as an assured reuenewe (yet much more frutfull) as their
fields and gardens, and dissembling the true cause of the mischief, which
they hide from their Princes, they seek pretextes and cloakes in flattering of
them, and in lying unto them, to harden and to set on fire, their hearts
against their subjects. I have seen (my Lords) their doings, I have heard
their words, I have bin a witness of their advise, by which they adjudged all
you to death, making no more account of you, than of beasts, if they had had
power to have murdered you, as they do in the Indies, where they have
miserably put to death, more than twenty millions of people, and have made
desolate and waste, thirty times as much land in quantity and greatness, as
the low country is, with such horrible excesses and ryottes, that all the
barbarousnesses, cruelties, and tyrannies, which have ever bin committed, are
but sport, in respect of that, which has fallen out upon the poor Indians,
which thing, even by their own Bishops and Doctors, has bin left in
writing, and, to make the King without excuse before God and men, the history
thereof was dedicated unto him, by one of his own subjects, in whom there
remained, as it should seem, some small spark of justice. From that time then
(my Lords) I, and other Lords, and sundry of the best and wisest personages,
both of the nobility, and of the common people, thought it good, to cause (if
we could) the Spaniards to depart out of the country, thinking in deed,
that, albeit there were yet remaining some corrupt blood amongst us, as verily
we see, there is more remaining then were meet, which did proceed, from this
infected race, of the contagion of the fathers, who served at that time, the
ambition of the Spaniardes, and followed the Cardinals businesses, yet
notwithstanding, that the better number, and all the Lords of the greatest
credit and countenance, would be enemies to this Spanishe tyranny. But,
partly through other businesses, and partly, by reason of my voyage, and the
going of some other Lords into France, whether we were sent for hostages, as
also to be present at the French Kings daughters marriage, the business it
selse was interrupted, and the perfourmance thereof hindered. Now so far of
is it (my Lords) that I will deny a great part of that, which is set out
against me, that I account it on the other side, a great praise for me, and
will (it may so fall out) tell you more thereof, than mine enemies know, and
the more that they shall write against me, and give a testimony of their fury
and enuions heart against this country, the more will I rejoice herein, that it
has pleased God, to show me this grace, to be an ayder to cut of the course,
of this unmeasurable tyranny, and by that means also, to have bin an
assistaunt, to the manifestation and opening, of the true Religion.

They say, that from the time, that the King turned his foot, from these low
countries, I have, by sinister practices, sleightes and subulties, assayed to
get the good wills of the Malcontentes, and of such persons, as have bin
greatly indebted, haters of Justice, desirous of novelties, and specially of
those that were suspected to be of the religio. As concerning them that had the
knowledge of the religion, I confess, The love that the L. Prince has
alvvayes born, to the^ of the religion.
that I never hated them. For, seeing that from the cradell, I was nourished
therein, and that my Lord my father, had lived and died therein, having driven
out of his Lordshippes the abuses of the church: who is he, that will think it
strange, that, if this doctrine were after such sort engraven in my heart,
and had taken such deep root therein, it should come in good time, to bring
forth her fruits? For, seeing that I was so long time brought up, in the
Emperors chamber, and being of the age to bear arms, I was even then
presently inwrapped, with great charges in armies: for these reasons I say (and
considering the scarcity of good education that we had in respect of religion)
it was no marvel, though I had then in my head, the feats of Chivalry,
hunting, and other exercises, which young noble men use, rather than those
things, which concerned my salvation. And yet notwithstanding I confess, that
I have great occasion to praise God, that he has not suffered, this holy
seed to be choked, which he him self has sown in me, and I say moreover,
that I never liked, of these cruel executions, of fire, of sword, of
drownings, etc. which were at that time very common, against those of the
religion, as the scriuener or painter (for so he names him self) of this
infamous Proscription, calls them. Wherein, albeit he flatter, lie, and
slander altogether in other places, he has notwithstanding spoken very well
in this behalf, saying, those whom he condemns to be of the religion, as in
deed it only deserves this name by excellency, which thing also, the truth
it self has wrong from his own mouth, so great is the strength and power of
the same truth. But, when as I being in France, had understood by King
Henry his own mouth, that the Duke of Alua, sought and spoke of the means,
The counsel of the King of Spain and the Duke of Alua, to root out those of
the religion, communicated to the French king, and by the said L. King, to the
Lord Prince of Orange.
to root out all those, that were suspected to be of the religion, in France,
and in this Country, and through out all Christendom: and that the said Lord
King (who thought, that, as I was one of the Commissioners for the treaty of
peace, and had had speech with him of such great matters, so I was also of
that religion) had declared unto me, the ground of the counsel of the King of
Spain, and of the Duke of Alua, I, to the end I might not be, of less
estimation with his Majesty, as though he would hide any thing from me,
answered in such sort, that the said Lord King, was not deceived in his
judgment, which also gave him occasion, sufficiently enough to discourse unto
me so much, as that thereby I might understand, the ground of the purpose of
the Inquisitors. I confess, that I was at that time, in such sort moved with
pity and compassion, toward so many good people, as were appointed to
slaughter, and generally toward this whole country, to which I was so much
bound, and into which they meant to bring in an Inquisition worse and more
cruel, than that of Spain, yea that there were nets laid, to catch, even the
very noble men and the Lords of the country, as well as the common people,
insomuch that they whom the Spaniards and their adherentes, were not able to
supplant by any other way, might fall by this means into their hands, from
whence it was impossible to escape, because, that a man could behold nothing
else, but a very laberinth, whereby they might be condemned to the fire: I,
seeing I say these things, do confess, that from that time forward, I did
earnestly attempt to help to drive out of the country, this vermin of the
Spaniards, and I do not repent me, that I have done it, but judge rather, that
I, and my Lords my companions, which favored this so laudable an enterprise,
have done a deed worthy of immortal praise, The enterprise of the Lords, to
cause the Spaniardes to depart out of the country.
and which in deed had bin altogether accomplished, and we by that means had
achieved the vpheaped measure of honor, if, after their gripes, we had as
well shut the gate against them, so that they might never after have entered in
again upon us, as we have since found out and had the means to purge the
Country of them. And I say yet somewhat more unto you (my Lords) and I wish
that the whole counsel of Spain, yea that the whole world should understand
it, that if my brethren and companions of the order, and of the counsel of
Estate, had liked rather to join their counselles with mine, then to make so
good and cheap a market of their own lines, al of us would have employed, our
bodies and goods, that we might have hindered the Duke of Alua and the
Spaniardes, from entering again into the Country: and I am yet even at this
present content, that they should understand, that, as already one part of
the country, is scoured from this filth, insomuch that there is not therein
any remembrance thereof, except it be of their bones: so I will not cease, by
the power of God, and by the assistaunce of your favor, (which I hope will
never fail me,) to imploye all the power that I have, with you (my Lords) to
purge the whole country in general, from this vermin, and to cause them and
all their adherentes, to pass from hence over the Mou^taignes, there to
trouble their own Countries if they will, and to suffer us to live here, in
peace and quiet possession, of bodies, goods, and conscience. Wherefore they
are deceived very much, when they think, that I attempted this work, after
their departure out of this country. For I did it then, when I was in France,
even a hunting with the King, whilst they them selves were here, and I ceased
not, till that by the mean, of the late Lady of Sauoie, of most noble
memory, I had obtained leave, to come again into this country, upon my faith
and promise given, to return again to Reins, at the coronation of King
Frauncis the second, and being come hither, I provoked not banckeroutes, but
good and honorable people, and of the chief and most noble personages of the
country, in the name of the Estates to demand, that the Spaniardes might be
enforced to with draw them selves: which thing was at the last executed, and
the enemies may remember (if they will) who were those good, and honorable
personages, that brought them that most unpleasant message, who when they
shall show themselves, the adversaries shall know and confess, their
impudencies and slanders.

But as concerning that which they say, that I was the principal author of
the supplication presented and offered up, The request presented by the
Nobility.
I will in deed tell you (my Lords) the whole matter, that is, that having
once perceived, that the mischief was grown so far, that there was not now
any more question, of burning only the poor people, which suffered them
selves to be cast into the fire, but, that sundry of the best nobility, and
of the principal men among the people, murmured thereat: I fearing some
dangerous issue, as I had seen before mine eyes France it self to have
endured, a dangerous access of civil war, for the like occasion: and
doubting least we should be assailed in this country with the like disease,
which commonly has most dangerous accidents, and effects, more hard to
heal, than the disease it self, as alas we do over much see it at this day:
seeing I say, these things, in respect of the bond wherewith I was bound by
reason of my oath, and in respect of my duty toward the country, I besought
my Lords my brethren, and companions, the Knights and principal
Counselloures of the Estate, to assemble together at Hoochstraten, with purpose
to declare unto them, the apparaunt danger wherein the country was, to wit,
of falling into civil war, and that this was the true and only mean to
hinder it, that we, who by reason of our degrees and offices, had authority in
the Country, should take the matter into our hands, and so to use that
remedy, which we should find most agreeable, for the countries good, and
only to bring to pass, that the Cardinals creatures (who sought nothing,
but effusion of blood, bannishmentes, confiscation of goods, and to be short,
wounds and murders) should not deal therein, which had brought an assured
destruction to the country, but rather that those which thought it not meet,
that men should burn others according to their accustomed order, should not
want a guide, who might let and hinder him in his attempts. And albeit, I
showed them very many reasons, to cause them to condescende to my counsel, and
that I had added thereto (beside the good will which was between us) the advice also of my Lord the County of Schwartzenbourg my brother in law, and
the Lord George van Hol, who had at that time very great credit with the
Lords, for the evident and excellent services, which they had performed to
these countries: yet it was not in my power to obtain any thing, and this
mutual sight one of an other, did not profit me any whitt at all, saving for a
testimony to all the world, that then, seeing the mischief a far of, which
now we see present upon us, I did seek all the good means I could, to
prevent and turn away the same. But they of whom I have spoken, who thought
these persecutions heard, and who saw not so long as they endured, any assured
rest in this country (which thing always falls out in such like affairs)
began and labored to propounde and broche new enterprises, which, by reason
of the offices I had, I found out a mean to discover: yet for all that,
fearing least some most dangerous event might ensue thereupon, and supposing
that this way was the most mild, and very lawelike or lawful, I confess,
that I thought it not evil, that the request was presented, which thing so
far of is it, that I mind to dissemble, or coulor over, that I count it a
most great profit, both for mine own honor and reputation, and also for the
service of the King and the country, for if the wise Counselors of the King,
had bin so well advised as to yield thereunto, there had not insued so many
miseries, by which, there wants but a little, but that the whole country had
bin consumed. But if they desire to know, the true and the nighest cause of
the said request, and of that which followed therevppon, let them asscribe it
to their insatiable cruelty, which was not content, with the intolerable
rigor of placardes and licenses but following the example of that fool Roboam,
and believing the counsel of an unwise woman, of a Cardinal the Popes
creature, and other such like, they said, the father has corrected you with
rods, The Duchess of Parema, and the Cardinal Grandvelle, were the cause of
all the mischie fes in the low counstreis.
but the son will chastise you with scorpions. Whereupon there was set out, a
most earnest pursuit, concerning the receiving of the new Bishopps, (who were
set up but a little while before) that is to say, so many tormentours, to burn
the poor Christians, then were the privileges trodden under feet, and by
whom? Verily by a passionate woman, who was yet notwithstanding armed, with the
visar of a Kings power, and with the treason, periuries and subtelties of a
Cardinal. Behold I say, the stithie or andvile (my Lords) upon which was
forged all the evil that insued, to wit, because they yielded not, (as
requisite and necessary it was) to the request presented by the nobility,
wherein I know, and I may protest it, before God and before you (my Lords) that
I did not therein commit any thing against mine Honor, and mine oath, but I
advertised the Duchess, and all the Lords of the Counsel, of the great
inconveniences which afterward fell out, insomuch that all the, mischief
ensuing thereupon, must be imputed to them selves. For so far of is it, that
they would harke^ to me, that they thought on the other side that they had
found, a matter or mean fit for to execute that, which they had a long time
purposed and set before them, that is to say, that after that they had
destroyed them, that were suspected to be of the religion, they might
afterward the more easily bring the rest, under a miserable and intolerable
bondage. And not only were they admonished by me (my Lords) but also sundry,
public, and particular admonitions were given them by diverse others, both good
people and lovers of the country, yea and lovers of the King also more then he
deserved, and they did in good time advertise him, of the danger to come, and
what was the Kings duty, by reason of his oath, of his obligations or bonds,
and of the conditions upon which he was received and admitted for Lord of
these Countries, as also his ancestors were before him.

My Lord the Cou^tie of Egmond him self, was sent into Spain, to show the
said aduertisements, unto the Kings own person, which notwithstanding so far
of was it that it could profit any thing, that the said Lord County on the
other side being deceived, under the coulor of the word of a King (which
afterward cost him very dear) brought letters altogether contrary to that,
which the King from his own mouth, had given him in charge to speak, in
so much that then he was in-forced to confess, that I did before his journey
well foresee, that which should come thereof. And yet these scholars of
Machiauell, would here bleare our eyes, with these goodly shows of loyaultie,
fidelity, natural clemency, and such golden and glorious words, and yet
notwithstanding they make no difficulty, to play with the oaths which they
take, and with the words that they give, to men of such quality and
countenance. Behold then, the authors, promotors, and framers of the
troubles, that have fallen out by reason of the first request or supplication,
and you have understood (my Lords) that this was the counsel that I have
given therein.

Touching my lord the County Lu dovvick of Nassau.
As concerning that which they speak, of the late my Lord the County Lodowick
my brother, they should do better, to leave so good a Knight in peace and
unnamed, than to speak of him, seeing that he was much more honest then they,
and without comparison a better christian, and I make no more of this that they
call him Heretic, then our Lord Jesus Christ did, when as good people as
our enemies are, called him Samaritane.

As concerning public preaching, which after their manner they call heretical,
Of the public assemblies of the^ of the religion.
you your selves (my Lords) do sufficiently know, by whom and how they were
brought in. And albeit, that I had not at that time so much credit with them,
as that they would demand my advise therein, neither in deed did I ever
counsel them: Notwithstanding, the matters being come to such terms, I
confess that I was of advise, that the Duchess of Parma should yield unto
them, wherein if I have given ill counsel, then that which followed
afterward, does at the least sufficiently declare, whether those that
supposed my counsel to be naught, have very well handled their Masters
affairs and businesses, but rather God has manifestly showed, that albeit he
do for a time correct his own children, yet he never leaves, a perjury so
well qualified and notorious, as that of the Kings and the Duchess of Parmes
was, without greenouslie punishing it, to the end that all the world may know,
that he says not without cause, that he will not hold him guiltles, who
shall take his name in vain.

As concerning the beaters down of Images, and other dissorders, I believe (my
Lords) that there is none amongst you, Concerning Images beaten down and
overthrown.
but he knows well enough, that such ways and manners of doing, please me no
whit at all, and that many of them, who should have aided and sustained me,
have on the other side with great injury torn me in pieces, because I would
never consent, that such things should be done, without some ordinance and
decree of the Superiors and Governors.

They have no better foundation, then such as you have heard before, for this
that they say, that the providence and wise government, of the with dravving
of the Lord Prince into Germany.
of the Duchess of Parma was so great, that I was enforced to depart out of
the country. It may be, that they should say somewhat, if they would say,
that the deceites of the Duchess and her periuries, were the cause thereof:
or if they would speak, of the small resolution, and of the over great
easiness to believe that some had, who looked continually for the hangmen and
tormentours, and of the over great affection, that I am other great Lords had
toward the King, who persuaded my Lords of Berghes, and of Montignie to go
into Spain, supposing, that for their good services, and the nobility of
their race, the King him self would be content, to understand by their mouth,
that which was necessary for the preservation of the country, rather than to
hear it by the Spaniardes: but seeing that they were entreated in such sort,
as every one knows, I thought, that I had just occasion, more nighlie to take
heed unto my self, than before. If they would say these things were the cause,
they should speak some piece of the truth. But I was resolved ayeere before,
to depart and to give up my offices, as appears by letters written with the
Kings own hand, and which I have also joined to this present writing, which
does sufficiently set out, the falshode of their speech. And if any man would
know, why a year afterward I withdrewe my self into Germany, my defense
published int he year sixty seven, does sufficiently declare the causes
thereof, to wit, specially because I would not consent, that the Spanishe
Inquisition, should be received into my gouernementes. By reason whereof, I
resigned them before, into the hands of the said Duchess, with full purpose
to live in peace and quietness, with my kinsfolks and friends, looking when it
would please God, either to give the King better counsel, or, if he did yet
wax worse and worse, when it would please God him self to open a gate, to
deliver this poor country, which I saw plunged, into a bottomless depth, of
mischieues and miseries. For, who can without being wounded with wounderfull
grief, rehearse the banishementes, the taking away of goods, the
imprisonmentes, the torments endured, the sundry sorts of horrible and
miserable deaths, wherewith these bloody people, (surmounting in cruelty,
Phalaris, Busyris, Nero, Domitian, and all tyrauntes) have persecuted the poor
subjects of this country? And notwithstanding these things, I seeing no
mean, to comfort them over this misery, did hold my self peceable and
quiet. And, because in this Proscription they say, that I was at the least
offered it, The King of Spain enforced my Lord Prince, by all manner of
injustice, to take arms.
whilst that the last treaty held at Colen lasted: they ought to know, that
they should be contented with my voluntary banishment, and not to pursue me
any further, seeing in deed, that I gave them to understand, by a man of
countenance and credit, who yet is living, that if they attempted, to touch
mine hounour and my goods, they would constrain me, to take such order for my
affairs as I might. But, as madd people, after that they could not draw me by
their honied and flattering words, the King also thinking, to busy me by
over honest letters, The Cou^tie of Bueren, taken in the schools, and carried
into Spain, against the oath given and made, at the Kings gladsome entrau^ce,
and against the privileges of Brabant.
which yet notwithstanding I did plainly perceive to be full of deceit, they
directed themselves, first to my young son, a child and a scholar, and
against the privileges of the University, they took him violently from
Louain, yea, after the exhortation and declaration made by the University,
that barbarous fellow Vergas, answered barbarously in false latin: Non
curamus vestros priuilegios: we regard not your privileges. After this, they
carried him out of Brabant, against the privileges of the Country, and against
the Kings oath, and they sent him into Spain, that so they might remove him
from me, who am his father, and even unto this present, they keep this
innocent, in hard and cruel prison, insomuch as, if they had done me no other
injury, I should be unworthy, not only my stock and the name which I carry,
but also of the name of a father, unless I did imploye, all the wit, and all
the means that God has given me, to assaie to deliver him out of this
miserable bondage, and to recover if I could, such a wrong. For I am not (my
Lords) so unnatural, that I feel not the affections of a father, Nota.
neither yet so wise, but that oftentimes the grief, of so long an absence of
my Son, does present and offer it self to my understanding. And yet they
were not content, but, against all order of justice, they apprehended my
brethren, and pursued me with summoninges, seasementes of goods, and thrust me
on, even as it were by force, to attempt sundry things, The unjust
procedings, against the honor, the life, and the goods of the Lord Prince.
whereof I my self never thought: they put the process of me and my
companions (against the articles of the order, and against the oath of the
King, who was the chief thereof) into the hands of I know not what porters
and petiefoggers, who were not meet to be, grooms or pages, to my companions
and me: they do degrade me: they do deprive me of my goods: they do
condemn me to death. And is this any other thing, than to free me from mine
oaths? and to set me at liberty, to come out, to assault mine enemy, by all
the means that GOD shall give me? Behold then, how, when I seek nothing but
quietness, they stir up trouble, I seek peace, and they provoke me to
war. And what war? A war attempted to deliver my child, to preserve my
life, to recover my goods, and, which is more dear than all, to defend mine
Honor. And yet, I do not here propounde unto you (my Lords) any thing of
that, which concerns the common cause, and belongs unto the general State.
This then (my Lords) is that, which these men slightly pass over, and under
silence as it were, and which of set purpose they omit, as in deed not serving
much for their purpose. If then, I not being the Kings natural subject (which
thing also he him self says) if I being absolved from mine oaths, by this
unjust proclamation and sentence: If I having so just a grou^dworke, by force
to demand my son and my goods: If I say, I had driven him, not only out of
the low country, but also out of all his lands and Lordshippes, yea and
though I did desire to make them mine own, seeing that against all right and
equity, yea against his own oath, he has by force constrained me, to attempt
so necessary a war, even then, when with all my power I did avoid it, and
has done me all these outrages, and that at the very self same time, or a
little after, when by his own letters written with his own hand, he yielded
me so great, and solemn a testimony of faithfulness, as no man in the world
could desire a greater, as appears by the copy of the letter hereafter
inserted, who is he (the premises being rightly considered) that can accuse me
of any other fault, then this, that I framed my self to much to the time,
before that I would take arms, and that I would not enjoy that, which the
law of war, and of al nations yielded unto me, unto me I say, who am borne a
free Lord, and who have this Honor, to carry the name and title, of an
absolute Prince, albeit that my Princedome, be not of any great length or
largenes?

But, seeing that the special foundation, and groundworke is this, The
justifying of the taking of arms by my Lord the Prince.
that I have taken and borne arms against my Superior, I am likewise content,
to enter into this matter, where they shall find themselves to have as good
foundations, as in other places. And in the first place I would feign have them
to tell me, by what title King Philippe, the heir of the bastard Henry of
Castille, possesses the kingdom of Castille, and of Leon? For it is most
manifest, that Henry his predecessor was a bastard, who rebelled against the
lawefull heir, who was his own brother and Lord, whom also he slew with his
own hand. What right then or title had this bastard being the Kings great
Graundfather? They answer, that Don Pedro was a tyrant, and in deed I
confess, that commonly they give him the name of cruel. But if by this title
Philippe hold Castille, why does not he perceive, that men may by the same
measure, drive him out, that has chased away others? And if there have never
bin, any more cruel tyrant, who has more proudly, and with less
consideration violated, the privileges of the country, then Philipp him
self, shall not he be much more unworthy, to bear, and to wear the Crown
of Castille, then Don Pedro? For, at the least Don Pedro was not an incestuous
person, nor a slaier of his Son, nor a murderer of his wife. And if some
will say, that this concerns me no whit at all, I am content to come yet
somewhat more nigh, albeit that I have not purposed, to stay my self upon
that, which I shall presently speak unto you. But suppose, that I did take up
arms against him, and that he were simply my superior, and that I were borne
his subject (which yet is not so, even as he him self confesses it) what
should I do but that, which his predecessor had done, Albert Duke of Austriche
took arms against Adolfus of Nassau the Emperor.
against the Emperor Adolfus of Nassau, his Superior? Eurie one that knows
never so little in the matters and affairs of Germany, knows, how Albert
the first Duke of Austriche, of that name and race (for before he bare the
title, of the County of Habsbourg) armed him self against the said Lord
Emperor my predecessor. And albeit, it was Gods will, that the said Emperor
should die in the battle, yet I know, what the wisest writers have judged
thereof, albeit that Gerrard, then Bishop of Maience, the principal author of
that conspiracy, meant to color and darcken the same. And verily, if a man
will somewhat more nighly look into the story, he shall find, that this
faction was set up by Pope Boniface (of whom it is said, Pope Boniface the 8.
he entered into his Popedom as a Fox, he reigned as a Lion, and died as a
dog) because the Emperor would not acknowledge him for such a one, as he
said he was, and therefore, he stirred up against him Albert, who was already
much displeased against him, because Adolfus was preferred before him, in the
election to the Empire, and some Bishops also, overmuch addicted to the Pope,
did join them selves unto him, and aided him.

But who is he, that would willingly reverence so wicked a man, who in his
Jubilee, caused to be carried before him, in the manner of a triumph, two
swords, causing him, that carried one of them, to cry, O Christ behold thy
Vicar on earth, and the other, to say, O Peter, behold thy successor? And
verily, having committed so wicked a feate against the Emperor, and having
Albert at his commandment, he was purposed, for the like consideration, to do
as much to the French King, called Philipp the fair, giving his kingdom to
the said Albert, and caused him to be named King of the Romans and of the
French men. But he found the priests of France, less ready to serve him,
and less able to help him, and the whole kingdom stirred up, by the learned
Orations of Master Peter Coignieres, and a resolute King who caused his
foolehood (for so the King called him in his letters) to be taken at Anania, by
one of the Lords, King Philip the fair, be ginneth his letter with these
words Sciat fatuitas vestra, that is, let your folly or foolehood know
and he the eldest of the noble house of Colonnes, and by a gentleman of
Languedoc, named Nogaret, who brought him to Rome, where also they put him to
death, as he had most justly deserved the same. But, as I have said, I will
not stay my self upon these foundations, but mind to come to the mutual
bonds, which are between him and us. Let us the^ put the case, that all this,
were neither so nor so. Does not he very well know, that if he be Duke of
Brabant, I, by reason of my Baronneis, am one of the principal members of
Brabant? Does he not know wherein he is bound to me, my brethren and
companions, and the good towns of the country? Has he forgotten upon what
conditions he keeps this estate? The justifying of the taking of arms by the
Estates against Philip Duke of Brabant, and County of Flaunders.
Does he no longer remember his oath? O if he think upon it, does he so little
regard that which he has promised to God and the country, and that upon
conditions tied to his Dukes hatt or garland? It is not needful (my Lords)
that I should here set out unto you that, which he has promised us, before
that we took any oath unto him, for sundry amongst you know the same: But
because that others shall see, this my defense, I was very willing, to call to
your remembrance, the sum of his oath. You know (my Lords) whereunto he is
bound, and that it is not in his disposition, to do whatsoever he likes of, as
he does in the Indies, for he cannot here amongst us, by violence enforce, one
of his subjects only, The sum of the privileges of Brabant.
to any thing whatsoever, unless that the custom, of the benche of the
justices, where they dwell, permit the same. He may not, by any ordinance or
decree, alter or change, after any sort whatsoever, the estate of the
country. He must content him self, with his ordinary and common revenues:
he may not cause to be levied, nor yet exact any impositions or taxes, without
the good will, and express consent of the country, and according to the
privileges thereof: He can not bring soldiers into the Country, without the
consent thereof: He may not touch nor deal with the decrying or imbasing of
money, without the consent of the Estates of the Country: He can not cause
any subject to be apprehended, without information made, and knowledge first
given, by the Magistrate of the place: Having any for a prisoner, he cannot
send him out of the Country. I beseech you (my Lords) do you not see,
hearing only this su^me rehearsed, if the Barons and Nobles of the country,
who by reason of the prehemine^ces, and the charge of the armies, do not oppose
them selves, I say, not only when these articles are violated, but when they
are tyrannously trode^ under foot, and when not one article, but all, and that
not once, but a thousand thousand times, are broken and corrupted, not by the
Duke only, but by barbarous and savage people: Do you not see, I say, that if
the Nobles, according to their oath, and bond, do not enforce the Duke, to
yield equity and justice to the Country, that they them selves should be
condemned, of perjury, unfaithfulness, and rebellion against the Estates of
the Country? And as concerning my self, I have in deed a particular reason,
and which touches me yet more nighe, that is, that contrary unto all the
said privileges, I was deprived of all my goods, without observing any form
or order of justice therein. But that which fell out in the person of my Son,
the County of Bueren, is so evident a testimony, of the enemies disloyaultie
and unfaithfulness, and of the transgression or breach of the privileges, that
no man can, with any good reason doubt, why I have taken up arms.

And in that, I was not able at the first time, to take fast footing in the
country, which he vpbraideth me withal, what new thing has betithed unto
me, The first army of the L. Prince.
which has not fallen out unto the greatest Captains of the world? Yea, even
unto him him selse, who has so oftentimes entered, and that with so great and
mighty armies, into Holland and Zealand, and yet, with a handful of people,
and by the aid of my Lords the Estates, of the said provinces, he has bin
shamefully driven out of the said country, and that great Captain the Duke
of Alua and his successors, without having at this day, in the said countries,
one foot of land under his disposition, and government, as by your good
aid, I hope that shortly, he shall not have any in all the rest of the
country. To be short, by his oath he means, that in the case of
gainestanding him, we should be no longer bound unto him, neither yield him
any service or obedience, as appears by the last article. If then I be not
bound unto him: If I owe him not any more service or obedience, why is he so
rash, as to say, that I have taken up arms against my Lord? Certainly
between al Lords and Vassailes, there is a mutual bond, and this saying of a
certain Senator to a Consul, shall be always praised: If thou do not
account me for a Senator, I will not account thee for a Consul. But between
Vassals there is very great difference, some remaining without comparison in
far greater liberty, than other some, as we are in Brabant, having such
large privileges and rightes, that we may freely make and give, grau^ts in
our lands, so that, excepting the homage which we owe, we cannot have any
thing more than we have. And amongst other rightes and privileges we have
this, to stand our Dukes in that steed, that the Ephori at Sparta did their
Kings, that is to say, to keep the Kingdom sure, in the power of a good
Prince, and to cause him to yield equity, which stood against his oath.

But some will say, that there is a condition annexed, that is, that we shall be
so long freed from our oath, An objection.
till he have amended the fault. But what if he will never amend it? If after
the Emperor Maximilian, and the Princes of the Empire entreat him, and make
intercession for us, that it would please him to unburden the country: for a
full answer, some would say unto them, that they should meddle with their
own matters, and that the King knows well enough, how to govern his
subjects: If, after infinite declarations, by the message of very noble
Lords of this country, we do request him to do us justice, he proudly reject
our requests, and put to death the said Lords, and such as he can take,
causes them to pass through the hangmens hands, and pursue the rest, by all
unworthy and cruel means: If he bring in upon us new armies, utterly to
destroy us, shall we tarry always looking for mercy, until such time as the
Spanishe cruelty, shall have cut of from us all hope of respite? But he will
now amend the fault, and has sent means therefore, by the Lord of Selles:
also he has disallowed the Duke of Alua. We shall see al these things in
their order. For the present I am contented to declare, that by good reason I
have taken up arms against him: First, with the Estates of Hollande and
Zealande, and afterward with you (my Lords) that he is foresworne against
the whole country, and in respect of me, Nota.
against the articles of the poinctes of the order, against the privileges of
Brabant, in taking away my Son, and carrying him into Spain, depriving me of
my goods and dignities, having set me sufficiently free from mine oath
toward him, and declaring at this present, his very base heart, and yet
notwithstanding tyrannous, publishing this cruel and barbarous Proscription,
as the heap of all injustice and unworthiness.

Now (my Lords) since it has pleased him, to stretch out his speech unto the
times which followed, I mind verily to enter thereinto also, and that the more
willingly, because that I have done nothing of that, whereof hereafter he
accuses me: but first, by the advice and consent, of the Estates of Hollande
and Zealande, and afterward by your consent in general, so that if there
have bin any fault committed, it ought not to be imputed to me, but rather I
should be greatly praised, because I served you so well and faithfully. I will
then come, to the accusations that remain, but it shall be with this condion (my
Lords) that I may, as heretofore I have done, largely rehearse, and plainly
set out, that which he maliciously omitteth, to the end he might cover his
wicked and cruel heart, and yet nevertheless cease not, to cause it to be
published, by certain small slanderous libelles.

I have (my Lords) observed, that all this accusation, or ill speech rather,
which follows afterward, is divided into two parts: the one touching that,
which was joined with the coming of the Duke of Alua, and which followed
thereupon, and specially concerning that, which after my coming into Hollande
and Zealande, was executed, by my government, and my Lords the Estates of the
said Countries: The other, is that which has fallen out, since that God
opened your eyes, by the mean of the pride and outrages of the Spaniards, and
that you published them, and their adherents, for rebels and enemies to the
country, that so you might at the last deliver this poor country, from this
accursed raze. Wherefore I will follow the self same order. And first I render
thanks to God, that even by the very silence of mine enemy, you (my Lords)
do know, and I hope, that all the world shall know, that I was not so much
as suspected, The Lord Prince was not so much as suspected by his enemies, to
have touched or taken any of the common treasure.
to have applied to mine own profit, so much as one only penny, of the
public coin: for though in other things, as you have already begun to
see, they have not stuck at it, to set out false accusations, and to charge
me, with over manifest slanders: seeing also, that they do not object unto me,
the least suspicion of covetousness, they do sufficiently thereby declare, not
only, how free I am from that fault, but also, albeit they them selves be
impudent, and in very deed my deadly enemies, yet they durst never object
against me, this fault wherewith commonly, the Governors of Provinces, are
either wrongfully or rightly charged. But, I thank God, I have long time ago
learned, that he which governs and commands others, ought above all things
to have clean hands, and even void if it may be of all suspicion, which was
the cause, that even from my youth, I unburdened my self, of the charge of the
treasures, which was most gladly received and accepted of others. And albeit
(my Lords) that it was at no hand needful, that I should make mention of these
things, whilst I speak unto you, who know, that I never had the handling of
one only penny of the public treasure: and as concerning this, that it has
pleased you to appoint me so much, as well in respect of my Estate, as in
respect of the extraordinary charges of the war, you know how little I have
received thereof: and of the means, which yet I have, how I have therewithal
mainteyned and vpheld, sundry great charges, since that I entered into your
service: which I do notwithstanding not impute, to the want of your good will
toward me, but to the condition of the time wherein we live. But since, that by
the secret confession of mine enemy, I may have such an advantage, I mind
not to pass it over under silence, to the end I might cause, certain small
Serpents that are amongst us, to understand, that they ought to be ashamed,
to have spread abroad, either against their conscience, or else through a
certain extreme folly and madness, that which the very enemies: who have
conspired against me and the country, have as yet never bin so impudent, as to
object against me: perceauing in deed, that in propounding such a matter, the
brightness of the truth, would discover the filthiness of their life.

Seeing then, that they place me in so goodly a field, as to declare not what
I have done, but what the Estates of Holland and Zealande have done, by my aid
and service, I refuse not, even before you my Lords, and before all the men in
the world, to enter into account with them: but also, since that you are the
chiefest Judges, of that which is done in this Country, it is more than
reasonable, that you should regard that, which they have unjustly performed,
in all the other Provinces, whilst that my Lords the Estates of Hollande,
Zealande, and I, did stand in steed of stays and hinderaunces, unto the
course of their enterprises and attemptes.

First they say, That I practiced to return, into Hollande and Zealande.
Though it were so, what other thing did I, but that which my duty required?
And if I did enter upon so good a foundation, The causes which moved the lord
Prince, to come into Holland.
as I have heretofore laid out, into the Country with an army, why should I
have made any stay, to enter into that, which was of mine own government,
and whereunto I was more sworn and bound, and wherein I hold the chiefest
degrees of Honor, amongst the Nobility? But so far of was I, from
attempting such matters, that on the other side, I am ready to show the
letters both of the principal Governors of the towns, and of the principal
towns themselves, by the which I was called, for the deliverance of the
country, against the tyranny of the Spaniardes, and namely of the Duke of
Alua. And as concerning the promises that I made, at my entrance thereinto,
and namely that they say, that I promised the said Estates to maintain them,
if the Duke of Alua would press them, with the tenth and twentieth penny,
shall never be found true, but this rather, that I came the second time,
openly and in arms into the country, that I might deliver it, from that
tyranny, which then oppressed them, not only in respect of the tenth penny,
but, for a thousand other sorts of more than barbarous cruelty, and
specially, for the great slaughter, that the Duke of Alua the^ made, of the
poor inhabitauntes of the said countries. And as concerning that, that they
say, that the ecclesiastical Romanistes, were persecuted by me and driven from
their goods, and an other religion brought in, I need my Lords for this no
other defense, but that which you your selves know thereof, to wit, that the
whole change, which insued thereupon, was rather a work of God, then of men.
You know, how often I have bin accused, that I did over coldly set my self
against the adversaries: that I did suffer them to much: and that I should be
the cause of the ruin of the country, because I was over slow to chase them
away, and to root them out. And, when the question was, to send some of them
packing, you know the duties that I performed, to the end that every one
might live in peace, and one of them with an other. But the Estates, which at
the first, thought it fit and profitable, for the preservation of the country,
that both the one and the other religion should be tolerated: learned
afterward, by the insolences, attemptes, and treasons, of the enemies which
were mingled amongst us, that their Estate was in danger, of an vnavoydeable
ruin, unless they hindered the exercise of the Roman religion: and they
perceived, that those that made profession thereof, at the least the priests,
had taken an oath to the Pope, (as they do in every place where they come)
which they preferred before the oath, they had made to the country: insomuch,
that in the assembly of the Estates at Leyden, as also in the league of the
countries of Holland and Zealande, this article was with one consent agreed
upon, The causes wherefore some of the Romish Church, vvithdrevv them selves
out of Hollande.
neither could the enemies be ignorant of these things, seeing that in the
treaty held at Breda, about the question of religion (the enemies there
propounding this, on their own behalf, that that change fell out, by the
guiding of certain particular persons) there was showed unto them, the consent
of all the towns under their several seals. And now I beseech you, what
bond could there remain unto me, seeing that they, unto whom I had made a
promise, The establishme^t of one only religion in Hollande and Zealand, and
wherefore it was so done.
did not only discharge me thereof: but they them selves also, did cut it in
sunder, break it, and made it of no force? And notwithsta^sding, I will leave
it to the judgment of the wise, whether therein I have done well or evil.
This only I say, that when such things were propounded, I desired them, that
they would not proceed so far, and therefore much more, when they did
execute and perform the same: whereof not only my Lords of Hollande and
Zealande, but also, certain troublesome, and waieward persons, amongst us
(who also have spread abroad against me in strange countries, their wicked
speeches) will give me so good a testimony, that I hope I shall not need any
great defense, against such accusations, which being by me denied as false (for
so they are in deed) I fear not that they shall be able to yield any proof
thereof: leaving it to you (my Lords) to judge, how foolish such an
accusation is, which may be beaten back, with a simple denial, and yet
notwithstanding the greatest part of the goodly colors, wherewith this
painter boasts that he has set me out, may be quite and clean defaced, with
such a sponge only. If they will allege, that yet notwithstanding they, that
were driven out, have just occasion to complain, because that promise was not
kept with them: I answer, that albeit this is not directed against me, yet
notwithstanding, for the defense of the Estates of Hollande and Zealande, I
will say this much, that this complaint, should have but a very ill
foundation, because it is not reasonable, that any such people should enjoy a
privilege, by means of which they would deliver the country into the enemies
hands. Their purpose was, to betraie the lives, and the goods of the
subjects, and not one or two or three privileges only, but all the
fraunchises and liberties, preserved time out of mind, and from age to age, by
our predecessors and ancestors.

They add withal, That I have procured liberty of conscience. If they
understand thereby, that I have made an open way to such impieties, as are
commonly committed in the house of the Prince of Parme, where Atheistrie, and
other virtues of Rome, are counted but sport: I answer, that it is amongst
the heirs of the Lord Peter Lewis, where a man must seek and find such
liberty, or rather unbridled license. But I will in deed confess, that the
brightness of the fires, wherein they have tormented so many poor christians,
was never deliteful or pleasant to mine eyes, as it has reioysed the sight of
the Duke of Alua and the Spaniardes: and that I have always bin of this mind,
to wish and procure what I could, that the persecutions might cease, in the
low Countries. I will moreover confess unto you, to the end, that the
enemies may know, that they have to do with one, that speaks roundly and
without any painting, to wit, that the King, when he departed out of
Zealande, (which was the last place that he left in this Country) commanded
me, to put to death, many godly and virtuous people that were suspected to be
of the Religion. Which thing I would not perform, but advertised them them
selves thereof, knowing in deed, that I could not do it with a good and safe
conscience, and that I was rather to obey GOD, than man. Let the Spaniardes
then speak, what they them selves shall think good, I know that sundry
peoples and nations, which are much better then they, who also have learned,
that by fire and sword, men little or nothing prevail, would praise me, and
approve my fact.

But seeing that you (my Lords) together with the general consent of the
people, have since that time approved it, in condemning the rigor, of the
placardes and licenses, and in causing those cruel executions to cease, I do
no whit at all regard that, which the Spaniardes and their adherentes, do
murmr and whisper, concerning the same. Neither can I sufficiently wonder at
their folly, They that ill entreated the priests, were punished.
when they are not ashamed to object unto me, the murtheringes of the people of
their Church, seeing, that not only they know my natural disposition, to be
altogether estraunged from such violences: but also that you and the whole
world, do very well know, that by commandment and appointement, some, in
respect of such outrages, as these men would charge me withal, were put to
death: and other some, being of great note and noble houses, were arrested, by
the principal servants of my household, and after that they had bin kept
prisoners a long time, they were not delivered, but in respect of the house,
from whence they had this honor, to proceed and come: the long imprisonment
of their persons being appointed unto them, for the punishment which they had
deserved. But that which was done by my charge and appointement, is in such
sort known to all the world, that they are not able, either to disguise or
darken the same, only (as they have very well learned to speak truth) that
which I have done virtuously, they say, that I have feigned, that the thing
did displease me. But who has told them that I feigned? Or who is he that
has revealed unto them so much of my secreates? They see that which I have
done, they can not judge my heart, neither is there any man so malicious,
(except it be the forger of this writing, or some Spaniarde) which ought not
rather to give judgment upon that which he sees, than upon that, which he
malitiouslie and wickedlie suspecteth.

The cast also infinite blames and slanders, upon our religion, and they call
us heretics. But it is such as a long time since, they took upon them to
prove it, and yet were never able to bring it to purpose or effect. And I say,
that these injuries (being like unto the words of women, provoked and chafed
with collor) do not deserve any answer, much less that beastliness, to
say, that I never trusted any either Priest or Friar, unless he were married,
and that I enforced them to marie. For, who is it that knows not, that
without choice or discretion, they cast at my head, every thing that they find
in the way, so great is their fury, and their passion so outrageous and
unmeasurable? And albeit that these things were true, Concerning the marriage of
Priests.
as in deed they are not, neither yet reasonable (for we learn by our
Religion, that marriage ought to be free, and should not be either enforced or
forbidden) yet so it is, that this fault should not be comparable, with that
tyranny over consciences, which has forbidden marriage to a great part of
Christendom, against which forbidding, nor only the East churches opposed
them selves, but also the churches of Germany and France.

But that (my Lords) which is greatly to be esteemed in this Proscription, so
true and well grounded, is this, That the King commanded not the Duke of Alua,
to impose the tenth and twentieth penny, without the consent of the people. If
the^ the Duke of Alua, in a matter of so great importance, and which was the
cause of the death and destruction, of so many thousands of men, has passed
his commission, what punishment followed thereof? The Duke of Alua, for having
performed to his own son this duty, to wit, that he might marie his
cousin, leaving another, whom under the color of marriage accomplished, he had
abused, (even as Rigomes had before performed for the King, as before has bin
declared) was cast into prison, and put out of favor, and should not as yet
have bin delivered, if in all Spain they had bin able to have found a
tyrant, Concerning the tenth and tvventith penny.
more fit to exercise tyranny upon the poor Portugales then he. He was then
chastised for a small fault, and for such a great one, he was honored, much
made of, and filled with rewards: And he that would press the King, with the
death of my Lords of Egmount and of Horns, he would say as much, and
disallowe again the Duke of Alua for it. Is not this a good mean think ye,
to discharge him self of all faults? But let them take which part they will,
either the King commanded it, and then he can not avoid the name of a
tyrant, or else he commanded it not, and yet for all that the name of a
tyrant shall remain unto him, because he did not chastise and correct him,
who of his own private authority, had usurped such a tyranny, upon a franck
and free people, whereby it appears, that he is culpable thereof. And albeit,
that I have always esteemed the Duke of Alua, for the enemy of the Country,
and as one who has willingly bathed him self in our blood, and in the blood
of all Christians, carrying closely a Turkishe heart within him: yet so it is,
that I have known him to well, and have bin to to much practiced to believe
this, that he should be so sottishe, and so presumptuous, as to dare to
attempt, to lay upon the people an imposition of such consequence, and to
pursue it so long time, and that by such extraordinary, yea and altogether
insupportable means to the country, without good and sufficient commandment
directed unto him therefore, and that not once only, but sundry times. I
beseech you (my Lords) to weye this well, whether he, that in his own proper
and private name, durst condemn, or favor them that did condemn, the
Burgmaster of Amstelredam, in five and twenty thousand Florins of amercement,
because he set him self against the tenth penny, was not well assured, and
had not sufficient discharge for the same from his Superior? Neither need we
(my Lords) any other place then this, whereby to know, the frauds,
dissimulations and crafts, wherewith the King, has so long a time, led and
deceived us, and yet purposes still to do, if we suffer him to wound us, with
the prick of his tongue, or to astonishe us, with the threatenings of his
armies. And because, he will have the brute thereof, sounded abroad, by reason
of the Towns taken, and surprised in Hollande, to wit, within this two,
three, or four veeres, and that with more force then he has fought against
the Turk withal: I answer him, that, having the advantages whereof he
braggeth, he ought to consider, whether this tend not to his very great shame,
that he is altogether driven out of that Country. And it stands him not in
any steed, to allege, the mutiny of the Spaniardes. For a Governor, and
specially such a one as had such great means as he had, does sufficiently
bewraie his insufficiency and unworthiness to command, when he is not able
by such means, to keep in obedience his own Soldiers: on the other side, in
excusing him self so foolishlie, he sees whether he will or no, that he is
enforced to confess, that I, and my Lords of Hollande and Zealande, having
very slender means, as namely but four or five thousand men, have broken
his attemptes, and caused him to consume three score thousand. And whilst (my
Lords) he thus in this country lost his time, his men, and his money, he lost
likewise within two months, the Kingdom of Tunis, and the Goulette, The
shameful lostes of the kingdom of Thunis and the Goulette.
with the greatest shame and confusion, that ever any mighty Prince did, yea
though he were driven out of his own land, albeit some would lay the fault
hereof, upon the youth of Don John, and upon the whoredom of the Cardinal.
For whilst he did so ill imploye his forces here amongst us, Sinam Basscha,
took from him that Kingdom, and that fortress, which men supposed could
never have bin taken: and this he did in the sight of Spain and of Sicilia,
without that ever any of the Kings side, durst so much as show his head, to
fight against him, or only to turn him aside. And yet, if he had no regard
to the good of Christendom (which in deed he never had, as witnesses the
painted league that he made, which also cost the Venetians so much) nor respect
to his own honor, at the least, the memory and name of the Emperor his
father, (who did little or nothing regard, all his notable deeds and feats
of arms, in respect of that conquest) ought to have moved and thrust him
forward, with a noble and earnest desire, wisely to have mainteyned that,
which the Emperor his father had so valiauntly conquered for him and all
Christendom. But the rage and fury to destroy us, which carried him away,
took both his eyes from him, that he could not see that evil, and his
understanding also that he could not discern it, he loving overmuch to make
proof, rather of his weakness against his own proper people, then of his
forces, against the common and universal enemy of Christendom.

This (my Lords) is that which he obiecteth against me, and which also fell
out, before our general conjunction, and joining together. Whereunto (it may
be) it was not altogether necessary to answer, saving that it is requisite,
not only to satisfy you, but also to stop their mouths, and to make all
the world to understand their impudencies and slanders. For, if the question
were, but of that which concerns your selves, and those which heretofore
were on our side, who have notwithstanding, very euelly and without any cause,
withdrawn them selves from us: you, and those with you, have heretofore
sufficiently declared, that you had a far better opinion of me. For first,
the accord treated of by you, with me and my Lords of Hollande and Zealande,
at Gaunt, has sufficiently justified me, seeing that if you had supposed me
to be such a one, as this infamous Proscription describes me, you neither
would nor could have entered into treaty with me: beside, so many honorable
embassages, as you since that time have sent unto me, to S. Gheertrudenberghe,
and even yet to Antwerp, both to cause me to come into Brabant, and to cause me
to come unto you to Bruxelles, that I might be assistaunt with you in Counsel:
and also, that ye did honor me with the title of Lieutenaunt general: All
these things I say, do sufficiently declare, what is the opinion and
judgment that ye have had, of all these false and friuoulous accusations,
which thing alone, I suppose, to be over sufficient and strong to confute them.

But let us now see, how before that time, they on their behalfes governed
themselves, with what pride, insolency, and disdain of our whole nation. I
will not repeat, the periuries and deceites of the Duchess, nor of the King,
in the behalf of my Lords the Counties of Egmount and of Horn, nor the
baits and allurementes, which they prepared for me, nor yet generally that
which fell out before the coming of the Duke of Alua, but that only which was
done afterward, until the time of our general conjunction and joining
together, to the end, that as the remembrance of the mischiefs and griefs
past, shall bring unto you pleasure and contentement, and the same (as I hope)
unto me, who with some delight have aided you therein: so that by the same you
will more and more strengthen your selves, in this resolution, which is both
holy, and worthy of immortal praise, and which you also have taken upon you,
that is, to oppose and set your selves against the Spaniardes and their
adherentes. Now, as well the said Duke of Alua, as those that commanded
under him and after him, have sufficiently made us to understand, what was at
all times the counsel of Spain, to wit, to root us out, and to bring us into
bondage. For, as Hanniball, even when he was but nine years old did swear,
by the altar of his gods, that he would be al his life long, an enemy to the
Romans: so was this Duke of Alua, from his childhood nourished, and brought
up, in an unreconcilable hatred against this country, The insupportable pride
of the Duke of Alua, and other officers being Spaniardes.
which, by so much blood as he has spilt, could as yet never be satisfied, but
so much the more has he caused it to run out on every side, in all the
Towns of this Country, yea so far forth, that he has caused to be put to
death (which thing also he him self bragged of) eightene thousand poor
innocent men and more, and that by the hands of the hangman or tormentor, and
yet for all that, that cruel lust of his, could never be satisfied. So that if
any would know, what are the privy counsels of Spain: what is the Kings
good will, and how much he loves us, he shall find it all deciphered and set
out, in the bloody deeds of the Duke of Alua, as if it were set out before
his eyes, and lively painted in a table of painters work. For there has not
bin any kind of dissimulation, treason, and unfaithfulness, which he has not
used, that he might bring under his subjection and service, the principal
Lords of this Country, and that by offers, promises, and new titles of
Honor, bestowed upon them. But, the good and virtuous people, that he could
get into his hands, he has cruelly put to death, without any respect, either
to their innocence, or to the privileges of the country, and yet nothing was
done, but by the Kings commandment. He committed the like, against the
Citezens and good Merchants, so proudly treding under feet, our ancient
liberties and freedoms, yea every thing, that was remaining amongst us of the
glory of our ancestors, that it seemed that he thought, that you were at no
hand worthy to be reckoned, in the number of men. And where is it, that we
can have a more certain and plain proof, and that so open, that it is (as it
were) in the sight and beholding of all Christendom, concerning this matter,
the profane and proud erection, of the Duke of Alua his image, in the midst of
the late Citadel at Antwerp
and withal, of his unsupportable contempt and disdain of all these
countries, then in that proud, ambitious, profane, heathnishe, and withal
foolish setting up of his own Image, in the midst of the Cittadell at
Antwerpe, going impudently upon the bellies of the Noble men, of the Estates,
and of all the people of this country? Was not this think you, a notable
monument of his tyranny, and a testimony of his pride? What shall I need to
speak of his servants, and of all that vermin that came out of Spain, who
spoke of us, not as it were of Villacos (as they use to say) or villains, but
even as it were of brute beasts? You (my Lords) have even as yet your ears,
altogether beaten with such matters, and you are able to set out their
gestures, their proceedinges, their words full of boldness, of pride, and of
contempt: also their unsupportable acts, and how when they were within your
towns, with what pride and insolency they did command you. Wherefore, if
that be true which wise men report, that, for the understanding of the natural
disposition of a Lord or Noble man, men must examine him by his friends and
familiars: and for the knowledge of a master, men must sift his servants:
you may (my Lords) by the virtues of the Duke of Alua, his masters principal
officer, and the executor of all his counsels, easily judge, what good
affection and will, the King bears you, who sent him to you, to torment you:
and also ye may know what ye ought to look for, unless ye provide for it
in time, (as in deed ye ought) which thing also, all the good people of this
land look for at your hands.

I will speak nothing, of the rauishings, raunsomes, and exactions committed
by the Spaniardes, I will only stay my self upon the principal point. Ye
could never yet tell, how to obtain a free assembly, The assembly of the
Estates general, ever refused.
of the Estates general, your enemy very well knowing, that, to hinder the
calling together and meeting of them, was in deed to cut of by the foot, the
tree of your privileges, and utterly to dry up the spring of your liberty.
For, to what end serves it the people, to have privileges in fair
parchement, kept up in a cofer, if by the mean of the Estates, those
privileges be not maintained, and so men feel the effects thereof? And in
deed long time before, the King him self had received a dispensation from the
Pope, The King takes a dispensation from the Pope, for his oath made at his
gladsome entrance.
for the oath which he had made unto you, to keep your privileges. Wherein he
did not only violate and break his faith: but also did over easily, yea very
hurtfully believe, foolish counselors, whereby he to to manifestly declared,
how great his own wisdom was. For, might he not very well understand,
that, counting him self free from the oath, which he had made to you, you also
were freed and quitt from your oath toward him? In so much, that he, minding
to be unburdened of his oath toward you, you ought not unto him, any
obedience and subjection. That I may at this time say nothing, but leave it
unto others more exercised in such matters than I, to handle this question,
whether the Pope may justly vaunt, that he has any such power and
authority, yea or no: and whether any thing in the world, shall remain
certain and sure, if oaths so solemnly made, may, under such a pretext and
cloak, be violated and broken. At the same time, marriages made out of the
country, were wholly forbidden, and that which was never practiced, was
prohibited, to wit, that youth might not go out of the country, to study in
any other school of the world, but in that at Rome: and condemning by that
means, all other schools (which is an over great arrogancy) they did
condemn (so unwary they were) even those of the Jesuits, The schools of all
the world forbidden, save that of Rome only
without thinking any whit of them: and so (which is in deed the worst) they
opened a way, to very barbarousnes. For, as the meetinges together of all
maneer of learned men, has brought forth unto us in this Country, sundry
persons well qualified, who have greatly innobled these Provinces: so this
interdiction and forbidding, could not but in process of time cause, a more
than Turkishe ignorance, that I may say nothing of this, that by that
means, they would make this Country subject, The publishing of the council
of Trent.
to such conditions as never were heard of. About the same time, the Council
of Trente was published, which Council has seemed, even to the Frenchmen them
selves, so unjust, that even unto this day, it could not as yet be published,
in the kingdom of France.

A little while before this time, there was egerlie pursued, and at the last
obtained, the installing of the new Bishops, which had bin so long time
before debated, Bishops newly made.
by reason of the inconveniences, which all wise people, and lovers of the
Country, and haters of the tourmenting of men's consciences, did foresee, would
ensue therevppon: which thing also I my self, write even unto the King: that I
may say nothing, of the warninges, that I gave to the Duchess, sometime in
open counsel, and oftentimes else where: all these their purposes, tending to
no other end, but to set up the cruel Inquisition of Spain, and to
establishe the said Bishops, that they might serve, in steed of
Inquisitours, burners of men's bodies, and tyrauntes over their consciences.

It is true, that at this day they deny, that ever they meant to bring in,
this cursed Inquisition, but, if I bring forth unto them a man worthy of
creditt, who was at that time a Pensioner of Franck, and who had the rack
twice showed him, to be tormented upon it, that he might confess, who they
were of the Lords of the said Franck, which were purposed to refuse the
Inquisition: will they say that he is a forged witness, who yet
notwithstanding is such a one, as they are not able to object any thing against
him? And beside, if need were, I could find enough other, plain, and most
manifest proofs. There followed the most rigorous placardes and licenses,
Placards and licenses renewed.
with express commandment, to abate nothing of the old rigor: and verily the
bull granted by the Pope, for the erection of the said Bishops, does
plainly carry with it this much, that every Bishopp, might give in his own
Cathedral church, two prebends: that every one of the Canons, should be bound,
to assist him in the matter of the Inquisition: and that particularly, two
amongst them, should actually, and in deed be Inquisitours. And as Princes or
tyrauntes, which possess new Kingdoms or Lordshippes, do lay upon them a
tribute, in sign of their victory: so the Duke of Alua, in testimony of his
conquest (for this was his common speech, to wit, that these countries,
apperteyned to the King, not in title, or by right or patrimony, but as being
conquered, by armor and weapons) then I say, to the end he might make all
the world to understand the condition, whereunto he had made subject this
country, he laid upon the people, by the commandment of his Master, the
perpetual payment of the tenth penny, without the consent of the Estates, The
imposition of the tenth pe^nie, without the good vvil, and consent of the
Estates.
without the consent of the Towns and Provinces, and he resolved with him
self and his people, to execute the same by force. Insomuch, that when he un
derstood, that certain noble and courageous hearts, began to be moved, even at
the very hour (ye see my Lords, how great Gods providence is) when he
received news of the taking of the Briele, he was resolved, to put to death,
the same night the principal Burgesses and Citizens of Bruxelles, because,
that they set them selves against this impositio^, which was violently
published against their privileges. The Hangman, named Master Charles, was
commanded to have in a readiness, seventeen halters, and certain ladders of
ten or twelve foot hie: the soldiers were up in arms: Don Frederico, came
into the house, of Viglius the President, to conclude the speech of the
condemnation, when these happy news, against the good Burgesses and Citizens
of Bruxelles, arrived there. The Lieutenaunt of the Amman, was one of them,
that should have bin put to death, because he refused to execute them, that set
them selves against these attemptes, and in deed the Duke of Alua, meant to
keep the promise with them, which but a little while before, he had spoken
unto him, saying: By this to wit, Beard, a form of swearing, use amongst the
Spaniardes.
if you will not do it, I will cause you to be hanged. And moreover, the Judges
are knaves, It is sufficient that which I command you. And I confess, that
at the same time, I being again provoked, as well by sundry good people, as
by mine own oath, came again the second time with an army, of which
expedition I will say no more at this time, The second coming of the ^ prince
with an army.
because there is none amongst you, but he knows, what then were, and what
yet at this present are, the euentes and successes thereof. Now then (my
Lords) if it please you on the one side, to consider, that which the Duke of
Alua did, before that this war, was begun: what just occasions he gave me,
and the Estates of Hollande and Zealande, to have our recours to arms: and
also that, which he and the great Commandador did, until the day of the
reuolting and rebellion of the Spaniardes: and on the other side, to way, how
since that time, I have guided and governed my self, I refuse not to make ye
ludges thereof, and to give ye leave to determine thereof, as ye your selves
shall think, convenient and meet. But ye have already sufficiently
declared, what ye think thereof, by the pacification of Gaunt, by the
expulsion of Don John, and by so many acts and testimonies, that I need not
to have any more, yea even by this, that ye would not discharge me, of my
offices and charges, although that very oftentimes I requested the same of you.

Now I will come to that, which in the second place they touch, in their
cruel Proscription, to wit, that, which followed the time, wherein the
Spaniardes were declared rebels, and enemies to the country.

About that time (my Lords) there was treated and concluded the Pacification
of Gaunt, The pacification of Gaunt: and that the enemies, both Spaniardes and
their ad here^rs have broken the same against their oth^^.
and that with so great joy and contentement of the people, yea and of all the
Provinces, both generally and particularly, that no man alive, is able to
remember the like.

Every one may remember, the mutual promises of friendship, of
intelligences, partaking of counsel, and such like comprehended therein. But
what? They them selves, who afterward did make manifest, the great and
inueterate hatred of their heart, and were notwithstanding of the number of
those, which treated of the same matter with my Deputies, and with them of
Hollande and Zealande: they I say, entreating thereof, did ouerthwartly cast
against it, all the hinderaunces that possibly they could, to cause it to die,
before it came to ripenes: which thing, without controversy, they had
obtained, if they had not feared to fall into danger, and if the people, and
all the Provinces (who perceived, and saw before hand a far of, that this
pacification, should be the groundworke of their liberty, and the restitution
of their ancient privileges) had not, as it were with one voice, enforced
them to conclude the same. And, because (my Lords) often times in this
execrable Proscription, and in their little, foolish, diffamatorie libelles,
and secret letters, they object unto me, that I have violated and broken the
same: Let us see, how they on their behalf, have mainteyned and kept it. It
was no sooner confirmed by oath, but that the Lord of Haussi, according to
your commandment, The Lord of Haulsi, sent into Zealand to demand succor
of the L. Prince, for the siege of the castle of Gaunt.
made sundry voyages into Zealande to me, that he might obtain succor of
men, and munitions of war, for the siedge of the Castle of Gaundt, one of the
nestes, of the Spanishe cruelty, which thing he also obtained. But, a certain
man, unworthy of his stock, and of his Country, could not contain him self,
but at the same time began to vomit his venim, charging with a fault the
said Lord, in recompense of so good a service, and which was in deed the very
gate, to the liberty of the Country and County of Flaunders, and namely of
the town of Gaunt, which had bin so long time before, kept under by tyranny:
and it was a matter of no great account, to the said Sweueghen, to the County
of Reus, Mouqueron, and others, that the Spaniardes, yet all bloody with the
murder of Antwerp, and laden with the spoils, of good Burgesses and Citezens,
should perform a like execution in the Town of Gaunt, as they had committed
in the most renoumned town of Antwerp: which thing also they had executed and
performed, (as the letters of Rhoda and others, do sufficiently prove) had not
the said succor hindered them. Mark I pray you, how that even then when the
Trumpet sounded, for to publishe the Pacification of Gaunt, these honest people
began to break the same. Hereupon Don John arrived in these Countries, the
coming of Do^ John
and albeit that mine enemy would here play the falsifier, and alter the
matter: have not I yet the letter signed with the Kings own hand, and with
the hand of one of the Secretaries of his estate, and sealed with the seal of
his arms, which yield testimony concerning the charge and commission given
to Don John? Have not they bin published to all the world? Was there yet ever
any Spaniarde found, that durst contend against him? By those letters we have
known, that all the difference, between Don John, the Duke of Alua, and Lewis
of Requesens was this, that he was more young, and more foolish, than the
others, and that he could not so long time hide his venime, dissemble his
attemptes, and withhold his greedy hands, from the desire that he had, to
wett and wash them in our blood. I will not (my Lords) make in this place any
recital of these matters unto you, for they are known unto little children,
and all the land, is as it were, watered therewith. Albeit then that these
things were set out before the whole world: and albeit that the pacifiers
knew and understood the same: Notwithstanding the inueterate hatred toward
this poor people was so great (so much were they accustomed, to aid them that
oppressed your privileges, and to subject them selves to tyranny, was even
become altogether natural unto them) that even like horseleaches, foming with
rage, they themselves came to lance the^ selves, upon the thorn of the
bloody heart of Don John, and agreed with him, against mine advise, and the advice of them of Hollande and Zealand, and against their own oath taken,
against the pacification of Gaunt, and yet these men dare object unto me the
pacification and mine oath, as though those bands had bin prepared, only to
shakel me, and my Lords of Hollande and Zealande, whilst that those good and
loyal peacemakers, having broken all bond of laws, of loyaultie, and of
fidelity, might have liberty to perpetrate, commit, and do, whatsoever their
disloyal heart, should put them in mind of. They will say, that they caused
Don John to promise, that the Spaniardes should depart: as though that all our
agreement and league, consisted in that only point. But before they had
concluded with Don John, should not they have placed me, in my gouernementes,
and put me in possession of my goods, and restored me my Son, who was one of
the number of the prisoners? Have they so much as only thought upon it, though
that sundry amongst them were kin unto him? No whitt at all in deed. For
they had a far other mark, which thing they them selves did sufficiently
declare, by so many consultations as they made, that they might at the length
find out a way to oppress me, and to bring Hollande and Zealande under
subjection, knowing, that at the same time, I yet only, and the Estates of the
said Countries, were they which did openly hinder their pernicious purposes,
which was, to enter in the place of the Spaniardes, to exercise the like
tyranny that the Spaniards had done, but yet as they thought, with more power
and authority, and also, that they might remain in their own Cou^treyes with
greater impunitie. Concerning this matter, I refer my self to the
instructions, given to those which came to treat with me, at Saint
Geertrudenberghe, which I will bring to light, if need be thereof.

At the same time, they sent to the Queen of England, that they might fill
her with all false matters against me, and also move her to arm her self
against me and my Lords, the Estates of Hollande and Zealande: But the
knowledge that she had of the truth, and the singular wisdom, wherewith she
is endued, made her to take a clean contrary resolution, then that which they
hoped of. To be short, they devised as much ae they could, to execute and
perform against us, the same practices that the Spaniardes had done, and this
(my Lords) was the observation of the Pacification of Gaunt, that these men
used even from the beginning. And as concerning the Spaniardes, The Spaniardes
licensed by Don John to return.
which Don John told them he had sent away, they saw (at the least if they had
any understanding, though never so little, for they wanted not advertisement
and intelligence) that some stayed in Luxembourgh, other some in Bur gundie,
and other some in France, under the shadow of the civil war, which was at
that time raised up in France, looking only for their watchwoorde, that they
might return again in an instant, which thing also they did. Beside this,
they knew, that Don John retained with him fourteen thousand Germans, of
the old soldiers, which he kept in garrison, Fourteen thousand
La^ceknightes left by Don John in garrison, in the principal towns
in the principal Towns of the Country: that at Malines, he treated with the
said Germans: that he spoke one thing to them, and another thing to you my
Lords: and did in the mean while, take the Castle of Antwerp, from the power
of the Duke of Aerschot, and of the Prince of Chimai his son, and left it in
the hands of Treslon. They saw I say, these things, and did notwithstanding
aid and favor him therein, and yet they will say that they kept the
Pacification of Gaunt. For, as concerning that which mine enemies say, that
Don John swear unto it, I confess further, that the King him self promised,
it should be observed, which makes him so much the more vanquished, for even
at the same time, he commanded Don John to break it, as appears by his own
letters.

And as concerning Don John, true it is, that he promised and swear, to see the
same performed, but that was with a condition, which he spoke of before hand,
Don John swore to the pacificatio^ of Gau^t.
in the presence even of some of your Deputies, which should be added, to
wit, that it should be kept until such time, as he repented him thereof,
which condition fell out very quickly afterward. For, this young man,
supposing that he was at the topp of his business, and that he had in his
hands (by reason of the garrisons of Germains, and sundry traitors taking
part with them) the best Towns, took (but yet not without doing, an
vuworthie injury to the Queen of Navarre) the Castle of Namure, a place which
he thought was very fit and necessary, for the Spaniardes to go and come.
But so soon, as the Castle of Antwerpe, was by composition yielded up unto
you, he found him self far from his reckoning, which caused him at one time
to lose, many friends, who began even than to change their copy and
countenance: and Don John was thereby made, so perplex and doubtful, that he
had no other succor, but this, that, having corrupted some of your own
Deputies, he might protract the time, and busy you, with a painted hope of
peace. And I would to God, that at that time, ye (my Lords) had not bin
hindered, by these good obseruers of the Pacification of Gaunt, from believing
my counsel, for then, by a very small army, we might have bin quitt and rid
of Don John, of his Spaniardes and adherentes, and of so many miseries, as
since have insued. I would then yet further know, in this place (my Lords)
whether Don John did then keep this Pacification, and his Union so solemnly
sworn (as they say) which he had made, with these favorers of the
Spaniardes. And why shall he come to vpbraide me with the Pacification of
Gaunt, which yet has caused this to be declared unto us, by the Lord of
Selles, that he would not keep it? Shall he to my hurt, enjoy a privilege,
which he him self renounceth and forsakes? And when we have said all, it is
not with him, that I, and the Estates of Hollande and Zealande, have contracted
and accorded, but it is with you (my Lords.) Now, if after so many breaches of
the Pacification, and that in such sundry sorts: if after that contrary to
the said Pacificatio^, they have destroyed the Towns, where they could
exercise their tyra^nous government, and the best Burgesses and Citezens
therein, alleging against them false and wicked things: If then I say,
after these things, you (my Lords) have judged, that for your own surety,
you ought to enlarge some of the articles, yea and if need were, that you were
minded, altogether to break, cut in sunder, and revoke them: who is he that
could accuse you therefore, If ye have used that which was your own, as you
your selves thought it convenient for your own profit, unless it be he, which
would use his own oath, as a nett and snare to catch you in? For as
concerning that which they say, that the change has bin on my behalf:
though that were true, yet so it is, that I am no more bound, in respect of
the contractours with me, seeing that they have so many ways, violated and
broken the contracte it self: and seeing that on your part, it was thought
conueuient, that the change should be made, you have as much authority and
power to dispose thereof, as a Lord has right in his own inheritance: for the
Pacification was yours, which also you might use, at your own pleasure and
discretion.

But I have so often times, both by word and writing declared, nothing to be
broken on our parts, that I shall not need to bestow any more time, to set
out the same unto you: Only I will confess this, that they of Hollande and
Zealande were in deed forbidden, to innouate or change any thing in that
country: but that the other Estates, might not in their Provinces, by some
lawefull condition, Nothing was attempted, by the L. Prince, the Estates
general, and those of the Religion, against the pacification of Gaunt.
provide for their safety, it will never be found that there was as yet any
such obligation or bond: which thing may be manifestly seen and known, by
the reading of the eleventh and the twelueth Article. And in deed, upon the
making of the said Pacification, as one of those which were Deputies on our
side, did declare unto some one of the principal persons of the other side,
that some such matter might fall out, and that therefore it was better, to
accord some liberty, for the poor subjects of the Provinces, whose causes
they handeled, and for whom they were to make agreement: so some other
answered him again, that he needed not take care for such matters, and that
those of Brabant, Flaunders, and the other Countries, would not at any time
demand a change in the matter of Religion. Now, if they have bin deceived,
what cause is there for them so furiously, to direct the^ selves against me? I
give them also the same answer, in respect of the change which fell out, in
certain Towns of my government, for I can in deed assure me^ before God,
that I have not given any advise or consent thereto: and that many things fell
out there, as also in Flanders, which pleased me no whit at all: and I do
defend it against the^, that if there have bin, some souldiarlike insolency
and violence, that that was nothing, but sweet smelling roses, in respect of
the intolerable excesses, which they have committed: and also at the least,
that we have not had on our part, any infidelity or treason, or intelligence
with the Spaniardes, as our enemies on their part have had. For have not they,
against their faith and promise, with an armed power begun a war, and
assaulted their confederates, when we were, within two days ready to give
battle to our enemies? The beginning of the war of the Malco^tents even
then, when they were ready within 2. days, to drive away Don John.
Have not they pursued the execution of their co^plott and conspiracy against
their confederates, and declared their defection and falling away, at that
time, when the good town of Maestricht was besieged? Was there ever any
detestable and vile act in the world, and is it not this? Even then, when you
your selves looked for the forces and powers of your confederates, to succor a
good Town besieged, with which they were entered into a sworn league: and of
which, they could not in any sort, either wrongfully or rightly complain:
Even then I say, they did not only destitute and forsake you, but also made
war upon you, and that as whotly and as fiercely as they could. The stories
report, that Suffetius was drawn in pieces with four horses, because he
stirred not, but only looked on, when Tullus Hostilius his confederate, fought
the field: then what Gibbettes, and what punishments can a man devise, which
might be sufficient to correct, this unfaithfulness and treason? And whose
treason? Those (my Lords) who before had laid their hands, The continuance,
during the siedge of Maestricht.
upon the County of Mansfelt, Viglius, Fonc. Assonuille, Berti, and others of
the Council of Estate, then when I was not so straitely bound unto them, as
since I have bin, and was not yet come into Brabant: Those I say, that by such
laying hands upon them, had given all the world to understand, what
judgments they had concerning the King and his counsel: Leaving it to you
(my Lords) to judge, what great consideration, there is in such people, that
whilst we make war, they can not foresee, that they sharpen the swords of
those, whom they had taken prisoners, to take away their own heads. They will
say, that I have not showed my self to be an enemy against them of our side,
who have passed the bounds set the^. Verily I have not approved the excess of
any, but do they think that I am so unwary, as that for to show them a
pleasure, I will open a gapp to the destruction of the Country, and so make
Escouedo a prophet? Have they ever heard that a wise father, for the
contentement of his enemy, would seek the ruin of his children? Nay rather
this is his duty, to correct the faults, and in amending of them, to labor
the preservation of his family and household.

But Bours, Montigni, and others, do not they know the duties that I have
performed, to establish every thing in good order? Have they forgotten the
Articles, agreed upon, even such as they them selves demanded, and which
since that time, they have broken against their oath? It is then rage, folly,
ambition, hatred against the religion, and desire to govern, which has carried
away their hearts, and tossed them as it were with madness: and which has
first moved them: and which since that time they have covered, with the cloak
of the Pacification of Gaunt. For I know (my Lords) how hardly they were
distressed, and what labor they took, to cloak and color their enterprise,
and that a simple Captain, did in this counsel open a gappe unto them, who
was immediately followed.

I know, that sundry will think it a new and strange thing, that children
of so good a house, issuing from such fathers, should so far forgett them
selves, as to heap up such reproaches upon their own stock: yea some I think
will think it vnbeleeuable, that ever there could be found, such great
inconstancy in them: and for mine own part, I can not choose, but be greatly
sorry for it, by reason of the good will anst reverence, which I have borne to
their fathers: and the desire which I have had to see them advanced, in all
virtue, honor and reputation (which thing they might have atteyned, if they
had only learned to forbear but a little while, and to bear some part of the
misery of their country) and I would yet in deed desire, that they might
become so wise, that by a good repentance, they might amend the faults past.
But to the end, that I may not speak, of sundry their particular actions,
which are not come to the sight of all the world, and are notwithstanding full
of inconstancy and lightness: if we come to consider that which every one
knows, and is laid out before the eyes of all the world, who is he that can
sufficiently enough marvel, at the inconstancy and vanity of their
resolutions? They served the Duke of Alua, and the great Commandador, as
servants or pages, and they made war against me, with all extremity: a
little while afterward, they treated with me, and reconciled them selves, and
then (lo) they were the Spaniardes enemies. Don John came, they follow him,
they serve him, and they endeavor and practice my destruction. Don John failed
in his enterprises, concerning the Castle of Antwerpe, inco^tinently they
forsake him and call me: I was no sooner come, but contrary to their oath,
without communicating any thing thereof, either to you (my Lords) or to me,
they call my Lord Matthias the Archduke: He being come, they saw that they
could not come to their mark, therefore they left him, and without aduertising
him any thing at all thereof, they go to seek my Lord the Duke of Aniou: they
bring him in, and they promise him wonderful things. They saw, that they
could not bring him to this point, to make him a Captain against you (my
Lords) and them of the Religion, then they left him, and joined them selves to
the Prince of Parma. Are there any wanes of the Sea more inconstant? Is there
any It is a part of the Sea, which flows seven times a day with such great
force, that it ca^^eth ships with full fail against the vvinde.
Euripus more uncertain, than the counsels of such people, who think that
they are so highely set: so much lifted up: and so strengthened, that it
should be lawful for the^, to play and dally, in such sort with Princes, of
such quality and calling? If then they have done such things (as all the
world knows they have) assure your selves, that there is nothing so light
and vain, but they will enterprise and attempt it. And what could they have
committed more grievous, then to have consented to this wicked Proscription,
which was framed against his head and life, who had helped and healed theirs,
and caused their possessions and goods, to be restored to the principal
amongst them? And believe (my Lords) that this is not the last pranck they will
play. For, though they should very quickly confess it, (which thing I also
desire) yet shall you find them more then ten times, change their horse and
their saddle, before that this business be ridd and ended.

As concerning that, which they object against me, That I caused my self by
force and tumult to be chosen Governor of Brabant. You (my Lords) do remember,
that I never spoke to you thereof: and that I have not any manner of way,
provoked you thereto: and on the contrary side, you remember (I hope) the great
withstanding that I used, and my plain declarations and speeches made to the
contrary: The estate of Governor of Brabant and heuetenant general.
and also as concerning the estate of Lieutenaunt general, that I meant to have
had the advice and consent, of the governors which were in the army, and which
being very shortly after tumultuouslie and disorderly handled (I mind not
now to tell by whose fault) was sent me, even as I yet have it, signed with
their own hands. Now, if some of the people, preferred and promoted this
choice, and yet I neither entreating nor provoking them thereto, shall I
mislike the^ therefore? Nay rather, I am enforced to confess, that they were
more wise, and better foreseeing to the affairs of this Country, then I was
at that time. For they well understood, that if they should leave the handling
of the matters, and the administration of the public cause, in the hands of
these men, that were become Spaniardes as it were, and so greatly affected
toward them: it should be nothing else, but to build upon the quick sand, a
ground work not strong enough, to set such a frame and building upon. And it
is as true that they say, The govern meant of Flaunders offered to the Lord
Prince, and yet not accepted.
that by the tumultes of Gaunt, I was chosen Governor of Flaunders, for it
bewrays a very ignorance of our affairs: because that the four members or
parts of that Province, did choose me, not once, but sundry times, and that
not while the tumultes lasted, but since that the matters were well quieted:
yea and they them selves, have oftentimes sued for it, both to me and to you,
and yet to this present I have not minded to accept it.

Of the moneys levied by my lords the estates, and how they were distributed.
Also, I do not (my Lords) think it raisonable, to answer concerning the
means and money levied by you, and which, according to your advise, were
governed under your authority, by your treasurers, commissioners, and
receauers, without that I, or any of mine, did ever see penny thereof. But if
any must be blamed for it, it is the enemy him self, who has in-forced you
to use, and seek means for your own defense. And if he, to the end he may
execute mischief, exercise tyranny, and oppress your liberty, do bestow so
great and excessive charge and expenses: why should not you bestow some cost,
to do good things, to repress the Tyrannt, and to preserve your Privileges
and your liberty, which cannot be valued? And if the matter be, to give up all
that we have, even to the uttermost farthing, and to the last drop of our
blood: what should we do, but that, whereunto we are holden and bound? and
whereof we have in ancient Histories, so many goodly examples, as well of
strangers, as of our brave and valiant Predecessors and Ancestors? But so
far off is it, that we should leave off, that on the other side, seeing we
see that which pricketh and provoke the^, that that is it, which we should
take unto our selves, thereby to endeavor and to encourage our selves to go
forward. For to answer that which he says, that I have committed to prison,
and caused to be slain, some of them that gainsayed these contributions, I
suppose it is not needeful to anuswere them to this, before you (my Lords) who
know, that these are manifest slanders: and who know also, that I have bin
more blamed, for my over great gentleness and patience, in tollerating sundry
wicked persons, who by their subtelties and secret practices, hinder our
affairs, then I have bin accused of mine enemy, for my rigor and hardness.
But if that which they object against me were true, there are sundry, which
speak at this day very hie, and for whose sake the threedes and snares have
bin cut: and I do notwithstanding as yet not repent me, that I have so used
them, but will always rejoice, that I have had a mind ready rarher to receive
injury, then to do it, not doubting but that God, who is a just Judge, will
bring upon the heads of these traitorous and disloyal people (who did eat
bread with us, and were partakers of our Counsels, and notwithstanding at this
present, are in their counsel against us) the reward and recompense of their
wickedness, as already vengeance pursues them, with a perpetual
disquietnesse, vexation, and tossing of spirit.

As concerning the business or matter, which the Lord of Seeles took upon
him to deal for, The negotiation of the Lord of Seeles.
and which also was known, to be full of dissimulations and deceites: to
answer this, it appertains to you (my Lords) who have so wiselye discovered
his frauds: and who have caused him to understand, that those that have not
seen Spain, are not for all that beasts, as he and such as he are, do
suppose: to you I say it belongs to answer this, because that this
accusation is directed against you. I confess, that I was of the same mind
that you are, that he was no more to be trusted, than a beguiler and a
deceiuer: and that he was to be taken, as an instrument chosen to bring all to
division and disorder: upon which point to resolve my self, no man help me, so
much as he himself. For, in that that he told me, that I was so much in the
Kings favor, as that there was no Lord in these quarters, of whom he had
better opinion than of me, and whom he would employ so much as me: this made
me more and more to think, that they would gladly have taken away my head and
life, if I would have let it gone so good cheap, as this fellow so greatly
affected to the Spaniardes, would have persuaded me.

I confess, I say, that I was of the self same opinion that you were: and
that you have most wisely resolved upon this point, to wit, that, according to
the example of that wise Captain, you have stopped your ears, against the
Sirenes or Myrmaides of Spain. But what say I, that I have bin of this advise?
Those miserable men, that have consented to this cursed proscription, have not
they also resisted his attemptes as well as I? The very self same Magistrates,
which have caused this Proscription to be published, have not they also
rejected the Lord of Seeles, and all his tristing tales? which is sufficient
enough to answer that, which they say, The changing of the Officers.
concerning the changing of the Catholic Officers.

And would to GOD, that I had had power, or that by the headlongnesse or
hastiness of some, I had not bin let and hindered, from procuring and
perfourming such a change in every place: for then there had not followed, so
great a floude of evils, as since we have seen, by reason of the disjunction
and discord of the Provinces, which, it is to be feared, least it will daily
more and more grow, to the general destruction of the Country: at the least
I hope, that if the Provinces, who have so wickedly forsaken us, do not repent
them of so great a fault, they shall perceive, that there was never any man
better corrected for wicked counsel, then they that have first given the same.
And concerning this point, I will not stick at it, to answer this slander,
that I have, and that by mine own private authority, put into charge and
office the said officers, seeing that in every place, where I have bin
assistaunt in the changing of the law, I have therein executed only that
charge and office, which it has pleased you to give me, and that as your
Commissioner and Deputy, doing nothing therein against the laws and
privileges. In deed I will confess, that I sought as much as possibly I
could, to bring in and to place in these offices, virtuous people, honorable
personages, men of good conscience, and above all lovers of the country. But I
know what wringeth and pricketh them, that is, that I did not willingly favor
those, which they had in their own cord, people without faith, without
godliness and honesty toward their Country, yea bloody people, and slaves
to execute their tyranny. And this is that (my Lords) which these men call
confusion, to wit the good rule and government of our common wealth, according
to our laws, which also are as contrary to their barbarous intentes and
purposes, as the day is to the night. And in deed (my Lords) there is no
great need, to answer such objections, seeing that our own enemy does
sufficiently answer them for us. For, who were these officers, of whom they
say, we have discharged and unburdened our selves? They were (say they) well
affected to the King. Which is as much as if they should say, they were good
enemies to the Country: and by this (my Lords) you understand, that it was
very well done to change them, in sundry places and quarters.

They vpbraide me, with the great credit that I have amongst the people. So
far of is it, that I am ashamed of this, that I am very sorry that I have
not as yet atteined more, that is to say, that I have not well known,
Touching the auctority of the L. Prince amongst the people.
how to persuade them to do that, which I have so oftentimes set before them,
both by word and writing. For, it is long time since, that I would (through
the aid of God) have cleansed the country, from these filthes of Spain. But
if they be such as they say they are, and that I am such a one as they
describe me to be (for to show them some pleasure, I will easily grant them
this point) they must of necessity confess, that their tyrannies and
cruelties, have bin wonderfully excessive and outrageous in all sorts, in that
they have incurred, such a general hatred of all that people, who before were
so well affected, and has bin so loyal and faithful to their predecessors,
and even unto them themselves, before such excesses were committed: and on the
other side, that if the people have willingly chosen me, to be the claimer and
challenger of their liberty, what other thing can men say: what shall the
strange nation speak: and what shall posterity report but this, that there
was in me something, worthy of favor and freendship, and in them somewhat
worthy of extreme hatred? I confess then, that I am, and that I will al my
life long be popular, that is to say, that I will pursue, maintain and
defend, your liberty and your privileges. Thus you see, how these wise
brains, are utterly void of common wit and understanding, and how that even
then when they blame me they praise me. True it is, that five or six ill
advised persons gathered together, being the enemies of your liberty, whose
cou^selles, imaginations, and secret thoughts, tend altogether to this, to
seek out the ways, to make you subject to their tyra^nie, which should be
more cruel, or at the least more unworthy and more slauishe, then that of the
Spaniardes has bin: that these men I say, measure the brain of all the
world, by the elne of their own understanding, and think that every one,
will condemn that as evil, which they judge to be so. But when the whole
matter shall be weighed at the common beam and balaunce, the^ they shall find
that they have greatly misrekoned them selves. For he, whom they judge
unworthy to live, that he might profit the common wealth (for what other thing
is the common wealth, then the good of all the people) they will make him
through their own folly, so much the more honored, as the people it self
will more esteem of him that maintayneth them, than he that would oppress
them.

The regard that the L. Prince has always had of nobility.
I cannot also sufficiently wonder at that, which they themselves have here
forgotten: yet sundry base but wicked writers, have lyingly put down, in
their fond Libels of diffamation against me, to wit, that I hate Nobility.
For, shall I begin this hatred at my self, my kinsfolks, and friends, who
are (thanks be to God for it) al descended of a noble and famous race, and
that so ancient, and of such great riches and dignities, that I am not afraid
to affirm, that sundry of mine enemies, cannot with any good right prefer
themselves before us, and few amongst them, shall be found, that may be made
equal with us? But experience has declared, whether I do not that which is
in my power for the advancement of Noble men. Now, if I have long time ago
foreseen, that certain ambitious heads (who since that time have forsaken us)
would go about to take possession, of certain governments and charges, that so
they might afterward abandon the country, and falsify their oath: if I say I
have known their lightness, vanity and inconstancy, and their affection
also, tending to tyranny, and therefore meant not to favor them, and so by
that means I have helped to preserve, the better and the greater, and the more
sound part of our estate: I have not for all that hated or despised Nobility,
but meant by good counsel, to prevent the destruction of the Country, which
might have followed. If their Fathers, who were more wise, more valiant, and
more virtuous than they, and with whom I have lived in such good friendship:
if, I say, they were now alive, they would die with grief, seeing their stock
so much degenerating, from the constancy and virtue of their ancestors, who
lived so honorably and without reproach: If they saw I say, that there is at
this day no Country, wherein they are not counted, for inconstant people, and
great coopes men: If they saw, even the Spaniardes whom they serve, and the
Cardinal (who is the hindge, yea the Spindell whereupon the Mill turns) to
play with them, as it were with a ball: to make them as it were little
children: to lead them by the nose like beasts: and to uphold them, The
Cardinal vvriteth to Morillon, that it is not yet time to cause Bourse and
others to yield an account.
till it be time to demand again their pictures, instruments, tapestrie,
and other moueables, which they have taken away, and even so far till they
come to the point to be lead to the slaughter, even as it appears by his own
Letters written with his own hand, which you (my Lords) have seen and do
know: If they saw these things I say, what would they then do?

And because that mine enemy (as though he did distrust his own authority,
and that he doubted whether the weight of his own titles would be sufficient,
to intrappe me) proceeds yet further, and joins the Emperors authority to
them, and the credit also, of certain of my Lords, the ecclesiastical
Electors, saying, The treaty of Colen.
that they had propounded such reasonable articles, as every man of good
judgment would deem them to be such: he knew not (in a word my Lords) to
speak more than you. What say I you? Nay then all the inhabitants of these
Countries, who did with one voice refuse the said Articles, as impertinent,
captious, and unreasonable, being without judgment and void of reason. But
whom shall they be able to persuade, that a people beaten with such long war
(which cannot be without a million of inconveniences) would refuse a peace, if
it were reasonable? Or that good, yea very good subjects, and suffering very
much, would refuse to agree, with their superior, except it be, when they see
that such agreementes, are baits to catch them? such a peace is worse then
war: and such sweet honey of the tongue, is more to be doubted, then the
steely edge of swords. It may be, that the Emperor, who thinks such a
condition and state to be fit, in his own lands, that come to him by
patrimony, holds an opinion, that it should be likewise proper and fit for
us here. The Emperor was advertised of our state, by our enemies, and by the
traitors which were amongst us, who also under the color of an embassage to
Colen, assayed to destroy all our matters. The Emperor informed other Princes,
who trusted to his report, thinking that yt which came from this part, was an
oracle.

But you (my Lords) who know the depth of the state of these countries, the
commodities or discommodities, the true causes of the upholding, or of the
ruin thereof: who have also much to lose therein: who also are bound by all
laws to the preservation thereof, have otherwise judged of those articles: all
the people was asked their advise therein: and they did al with one consent,
reject those conditions, as over unreasonable: and this was done, not in one
town only, but in all. True it is, that we besought the Emperors Majesty, the
French King, the Queen of England, and the King of Portugale, to entreat for
us, that a good peace might be granted us, but to take that, as though we had
submitted our selves unto them, we suppose not that any wise man would so
think.

And as concerning that forbidding, which they say was made, concerning the
publication of the said Articles: your patience and gentleness ought greatly
to be praised, when you did not openly and for an example cause such to be
punished, who were so rash as to publish the same without your leave: and so
far off is it, that we feared the communicating, diuulging, and publishing of
them, that on the contrary side, we caused them to be printed, The Lord Prince
hindered not the co^municatinge of the articles of Colin, to the people.
with the declarations of their insufficiency, and they were sent through all
the Provinces and Towns, that they might be deliberated upon: and that the advice and resolution of all might be had. But there is great difference,
between a thing communicated in order, by the way of right, and by the
authority of them, which have power so to do: and between this, that
certain little Scoutes, should privily cast amongst the people, certain
little Pamphlets, as some of them which were sent to Collen about your service,
caused under hand and closely to pass forth, those things which they had
negotiated, and treated off with the enemy, wherein they betrayed both you and
the Country, as more largely appears by their own Letters, whereof I will
not speak any further, because that all is set abroad, and brought to every
man's sight.

They think the union of the Provinces, made at Vtrecht, to be wonderfully
wicked and evil. And why so? Because that all that which is good for us, is
evil for them: The union of the prouices made at the time of the seperatio^ of
Artois and Haynault.
and that which is healthful for us, is deadly for them. They had set all
their hope, upon a discord and disagreme^t, and they had provoked thereto some
of the provinces, who have had as many deliberations and counsels, as there are
months in a year: beside they had at their commandment certain pestilent
fellows amongst us. What remedy then could a man devise better, against
dissension then union? And what counterpoison more certain against their venim
of discord, then concord? By means whereof, their purposes, their
trecheries, their night counsels, their secret intelligences, were all at one
time scattered abroad, God (who is the God of peace and concord) declaring
thereby how much he hates such deceitful tongues, and how he can easily
overthrow, such false and abominable enterprises. You see (my Lords) that I
give them a fair and large field, to cry out against me, and to scorn at me.
I confess unto them, that I have procured the union: that I have advanced and
promoted the same: that I have endeavored to maintain it, and I tell you (my
Lords) yet; and I speak it very plainly, and loud, that I like it well, that
so not only they, but also all Europe should understand it. Maintain your
union: keep your union, but do it, but do it indeed (my Lords) that so you
may execute, not in words, nor by writing only: but in effect also, that,
which your sheafe of arrows, tied with one ba^d only, does mean, which sheafe
you bear in your seal. Let the^ go now and accuse me, that I have brought all
to confusion, when I procured the union, for the doing of which matter, I will
never blush. For if under the shadow of a peace, they would bring forth unto us
a division: if they would assemble themselves, one while at Arras, another
while at Montz, giving us always fair words, and that to this end, that
they might sunder themselves from us, and so draw by their cords unto
themselves, light headed fellows like unto themselves: wherefore should it not
be lawful for us, on our own behalues, to join and tie our selves together?
Unless (as it may be) they think, that they are permitted to do evil, and
to abandon the Country: and when I pray you? Even when Maestricht was besieged
(will not ye, O ye poor people, feel, when ye shall read these things,
the hot iron, which shall burn your conscience?) and that it was not lawful
for us then, to do good, and to heal the Country. Let us then here (my
Lords) learn that, which is profitable and necessary for us to learn: and
let us learn it of the greatest enemy, that ever the Country had, yea of the
greetest tiraunt of the whole earth.

Concerning the voyage of the Lord Prince into Oueryssell, An. 1580.
They object unto me afterward a hotrible crime, and worthy forsooth, of this
more great Proscription, than that which was pronounced by Sylla and Carbo:
that is, that I departed not out of Antuerp for two years space, and that I
went to Vtrecht. A man may easily see, that they know very well what I do, as
though, that with their very great sorrow and greef, I had not in those two
years space, travailed twice into Flaunders, where by the aid of the four
members or parts of that Province, I placed better order in the said
country, then they would or wished. But go too, let us grant, that I did not
for two years space together, go out of Antuerp: was not this a great fault to
be always nigh unto you, that I might the better serve you in every thing,
which it pleased you to command me? But I went to Vtrecht: behold (my Lords
the evil: behold the bile or sore, for this is the voyage, that wounds them
even to the heart. They had before hand so wisely purposed their matters: they
had laid so sure a foundation for their affairs and business: they pleafed
themselves so much therein: they writ thereof to their friends: they held in
their hands so many countries and governments: they had written so many
Letters: and had used so many hirings, secret intisements, and open practices,
as they thought all to be sure their own: and yet I coming only to show my
self at Vtrecht, with the good assistance and counsel of my Lords, the
Deputies of the Provinces: behold that great mist or fogge, was vanished away:
so many Castles as they had reserved for their tirannie, were beaten down: and
so many of our own Towns assured to us: they having for all, no other thing
left unto them, but one only Town of importance, wherein was the Captain of
the enterprife: which Town notwithstanding he knew not how to make subject to
his commandment, but by an abominable murder, of one, whom he called his
father: who the evening before, had set at his table, he as a Judas dealing
with him under a false kiss. And this (my Lords) is the cause, that makes
them cry so loud, yea this is the Helena, for which they fight.

Touching the Priests, driven out of the country of Freiselande.
And as concerning that, which they object against me, that I have driven out
some of the ecclesiastical persons or church men: you (my Lords) know, that
this is not true. But when their Captain, who is in Groeningen, had taken
prisoners some of the religion, and had murdered other some, yea the very
Bourgmaister, and all this, contrary unto his oath: having also before time,
brought in and sworn unto, the new religion (as they call it): and having
solemnly, and that with his oath, and his sign, and his seal confirmed, the
union of Vtrecht: al these things considered, who is he that will think it
strange, if those on our side, meant what they could, on their own parts to
assure themselves, seeing that they saw the enemies, without any reverence to
their oath taken, to tread under their feet al holy and sacred things, and
with such a perpetual reproach to them and their raze, to have violated and
broken, whatsoever justice and equity, does as yet remain in the world? And
this we may say at the least, that no man can justly charge us, that in the
midst of those troubles, which our enemies themselves have stirred up, that
ever any of our side, proceeded or came to such a heap of injustice, as to wet
their hands in the blood, of those that were confederate to them, or of those
which stayed themselves upon their fidelities: which thing their Captains have
done, yea and that with their own hands.

Concerning certain noble me^, that departed out of Freiselande.
Concerning the Nobles, which he says, have withdrawn them selves out of the
Country, who is he, which ever drove out so much as one of the^. But if the
terrors of their own consciences have pursued them, and that they have bin
vexed by their own feling, which (as it were infernal and hellish furies) has
chased them from place to place, who ought to be accused therefore, but only
they themselves who secretly, disloyally, and unfaithfully, have practiced the
destruction of their own Country? And would to God that they had sooner felt
this burden, and that they which remain, and are overtaken with the like
madness, might follow the^ even at the heels, so should they deliver us from
great travail, and the common wealth from fear, least some one time or other,
they should execute their pernicious purposes.

The roundnesse and plainness of the Lord Prince.
It is a ridiculous and fond thing, that they call me hipocrit, who never in
respect of them, have used any dissimulatio^. For while I was their friend, I
have freely foretold them, that they twisted the threede of their own
destruction, whilst that they attempted and took, these barbarous ways of
persecuting. And if their rage and unmeasurable heat, joined with a contempt
of us, had not hindered them, from following my counsel: they had not been
brought to that state, in which they are at this present. When I was their
adversary and enemy, for your liberty, I know not what hypocrisy they have
found in me, unless they will call this hypocrisy, to make open war upon
them, to take Towns from them, to drive them out of the country: and without
dissembling to do against them, whatsoever the law of war suffered me? But,
if it please you (my Lords) once again to read my defense, which I published
three years ago, you shall see there, the Letters of King, who is a deceiuer
and an hipocrite, and who thought to catch me then, in the snare of his sweet
and deceaueable Letters, as he supposes at this present to astonish me, with
his threats and thunders of words. But, thanks be to God, I have a
counterpoison, against both the one and the other venim.

The Lord Prince accused of diffidence or distrust.
They proceed afterward, with a great heap of foolish words, to amplify
this matter, that I stay and ground my self upon a certain diffidence and
distrust. Though I did so, should I be for all that, like unto Caine and Judas
as he accuses me: No verily. For it is one thing to despair of the promises,
and of the grace of God, who cannot lie, and an other thing not to believe, the
words of a subtle and deceitful man, who keeps not faith or loyalty, as
the poor Moors of Grenado, may speak to much thereof: and also, as the death
of the Lords, the Counties of Egmont and Horns, of blessed memory, do give
sufficient proof thereof. But if these good deuines, such as the Cardinal is
(who is one of the foundations of his Church) had thoroughly sounded, for the
true and nigh cause of the ruin and fall of Judas and Caine, they should have
found, that it was despair, whither by the grace of God, I have not bin
brought, and I hope never shall be. On the other side, if men, would look upon,
the monstrous and thundering speeches which are used, in this not barbarous
only, but more then turkish Proscription: shall they not find therein, the
very style of desperate persons, such as we hear the Poets use, when they
bring in furious and mad men. They then have the seared conscience of Judas,
the astonished conscience of Cain, and the reproved conscience of Saul. You
see notwithstanding (my Lords) the great wisdom of these wise heads,
diffidence or distrust, say they, is a common thing to al wicked persons. But I
speak unto thee (O Cardinal) who have spente so much time in the Schools, and
I bid thee tell me, whether thou call not this learning, to wit, to be from a
man's youth instructed, to lie and deceive? I demauud then of thee, what thou will answer to the most strong and sententious of al orators, and to the
greatest lover of his Country, who says (as I have understood it from my
youth, by all learned men) that the greatest and surest fortress, that a free
people can have, against a tyrant, is diffidence and distrust? And this
speech was directed against one called Philip, who had learned but a little
tyranny, in respect of thy Lord Philip, who exceeds all other tyrants, and
for whom, no oration pronounced against Philip, is sufficiently worthy, no
not that, which for the excellency of it, is called Divine. I know thou will
advise and take counsel concerning this matter, and in the mean while I will
speak, I will write, and I will cause to be iugraued in every place, this
notable sentence, worthy of eternal remembrance: and would to God, that I
might be better believed, than that good Orator was, amongst his people, who
suffering themselves to be busied and abused, by people like unto thy self, and
other such wretched workers of confusion (which are at thy commandment, and
have set on sale their tongues and pens) were at the last snared, and utterly
brought to confusion. But I hope (my Lords) better things of your constancy
and courage.

The offers which the enemies say have bin made to the L. Prince, to cause him
to depart out of the Country.
And as good Orators, do always keep toward the end, some strong and
pearcing reason: and as good Captains, leave their best Souldiars in the last
ranks: so these so skillful and so much excercised men, come at the last to
entangle and snare me, with the weight of a great and grecuous reproach, They
have offered me (they say) great commodities, to the end that I might depart to
the place where I was borne, where every one ought to desire most to live, to
the which I meant not to consent. What could they say (my Lords) which might
make more for me than this? consider I pray you their folly, or their
shamelessness. For this must needs be, either that they speak shamelessly, or
else that they are so void of good understanding, that they praise me, when
they think to blame me. It is a pleasant thing for every one to live in his
own Country, wherefore then, does this cursed race of Spaniardes, go from
country to country, to torment and to trouble all the world? But if, in
respect of so many bonds, as I am bound unto you by, I prefer your service,
(as I ought) before the Country wherein I was born: am I therefore to be
counted a traitor and a wicked man, and the public plague of the world? And
yet notwithstanding you know, that ever since I was an eleven or twelve years
old, I have bin nourished and brought up amongst you, and not else where, in
so much that this country, is become as it were my natural country. If then,
they have made me sundry promises: if they have offered me (as they say) great
commodities, and I have notwithstanding refused the same: what can they
condemn in me, except it be my constancy and fidelity, toward God and the
country, which I have preferred before all the goods in the world? Think not
(my Lords) that I love to be so continually occupied in travail and labor, or
like to hear, so many wicked speeches and slanders, on the behalf of mine
enemies: and (which is more) that I would hear them of them, that ought to be
my friends and are bound unto me: or that I take delight, to be so long time
deprived of my goods: to see my son so long kept in cruel prison: to
behold my self charged with such infinite debtes, and yet should be able to
put an end, to so great difficulties and distresses, and would not: or that I
should not be like unto other men of the earth, who all prefer quietness
before travail, and prosperity before affliction. But what: If I cannot
obtain such blessings, and so blessed a condition without betraying you,
without forsaking you, without giving you over (as much as might be) for a
pray, into the teeth of these bloody woolues: let the rest of the world pardon
me (for I know that you approve me, and that I need no excuse before you) if I
will not, either for goods, or for life, or for wife, or for children, mingle
in my drink, one only drop of the poison of treason. But, so long as it
shall please God, to give me any drop of blood, one peniworth of my goods,
any understanding, industry, credit and authority, how small so ever it be:
I will implore: I will dedicate: and I will consecrate the same wholly unto your
service. Notwithstanding, seeing they vpbraid me with such things, I will yet
tell you (my Lords) that they have not done any such thing, without borrowing
somewhat of the truth, and going beyond it also, according to their good
custom. For such offers as they speak of, were as yet never made me, not but
that I have bin, well and surely advertised, that I could not demand any
thing, in respect of mine own particular, but that they would yield the same
unto me: that they would promise to set my son at liberty: to leave him all
my estates: to assign unto me in Germany, so much goods as I have here, as well
in respect of that which I possess, as of that which is held from me: to
discharge me of my debtes, which are very great, and to give me in ready
Coin, a millyon of Money, and good assurances for all these things.

These be (my Lords) the goodly offers which have easily turned them aside,
which are departed away from us. But so far of is it, that such conditions
were offered unto me, that on the other side, they never knew, either by the
Letters of the Emperoures Ambassador, or by his secret practices, with some of
my servants, and sundry of my nearest kinsfolks, or by the Letters of the
Commissioners: how to get this only at my hand, to wit, that I should fend
particular articles, and that in my own name: but I have always answered,
that if the peace might be concluded, as you (my Lords) demanded it, I should
be satisfied: I not minding to have any other condition, either good or evil,
than that which you accepted of: nor yet minding, neither directly nor
indirectly, to sunder my self from the common cause, upon which I did judge,
that either my adversity, or my prosperity did depend.

Is not this a great fault, to vpbraide a man with this, that he is a good man?
and that he is, as much loiall, constant, and assured, against all the winds of
fair promises, as by Gods grace he is, against all the floodes of cruel
threatenings?

Hitherto (my Lords) you have heard, the accusations, or rather the injuries,
wicked speeches and slanders, which they have gathered together, against my
honor and reputation. It shall belong to you (to whom only I think my self
bound, by reason of my goods, of the state wherein they are, and specially of
my oaths) to judge thereof as it shall please you: for I do not refuse, if I
be found culpable, to receive punishment: but if it fall out as I hope it will,
that you judge, that I am accused by tiraunts and slaunderers, then I shall
esteem my mean, yet notwithstanding my most loyal, and my most faithful
service, to have bin very well employed.

The sentence of the proscriptio^.
NOw then (my Lords) upon these frail and weak foundations, they come to
build the sentence of their Proscription, and here they lay out all their
tragical eloquence: they thunder: they lighten: they storm and rage: they do
as the Corebae or furies do in Theaters: they darte out all execrable words,
and such as have bin kneded, in Cocyte, Styx, and Acheron, against this poor
Captain. But this, thanks be to God, does astonish me as much, as the
thunderinges and lightninges of Pope Clement, thrown out of the mount
Tarpeius, against my Predecessor, my Lord Prince Philebert, did astonish him:
who ceased not for all that, to make him his Prisoner. For, after that I have
looked round about me, I find that they are, but winds of words, and
noises, to make children afraid, rather then a man, who through Gods goodness
has not lost his courage, for the toringes of al their canons, nor for their
four score thousand Soldiers, who were always at the Duke of Alua his
commandment: nor yet for so many armies by sea: nor yet for so many treasons
of the said Duke, or of his successor against me: nor for the treasons of the
Duchess of Parme, who was before them: and yet notwithstanding, this was in
deed a more fearful thing, than a vain noise of such a great thunder, which
so quickly vanished away and hurt no man. And it is sufficient for n^ee,
shortly to say before you (my Lords) and before all Europe, that every
Spanyarde, or every one that favors the Spaniardes, of what quality or
condition soever he be (I respect not now any man's person) who has said,
or shall say, (as this insamous Proscription has published it) that I am a
Traitor, The aunsvvere of the Lord Prince, to the sentice of Proscription.
and wicked man, that he speaks falsely, and against the truth. In the mean
while, let them forbid me, as long as they will, both fire and water, I,
together with my frindes, will not leave of for all that, even in despite of
their rage, to live as long as it shall please God, to give us grace: which God
only has in his power, my life and my death, and has numbered all the hears
of my head, whose great favor and assistaunce, I have felt even until this
present time, and I hope that he will preserve me, even unto the end. As
concerning the goods which I possess, which also he gives away (for hitherto,
he has been so good a husband, that he will give nothing of that, which he
has violently taken from me) I hope, (God aiding me) that it shall cost them
so dear to have them: that they shall get others else where far better
cheap As concerning my other goods, which he keeps from me, I hope, that God
will give me grace, as well to dispossess them thereof wholly, as I have
already done of a good part: and that they have never violently taken goods,
from any poor Prince (albeit that they have spoiled sundry thereof) which
shall lie and weigh more heavy upon them.

He promises five and twenty thousand Crowns, either in lands, or in
ready money, to him that shall yield me up, into his cruel hands, dead or
alive, or to him which shall take my life from me. But albeit, there has
heretofore no publication bin made of such a matter, until this present time:
thinks he that I am ignorant, how oftentimes he and his, have bargained
with murderers and poysoners, to take away my life from me? And if God have
showed me such grace, as to make me able to preserve my self, even then, when
I was not advertised of any such danger: I hope, that he will not show me
less favor at this time, wherein I am admonished, but rather, that as I have
great occasion to look unto my self: so he will stir up, sundry good and
virtuous people, who shall watch for my assurance and safety. But albeit,
that I know not in the world, any impudency so shameless, which may be
compared, with the impudency of the Spaniardes: notwithstanding, I cannot
sufficiently marvel, that they have bin so shameless, as to dare to publish,
before all Europe, not only that they set a price, upon a frank and free
Captain, who (thanks be to God for it) did as yet never fear them: but also
that they annexe thereunto, such recompenses and rewards, yea and those so
barbarous, and so estraunged from all rule of honesty and humanity, as the
like has not bin heard of: that is to say, in the first place, that they will
make him noble, if he were not noble before, who shall do so Gentlemanlike, or
so noble an act. But I beseech you, suppose, that he, which should execute so
wicked an act, (which thing I hope GOD will never suffer) were of a Noble raze
and stock: think you, that there is any Gentleman in the world, I mean
amongst the Nations, which know what Nobility is, who would so much as
eat, with so wicked, ungodly, and mischeeuous a man, who for money should
kill another man, yea, though he were the least, and the most abiecte person
that could be sound?

Now, if the Spaniardes accounte such people for Noble men: and if this be
the way to come to honor, in Castile and Spain, I will no more wonder at
that, which all the world believes, to wit, that the greatest part of the
Spanyardes, and specially those, that count themselves Noble men, are of the
blood of the Moors and jews, who also keep this virtue of their Ancestors,
who sold for ready money down told, the life of our Savior, which thing
also, makes me to take patiently this injury lay de upon me. In the
second place, they pardon him, every offense and fault, how grievous soever
it might be. But what if he had pulled up the Christian Religion, out of one
of his Kingdoms? what if he had ravished his Daughter? what if he had spoken
evil of the inquisition, which is the greatest crime that can be in Spain?
Should he be pardoned? But, seeing mine enemy, meant so far to forgette
himself, that he would attempt, to take away, my goods, my life, and mine
honor: and that he might have more witnesses, of his injustice and follies, to
publishe it so through out the world, and that in so many languages, I could
not very well desire in respect of most great advantage unto my self, that he
should have enriched and adorned, this his Proscription, with any other
ornaments, than these very same, to wit, that for killing of me, he should
make noble, not only villains, and infamous persons, but also the most
wicked, and the most execrable people of the whole earth: and to give such a
great, yea so honorable a reward, to so notable a virtue. For what could be
found out more fit, to justify my righteousness and innocence, then to go
about, to root me out by such means? and then this, to carry a mind, by
tirannie, impoisoninges, forgiving of grievous crimes, making of wicked men
noble, and such like, to oppress the defendour of the liberty of a people,
that is cruelly and tyrannously vexed?

I doubt not (my Lords) but that GOD who is just, has taken from him and
his, all understanding: and that he has suffered him to declare and set out to
all the world, matter enough, whereby they may know, his poysonfull heart,
against this country, and against our liberty, in as much as he makes no
account, of any act, how wicked and detestable soever it may be, in respect of
the death of him, who hitherto has so faithfully scrued you. And further, he
is not ashamed, to mingle with such sacriledges as these are, the name of God,
calling himself his Minister or Officer. Has the Officer then this power, not
only to permit that which God has forbidden: but also, to reward it, with
money, or money worth, with nobility, and the forgiveness of offenses? And
what offenses or crimes I pray you? Verily of all crimes how grievous soever
they can be. But I doubt not, but that God, through his most just judgment,
will cause to come down, the just vengeance of his wrath, upon the Captain
and head, of such ministers and officers: and that on the other side, he will
of his great goodness maintain, mine innocence and mine honor, so long as I
live, and amongst my posterity after me. And as concerning my goods and my
life, it is long time since, that I dedicated them to his service, and I know
that he will do therewith, whatsoever he shall see to be good, for his own
glory, and for my salvation.

And because (my Lords) he proceeds also, to bring the drops of this
infamous Proscription upon your heads, so far of is it, that you shall be moved
therewith, that ye should rather think, that herein the Spaniarde and his
adherentes, follow the natural disposition of women, who, after that they have
wept, scratched and bitten, do for their last remedy and refuge, come to
injuries and reuilinges: and even so does your enemy, now yield out his last
barkinges: and if we give them proof, of our constancy, resolution, and
courage, behold they are, at the last of their miserable and wretched
enterprises. For, Sylla, Carbo, Marius, Antonius, and such other tyraunts, the
first fathers of these abominable Proscriptions, never gave example to the
Spaniardes, to commit such folly and beastliness, albeit that they have
traced out before them, that example of cruelty and barbarousnesse, which
these miserable wretches have accomplished and performed: But they proscribed
such only as were fugitives, driven away, hidden in secret, and that within the
countries, over which they had power and authority. And these men are like
unto them in this, that is to say, in cruelty, because they proscribe, good,
virtuous, and honorable personages: but yet in this point, they show
themselves sottish and foolish, that they proscribe him, whom they should
fight against, with an armed power. For, to send a poisoner, as the Duches of
Parme sent one: or to send a murderer, as her son, the general heir of the
virtues of his ancestors, did: this is not the effect of a Proscription, but
of briberie, and the every rather.

Behold (my Lords) not what I am able to say, against this tyrannous
Proscription, but what I have thought meet for this time: speaking unto you,
which have the knowledge, of sundry things, that I omit, because they are
known unto you, and because also, that if I would attempt, to speak of the
particular enterprises, of the King, and of his chief Officers, I should
assaie to do that, which no Orator is sufficiently able, worthily to describe:
yea that, which no good man, was ever able to conceive: so great is their
cruelty, tyranny, and all manner of unjust dealing. Notwithstanding I hope,
that as well by the matter contained in this Proscription (which is a
sufficient testimony, of their over base and abject courage) as by my answer
you shall sufficiently know, what are their pernicious purposes, and miserable
attemptes: and by this knowledge, you shall also learn, what it is necessary,
for you, to cast your eye upon, and diligently to understand: that is, that
they despair, that ever they shall be able to vanquish you by force, and
therefore they assay to sow division amongst us, magnifying chiefly those, who
have not only forsaken us, against their oath: but even have left us in
perilous times, and namely, whilst that one of our Towns was besieged:
whereof they are not able, to make any just complaint, nor allege their
accustomed pretext and cloak, yea (which also is the heap, of all disloialtie
and unfaithfulness) at the very same time they come to assault us, in other
places and quarters. As for the threats annexed in this Proscription, tend to
no other end, but to astonish you, to the end you might separate your selves
from me: and plainly to declare, that they make war against me, and not
against you, even as the woolfe would persuade the sheep, that he had not war
with any but with the dogs, which being once discomfited, he would easily
agree with the slocke of sheep: for the dogs were always the authors, of
their debate and combatting. But (my Lords) though I were absent: though I
were departed into Germany, would they burn no more? would they spill no more
blood? would they drown no more? Was the liberty of the Country maintained,
by that gentle and mild man, the Duke of Alua? Did they not then wickedly put
to death in Spain, your own Ambassadors my Lords of Bergues, and of Montigni?
Did they not at the same time, set before your eyes, upon spears and lances,
the heads of your principal Captains and governors? The other point, which
they most set before them, is the extirpation of Religion. I mind not here (my
Lords) to enter into this question, which is the true Religion, wherein God is
truly served and called upon, and that according to his word: but leave it
rather to be declared by others, more excercised in that matter than I: and
yet so, that every one may know by my profession, what I believe concerning the
same. But this I cannot choose but tell you, that such is the estate of your
country, that without the exercise and free use of the said Religion, it
cannot stand three days. You see the number of them that profess it,
marvelously increased: you see that hatred against the Pope, is inrooted
deeply, in the hearts of all the inhabitauntes of the Country, because that
his damnable practices, against this whole estate, are manifestly discovered.

Who is he then, that can boast that he loves the Country, and would give
counsel to drive away such a great number of people, which once departing,
shall leave the Country, waste, poor, and miserable, and shall people and
inriche the strange nations about us? But suppose, that they will not depart,
or void the Country, who is he that can enforce them so to do? let us look
upon our neighbors: Let us consider our own examples, and if we be not
utterly void of wit and understanding, we will never choose such pernicious
and hurtful counsels, as shall utterly, even from top to toe, bring to
ruin and destruction, this estate. I will yet say somewhat more unto you (my
Lords) that albeit that amongst them, which follow the Roman church, there
are sundry good people, and lovers of their Country: and that amongst them,
there are some also, which have most honorably acquitted and behaved
themselves: yet notwithstanding those of the Religion, are very well assured of
this, that there shall never be found any amongst them, who has had
intelligence, or made any practice with the enemy, but all of them generally,
have bin contrary unto him. And albeit that some have bin found amongst
them, who being like unto wanton and proud children, have brought through their
vnheedinesse, some trouble into the house: yet for all that, they have not had
any dealing, with the common enemy. Seeing then (my Lords) that you know
their purposes and attemptes, there rests no other thing but this, that you
do in time provide for them, and labor what ye can, to redress the same. And
how shall this be performed? forsooth by this means, that ye perform in
effect, that which ye have always in your mouth: and that which the mark of
your sheafe of arrows signifies, which it has pleased you to have graven in
your seal: that is to say, that no member of this goodly body, respect that
which is his own, but regard the whole body altogether: that some one part
of the body, take not unto it self that meat, which is prepared for the
whole, but that it suffer the stomach (which is the counsel, that ye shall
ordain and appoint) to concoct and digest the same, and to send it by the
veins, to all the members of this estate, and specially, that wheresoever any
disease or sickness shall appear, the Physicians should speedily be sent
thither, and that the Patientes should quietly bear for a time, the miseries
upon them, that so they may feel at the length, a joyful deliverance, from
their disease and evil. Shall not this be a just reproach upon us and ours,
for ever, if that, having so glorious an estate under our power, and so goodly
means for our defense, we do, through a miserable covetousness and greedy
desire, to get unto our selves some commodities, and that with the prejudice
and hurt of our country men and friends, whilst some draw one way, and other
some an other: if we do I say, find our selves and that in a moment, snared
and overwhelmed by our deadly enemies? Remember (my Lords) I pray you, the
very great diminishing and weakening of this estate, which came to pass after
the death of Duke Charles, which fell upon us for no other thing, but because
that while the Provinces, busied themselves, to contend and to fight one of
them against another, for certain pretended privileges, and for certain
commodities, the rest was abandoned and forsaken. Think not that it is in my
power (the affairs and matters being in such condition as they are) any long
time to resist the enemy, with such small and slender means, as you (my
Lords) know, that I have had in my hand and possession. But on the other side,
if I have any experience, or practice, of government and war: if I know this
Country, and the means that the enemy has, though that all the armies and
powers, which they threaten shall come the next year, out of Spain and
Italy, should come upon us and our powers, they shall do no more, but much
less rather, then the Duke of Alua did in Holland and Zeland. And if it be in
your power to take order for this (as it is indeed) and yet notwithstanding ye
do it not: by what name shall a man call this fault, if it be committed by you
(my Lords) who are here assembled, and upon whom, all the good people of this
country stay themselves, esteeming you as their fathers, and their Protectors,
who will also willingly embrace, as some joyful news sent from heaven, any
good order which you shall decree and establish? Wherefore take pity of your
selves, and if that which concerns your selves move you not, yet take pity I
pray you of so many poor people already destroyed, and more like to be: of so
many poor widows and fatherless children: of so many murders and
slaughters, committed within the bowels of your own country: of so many
Churches destroyed: and of so many Pastors wandering up and down together with
their poor flocks. Set before you, that cruel and barbarous execution,
committed at Niuelle, by the County of Mansfeld Which things you may easily
avoid, and cast all the evil and mischeife of this war, upon the enemy,
if only you remove partialities and partakinges, and with one courage and heart
as it were, imploye together all the means that you have, without sparing, I
say, not the bottom of your purses, but that which abounds therein. And as
concerning that which particularly touches my self, you see (my Lords) that
it is this head, that they seek for, the which by such a price, and so great a
sum of money, they have vowed and appointed to death and say, that so long
as I shall be amongst you, the wars shall have no end. Would to God (my
Lords) either that my perpetual banishment, or else my very death it self,
might bring unto you, a found and true deliverance, from so many mischeifes
and calamities as the Spaniardes (whom I have seen, so many times deliberate
in counsel, devise and speak of particularly, and whom I know within and
without) do devise against you, and prepare for you. O how sweet should this
banishment be unto me? O how delitefull should this death be unto me? for
wherefore is it, that I have given over, yea lost all my goods? is it to
inriche my self? Wherefore have I lost mine own brethren, whom I loved more
then mine own life? Is it that I might find some other else where? Wherefore
have I so long time left my son a prisoner, my son I say, whom I ought so
much to desire, If I be a father? is it because you are able to give me an
other? or because you are able to restore him to me again? Wherefore have I
put my life so oftentimes in danger? what other recompense, what other
reward, can I look for, of my long travails, which have come upon me for
your service sake, even so far, that they have brought upon me old age, and
the ruin and loss of all my goods, except it be to purchase and to procure
you liberty, and that if need be, with the price of my blood. If you
therefore (my Lords) do judge either that my absence, or that my very death it
self, may serve you, or stand you in any steed, behold I am ready to obey,
command me, yea send me even to the worlds end, and I will obey you.
Behold, my head over which no Prince nor Monarche, has any power, save you
only, dispose thereof as shall make most for your own good, and for the health
and preservation of your common wealth. But if you judge, that this mean
experience and small diligence that is in me, and which I have attained, by so
long and so continual travel: If you judge that the remainder of my goods,
and that my life it self, may as yet serve you (as in deed I do wholly
dedicate and consecrate the same unto the country) resolve then upon the
points, which I propound unto you and set before you. And if you think that I
bear any love to the country, and that I have any sufficiency in me, to give
counsel, believe that this is the only mean, to assure, yea to deliver our
selves from the enemy. This being done, let us with one heart and good will go
together, and let us together imbrase the defense of this good people, which
demands nothing else, but to have good counsels laid open before them, nor
desires any thing else, but to follow the same: And this doing, if you yet
continue toward me the favor, which heretofore you have borne me, I hope by
your aid, and Gods grace (which I have so often heretofore felt, and that in
very perplexed and doubtful matters) that that which shall be resolved upon,
by you, shall be, for the good, and preservation, of your selves, your wives
and children, and all sacred and holy things.

The Copy of a Letter written by the King with his own hand, to the Prince of
Orange, translated out of Spanish into French.
I HAVE WITH GREAT AFFEction received your Letter of the xxvij. of May, and
since, that other which you writie unto me, the xivj. of sune: and by that
which I have written to my sister, you have bin abie to understand, the small
occasion that you have to think that which you write unto me, in that Letter of
the xxvij. of May, but rather the contrary. Also it is cetaine, that you
should much deceive your self to think, that I would not have all confidence
and good opinion of you: and albeit some certain one should mean, to perform
a contrary duty toward* me yet this should remame, that I would not be so
light, as to give credit thereto, having so great expertence of your loyalty
and services. Wherefore you need not trouble your self therewith, but stay
your self upon the Letters, which heretofore I have written unto you in this
behalf, and upon your own deeds, but at no hand rest upon that which some,
enemies (it may be of my service, and of your good estate) would endeavor to
cause you to understand. Touching the liberty you demand, to leave of your
charges and offices, it greeueth me, that your particular affairs and
businesses, are in such terms and state as you say: and I cannot but tell
you, that the affairs of those Countries, standing in such sort and manner as
they do, it is not reason that such persons, as yours is (to whom I trust, and
upon whom I stay my self) should abandon and forsake the same, specially I my
self being so far off from the said Countries, yea rather it were reason,
that those, that are in their own houses should speedily provide for, and
help this present necessity, and unploy themselves upon that, whereunto they
are bound, as ye have presently done, ingoing to Antuerpe, whereby I have
received great contentment and joy, and am very well assured, that ye will
there do, whatsoever shall be most convenient for my service, and for the
quietness and peace, of the said town and country, and for the avoiding of
the disorders, that shall arise there: which thing also I hope of you, and I
know that ye will not declare your self to be any other, than such a one as
ye have heretofore declared your self to be, all your life long: And to the
end ye may perceive, that I do deal freely with you, I will not cease to
advertise you, that there has bin in these quarters a great rumor, concerning
this, to wit, that your brother has bin found to be a dealer, in those things
that are done there. And because I cannot cease, much and often to think of
this matter, I charge you straightly diligently to consider, how it may be
remedied and redressed, that it proceed no further, and look that you do
effectually perform it: and if it seem good unto you to remove for a few
days, your brother far from you, do so.

From the Forest of Segouia the first of August. Subsigned PHILIP,

Kings Seal.



A PROCLAMATION AND AN EDICT IN FORM OF A PROSCRIPTION, made by the Majesty
of the King our Lord, against William of Nassau, Prince of Orange, as the
chief Captain and disturber of the state of Christendom, and specially of
these low Countries, by which every one is authorized, to hurt him and to kill
him, as a public plague, with a reward to him that shall do it, and shall
be assisting and ayding thereunto.
PHilip by the grace of God King of Castile, of Leon, of Arragon, of Nauarr, of
Naples, of Cicilia of Maleorcha, of Sardinia, of the Isles, of the Indes and
the firm land, of the Ocean Sea, Archeduke of Austrich, Duke of Burgondy, of
Lothier, of Brabant, of Lembourg, of Luxembourg, of Gelderland and of Millan,
County of Habsbourg, of Flaunders, of Arthois, of Burgundy, Palatine both of
Haynault, of Holland, of Zeland, of Namure, and of Zutphen, Prince of Swaue,
Marquis of the holy Empire, Lord of Friseland, of Salines, of Malines, of the
City, Towns and country of Vtrecht, of Oueryssel, and Groninge, and
Governor in Asia and A frick. To all those that shall see these present
writings, greeting.

It is known to all the world, how the late Emperor of most excellent
memory, Charles the fifth, my Lord and father, whom God absolve, has
favorably handled and dealt with William of Nassau, for the succession of the
late Rene of Challon, Prince of Orange his cousine: and how from that time
forward, even from his first age, he has (although he were a stranger)
greatly advanced him, which thing we our selves also, have always
successively continued, and day lie augmented more and more, having made him
first of our order, afterward our Leiuetenaunt general in the government of
Holland, Zeland, Vtrecht and of Burgundy, and withal, of our counsel of
estate, bestowing upon him sundry benefits and honors, whereby both by
reason of the oath of fidelity and homages, which he has likewise made unto
us, because also of the fees, pensions, lands and Lordships, held of us in
diverse our Countries and Provinces, he was greatly subjected and bound to obey
us, to keep and hold his faith given, and to procure the good and profit of
our affairs, and consequently to maintain, all quietness and peace in our
estates and countries. Notwithstanding every one knows, that we were not so
soon departed, out of those our low Countries, but that the said William of
Nassau, made Prince of Orange by the means above mentioned, did by his
sinister practices, devises and crafts assaie, first, to get the good wills
of those whom he knew to be discontent, greatly indebted, haters of justice,
studious of novelties, and specially such as were suspected to be of the
religion, bancketting them, provoking them, and drawing them after him, by
fair words, promises, and vain persuasions, even so far, that he was the
principal author, promotor and framer, of the first request, presented by
certain companies of young Gentlemen, who did daily frequent his house and
table: yea that the very plot thereof, was laid in his said house, by and
with the assistaunce of County Ludouick of Nassau his brother a great
heretic. And albeit, that he was the director of al these devises, yet in that
time, he daily haunted the counsel of estate, being present at al consultations
and resolutions, taken and made therein, in so much that every man may easily
mark, the faithful trust that was in him, and the observation of his oaths.
And afterward passing from the said request, and proceeding further, he and his
adherents, brought in hererical preachings, and public assemblies in sundry
places of our said countries, whiles that the Duchess of Parma, our most dear
and best beloved sister (the^ Regentes and general Gouernes of our said low
countries) had sent unto us, that we might give order concerning the said
request. And also, by the advice, knowledge, and partaking of the said P. of
Orange the heretics (being guided by those prese^ters of the aforesaid
request, who were favored by him) began tumultuously to break Images, Alters,
and Churches, to profane al holy and sacred things, yea the sacraments
instituted by god. Nevertheless, by the grace of god, and foresight of the
said Lady, the matters were so well governed and remedied, that he was enforced
to depart out of our countries, and to leave his said governments, yet
notwithout being full of wrath and threatenings that he would be reue^ged
therefore, which thing he thought the year following to perform by arms, but in
vain, for he was so speedily pursued, by our army continually following him at
his heels, that he was driven out, of al our said countries, without being
able to remain in any part thereof. But as soon after, there did in sundry
places appear some disco^tentme^t of our said subjects, against the government
of the D. of Alua (who succeeded the said Lady in the government aforesaid) and
amongst others, in the provinces of Holland and Zeland, so he practiced that he
might return thither again. To which notwithstanding he was not received, but
that first he did holily swear, to the estates of the said countries, and the
towns therein, that he would maintain the said countries and towns for us, and in
our obedience, and that he would not change any thing whatsoever, of the
ancient, catholic, and romish religion, but as a governor only, would assist
and defend them, against the said D. of Alua, if he would enforce, and by
violence draw them to that, which he pretended, that is to say, to the payment
of the x. and xx. penny, of that imposition, which he would charge them withal,
a thing indeed which we never commanded him, neither ever understood to have
bin done, but with the good leave and liking of our said subjects, and yet that
also in the steed of other aids and impositio^s, whereof we meant to vnburthe^
the^. Notwithstanding, so soon as the said Nassau, was entered and received
into the said government, he began by his officers and co^plices, to bring in
heretical preachings in every place where he could, persecuting all the good
pastors, preachers, religious persons, and honest people, whereof he drove
away a great number, and amongst them he caused many of them to be murdered
or else wincked at the murder, that was made of them, by some of his
adherentes until such time as the said Estates, being greatly offended with
this cruelty, would have a reason and an account yielded thereof. but the^ he
feigned that the thing did much displease and dislike him, and yet
notwithstanding afterward, he returned to his first purpose and mark, ill
entreating those, which he knew to be Catholics, and contrary to his
attemptes, arding himself with the council of heretical Ministers, as well
strangers, as of the said country, changing likewise the Magistrates, which
he knew sauoured not his enterprises and purposes, and afterward proceeded to
bring in liberty of conscience, or (to speak truclie) confusion of religion.
Whereupon immediately after it fell out, that the Catholics were openly
persecuted, cast down, and driven away: the Churches and Monasteries both of
men and women broken down, ruinated, and made even with the earth: the
religious persons both men and women evil handled, banished and rooted out,
unless they would play the Apostatates, and become married, for in the other
he had no confidence at all (as also he himself, being before a married man,
his second wife yet living, did take a religious woman and an Abbais,
solemnly blessed by the Bishops hand, whom he as yet keeps with him, the
most shamefast and infamous thing that can be, not only according to christian
religion, but also by the laws of the Romans, and against all honesty) and
at the last, has proceeded so far, that he has not left any more place for
the catholic religion, suffering all the errors and impieties, of all other
sects and heresies, that he might there by, overthrow and root up (if he
would) our catholic and holy religion, which has bin always observed by the
whole estate of Christians.

Furthermore, he has caused our poor subjects of Hollande and Zelande, to be
so susse, and brought them to stand upon such terms, that almost all the
towns thereof, one after an other, have bin besieged and taken, some by
assault, and other some by composition and yielding, in so much that more the^
once, he has bin almost utterly driven out by our armies, until such time
that, the great commander of Castile, being dead, whom we also made successor
in that government after the said Duke of Alua, whom we called back from
thence, that we might make out subjects more contented thereby, things came
into some disorder, and disobedience of Souldiars, who took the town of
Ziriczee, which disorder began to give some favor to the said Nassau: and
immediately after, the estates general of our said Countries, in those
quarters, (desiring once to get out of these miseries of war, persuaded by
the said Orange, saying and feigning that, he desired nothing, but the good
peace and tranquillity of the countries, and to set them free from strange
souldiars, and to hold the country under our obedience, and withal to
preserve therein, the ancient catholic religion, such as it had always bin
exercised and practiced amongst them, and to keep the privileges and
liberty of the said country) did make with him the treaty of Gaundt,
established expressly upon these two grounds, that is, to maintain the said
religion, and obedience to us.

While these things were in handling, we sent our good brother, the late Lord
Don John of Austria, of blessed memory, with commandment and intention to
pacify, reconcile, and accord, all the troubles of our said countries, by the
most gentle mean, and fauourablest way that could be, which thing also he did,
yielding unto our subjects every thing, which any manner of way, might be
granted unto them, ratifying and confirming also, the said treaty of Gaunt,
which he caused to be published in every place, according to the accustomed
manner, which the foresaid Orange did gainesay, by all the forces and power he
had, but not being able to hinder it, he would never afterward cause the
same to be published, in the places of his governments (fretting as is said
because he was not able to let it) notwithstanding that we our selves had
afterward approved, confessed, and confirmed both the one and the other
agreement and treaty, and notwithstanding that our said good brother (together
with the deputies of the rest of the estates, had sent diverse great and good
personages, to the said Orange, to persuade him to that, to the end
effectually to accomplish on his part, that whereunto he was held and bound,
by the articles and points, of the said treaty of Gaunt. And because, that he
pleaded and alleged continually that he ought to recover his whole government,
and withal, that the towns which would not acknowledge him for Governor, or
else those, which afterward we had taken by force of arms, and brought by
some other means into our obedience, should be put under his said government,
he was even in that also satisfied, by the goodness and gentleness of our
said estates, who had not yet the^ sufficiently known his deceits and periuries
yet so notwithstanding, that he should swear that he would change nothing at
al, of the form of the said ancient, catholic and Roman religion, and that
for this purpose, he should give such assurances and satisfactions, as the
magistrates, Burgesses and inhabitauntes of every town, might justly
demand. Whereupon they, having reasoned a long while, touching the
assurances, which every town did demand, to the end that that which the
said Orange promised them, might be observed and kept, they were subjected
under his government, after that he had sworn to perform the points
aforesaid, and other articles contained in the instruments and writings of
the said satisfactions and assuraunces. But, so far of was it, that he has
kept and observed his foresaid promises and oaths, that, on the contrary side,
he immediately brought into the said countries and towns; his ministers and
Caluinistes, preachers, he has caused the heretics, that were banished, to
return, he has there practiced liberty of conscience, and has caused to be
committed, some offenses in some churches joining himself, first to the poorer
sort, and afterward to the magistrates, and has by little and little,
persecuted the good pastors, and caused them to fly away: finally, he has
expelled and banished the whole catholic religion, and forbidden the exercise
and use thereof. In doing of which, he used his ordinary hipocrisies, and
accustomed counterfeiting, saying that those things displeased him, and that
he was not able to remedy the same. And yet notwithstanding he did, both by
himself, and by his Officers secretly, and as it were under hand provoke, all
the seditious and heretical persons, to use and practice the mischief he had
conceived: and for this cause he did (by the aid and assistaunce of those of
his side) place by little and little, garrisons within the towns, against his
couenauntes and promises sworn, and in the mean while ceased not, to accuse
our said Brother Don John, that he privily practiced many mischiefs against
the Estates, which thing notwithstanding, our said Brother has always
assured us not to be true. But rather that seeing the obstinacy and malices of
the said Orange, he might be able to impart the same matter with others, and to
devise how, they might bring him to reason, and hinder him, from again
troubling the whole public quietness, of the said countries, as afterward
he did indeed.

All this notwithstanding, the foresaid Orange left not of, until that by his
practices and subtle sleights (which are very proper to him) he had set such
great diffidence and distrust, between our said brother, and the estates of our
said countries, that there appeared nothing, but a most great, evident, and
apparaunt murder. In so much that, for the avoiding of that disorder, or at
the least to escape the imprisonment of his own person, the said Don John,
placed himself safely, in our town and Castle of Namure. Whereunto he was so
much the more moved, by how much he was not any whit at all armed, and on the
other side, because it was manifest and certain, that the said Orange, by all
his posting messengers and officers, did not cease to provoke the factious
persons, to practice the like thing, upon his own person, as he had the same
year caused to be practiced, upon those of our council of estate, appointed
to the general government, of our said Countries: as also, because that then
the said Orange, thinking that he had gotten all, did begin to shoot out all
his arrows, and to discover his sleightes and weapons, that he might draw our
people into open war, against our said brother and Lieuetenaunt general.
Notwithstanding, by occasion of some good men, being nigh about his person, and
of other virtuous people, on the estates side, the matters came so far, that
all was well agreede, and that for the avoiding of all occasion and distrust,
it was both on the one side, and on the other concluded, that he should
withdraw himself from his government, and go into Italy, which thing also we
our selves wished and willed: And there were with him, the Deputies of the
Estates, mutually to accept and to sign, the offers made on both sides, one of
them to an other. But in ill time, this enemy, the common disturber of public
quietness (who knowing that from the place of Holland where he was, he could
not with all his devices any more hinder this peace and reconciliation) made
haste to come at that very time to Bruxelles, and feigning that he would have
peace, he procured war, setting down new conditions, not yet talked nor
conferred of, nor opened, in so much that he obtained his purpose, breaking
the whole agreement, as every one very well knows. Afterward, the matter
being come to a breaking out, of open and most cruel war, he by force and
tumult of the people, caused himself, against the good will of the Estates,
to be declared, Rewart, that is, the protector or defendor of our Country of
Brabant, and afterward the second Lieuetenaunt of all our low countries, and
also in fine he caused himself by the tumultes of Gaunt and of some other
places, to be chosen governor of Flaunders: having also caused to come
thither, his brother, and brother in law, being strangers, to take upon them,
some other gouernmentes, of our Provinces, and yet notwithstanding, he and his
partakers, burden our people, withal sorts of impositions, exactions,
demaundes, leuies and taxes, so hard, barbarous and tirannous, that the like
has never bin heard of, which he has executed, by a strong hand and force of
arms, without the consent of our people, and without yielding any account
thereof: and if any man speak of these things, he lays hand upon them, or
causes them to be spoiled, evil entreated, imprisoned, or slain.

On the other side it is manifest, what we have continually done, to pacify
and quiet (so soon as we understood thereof) the evil that fell out, as has
bin said, between our said Lieuetenaunt general and the estates. But all the
good that we have done, or our said brother, has bin suppressed and hid, in
steed whereof the said Orange and his partakers, have devised a thousand
slanders, the more to abuse our said subjects. Even as in the obtaining of the
victory of Gembloux, when we sent the Baron of Seelles, with most reasonable
conditions, that he might receive into favor our said Subjects, and accord
the whole matter, nothing for all that followed thereupon, by means of the
hinderaunce and let, which he knew to cast in the way, albeit, that all this
while, our said subjects, writing both to us, and to our good brother and
nephew the Emperor, and other Potentates, to justify the controversies, which
they had against our said Lieuetenaunt general, did openly protest, that they
meant not to change any thing, in the auncieut, catholic, and Roman religion,
such as it had always bin observed, in our said countries, and withal, that
under the practice thereof, they would yield us that obedience which by Gods
law and man's law, was due unto us, which were the only two points which we
always demanded, and demanded then of them, and whereof also we were
agreede. Notwithstanding the said Orange, fearing the reconciliation of our
subjects with us, came so far, that he laid again new devises, not only for
to hinder that matter, but also to make (if he could) for ever, the thing past
hope of recovery, and altogether remediless, by going about to corrupt all
with heresy, whereunto he attained in diverse places, both by subtelties,
crafts, mischeefes, and periuries, well known to him and all heretics, and
also by mere force, using the same that he had practiced before, to wast and
destroy the provinces of Holland and Zeland, casting all into the fire of
popular tumult, and of the sacking of churches, prophanations of sacraments,
murder, or imprisonment of Bishops, Pastors, Jesuits, religious men,
religious women, and of sundry secular parsons, of quality and honor,
breaking against all order of law the priue-ledges, vsages, and ancient
observations, depriving the presidents, Counselors, governors of places,
Bailiffes Prouostes, Sheriues, and other catholic officers, well affected to
us, and the good and quiet of the Country, placing in their steed, and that
extraordinarily and by his own authority, and oftentimes by the tumult of
the people prouolied by him (amongst whom he reigns and triumphs) all
sectaries, seditions men and turbulent persons, living of pray and spoil, and
others like unto himself, in so much that he has brought all to the most
tirannous, barbarous and bloody confusion, that ever yet was heard of.
Wherewith certain catholic provinces being displeased, even to see the
consciences of the good so oppressed, and violently enforced, and the churches,
Cloisters, Abbayes, Castles, and houses of Noble men and great personages, laid
flat with the earth, and their goods given for a pray to all wicked men, at
the discretion and pleasure of this stranger, and the whole estate of the
country subverted by him, yea so far that he meante to constrain whole
provinces, and that against their oath and good will, they did willingly
reconcile themselves to us, which thing he indeauored on all sides, to
gainsaye and hinder, but they were more strong and constant then he, yea, which
is worse, albeit that the said Lord Emperor at the earnest request of the
said Estates (who besought him to be an intercessour, and to make a mean for
a pacification between us and them) was content to take the whole matter into
his own hands, and to determine it, if he could: whereunto for the desire
that we have, to see our people delivered from these calamities, we did
willingly condiscende and agree. And indeed, his Imperial Majesty, sent to
this purpose, his Commissioners to Colen, as well Princes Electors, as others
very principal persons of the holy Empire, to understand the points in
controversy and dispute between us, yet that has no whit at all turned him
aside, nor withheld him, from his wicked and perverse purposes. And indeed,
the said Commissioners, having heard the whole matter, and debated a good while
together upon the demands of the said estates and our offers made thereto,
resolved and concluded, the points and articles which they caused to be
published and imprinted, that they might be accepted both of the one side and
the other. Nevertheless, the whole matter was without any effect or fruit,
notwithstanding that the articles themselves were so gracious, favorable, just,
and reasonable, that there is no man of good judgment, but he confesses, that
they are more then sufficient, and that we have offered more, then by any
reason our subjects ought to demand at our hands.

Whilst this conference and communication endured and lasted, the said Orange,
to the end that he might countermine and work against the Emperor and us, and
so by that means, make all the matter desperate and past hope, caused to be
made in Vtrecht, a certain assembly of the deputies of sundry towns and
countreies, which he keeps under his own power, there to practice a new
league, or a manifest and notorious conspiracy, against the said religion and
us, with execrable and detestable both words and oaths, not abstaining to
injury the commissioners of the said Lord Emperor For which purpose he was
assisted, by his said brother, and brother in law, and other helpers, which
thing also he has wrested and wrong from fundry quarters, by great
provocation, practices, sclaunders, and importunate promises, yea, almost by
force And notwithstanding all the duties performed by the said commissioners,
to cause the provinces to understand their said good and holy resolution, so
profitable for our subjects, he by his adherentes, and certain supposed
persons, which he uses for instruments, has brought to pass that the said
articles, were a long while suppressed and kept close, and when they could not
any longer be hidden, he has not only hindered, that they should not be
accepted, but has procured, that certain pernicious books, stuffed with all
lies and sklaunders should be written against them. And moreover at the last,
the deputies that he has in Antwerp, nigh about him, being of the same
profession, have demanded articles more grievous, impertinent, hurtful,
offensive, and full of impiety against God and us, their sovereign Lord and
natural Prince, yea such articles, as a man cannot speak to much against
them. Besides, when he perceived, that as yet he could not by all his cunning
persuasions and labors wholly obtain the same, he determined with him self
at the length to depart out of Antwerp (from whence he had not starred by more
then two years space) and went into our said town of Vtrecht, to the end he
might accomplish the execution of the said damnable league, and make for ever
all the matters vnremediable. And generally, he has so behaved him self in
all manner of tyranny, that he has driven from thence and rooted out all the
people of the church, yea he has so handled the Lords, and the whole
principal Nobility of our countries, that they have bin enforced to withdraw
themselves and to forsake their countries, to the end that he may reign and
rule there, most absolutely, amongst the furies and tumultes of the people
the good being chased away. And because that all this confusion and curse, that
our countries suffer, is confessed to proceed from the counsel, exhortation,
provocation, and doing of this wicked hipocrite, by means of his unquiet
spirit, which also places the whole felicity thereof, in the trouble of our
subjects: and withal seeing that it is manifest, that so long as he is in our
Countries, there cannot be peace, rest, nor any quietness* establishing all
upon a perpetual distrust which he has ever in his mouth (a very ordinary and
common thing to wicked men, who have their consciences vexed and troubled, as
had Caine, Judas and such like) moreover, seeing that notwithstanding the
entreaties and offers, that has bin made him, even by the Emperors
Commissioners, offering him most great profits, to the end that he would
return to his native country (where every one naturally ought to desire to
live most) he would not accept thereof, and being a stranger, delights
rather to destroy our countries, then to yield to that, which is reasonable
and good, for the benefit of our natural subjects the inhabitauntes thereof.

For these causes which are so just, reasonable and lawful, using in this
behalf the authority that we have over him, as well by virtue of the oaths of
fidelity and obedience, which he has sundry times taken unto us, as also
being the absolute and sovereign Prince of the said low countries, for all his
perverse and wicked deeds, and because he alone has bin the head, author and
promoter of these troubles, and the principal disturber of our whole estate:
to be short, because he has bin the public plague of christendom, we publish
him for a traitor, and a wicked man, the enemy of us and of our countries,
and as such a one have proscribed him, and do perpetually and for ever
proscribe him, out of the said countries, al other our Estates, Kingdoms and
Seignuries, interdicting and forbidding all our subjects, of what estate,
condition or quality soever they be, not to haunt, live, be conuersaunt,
speak, or communicate with him, openly or secretly, nor to receive him or
lodge him in their houses, nor to minister unto him meat, drink, fire, nor
any other necessaries, in any sort whatsoever, upon pain to incur our
indignation and displeasure, as hereafter shall be said. And so we permit all,
whether they be our subjects or others, for the execution of our said
declaration and edict, to stay him, let him, and safely to keep his person,
and to hurt him both in his goods, and also in his person and life, giving the
said William of Nassau over unto all men, as the enemy of mankind, granting
unto every one, al his goods moveable and immovable, that can take, occupy,
or conquer the same, wheresoever they be, except those goods, which are at
this present, in our power and possession. And to the end in deed, that this
matter may be the more effectually and readily performed, and so by that
means our said people the sooner delivered, from this tirannie and oppression,
we willing to reward virtue, and to punish vice, do promise in the word of a
king, and as the minister of God, that if there by any found, either among our
own subjects, or amongst strangers, so noble of courage, and desirous of our
service, and the public good, that knows any mean how to execute our said
Decree, and to set us and himself free, from the aforesaid plague, delivering
him unto us quick or dead, or at the least taking his life from him, we will
cause, to be given and provided, for him and his heirs, in good land or ready
money, choose him whether, immediately after the thing shall be accomplished, the
sum of xxv. thousand crowns of gold, and if he have committed any offense
or fault, how great and grievous soever it be, we promise to pardon him the
same, and from henceforth do pardon it, yea and if he were not before noble, we
do make him noble, for his courage and valiant act: and if the principal
doer, take with him for his aid, in the accomplishment of this enterprise, or
execution of this his fact, other persons beside himself, we will bestow upon
them benefits and a reward, and will give to every one of them, according to
their degree, and according to that service which they shall yield unto us in
this behalf: pardoning the^ also whatsoever they have ill done, and making
them likewise noble. And because, that the receauers, favorers and adherents of
such tirantes, are they which cause them to continue, and do nourish and uphold
them, in their naughtiness, without the which, the wicked could not rule any
long time, we declare all them likewise for rebels against us, and enemies of
the common quiet, and as such, do deprive them of al their goods, nobility,
honors, and favors, present or to come, who, within a month, after the
publication of this present edict, shall not withdraw themselves from taking
part with him, but shall continue to show him favor, and to give him aid, or
otherwise shall haunt, frequent, follow, assist, counsel or favor him,
directly or indirectly, or from this time forward, shall deliver him any
money, giving, all the goods and bodies of such men, wheresoever they may be
found, either in our kingdoms or countries, or out of them, to those that
shall occupy the same, whether they be marchaundizes, money, debtes, actions,
lands, Lordships, and other things whatsoever, except that the said goods, be
already seized in our power, as has bin before said. And that they may the
more speedily come to have sentence, against their said person or goods, it
shall be proof sufficient enough to declare, that they have seen them, after
the time expressed in this proscription, communicate, speak, treat, haunt
openly or secretly with the said Orange, or have showed him particular favor,
assistaunce or aid, directly or indirectlie howsoever, pardoning
notwithstanding all men, whatsoever, even unto the said time they shall have
done to the contrary, if returning back, and submitting themselves again,
under the due and lawful obedience which they owe unto us, they have accepted
or shall accept the said treaty of Arras, concluded at Monts, or the articles
of the deputies of the Emperor determined at Colen.

Thus we give in charge and command, our most dear and faithful, the
heads, presidentes and persons of our privy and great councels, the
Chauncellor and persons of our counsel in Brabant, the Governor, President
and persons of our counsel at Luxembourg, the Governor, Chauncelor, and
persons of our counsel in Gelderlande, the Governor of Lembourg, Faulquemont,
Daelhem, and of others our Countries of Oultremeuze, the Governor, Presidentes,
and persons of our counsels in Flaunders and Artois, the great Bailie of
Haynault, and persons of our counsel at Monts, the Governor, President, and
persons of our counsel in Holland, the Governor, President and persons, of our
counsel at Namure, the Governor, Presidentes and persons of our counsel in
Frieseland, the Governor, Chauncelor and persons, of our counsel in
Oueryssell, the Lieuetenaunt of Groningen, the Gonernor, President, and persons
of our counsel at Vtrecht, the Governor of Lile, Douay, and Orchies, the
Provost and County of Vallanchiennes, the Baylie of Tournay and of Tournesses,
the Rent-masters of Bewest and Beoisterschelt in Zeland, the Judge of Malines,
and all other our Justices and officers, and those of our vassals and Subjects,
whom it shall concern, their Lieuetenantes and every one of them, in respect
of himself, and as though it did appertain unto him, that they cause this our
present declaration, edict and decree, to be published, every one in his
government, and in the places and bounds, of his or their jurisdiction, where
they are accustomed, to make cries and proclamations, to the end that none may
pretend any cause of the ignorance thereof: and moreover that they keep
observe, and maintain, and cause inuiolablie to be kept, observed, and
maintained, all the points and articles therein contained, according to their
form and tenor, proceeding, and causing to be proceeded therein respectively,
to the recompense, reward, pain and punishment of the persons above mentioned,
without any favor, love, or dissimulatio^, and for this purpose, and all
things appertaining thereto, we give them, and every one of them, full power,
authority, and special commau^deme^t, and we charge and command all, that
they obey the^, commau^ding the same and that they understand it diligently.
And nevertheless, seeing that at this present the said publications cannot be
made, in the towns, countries and territories, occupied by the rebellion of
the said Orange, we will that the publications which shall be made, in the towns
nerest thereunto, being under our obeisance, shall be wholly and all together of
such force and effect, as if they had bin utterly done in the circuites and
places accustomed, and for such we have authorized, and by these presents do
authorize them, yea we will and command, that immediately they be printed in
two sundry languages, by the sworn printers of our Universities of Louain or
Douay, to the end that it may more easily come, to al men's knowledge, and this
is our pleasure, appointment, and good will. In witness whereof we have caused
our great seal to be put to these presents, which were made in our town of
Maestricht, the xv. day of the month of March, and in the year of grace 1580.
and of our kingdoms, to wit, of Spain, Sicilia. etc. the xxv. and of Naples
the xxvii.

By the express appointment of his Majesty. Verreiken.
And the said Letters are sealed with the great seal of his Majesty in red wax, and a double lase hanging thereat.



The Letters of the Prince of Parma to the Governors, and Counselors of the
Provinces commanding the publishing of this proclamation.
ALEXANDER Prince of PARMA, and of PLAISANCE, etc. Governor and Captain
general.
MY COSEN, MOST DEAR AND well-beloved friends, seeing the K. my Lord has by 2.
several letters of his, very plainly commanded us to cause incontinently to be
published, in these his countries, the proscription and proclamation annexed
hereto, against W. of Nassau Prince of Orange, for the causes contained in the
said Proclamation, we could not cease to obey his Majesty's commandment, and
to send the same unto you, requiring you, and nevertheless, in the name, and on
the behalf of his Majesty, appoynting you, that immediately, after ye have
seen the same, you publish it, and cause it to be published through out all
the Towns and places of your government and jurisdiction, after the accustomed
manner, to the end, that none may pretend any cause of the ignorance thereof,
and fail ye not herein, and thus my Cosen, most dear and well-beloved
frie^des, our Lord have you in his keeping.

From MONTS, the 15. day of June. 1580, Underneath was written ALEXANDER.
And signed over against it VERREYKEN.
This was the Superscription of it.

To the Governors and Counselors of the Provinces.



THE PRINCE OF Orange, his letters to the ESTATES.
To my Lords, the Estates General.
YOU HAVE KNOWN (MY LORDS) BY my life past, and by my behauiours, that I
never minded to answer to any libels of defamation, which certain
sclaunderers had published against me, in so much as if the quality and
greatness of the wrong, which has been done against me by the proscription
that the King of Spain, has caused to be published, I had not as yet
proceeded so far, especially had it not been that the maintenance of mine
honor, had requested the same of me, as I have more largely laid out the
same in my defense, which I have presented unto you. Since which time, there is
come into my hands a letter very false and counterfayt by mine ennemy, which
they say they intercepted, and I sent to my lord the Duke of Aniou, or (as
they say) to the Duke of Alancon, whereof some personages amongst them, and
that of great quality also have sent copies, as well to certain towns of
our side, and amongst us, as to sundry strange and foreign princes. This
letter my Lords is so fondly written (whether a man regard the style thereof
or will respect the matter therein contained, which by the bare reading thereof
sufficiently bewrays, that there is not in it any show of truth) that such an
impudent devise deserves no answer: as also God be praised, there is not
found a man amongst us, which is any whit at al moved therewith. On the other
side, every man has known, that they had no other meaning hereby, but by such
mistes and smokes, to darken the brightness, by which their miserable and
pernicious inte^r against this country, has bin discovered by the letters of
Cardinal Granduell and others which you have commanded to be printed, after
that you knew their hands, their signs, and their seals, and withal thereby,
to take unto them selves an occasion and matter, to cast up and spew out
(acording to the manner of shameless women) slanderous, and wicked speeches,
full of lying. But so far of is it, that by this means, they have (inrespect of
me) obtained that which they pretended, that on the other side, they have done
me great pleasure, in publishing such follies because that thereby they do
more and more justify and verify my defense, sufficiently proving them selves
to be shameless liars, most impudent slaunderers, and most fond falsifiers,
which serves more and more to justify (as I have said) mine innocence, and
to give approbation to all my actions. For, seeing that all men know, that this
should be the best news, that they could receive or hear of, that I would
forsake the country, and leave it to them, I offered them (my Lords) and you
under my honor, do promise them to accomplish it, if they be able to prove in
your presences, that I have at any time written, or commanded to be written,
or sent such a letter, that presently I will depart the country, and withdraw
my self from it, without ever setting my self against them: and I promise
them, even upon a simple or bare request to send the^ such passeportes and
safeconducts, and they also penned in such order, as either they can or will
demand. But yet this shall be with this condition, that if they will not accept
this so reasonable an offer, all they which have bin the authors of such a
writing, or which have published it, or which have sent it, into the towns
amongst us, or to foreign Princes, and strange countries, shall be held for
liars, slaunderers, and wicked speakers, as indeed such they are.

Given at Delft the 25. of January. 1581.
