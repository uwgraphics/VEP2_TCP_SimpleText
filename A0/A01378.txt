(...) as it apperyth in this little treatise / how that god has ordained
him self / for our wealth a new law and commandment to be written in our
soft hertes / and therein steadfastly it to be graven with faith / where the old
law and testament was graven in tables of stone / sygnyfy^ge the hardness and
obstynacy of the (...) of the people of Isra ell / which laws were very
tedyous to them / in observing / and yet they considering little the great
benefaytes and ordynaunc^ that god did for them in desarte / as (the four bok^
of Moses) makes me^cyon of at large. Where now god of his goodness came from
the d^yety of his glorious father / and is become both god and man. And he
has given unto us / a new law / which is very easy / sweet / and light (as
matthew the euangelyst wytnessyth. xi.) And also co^mau^dyng us in his last
soup^ (...) saint John^ writes in the. xiii. chapter.) I give unto you a new
law or commandment / which is that ye love charitably each other / as I
have loved you / the which law I have a little expressyd in this lyter
Myrrour / unto the edefyenge and comfort of my self and all my brethren and
neygh bours / which is every christian man of what degree so ever that god has
called him unto. Consyderyng in my mind therefore / the great fraylte and
abusyon / and enormyte of living of christian people / which god* has chosen
only of his mere mercy to be his christian children in adopcyon / and has
ordained us to be merytours with him in his glorious eternal patrimony. And I my
self one that has lived many years in the enormyte and ambusyon of
vaynglorye / Iugynge my self a good christian man / and yet I was sore deceived /
unto the time for tuned me to behold and look stedfastlye in the goodly / and
most pure Myrrour of life: where I might euydently se / perceive and have
perfyte knowledge / of my foul enormyte / and shameful lyuynges / which
myrrour is the holy words of god / by the writing of the eua^gelyst and of
saint Paul in his pystles / called the new testament. And the more I looked in
this most pure glass: the more knowleg I had of my sow le spotted soul in
the sight of god / and per ceyued my self what I was / and what danger / and
case I lived in many years / most ly ke to lodge my poor soul in hell / if
the great exceeding mercy of god had not ben. Who is always redye to call
sinners unto him. And so when I perceived my self so far out of the true
right way / I saw also in this foresaid goodly (Myrrour of ly fe) that I was
not only bound to enlumy ne my self: but also to enduce my brethren and
neighbors / and charitably to socour and counceyll them perceyuyng that they
were so far from the truth by ygnorau^sy: and herein not Iugynge no man /
for I do find in the foresaid (Myrrour of life) that I may know and pceyue my
neighbor by his fruytes: and also from the heart / the tongue (will express
and show out of the mouth) at one time or other what the person is / or else
by his deeds. Even as ye may perceive and know all sorts of trees by their
fruy tes. By the which perceyuaunce and knowle ged I conceived i my mind /
the great enor myte of sin reygnynge in the common peo ple / where as I
frequented / and had co^uersacyon with often times. And were more like in
living to Pagans and Turks / inexersysynge the true and charytable ly fe of
christian men / the which we boldly do afferme ourselfes to be. (And are not so
in deed) for our fruyt^ and deeds be no thing like the pure and clean life /
which christ does show unto us by his elect and chosen prechers / of his
most blessed word: which is the new Testament / in the which pure Myrrour
all christian men may euydently se their deformytes and abhomynable foul spots
of stynkynge fylthynesse / toward the sight of god. Also in the said Myrrour
all christian people may casely perceive and find the means and ways to
puryfye and cleanse all such foul spots that appear in the fight of god in
that most precious sou le of man (which was bought with so pre cyous a pryse
as the blood of christ.) Meruay lynge again of the mondayne people of this
miserable world / the which regard so light the word of god / procedynge
out of his own mouth / which is daily express syd unto us by his chosen and
elect / which god has given grace to erudyt / and express by the holy ghost
/ the pure sentence of clean living / which wese and perceive in this
foresaid goodly Myrrour. They repreue and swell / murmr / and dysdayne / both
against god and his word / and the pronou^cer or speker thereof / supposyng in
them selfs / and Iugynge them and it / to be the most poison and daungerest
counsel and exortacyon that may be. And specially those that has seen and
looked in this foresaid Myrrour (Beatus qui perseuerauerit vsque ad finem hic
sal^s erit. mat. xxiiii.) and they be so blind that they will not se / nor be
known of their most foul stynkynge deformytyes. No more then does the foul
sow (which has pleasure to walowe in stynkynge mire / or else as the dog
which returns and receives his foul vo^et again) as witnesses. ii. Peter.
ii. And surely all such wylful and ygnoraunt people appear more abhominablyer
in the sight of god: which repyne against god and his word / whose doors of
their hertes and conscience be so fast barred and shut / that the grace of
the holy ghost can not enter therein. No more then did / or could / the
commandment of god by Moses in to the hard hertted Phaaro / which was
oppressyd with so ma ny terryble vengeaunces one after another For the
withstanding of the children of Israel (Exodi. xiiii.) Considering therefore
the great ambusyons and enormytes of our daily fylthy living / and so little
amendment daily of them / I ferynge the dreadful wrath and Ire of god / which
suddenly might fall upon us / for our sinful living and obstynacy. And in so
dre dynge his omnipotent power / motyonede me thorugh his benynge grace (which
styred me / of pure charity) to pen this little Myrrour out of diverse books
/ of good auctoryte when I had little to do / in aduoydynge Idelnesse.
Trusting in god that it might reduce some to the true life and understanding
/ and call again some faith full people / which was as far passed out of the
right way as ever I was. Also in trusting to god with the often redynge he
reof some shall open the doors of their hert^ and conscience thorugh the grace
of the holy ghost / with their dylygent will and mind / much sooner then in
redynge of Fables tales / balades of fylthynesse: whereof proce death no virtue
nor goodness. Desiring now therefore all christian people of their cha ryte to
have pacyence of my rude and gross sentence and english / this being the
first wherein I might possible err / trusting that they will accept my
sencere will and mind / and in no wise do I presume as an Auctour or a
translatour / but only for the pure love and compassyon that I had on my
christian brothren living in so great danger. And so trusting that they may
have grace of a mendemete (By the which the honor of god may be increased /
with whom remains all Joy glory and felycyte / To the which he bring us
all at his pleasure and will.

Amen.

THere ends the Chapytres of this present book.
The Myrrour / or lokyng glass of life.
The first chapitre contains the dyffynycyon of faith, and of good warkes
suffycyent for any man to lene to. The first Chapytie.
Faith according to the mind of saint Paul / is the substance of a thing
(which does not appear / and the foundacyon of things that can not be seen)
I spe ke not of such faith as lawers and merchants and such other worldly
people use: one with an other. But of the faith that we have in christ Ihesu /
and because that we may know him the more parfytely by his propertye / as ye
may perceive and understand / how man and wife be coupled to gyther by love /
in like manner does faith couple and knyt spyrytually man's soul / steadfastly
to believe that god is omnipotent above all. For what a greatter pleasure or
^oue can any creature do unto go^: (...) stedfastlye to believe that all truth
only restyth in him / and in his most blessed word and promise which never
failed nor ne uer shall / as wytnessyth the Euangelyste fayeng. Lelum and
terram transibunt: verba mea aute^ manebit. (Heaven and earth shall fail but my
word and promise shall never fail. And contrary wise there can be no more
greatter dishonor or blasphemy to god / then to put dystrust in him / or thyn
^ynge in him any unstableness or (...) ring from any thing that he has
promy sed us / ye will say again that man and woman does seeche other and
has co^munycacyon to gyther / which causes love and encreasyth the faith of
matrymony together in them / Forsothe in like manner has the loving and
faithful soul or spyryte of mankind spyrytually in god / the which faith
must be in us a steadfast believe / and asure trust in the glorious goodness
of god the blessed Trynyte / which is the Father / the sone / and the holy
ghost / three pe^ sons and one god / which is creature of ^uen and earth / and
of all things that (...) therein / for the wealth and co^modyte o^ (...) / and
so shall contynewe by hi^ (...) myse unto the world^ end. Also ye shall
understand at the beginning god made Angel in heaven / among the which was
Lucyfermoste glorious: which conceived in his mind to be equal with god and
next god. And at the very same moment or thought / he and many other
aungellys which offendyd with him (fell) from that glorious eternal place /
in to the depest place of hell / where they shall ever co^tynew in pay ne and
darkness intolerable without end. Also ye shall understand that in conty
nent after all things created necessary for mankind / god created Adam and
Eve / most like unto his image and symylytu de / And did set them in a place
of celestyal pleasure / and gyuynge them lybertye over all things that was
therein / Except of the fruit and tree of life which had the virtue of knowledge
of good and evil.

Chargynge them in no wise to taste nor cate thereof. And if they did they should
dye* but they tarried not there but a little while not passing three houre^
after the mynd^ of some Doctors / for Lucyfer which (...) having yet / great
indygnacyon and power over mankind / conceived in his mind / against Adam and
his succession a secret malice / ^tendynge to b^nge them out of the favor of
god / tho^ugh ^kyng o^ ^is co^maundem^nt (And so he did in deed) ^or first he
caused (Eve to taste and ^ate o^ the tree of life / which was forbo^ (...) /
and she caused Adam to eat of the same) for the which cause god sent Cherubyn
his angel to them with the sword of sorrow / and trybulacyon / and
banysshed them and th^yr succession out of y^ solacyous place o^ plea sur^ / in
to this miserable (...) ^to labor and get their living in (...) of his bo die
/ and in like wise all his succession. And Eve also in great p^ynes and t^auayl
and dystresse / to bring for^ (...) of man for her o^ence. The which penance
shall not fail mankind / while this wo^ld en dureth. And when they were exyled
out of Paradyse / they were vy^ns knowing no carnal affeccions. And. xxx.
year after they had ysshewe of a sone named Cayn. And. xxx. year after they
had* ysshew of a another sone named Abell / whom Cayn slew for his Just
sacrefyse to god / wherfo te god took vengeance of him and all his p^ogenye.
And the hundred and. xxx. year (...) Adam a^ge / he had ysshewe o^ another sone
named Seth / of whose lynage many years after succeeded Abraham / in whom was
wrought the orygynall and pryncypall (...) of faith before al other creatures /
of the which (...) Christ as scriptur makes mencyon. Also this Abraham by
faith steadfastly gave cred^ns to the word of god when he co^mmaunded him to go
out of his own cou^^ / which was. in. days Journey (...) to the (...) of
Canaan / and he g^ue sure fayt^ and trust in the promyses of god / the which
were fulfilled to him in d^de. Also by faith Sara his wife being paste a^ge by
course and by nature / she had ysshewe of a sone named Isaac. Also by faith
Abraham at the commandment of god / would have offered to god his oonlye sone
ysaac in sacryfyce / wherein his faith was reputed to him for right wysnesse /
and was Iustyfyed by that faith / as Paul witnesses of him and of many more
in the. (xi. chapter to the Hebreos) where he makes mencyon of faith more at
large / suffy cye^t for any Lrysten man / And also in most part of all his
epystles for them that do ground them in the true faith of christ out of the
which proceeds / all virtue and grace / as paul ascrybeth in the said chapy
tree. (That without faith it is in possible to please god /) for no pson may
come to god / but he must have steadfast trust / and sure faith in him only.
And after Abraham. 5099. years and more / the most part of the people of the
world lived in wretchedness and sin / and in the dysplasour of god / and
never were able of our selves to have risen again. But it pleased the father
of heaven / of his infynyt goodness and mere mercy and pity to send out of heaven
in to this wretched world his only sone the second person in trynyte / our
savior Thesu christ and suffered him to be borne of the most pure and clean
vy^gyn Mary. And took upon him to be a mortal man: for pure love that he had
unto mankind. And lived here upon earth. xxxiii. year and more / both god and
man / in mo^he trouble and vexacyon and pain / and always without spot of sin
/ and fulfilled the law in all thyng^ for us and made satysfaccyon for us and
our offenses. And in co^clucyon suffered his most precious and tender body to
be taken in the night / of the scrybes and pharysees / which in contynent with
great tygoure / put his most precious body to great pains and torments (so
pyteously) that from the crown of his hedde unto the sole of his feet / there
was no place hole / but ^ent and bruised. And wyllyngly he offered his most
precious bo die on the cross / unto the death for us / whtche at that time was
the most shamphullest death that might be devised.

O / what kyndnes was showed in him and is daily / and so little in us / for
the which cause we be all ^ly bound to love him / and serve him / with all
our hertes / with all our minds / and power / and to put all our hole trust
and confydence pryncypassy in him only / and not to trust in our own merytes
and werkys only / supposing thereby to obtain the glory of heaven. The which
trust or faith had the Pelagy en^ / against whom largely saint Austyn does
write / which were Heretykes / and held that opinion. God forbid that any
christian man should have that mind / or trust the ^n. Now albeit that no man
having here time nor space in this world / may be saved without good werky^:
yet be not our good werkys the chief cause of our salvation. Yet nevertheless
must we needs do good werkys / if we love god / the which love compels a
man to do good werkye / only for the (...) all graces and gift (...) / which
we receive of him and from him daily / by the which our sp^te or soul ^eth
/ and st^eth us (to do good werkys) (...) our co^s^yence as in example: what
man a ^rue / that is (...) and receives of his lord or (...) great ^ee and
reward that will not busy / or indeuer him self / to work or do though it be
to his pain / any thing lawful to his own profit / and his soueraygnes
pleasure / in like ma^er our good werk^ done) for the love and the honor of
god / in fulfyllynge his comau^ / brings us unto eternal life / for christ
says if thou wyl^ enter in to life / observe and do my co^mau^deme^t^. Mat.
19. Iaco. 2. And saint James in a pystle sayt^e / that faith without good
werkys / is but deed and void in the sight of god.) Yet I may not
presumptuously think thereby my self* precellynge other / and thereby supposyng
to o^ tayne an excellenter place or Ioyeth heaven (so trustyng) we be deceived
(as Theoph^lact. writes upon the* xviii. chapter of Luc.) saying there is
no man can do any good werkys / (...) i^ pro^eth fy^ste from the grace of god
(...): so then if the (...) come only from him / why shall we t^en glory in
our werkys / then says (...) the se^onde pystle / the. x. chapter to the ^o
(...). O^ (...) in d^o glorietur. He that will glory or magnyfy let h^ glory in
god / and magnyfye him only) as we have aparable in the gospel of Luc. (...)
chapter of the Pharase and the publycan / which ca^ in to the church to pray:
the holy and cerymonyall pharase / trusting in his ho ly garments and his
outward apparent per ^yory / said / I thank the good lord that I am not like
yonder wretched publycan / which gets his living synfully / And so forth
magny^yenge him self / and the pore publycan ^elynge / and sore repentau^t for
his living / cried god mercy humbly and repentau^tly / whom christ accepted
sayen^ that he reto^ed home to his house again much more Iustyfyed: then the
proud cery monyous pharase / saying there. (He that wylbe highest: precellynge
other: shall be made ^o west) thus we may pceyue that our good werkys be not so
merytoryous of our self to obtain thereby glory / and an higher place in heaven
for that Judgment is reserved to the secrets of god only (as saint Luc. 17.
says that when we have done all the good dedys that we can / yet shall we
find that we be unprofitable servants) in the Iu gement of god / for no man
syns the offenses of Adam unto this day / nor that shall come unto the end of
the world / was ne uer able to merit heaven / of his own good werkys / as
apereth in scripture they went all in to lymbo. A place of no solace / but of
darkness / no not the ^ayth nor perfeccyon of (...) John^ baptyst / could not
meryt the glory of heaven in crystes time / before christ had fulfilled the
Prophesyes and the redemp^yon of mankind. O what blyndnes and fo^sshnesse then
were in us that would trust in our good dedys and werks (only for to have the
glory of heaven by them /) for then christ nedyd not to have suffered for our
^dempcion in his humanyte wherefore tho to we faith let us do the best that we
can / and it shall be little enough for saint Johan says in his pystle
canonycall. 1. Io. 1. if we say or suppose that there (...) no sin in us / we
seduce and danger our selfs in so doing / also Dauit the prophet in (...).
13. there is none that is good: no not one.) where fore I counceyll all
faithful christian people / to have strong faith in god / that his only sone
Thesu christ / the second person in trynyte / has only all hole and perfytly
redemyd us / with his most precious blood in his humanyte / where one drop
had been suffycyent if he had pleased / yet notwithstanding let us do all the
good werkys that we can / and suffer trybulacyons / or psecucyo^s / and live as
charitably as we can to fulfill the laws / and follow the word of god / as
nere as we may / in auoydig vayn glory. De o^ verbo ocioso redditu^ (...) in
die iudi^ii. (For every idle word / or thought spoken in vain / we shall g^e a
strayt account at the dreadful day / or (...) meant general / In like wise no

nere as god shall give us grace for of our selue ha ue we no good as Paul
says. Quid habesque no^ accepisti. Co. 4* (What have we yt we have not
received / then if we have received / why do we glory in our self as tho ughe
we have not received.) Also we that do any good werkys / for fere of dampnacy
on or for the trust of the salvation only is not acceptable to god: For that
we do must be done with pure faith / and steadfast love in god desyryng in our
hertes / always that we might never dysplease him again / and when we have done
the best that we can. Luc. 17. to reken that we have done but our duty:) and
unworthy to inheryte the king dome of heaven / by our merytes only / but
thorughe the infynyt goodness and mercy of god / and by the merytes of Crystes
passion and death on the cross / and shedynge his most precious and innocent
blood / so pl^n tuously / for our offenses and unkindness And thus he most pure
innocent without fault has so kyndly done for us / wherefore all creatures
living give always honor and glory to god eternal / which has ma de us

Amen.

how all christian men should ofteremembre what a bond we have pro fessed at
the font of baptysme. The. ii. Chapter.
COnsyderyng often in my mind the great frayste of christian people / so little
regarding the great excellency / that god of his mercy and goodness has
called us unto / but daily renew like wild coltes unbridled following all our
own sensual pleasures / and nothing calling to remembrance when we are come
to the full years of dyscrecyon and knowledge / the most highest and excellent
Relygyon that we have professyd / at the font of baptysme nor yet reme^brynge /
what our god fathers and god mothers there promised for us / when we were full
impotent and pore / where fore me thinks great infydelyte and mysery in such
persons which calls not to remembrance what he was: and in what case he
stands in / and whereto he is like to come. First we were borne in orygynall
sin and naked in to this world / most pore of ourselfes of all creatures
that beryth life.) And then again new borne or regenerat by the merciful
goodness of god / and ordynaunces of the blessed sacrament of bap tysme /
which sygnyfyeth that we are therein washed clean from all dangers of the
devil / our most enemy / by the most ^ender passion of christ Thesu /
wherefore it is very expedyent / for us often to call to our remembrance / what
promyses that we ha ue made at the font stone. First we promy se to forsake
the devil and all his werkys dampnable / then we enter in to faith / whi che
is the root of all virtue and o^ good werkys / promising with steadfast faith
to by leave in god our father eternal / the sone our ^edemet / and the holy
ghost our daily com forte / three persons and one god as it is mo re plainly
made mencyon of in o^ Cred^. Also we there profess to observe and keep the
laws of god: which is contained in his Testament as the holy gospellys / and
pre chynge of christ which ye may read and he reprechyd of / the true
faithful prechers of crystes church. And not only to here it / but also to
root it in our minds and hert^ / and with all our dylygence to follow the
same as nere as we shall have grace. As cry ste wytnessyth by (saint Luc. the.
xi. chapter / blessed be they that here the word of god and keep it
faithfully in mind and follow the same.) Wherefore I counceyll all christian
people often to have in mind: as well in posperyte as in trybulacion: what an ex
cellent Relygyon we have professyd / and how we be elect and chosen people by
the high favor of god / the which professyon that we have professyd is very
easy for every christian man to keep (if he will) for cryst^ faith. Tribue mihi
cortu^. Live me thy willing or loving heart and mind / he desires no more
of no man. And in so doing / he gives us again power to su^de we and ouercom
all our aduesaryes ^n trybulacion: the which daily does assay ^e us / as well
in trybulacions as in prospe ^yte* for saint Paul says that christ will not
suffer no man to be charged with temp tacyon further then he may bear) ye in
our most need does he releue those that trust faithfully in him. Christ
says also in the euangelyst. Mat. 11. (my yok is swet and plea s^unt / and my
burden is light and easy) and so it is in deed) to all true loving and faith
full people / and as grievous and paynfull to them that be the children of
dampnacion (As ye wolds^y) (...) and malyc^ ous / people sclaunders / bacby^ers
/ sweters blasph^mers / ^nyere of god / and fo^ycatours / strife makers / liars
/ thieves* murderers / symonyers / and reprochers of the worcester de of god / cloked
herytyk^ which are sty^e neckyd / and obstynat / and vsu^ers / with many other
dyabolicall sorts / which search and can find nothing but the hye (...)
eternal dampnacyon / both of body and (...) le. O merciful lord god that
ever (...) sten man should be infected with an^ (...) like dampnable condycyons
/ which (...) of his mercy has called by baptysme and (...) de inherytoures
with him in his celestyall Ierarchyes and glory that will thus like mad men
ragynge like brute bestes / ^on hedlynge in to hell / where ever is woe / sorrow
/ pain / i^tollerable without end. (And here in ^ayth seit Barnarde I do
meruayl: ye and meruayll again that any man da^e adventure to live in such
estate of life / wherein he dredeth to dye in.) And death always so ready and
sudden at hand / whose sudden stroke all kinds of life dredeth. Now what
remedy against al such dau^ gers / surely none but ^yrste call for grace / and
knowledge our wylfull and sinful werk^ and call to remembrance our first
faithful promise / and according to the same to forsake the devil and his

How that scripture is very vtyle and profitable to read / with ryghtouse
using the same. The. vi. Chapter.
I ^olde every young man in void ty mes would exercise their pastyme in
redynge of holy scryptures / for I fy^ de no thing more better to stablysshe
out conscience. Also therein shall You find pre cyous preseruacyo^s against
all vices / fo: them that dylygently will apply it in ver tue: As when ye be
tangled or snared wi^h voluptuous pleasures / read the first pystle to the
Corynthea^s. vi. chapter / to auyode delectacyons of thy flesshely body for
no sin deedly / that a man does defyleth his own body / but only
fornycacyon (and Paul says to the Thessolanyons this is the will of god
which is your sanctificacyon / that you refrain from all concupyssence or
lecherous affeccyons) these places / and diverse other in scripture / does
provoke a man to refrain all carnal affeccio^s: and does cool and swage the
cruel hete of man / which naturally can not be avoided but only by arace.
Also scripture does not only monysshe us: but also noryssheth v^ through the
virtue of the holy ghost / to ob^ serve all thyng^ that we read or here therein.
Also if thy nature be so strong that tho^ can not avoid the danger thereof:
then man ste thou mary a wife. 1. Co. 7. Paul say^ better it is to mary then
to bren or to deffyl^ thy body which is the temple of god / Pau le exorteth
the Ephesians. 1. Ephe. 4. to use no ^ylthy or dishonest words to come out of
your mouths / but such as be fruyt^ in edefyenge each other.) Also be ware of
a lecherous ^ye / which is the preuyest enemy that the body has against the

Of the blind Judgments of people / concerning the secrets celestyall in
the merytes of saints. And how a cry sten man shall vow and use him in vows
and pylgrymages and oblacyons. The. vii. Chapter.
WHere as I do daily here and se great dynysyons: and opy nyons / the one
contrary to a another / among christian people / which have or should ha ue one
faith / one god / and one especyal me dyatour unto god. 1. Thy. 2.) For us
which is christ Thesu our redemptor (as paul ascrybeth to the Corynthyans. 2.
epistle / et Ephe. 4. Notwithstanding we have many folysshe fantasyes now
adays in Iud gementes o^ ^e secret mysteryes of god / in reasonynge and
dyssputynge / which engenders sysines / and folysshe blind opynyo^s among
christian people / some will say why or how is this man fallen in decay / syc^
nesse / or myschaunce being a good man. And why is such one auaunced in
welth^ dygnyte / and prosperyte being an oppressor of pore people / and a
vysyous person in living / hereupon shall be said diverse oppynyo^s passing
man's reason / which pertayneth only to the Judgments of god / and not of
man / for christ says here to. Nost^e iudicare et non iudicabimini. Also some
will reason on the merytes and ly^ynge of sayn^: which of them was holye^ then
the other / or hyer in favor with god: often times such quest^ons engenders
stryfes and sysmes / with dyuers^ties of opynyons / and so proceeds thereof
envy / pride / and vain glory / when one preferryth this saint / and another
that saint / and one this pilgrimage / or image / and another ^at pilgrimage
and image suerly these sensual opynyons rather d^spleaseth saints / then
pleases them For the lord omnypotent says I am not the lord god of d^bate
or strife: but of unity and p^as / which stands in true meekness / and not
in exalting or magnyfyeng this or that / some be more styred to thr^ saint or
pilgrimage / then to that other / (...) and that with great mind and aff^yon.
Trewely such mind or aff^yon is more worldly and carnal / then celestyall or
spyrytuall or godly / says not god am not I he that has made all saints (yes
trewly.) And more over he says I have given the^ grace / and I have given them
glory: I am only s^ete to all their meryt^ / I prevented them with the
swetnesse of my blessings / I know mine elect and chosen people before the
world was created / I have chosen them from the world / and they have not
chosen me: I called the^ by my grace. And I drew them by my mercy / I led them
through all temptacyons I sent them inward comfortes / I gave them
perseueraunce / I crowned their pacyence / I know the fyr ste man and the last
/ I love them all with such love as can not be estemy^ on earth. And thus
says our lord am I to all my saynt^ in all thyng^ to be praised and honored
/ and in all and every of them / whom I have gloryously magnyfyed and
predestynated without any merit in them going before me. Therefore he that
disprayseth the left of my saints / does no honor to the greatest: for I
have made both the less and the more. And he that dyspyseth any of my saints
he disprayseth me / and also other of my saints in the kingdom of heaven / for
they be all one / and fast united and knyt together in one sure bond of perfyte
charity and they love me much more then them sel^ / or their own merytes /
for they b^ rapt above their own love / and holy abide in my love / in the
which they rest by eternal fr^y syon. Wherefore let every man cease of their
carnal minds and aff^ccyonat opynyons bestly / which can not love but prynat
joy to search the state of my (...) in heaven for ye Judge after your folysshe
and blind sentence / and not after the pleasure of the eternal truth of god.
Thus in much people is great Ignorancy: and specially in them that have so
little light of ghostly understanding: that they can not love no person with a
clean heart / we may not ymagyn ce lestyall thyng^ as we do terestyall for they
be so fa^e in dyfference and unlike that no heart nor iye / nor tongue can
esteem or judge as Paul testyfye to the Loryntheans / the. ii. chapter. They
be very well contented with the Joy that they are in so men co^ de refrain
them selves from such vain arguments. Also many there be that will reason
who is highest in heaven: and such know not whether they be worthy them selves to
be nombred with the lest that shall come thy there / for it is a great thing to
be one of the lest in heaven: where al be noble or excellent For all that shall
come thither shall be called the sons of god / and so shall they be in deed /
as saint Paul witnesses to the To mayns the. 8. chapyt^e. Quicu^que enim sp^
de^ aguntur h^ sunt fil^ dei. All those that work in the spyryte of god they
are suerly the children of god do ye not consider what the mother of the sons
of zebedei desired of christ that the one might sit on the right ha^ de / and
the other on the left hand when he should come to his kingdom what answer gave
he / Mat. xx. chapter. Non est meum dare vobis sed quibus paratum est a patre
meo. It is not to me to grant you / but for those which my father has
prepayred it for wherefore let all christian people leave all such mystycall
reasons concerning to the one ly hye dyuyne power of god / which never erthly
creature has had nor shall have kno weleg of / wherefore this suffyseth to a
good christian man. And so to proceed also to se and here the great dyuersy^es of
minds and opynyons / one contrary to the other greuyth my conscience very fore
/ Reme^br^ge the very true sayenges of christ. And here in d^dynge his
omnipotent power: where as the Euangelyst says. Mat. (...). chapt. Om ne
regnum in se (...) desolabitur. Which of c^aryte moves and compels me /
some thing to my pore understanding / for the ins^ruccyon of the simple
ygnorant which gladly would do that which were pleasure to the will of go^ /
and prof^te to their souls: in avoiding the abusyons of all such thyng^ /
wherefore as con^rnynge Pylgrymag^ I think it very expedyent and helpful / as
concer^ynge the mocyon and intent thereof / music needs be good and acceptable
to god if it be done according to his will and pleasure. And again if we
mind / or do it for any affection for our own solace and pleasure. In so
doing it avails little / and in it apperynge more ypocrysy / then
perfeccion. Then when ye are moved to any Pilgrimage by power dyuyne / or by
aduersyte constrained by hop^ as by se^ / or on land / or fire / or any other
peril. And then when ye vow or make any promise or pilgrimage: give your hole
honor unto god first / with heart and mine de. And then vow or promise no
more in that extremyte / then thou wylt perfytly perform / when the time
comes. And then do it with dys^cyon / and soberness / auoydyng all vain
glory / and in your pilgrimage call unto your remembrance / what god of his
mercy did for you: at the vow or pro myse making / and with faithful mind do
it in the way of penance / and repentaun ce / of your misdeeds and sins /
and in willing no more to offend god to your pow er and will / and when ye
come where you have vowed. Then in no wise / suppose or think yt the same
Karued image or pain trd pycture / wrought with man's hand / has any
lyfelynesse or grace / or comfort no more than has any image of the same sort
in your parysshe church / or else where / and if you have any other trust or
confyden^ in them / you do plain ydolatry before god. Also be the place never
so holy / and the pyc ture or image / appear never so glorious or curyous in
sight / be you well ware of any trust or confydence in them: for in so doing
you dyshonoure god / as apperyth exodi. (32. chapitre. And to the Corynthyans.
x. chapytee ascrybeth partly) how we shall do in this cause (and in the. (...).
commandment / we find written. Thou shalt not make the no graven or karued
image / nor to any symylytude that is in heaven above / nor on the earth / nor

read and ye shall find what they be / wherefore god forbid that any cr^sten man
should have any such like confydence in them* Reserve that point only to god
/ with out any scrypulosyte of conscience / with will and deed. And in so doing
you do fulfill your pilgrimage purely and trewely: both to god and to the
presentacyon of the image / which gloryfyeth in the will of god in heaven / as
we do or should do here in earth / sant^fy his name and glory in him. But we
often times do our own folysshe cerymonyall wylles or pleasures / which are
but fantas^es and vain glory / whereof we shall never have thanks. For though
they appear never so glorious to the people And also as concerning your
oblacyons be it gold / silver / wax / or lyghtes / I suppose it comes of
your own fre will and devotion to o^fer what ye list / without any (...) on /
and I do consider it to be well done / so you hurt not your self nor your co^
science therein / pond^ here in your conscience how the will of god is
santefyed in us: when he charge us to do the werk^ of mercy to the pore and
ned^: which is the blessed image of god / (and that ye give or offer to the
lest of them / ye do it to christ him self says the euangelyst Mat. 25.) what
a more blessydder image is there in this worl de / then the lively image of
christ / which was bought with so precious a pryse / and such a multitude as we
have round about us and so little refresshynge and offering to them / which
peryssheth daily under our ^oses / great pity to se / the which causes me to
tremble / to remember the horrible rebuke that they shall have of god / the
which waste their substance and goods in Ior neys / in riding / and going
far and nere / and in superfluous raiment / and meats / and drynkes / with
many other cerymonyall and wylfull charges / I would to god such people had
the grace to remember the true we example that christ spoke. (Luc / the. xvi.
chapitre of dives ^pulo how little he regarded the pore Lazer and so great
need as he had of his comfort shortly after) (mark that point) thus I could
write a long process here in tochyng the abusyons of the ignorant people /
in this matter / wherein I pray Thesu give to all such as be yet igno raunt /
his grace that they may work their good works to the will and pleasure of
god. Nevertheless I do think / and allow pyl grymages and oblacyons very
expedyent in the sight of god / and profitable to the soul / so that it be
done according to the law^ and will or pleasur of god. And other wy se it is
frustrat and void be you sure / whereof you shall never have thanks nor favor
of god / for your wylfull wasting / and (...) will not do that which ye be
commanded to do. Wherefore I hold it most profitable and expedyent for every
faithful christian man to search his conscience here in / and ra there to do the
will and pleasure of god here / then his own mind and pleasu^ / whereof ye
shall receive so great and inestymable gifts / and rewards again in the
glory eter nall where as god reyneth with his glorious aungellys / and saints
which never sease in gyuynge honor / glory without en de / to the which he

Of prayer and of effycacy / and virtue thereof* The. x. Chapter.
According to the mind of saint Austyn / prayer is the help and rem^dy for
the soul / and comfort and co^solacyon and sub dewynge of the devil / and
voydynge of all sins. There is nothing of more virtue or excellency in the
sight of god here / then is pure denocyon or prayer / as christ says i the
eua^^yst / what so ever ye do axe or desire (my father in my name: shall be
granted to you.) Furthermore they yt will pray / must be hole affeccionat in
the promise of christ. And trust suerly in the will of god / as he witnesses in
the eua^ gelyst. Mat. 7. (axe and ye shall find / knock and it hall be opened
as who says / axe for mercy) it shall be given you / seek the means and help
your self / and god will help you / and ye shall find / knock at the door of
yor hard heart or conscience with repe^tau^ce: and the virtue of god shall open
the door of yor heart / for to receive grace / for he would have witness of him
self here among us / in strengthynge of our faith / thus we may euydently
prove and perceive the will of the father in heaven to ward us here in earth
Some manner of people uses d^uers manners of cloked ypocrysy / which in the ^get
and syghte of the common people / they seem very holy / and full of great
me^enesse and be not so in deed, these sorts of ypocrytes ^e keth their own
glory: and not the glory of god / where as christ ascrybeth the nature of such
ypocrytes in the. (vi. the. vii. and the. xxiii. chapytres of Matthew the
eua^gelyst) Read there and ye shall percevue / the one from the other. (As our
loving master cryst^ techeth us.) Attend^e a falsis yphetisque veniunt ad vos
in vestimentis om^u^ trins^ cus sunt lupi Rapaces.



Leo papa i^ sermde) ascrybeth yt of prayer comes forgyuenesse of sins / by
fasting or abstynence abateth the lust and affeccy ons of the flesh / by
alms deeds / sins are hydden from the sight of god: thus may the image of
god be daily renewed in v^ to our comfort. Prope est dominus omnibus in
vocantibue eum in veritate psalmo. 44.



Saint Austyn says there is no greffe so paynfull / as is the ^effe of ones
conscy ence / wherefore except thy conscience be pure ^ene / of god nor of no
saint can thy pray er be hard nor acceptable / and specially if thou be in
deedly sin.

Dauit cormu^du^ cre^ in ^e deus psalm. 50. Saint Bernarde says / when thou
en^est in to prayer i^ thy chamber / closet / church / or else where / ^rste
seperat and expel out of thy mind all ^ondanytes and world ly thoughts or
business / and elyuat thy heart and mind all hose unto god only our father
in heaven / and pray unto him in thy heart purely and syncerly / and in so
doing thou please god more / then if thou should say over all the bedys
that be in the world otherwise / in vaynglory having thy mind ru^led in
worldly business / for the euangelyst says. (Tribue mihi cor tuum et mihi
sufficit. Also saint Rychat de de sancto victore) records saying. O how many
are there which daily say and pray the Pater noster. and how few be the re
that be hard / for fault of pure and clean heart. And how many are there that
daily calls on the Father in heaven / in our Pater noster: and in deed be none
of his children / for fault of grace / and in fulfyllynge of the trowth / which
is the word of god / the whi che can not enter in their hertes / for carnal
affeccyons as christ says in the eua^gelyst. Mat. 15. Ye do worship me with
your lyppes / and your hertes be far from me / then how can we be the
children of god in heaven which is our father / and we be replet with the were
and operacyons of the devil (as saint Paul says. To. 8. they the which
work by the spyryte of the holy ghost / they be suer ly the children of god.
Also the euangelyst says.

Si filii abrahe est is opera abrahe facite. Johan. 8.
The virtue of confession: and to knowledge thy self. The. xi. Chapter.
Saint Austyn de penit^tia) says that confession is a sa crame^t / which is
the health of man / and the salvation of the soul / and the restoryn ge of
virtue / and the sperklynge abroad or ca^tynge away of vices and sins / and
the devil and his werk^. And shytteth us out of the gates of hell / and
opens (...) the gates of paradyse.

Saint Austyn) says that person that is a syn^er / and offends god daily /
and will not be known of his sins: but with a ^oborne her^e syueth in his
carnal pleasure / and obsty not to ward god in knowledge of his sins and
offenses / does to the denyll great pleasure / and gives his soul to
eternal dampnacyon. And in contrary wise he that confesses him and knowlegeth
him self thereof. And no more willing to offend god does please god / and so
through god he possesses his soul with grace eternal / for he yt will hyde his
sins from god, hydeth him self from god / wherefore knowledge thy offe^ ces /
and thou shall find always mercy (...)*

Qui se accus^ et se peccator sit iustus esse in^pit* Augusti.)
The life of a covetous man speaks Jeremy the prophet. The. xii. Chap^.
FRom the porest unto the rychest commonly and daily is seen the expery ence /
they be dysposed to covetous / and a^ ryce / whose propertyes is to withholde
and catch / lands / goodee / catall lawful / or unlawful / and what wrongs
or injury that he does to any man he passes not upon so that he may obtain
his own synguler profit. All such covetous persons hauyn ge lybertye / will
cut large thong^ of other me^^es lether as who says) he will be pro dygall /
or lyberall of other me^nes goods / and sparynge / and heinous of his own /
in so much that he will oppress his body and spare out of his belly / and will
suffer great penury for his affection and love that he has to obtain this
worldly good and substance / which deceyueth him daily before his iyes / and
all this suffers he to be noted or named a rich man among the people. And to
lay out any thing that shul de be profitable to his soul / or yt he is bound
to do by the law of god / is very tedyous and paynful to him / what then
follows him in this blind affeccyons and mind: death suddenly comes and
gives no respyte and his enemy the devil / for whose pleasure he took so
great pains for / there is ready to busy his brains about worldly matters: and
over charge both body and soul / when he has little respyte to make amends
for his blind living (this is a pytefull case) thus is he deceived on every
side / as when he is passed commonly the experyence is seen that they shall have
his substance and mucke which he loved so well that he never (...) nor loved
perchance.) Also wese day ly their children or successors shall wast / land
substance / money / and goods / more in one yete / then he gathered in. xx.
with great pain and danger both of bod^ and soul. O merciful god what
br^yt beestes be they that with such ^gynge madness will cast in danger of
d^h perpetual / both body and soul / in this short and miserable life / for
this worldly gold or silver / or any other vain glory thereof / wherewith we
may obtain the glory eternal / as the euangelyst says. (Facite bob^s amicos
de ma^mo^e iniqtatis. Luc. 16. and dauit / s^diuitias a^lua^t nol^e cor
apponere. And also says i his psalms in dyners pla^ / he does lyken or
compare such like persons unto brute beestes* as asses / and moyles and in
paul and the euangelyst in sundry plac^ reputeth them worse then bestes
without rea son and understanding. Also I find wry ten in Ecclesiastes. 34.
this sentence written he which entendeth to defraude any poor man of that he
laboreth for / in the swet of his body for his living / may be compared most
like a thief or a murderer* which de syreth or has pleasure to shede the
blood of man / which is a great sin in the sight of god.

Saint Bernarde farthe) O precious soul of man redeemed and bought with the
most highest and precious blood of christ and ^ted most like to the image of

Saint Austyn says the^o. O how in for^at is that soul or life / which will
for so short a pleasure / disheryte it from the inestymable Joys celestyal /
and here has such pleasure to busy it self in dampnable and deuyllysshe
works. And so wylfully will avoid it self from all truth / light and virtue
/ and follows the dampnable pleasure of his carnal body / and ouerdryn keth
him self of the bitter death perpetual. And leaseth the Joys and life
eternal. In inferno vbi nullus ordo sed sempiternus horror.



Hugo de claustro ai^e) says unto these worldly people / Remember where is be

through our most secretenemye vaynglory: which deceyueth the most part of
all such like worldly people / and little they consider the saying of
(Salamon: what avails any man to labor in vaynglory of this world) who is
the most subtyllest and secret craft that the devil has to deceive mankind
with all. And a great part of this world before deceived by it / where (ysa^

Austyn (...) Chapyt.
S^ Austyn writes (...) pystle) saying if thou will be a tyche merchant /
and bestow thy money / where thou may have great profy te. Thou shalt lend
and socoure thy brother in his need and extremyte which is like to perysshe /
for f^te of socoure of such substance or marchaundyse as god has lent you /
who is no strange creature but thy brother in (christ Ihesu) per adventure ye
will think your marchau^ dyse / not so well spent on these lusty and ^ut die
vacabondes / which do he blaspheme god / and spends their life in great
mysery and wretchedness / in sinful living and ydelnes more then does any
other sort yet nevertheless they may not be exyled / for ye shall have great
thanks (for christ says in the euangelyst. Mat. 25. that ye give the lest or
porest in my name / ye give it to me) if ye be not dysposed to lend them / yet
we be bound to give them good words and not rebu^ng them / for crystes sake
only we may help and give them counceyll as the person does require / wherein
ye may profyt both him and yourself: though he be stoborne or dysdaynous (for
in Prouerbiorum. 28. he that gives the pore shall not lack nor have need / but
he that dyspyseth the pore or vylypendeth shall suffer penury / and dystresse
all though they be vysyous / idle reprobat / obstynat / having no virtue nor
grace / yet when ye are mouyd or styred to devotion / withdra we not that good

deedly and mortal greffe to be known thereof / unto these and such other
fortes l^ke ye may lend and give daily / that ye may obtain and get so
great gay^e and profit and thanks / that no ^onge nor her te or mind can
express / as paul witnesses. Cor. 20.) ye will say there is no such or very
few of them / yes suerly a great no^ bre of them then of the other idle and
common beggars that go from door to door: as in eve ry parysshe in London
specially in alyes and lanes innumerable: the which hunger and thirst / and
suffer need and penury impor tunat / ye and does perysshe daily for lack of
comfort the experyence thereof causes my heart to blede for pity / to se the
pore image of god perysshe / and so many rich and welthy persons so nere. O
lord what deedly and intolerable death is hanging over the heedes of the
rich / which shall not avoid that charge: whereof god takes so great
unkindness. Cor. 4. Seeing that ye have received it of god / and not of your
self / As your tables garnysshed with dylycates chargeable / where the charge
of one dysshe would find one of these poor a hole weke / And the great
change of rayme^t / so rich where the charge of one garment / would find one
of these pore the days of his life raiment / where ye suffer the mothes to
perysshe them Also ye gather on hepes money and plate / and such pore people
perysshe for fault of a little thereof / and so had ye rather / then to depart
therewith. O lord what unkind nature is this in man / that will not remember
that god might / and may make the rychest / as pore as the most nedy. Now
^uge your self how gladly ye would be socoured / and if ye were in like
dystresse: (thus shall you suerly be iuged.) remember to do to another as ye
would be done to. Wherefore seeing that we have this richesse through the power
of god / then set not us be so unkind against god: churlysly to keep al for
our selfs / as a swyne unreasonable / therfo re depart to the pore and nedy /
and specially to the pore in spyryte and follow the counceyl of christ in the
euangelyst. Luc. 16. saying (Make you fre^des of your wicked mamot the which
is your money and place that they may receive you in heaven in eternal
tabernacle (wherefore every christian man make with your substance / whiles ye are
here / such marchaundyse that ye may receive an hundred fold as much in the

Also the wise man says beware that ye use no lyeng and specially suffer not

Saint Gregory says there is no thing so precious in the syghte of god / as a

to do the devil pleasure / is to leave al virtue / and to cause bate and strife

Saint Jerome) says that no man can live here at his pleasure in wealth voluptu
ously* trusting with such living to obtain the glory of heaven at his
departyng^ for Job says in the ^de chapter. Si b^ na suscepimus quate mala

pleasure and fely cite / why shall we not then be content with sorrow /
heaviness / dyspleasure / and trybulacyons / which criste our master suffered

the law openly known / you may charitably rebuke his offen ces openly / the
which rebuke might happ^ ly be example and help to some other that be present

or reconcyle him / of that offense or sin between him and you / And thus if
ye have twyse revoked him of his faults / and regards not god / nor his own
myschef / but rather dispy seth you for your good will. Then let him alone /
till it fortune the third time / then take two or threin record / which
stands with the law / and then give warnyng to the holy church or
congregacyon of such a wylfull person / and then use and take him as a
stranger among you (all this testyfyeth matthew euangelyst. 18. chapter. Al

Saint Ambrose de penite^ tia) ascrybeth partlye the mysery of such / which

of which does proceeds all vice / syn^e and abhomynacyon / and noryssher of

Ietom wry ^th* in a pystle Ad titu^ saying that the excess or supf^uyte of

all sechery / and noryssher of all fyl thy desires or apetytes. Ierom ad titu^.

Salamon says also in his proue^* ^e ye well ware and temperat i^ drynkyng^

Also Salamon says there is no secretnesse in a dronken person / ye may thereof
be ^ure / but all thing at large at pleasure. Nullu^ secretu^ vb^ regnat

And saint Ierom) says and gives counceyll or remedy in all these dangers /
and how we may avoid them / if we will be gouer ned with reason / p^yuyng that
we know by experyence that the dangers following upon superfluytes of meats
and drynkes special / the which root or foundacyon / is only free will / and
use thereof / wherefore let us refrain then our free will / and lusts / when
nature and reason satysfyed (and stop there) and repute your self above the
nature of bruyt beests / and always beware of the venymous serpent. Modicus et
temperatis tibi et carni anime vtilis est etc. Ioronomus.



Saint Austyn says yet what proceeds of this vile glotony and of insacyat
drinking / he says that lechery or fornycacyon is so ready as is possible /
and thereof follows afterward destruccyon of the body and soul and shortness
of life.

god / then the deed it self. O lord that art so merciful / hold thy hand
of wrath and ire from us / and to amend our sinful living in fylthynesse /
and to know sege / and that we may confess our mysery with repentaunt hertes
and minds with the prophet Dauit saying in his penyteneyall psalms.

Miserere mei deus secundum magna^ misericordiam tuam qr peccauimus: cu^
patribus nostris unjust egimus et iniquitatem fecimus.
Pause resyteth the condycyons and natures of people in the later days of this
world. The. x. viii. Chap. 2. Tuno. 4.
THere shall come sorts of people in the later days / that shall be loving
them selfs / and not god nor his laws / no nor suffer no holsom doctrine to
be used in prechynge / redynge / nor speaking / but such carnal and
delectable fables / testes / tales / and lies / that shall be pleasant to the
carnal lusts and pleasur of their body) but when they here of any good
exortacyotis / concerning the wealth of their neygh boures / with their own
also / to the pleasure of god / that can not in no wise entr^ in to their
hertes. but often times thereat will clawe th^re where it ytcheth not (as who
says) if it be true that is showed them / yet will they none of it i no wise
/ they can not abide it. To them says (Jeremy in the vt. chapter to such
hard herted and obsty not people the word of god is obbropryoue and hateful i
so much) that they will not here nor suffer it spoken / because it condem p^th
all carnal lusts and desires / the whi che they will not se^e.

Verbum dei factum est eis obprobrium / et non suscpient istud. Jeremy. vi.
According to Lyra: (Saint pause ad Romanos. 12.) to all them that has
gifts of grace from god. The. xix. Chapter.
AS if a man has the gift of pr^ sye set him use his learning so that it be
agreynge to the faith.

Also if a man has an office or dygnyte / therein to do that he is bound or
swornto / do it with Justice.

Let him that techeth prudently / take good head to his doctrine.

Let him that exorteth any person with charity and modestyousnesse) use him in
his exortacyon dyscretly.

If ye do give any thing / give it with symplycyte (as who says) not openly
/ in syghte of people / but secretly / and do it for the love of god.

He that is in auctoryte / do it with dylygence / that is to say govern them
under his lurysdyccyon in virtue and truth.

He that shows mercy / do it with cherefulnesse (as who says) be not therein
tygorous nordysdaynous / but comfortable.

And also let your love be without dyssy mulacyon (as who says) not cloked
lou^ / saying one and do another.

And so shall you hate that which is evil or sinful / and gladly to do that
shall be good and profitable both to your body and soul and use kind and
brotherly love one to another.

Which is a life angelycall to god / and thus we may proceed or Joy one with
ano there / and for another in virtue and goodness / or ^cellyng each other in
charitable gladness and not in murmur or dispysynge each other.

Also ^et no^ your busynes / and werkys in doing be tedyous to you / that is
to will in deeds of mercy / or i that which comes of the holy ghost / for the
wealth of your soul.

Wherein be seruent in spyryte / and apply your self with all your dylygence /
while ye have time and leyser.

And rejoice and trust suerly in the reward of god / which that he has and
mysed us.

Also ye must be part in trybulacion and think it not tedyous or paynefull to
you / but gently suffer theyin with thanks hertely given to god / and pray for
them.

Ye must always be steadfast i prayer / and not having your mind tuffled with
world ly business / but all only in god.

Also to dystrybute to the nedy and poor for the love and faith thou have to
god / and for gods sake.

Also you shall bless them that persecute you and vex you / in body or
spyryte / and pray for them / and do ye good for evil.

Also that ye wayle and morn with them that morn and weep / and thereof make
ye no ieste^ / pleasure or sport.

Also agree as one when ye be together in god / and let not one repute him self
(...) lenter in wit or courage against another) but gently to be companyons /
as children: and apply you therein egall to the inferyor sort / rather then to
presumpcyon.

Also be ye wise and keep none opinion in your own conceyte.

Also have ye before wit and provide for things honest for your self before the
people.

And yet specially for your own part use quietness and rest.

Here follows the seven deedly sins that all people be bound to fle and
withstand. The. xx. Chapter.
Pride / wrath / envy / couetyse / glotony / slowth / and lechery. Pride /
wrath / and envy / be the sins of the devil. Couetyse / and aueryse / be
sins of this worldly pleasur. Glotony / slowth / and lechery / be sins of
the flesh / and these ben the hye ways to dampnacion perpetual. Qui se
exaltat humiliabitur.

And we must understand / that man offends god in pride / when he is rebel
or obstynat against gods commandment in folo wyng his own will and
pleasure and not the will and pleasure of god.

Also a man offends god in the sin of wrath / when he malycyously bus^h
him self or other to be avenged / and is sur ly minded and dysposed to
complysshe his desire therein. Qur gladio pcutit / gladio pibit. mat. 26.

against his neighbors prospetyte / or good name. Quid gloriar^s in malicia qur
potens ^s ininiquitate. psalmo. 51.



Also a man offends god in cou^tyse / when he coueyteth any goodds to hi^
wealth or pleasure / or else wrongfully / from his neighbor / and has no will
to depart therewith to the nedy / in their necessyte. Qui pecuniam suam no^
dedit ad vsura^ et munera innocente^ no^ accepit. ps^. 15.



A man offends in glotony: when he ta keth excess of meat or drink / more
then needs / where through he may be the worse to serve god quyetly. Animalis
homo non pepercit que sun^ spiritus dei. Corin. 2.



A man offends in slowth / when he l^uyth undone the good works / or deeds
/ whereof god by his grace moves or styreth a man unto / and does leave them
undone. Surge qui dormis et exurge a mortuis and illuminabit te xp^s. paul to
the ephe. 6.



Also a man offends in lechery / when he withsta^deth not the foul fylthy
styrynges of his flesh and lust / and suffers him self to be over come /
whether it be in will or deed / both are mortal sin.
