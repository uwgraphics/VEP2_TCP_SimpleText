Ane answer to ane Epistle written by Renat Benedict, the French Doctor,
professor of Gods word (as the translater of this Epistle calls him) to John
Knox and the rest of his brethren ministers of the word of God: made by David
Feargussone minister of the same word at this present in Dumfermling.

Psalm. 8. Out of the mouth of babis and sucklinges haste thou ordained
strength, because of thine enemies, that thou might still the enemy and the
auenger.

The Prenter to the Reader.
AS that it was long after this Epistle was written and tranflated, before it
came to his hands that answered it. So was it long after it was answered
before it came to my hands to prent, when therefore (good Reader) thou shall se
so much time pas over betuix the tra^slating and answering, and betuix the
answering and prenting: impute it nether to his negligence that gladely would
have answered it sooner if it had comen to his hands, or yet to mine, that als
gladely would have prented it, but rather take in good worth both our labors,
taken to thy confort, whosoever thou be that reads it, to purge thy heart from
error, imbraice the treuth and believe it to the glory of God and thy
Salvation, in Christ Jesus, to whose protection I commit the, now and ever.

The Preface.
David Feargussone unto the Reader wishes grace mercy and peace from God the
Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ with yt spirit of righteous judgment.
I Have not interprised (beloved brethren in Christ Jesus) to answer this
Epistle as one more able so to do, then the rest of my fellows in office: but
rather driven thereunto by the incessant requeist of some zealous and godly
persons, who brought it to my hands for that purpose, after that it had been
carried as a matter of great importance from one place to an other: and so at
length translated by an certane Freir out of latin into Inglish in favor of
such perso^es What mo^ ued me to^ wryt.
as he thereby would gratify) it was ^reatlie bosted of: partly therefore to
sa^ffie the reasonable requeist of the afore^aid persons, and also to stop the
mouth of the adversary from further braging but chiefly for the discharge of
my conscience in the office whereunto God has called me. I have occupied my
pen in answering as after follows. And although this pithles Epistle have
little or no strength to deceive any that have but meanly teasted of the treuth,
yet because it may be a piece of help to hold them still in error that are as
yet within it (in my judgment it would not be past over in silence) nether do I
know whither any man has unto this hour answered it or not. For as much as I se
it a thing which all learned men will not only laugh at, and so contempe it,
as not worthy of answer but also judge it such a matter as they will spend no
time upon, saying that they may be better occupied nor to answer a fool
accordig to his folly: but list (...) ^c. 26
he est came him self wise in his own co^ceite. I have thought good to write
sumwhat in this matter: unto the which writing I have added my name, nor for
vain Why I have expressit my name.
^lorie God knows, but to this end one li^, that when the Reader shall find the
reules of Rethorick transgressed, and ornate Eloquence omitted (no man be
blamed but I allone (moreover if it shall hap pen that I be sumwhates longer
then ye would wish, werie not yet I beseech you to reid it to the end, for
certanely as I suppose no man is able fully to answer this ordorles confused
Chaos without many words. To the end therefore that ye may the better
understand the matter (because this man's letter keeps no certane ordor) so far
as the confusione of it will suffer. I have divided it, and that in four
Sectionis: first writing his words faithfully as they are translated, and
thereafter my answer. Fair well dear brethren in Christ Jesus our only
confort, and judge with equity.

Heir follows Renats Epistle the first Section.
THE love of Christ (most cu^ing me^) and no small desire of Salvation unto you
all, con trinis me to warn and pray you from the bottom of my heart, that ye
intruse not nor bring not in an strange doctrine and uncouth, in the Church of
God. Aliene and inpertinent (after the judgment of all wise and good men) to
Gods word and consuetude thereof, ather for the favor of the people, or for
naine and tra^sitorie glory, that is, that ather ye may be esteemed the more
wise and cunning of some (and received as they say in both their arms) or else
that ye may thereby get and gather to your selves riches. What tempt ye I pray
you to do, what is (I beseech you in Christ Jesus) this your beginning, look I
pray you how great is this your boldness, to profess a new doctrine against the
antiquity consent and universality of Religion, without any plain
testimonies or auctorities of holy Scripture, or of Christian Authors,
ancient and tried in learning and godliness.

D. Feargussones answer.
IT would appear at the first sight to i^ of small judgment and learning, that
the cause that hes moved you to write, were verray godly and charitable.
Forasmuch as ye say that the love of Christ, and the salvation of us all hes
contrined you thereto: but when the matter is tried with treuth, the contrary
will sone appear. It will please you therefore to give us leave a little to try
what kind of love this is that has moved you, and what fruit it brings
forth, and then I trust both ye and vthers (if ye have eyes to se) shall
easylie perceive this love to be preposterus and carnal: I will say no wors
til I have better opportunity, and list that ye should think that we deal to
austeirlie with you at the first: I would ye understood that the Spirit of our
God has c^ manded us in his Scriptures (verray stratelie) to be war of
deceauers and not to harken to falls Prophets, but rather math. 24.
to try the Spirits whither they be of 1. I^on. 4 Deuter. 13.
God or not, yea, and suppose the Prophet show a wonder or a myrackle, if his
doctrine be falls we are forbidden to credeit him. If then we aught not to
believe him to be of God that works mirackles If his doctrine persuade us to
Idolatry how much les oght we to believe that this is the true love of God that
moves you to write, when as your doctrine and admonition tendis to nothing else
through out this Epistle, but to draw us from the true worshipping of our God
in Spirit and verity to serve him according to manns invention by Idols and
Idolatry. And although that I would grant unto you, that this your love were
even to Christ and god ward without any hipocrysie, yet I dar boldly say that
it is als preposterous as Peter's love was to Christ whene as he exhorted him
to favor him self and not to suffer the death of the Trose. For the which
Christ calls him Satan, ^ath. 16.
nether fear I to affirm that Peter's love to Christ (which ye do se hear
damned) was als true love as it that moved you to write which suppose it be
vnfeinzeit, is nottheles als void of knowledge as the zeal of Paul's brethren,
for whom he praycth most effectuously in his Epistle to the Romans. This much
I have spoken Romans 10
of the nature of your love to Christ, to the e^d that the treuth may appear,
and that ignorants be not deceived with the name of love, for true love indeid
which proceadis of faith and knowledge. It is dangerous in deid to give haistie
credeit to all such as have the name of Christ hipocriticallie in their
mouths: for he him self affirms in the Euangle of Matthew that their shall
come many and abuise his math. 24
name and that so craftelie, that if it were possible they should deceive the
verray elect. These men are we expressedly sorbidden to believe. The desire that
ye bear to our Salvation is no better nor your love, but in all points is like
unto the desire that the Pharisees had unto the co^ uersion of the Bentiles,
for the which the Lord Jesus pronunces an extreme woe against them in these
words. Woe be unto math. 23
you Scribes and Pharisees, Hipocrites, for ye compass sea and land, to make one
of your professione, and when he is made ye make him the child of hell twofold
more then your selves. Your admonition moth. 23.
in desyring us not to intruse an strange doctrine, we verray gladely admit.
For as yet we have taught nothing (nether are in time cuming minded to teach)
that hes not agreed, and shall fully and i all points agree with the infallible
treuth of Gods eternal verity, to the more evident manifestation whereof we
have set out in prent a general confession of our Faith and doctrine, with the
which who so is not contented, let them show the cause out of the word of God,
and it shall be amended. Ye name generally all wise and good men to be against
our doctrine, and that also it disagreeth with Gods word, and yet in the mean
time ye bring forth no man for your prufe nor any sentence out of Gods word for
your defense. The nixt time therefore that ye write let us hear these good
mennis names that agrees not with us, and the sentences of Scripture that be
against us (for we can not answer to nameles me^ and word les sentences) and
then I trust by the grace of God that ye shall be answered accordingly, for
preased be God we be rea 1. Peter. 3
^ie to give a reckning of that hope that is (...) us, to all men that
demands it.

There he two things that ye charge us ^ith, the first is, that we hunt for the
fa^r of the people, the nixt that we study (...) gather riches, the which
accusations ^od knows are manifest falls. That the ^rst is false, all men may
se that are not ^ilfully blind, for he that hunteth for the ^or of the people
must bear with their Falls prechers spekis to the people plesa^t thin thin^
^ce, the contrary whereof the verray ^eid it self testifies in us. What
person (...) persons have we spared to reboke op^enly, of what estate soever
they were of, ^we knew the^ to be vicious. And where ^e Magistrate is godly we
procure at his and the punishment of whordome, dro^^ennes, blasphemy, I
dolatrie, morther, ^ift, and all other vices as the word of ^od prescribes.
For we know as says ^e Apostle, that the Law is good, being ^ughfully used,
so that suppose the Law 1. Timo. 1.
^th nothing to do with the just man, yet (...) serves well to punish the
lawles and ^issobedient, the ungodly and the sinners, ^he unholy and profane,
the murderers ^f Fathers and mothers, the horemongers and buggerers, the liers
and perjured persons, or to the punishment of any other vice that is contrary
to wholesome doctrine, which is according to the glorious Gospel of the blissed
God, co^mieted unto us. And where their is no magistrate that obeyth the voice
of God (as to few there be the more to be lamented) we use to expel such
perso^es as are above written, by excommunication out of our Congregations and
from the communion of the faithful. This is not the mean to win the favor of
the people, I am assured except they be altogether godly, for then the rebuker
of their vice is the more belo ued of them, as says Salamon. Reboke Prouer 9.
the wise and he will love thee, and be the contrary he that reboked the wicked
purchases his hatred, nether fear I to affirm (...) the (...) gospellers
(...) the ministers.
that the greatest number of carnal Gospellers in Scotland this day hates the
Ministers of the Euangle, for no other cause the^ for their seueir reboking of
vice, for the which I for one, that writes this answer, am hated to the death,
but God is with me, and therefore I fear not who be against me. The second
whereof Rom^. 8.
ye accuse us (I mean the gathering of riches) is so impudent a lie, that all
men ^ay perceive it to have proceaded of the ^euil, the author of lies. Thou
art never ^le to prove that ever any Minister in ^cotland had a brybe of any
man in the ^rth for any cause, yea, and I dar say for (...) own part (and am
assured my brethren ^ay say no les for their parts) with Sa^uel whose Ox, whose
Ass, have I taken 1 Samu 12
(...) whom have I done wrong to, or whom ^ue I hurt, or of whose hand have I
re^aued a brybe to blind mine eyes there^ith, tell me and I will restore it?
but so ^r absent are we from gathering of rich^, that the greatest number of us
have ^ed in great penury, without all stipe^d ^e tuelf month, some eight, and
some ^lf a year, having nothing in the mean ^me to susteane our selves and our
fami^es, but that which freindes have given ^s, and that which we have borrowed
of ^eritable persons until God send it us (...) repay them. Ye strife fast to
shift this ^ut from your selves to us, but I must ^alken you up because herein
ye appear ^o me to be fast a sleep. Have ye forget the ^saciable gredines of
your Popes the Antichrists of Rome and of you his chapmen. Remember your self
(omitting the rest for tediousnes) of Pope John the 23. of that name, called
before Iacobus Caturcensis, and of Clement the. 5. of that name called before,
Bertrandus ^ottho. The one of these I mean John left behi^d him in his treasure
more abundance of gold as says Baptista Platyna nor any that ever was

of gold, the other I mean Clement at his coronation, which was at Lions in
France (for then was the court of Rome translated to France by this same
Clement) lost of his attire stricken from his horse by a certane fall of the town
wall by which also John the Duke of Bertanzie and diverse others were slain. In
this tumult I say your holy father Clement Clementio Carbounkle: worth sex
thousand crow nis.
lost a Carbunkle, worth, as says the same Platyna, sex thousand crounes.

Remember your self who are gatherers of riches, Christ and his Apostles who
had not so much as to rest their head upon to pay their tribute: nor gold nor
silver in Math. 8. Ibid. 17. Actis. 3.
possession, and we his ministers that suffers affliction and penury, and
whither this fault of covetousness may justly be ^de to our charge or youres, I
bid you ^ember your self again, yea, and more ^er I dar be bold to say that
these same ^o forenamed Popes had more riches Two Popes ^cher in geir the^ all

Court of Dionisius? So whi ^r is it we Ministers of Gods word ^t lives in

^yring nothing for all these foresaides, (...) that we may be suffered to
reteane the ^w worshipping of our God and his ^ist, as we are taught in the
Scriptu^, whither is it we or ye impudent and ^meles shauillinges that hunteth
for ^hes, we that speaks the treuth frelie without respect of persons, or ye
falls ^tterers who for the mantena^ce of your ^lleis cares not to go to
everlasting da^ nation. It was more like that baallcs chaplanis (that eat at
Iesabels table) served Mammo^, then Eliah and the hundredth Prophets that for
the tyrranny of this cruel Queen durst not walk abroad, but were fed in caves
(by Obadiah Ahabes stewart) under the ground. But ye do well to charge us with
lies, because ye 1. Reg. 18
have nothing justly to accuse us of. Ye ask of us what we attempt to do, we
assure you (by the grace of God) to rute out supersticious and pestilent
Papistrie, and in place thereof to plant sincere and whole some verity,
contained in the book of God. Ye desire us to look to our beginning, God be

hands to it, nether commoned we with flesh nor blood in this case. Ye
affirm (...). 1.
that this is a great boldness of us to profess a new doctrine, contrary to
antiqui tie, consent and universality of Religion, having for us nether
Scriptures nor ancient Authors, if this your affirmation were true, certanly
our boldness were to great. It is an easy matter to you to speak so, but ye will
not find it so easy to prove. It has been the wonted and ac^stomed use of
Satan, from time to ^me, to sclander the treuth with noual^e, and deck
falshead with antiquity and ^nsuetude, persuading men that the doc^ine of
Salvation is such newfangled ^tasie, as never has been hard before any place.
Thus did the wise and cun^ng Philosophers of Athenis call, Pan^s doctrine. May
we not know (said Actie. 17.
^ey) what this new doctrine is, where^ thou speak? And certanly the rude
^ultitude are easylie persuaded that it is (...), for as says Tertuliane.

^uch of antiquity, but when the matter is tried it will appear that ye have
little for you, yea, your most precious gear and oldest constitutions will
appear, to be that thing that they are in very deid, to wit, beggarly
ceremonies inverted by the foolhardy and rash conceat of man, with out the
warrant of Gods word, or any exemple of that first or primative Church most
happily planted by the Apostles and reuled by the holy Ghost, for long after
the primative Church, and many hundredth years after that the word was preached
in Rome, yea, of poor preachers of the Gospel, or Bishopes call them as ye
list, and then Archebishopes, and last Patriarc^es (for be these degries they
ascended to the beasts saite) there was in Rome Th^e (...) i^ ^ome: o^ ever

and children, of this bloody Judas, the ambicious beast, Boniface obtained (I
say) to be called the head of all Bishopes and the Church of Rome the mother
of all Churches, and this was done in the year of God, sex hundredth and seven,
or thereby. This long the Church of God ^ked this monstrous head from whom
(...) the rest of his successors and you Papi^s their members, all poysone
descen^ed, as from the natural head of man's bo^y ather good nutrime^t or evil
humors ^scendeht to the rest of the members. ^he visible head of your kingdom
is no ^der, judge ye then of the members there^, and incres of the body. For
after that with great contention (as says Plati^) this matter was granted by
the afore^d traterous usurper of the impyre, yet ^d very few for a long time
acknowledge ^his title of the head of the Church to ap^rteane to any one
earthly man, but rather ^ithstude it to the uttermost of their now ^s, and
this chiefly did for the most part ^l the Churches of Grecia, and of the ^ast,
likewise did money other Churches ^ntill that the strength of this beast was
^uch as at lenth compelled them tirranni ^ally to commit fornication with her,
after that she had shaken of the zock of lawful obedience to Kings and
Empreours (as their proud Decries which afterward I will inter shall prove) and
had exalted her self above all that was called God, and so sat as one that
promised unto her self nether These. 2

^hese words are written in the first book of that ^laiphemous wolome gather
ed by one Raymond, and called the decre talis of Gregory the 9. in the 7.
title and (...). chapter there o^, the title is called, De translatione
Episcopi. the chapter begin (...)* with this word, Quanto. These worcester ^es I did
find in deid in many notable writers that writes against your Pope, but
because I delight not to make report (much les to commit to writ) any thing by
here say, and also, that first when I red them, it appeared an incredible
mat^r to me that ever the Devil culd so far ^ind any man that he would break
furthe in this plain blasphemy, so grossie that all men may perceive it) I
therefore deserred the writing of them until I did find out these same
decretales wherein I (...) these words before written and there^ took boldness
to affirm that which I ^d se and reid, the inglish whereof is this, (...) neir
as I could translate it. It is said that the Pope has a heavenly judgment,
(...) therefore changes the nature of things, applying the substance of one
thing to an other, and of nothing he can make something, and of the sentence
which was noght ^he can make it somewhat worth, for in O diuellishe presumption.
^ose things that he list, his will stands ^r reasone, nether is there any man
that ^ay say unto him, why does thou so? (...) he may dispense with the Law,
and of justice, may make justice, in amending (...) changing the Laws, for he
has gotten the fulness of power. which of you ^re so shameless as to stand in
the defense ^f these words? or rather who sees not that this is that same
mouth that the ^rophet Daniel affirms, should speak Daniel. 7*
presumptions things, this is the plesand doctrine that proceeds from this
monster, whose beginnig ye have hard, whose incres and grouth to the hight I
could declare, out of their own Histories (if it were not tedious) whereout of
ye might easylie perceive how fals^ie antiquity, by them, is applied to their
new forged reti gion in the deap dongeon of Satan's workehous, and practiced by
them, his members and Luftenne^ts, hear in earth. But when they find in our
Congregations that thing used which Gods word has not taught us, then boldly
accuse us of noualtie, and unto that time, best it is to hold their peace list
they be found ini^st accusers. As to the Doctors I nether contemp them, nor yet
do I build my faith upon them, because they were but men, and in their
writings many things a^is to be found, as Augustine (indeid the very best of
them in my judge meant) testifies in diverse places and chiefly in his
retractations, in these words (...) ^n his Re^tatio^s
^re non possum nec deb^o (...) ^ut in ipsis inato^s (...) ita multa esse in
tam multis opus^lis meis que posiunt iusto iudic^o et nulla te meritate
culpare. Behold freinde that Augustine does not deny that there be many
things in his volonies that may by just judgment, and without all temerite be
found faut with. Finally because of all that hitherto ye have written, and I
have answered, ye have inferred no ^rufe of Scripture but naked words of ^our
own. In this case I say with (...). ^uod de Scripturis no^ habet auctor^
^erome* upon (...)* (...) 23. Chap*
^adem facilitate contempn^tur qua probatur. That is to say that thing which
has not his authority out of the Scriptures, als easylie as it is prouen, als
easylie may it be rejected.

Renats Epistle the Second Section.
THis a little I beseech you take head and enter in your selves by dilegent
reasoning, putting away all mist of affection from you: say I require you by ^e
mercy of God and Christ Jesus love ^owardes us all? where is it red in the holy
write, ather in old Testament or new, that the mass that is the conswete
Sacrifice of holy ^irk is abomination, or any thing sou^ding to Idolatry?
where or in an of so many Counsels holden in the Kirk of God? where in any
learned or tried authorities? Look? never treuly, allege the place it ye can,
which verily never an of you could ever yet do. I me^ uel therefore why ye
affirm that doctrine with so great clamor, with such ardence as it is
believed, yea, with so great labors, to the perrell of so many Christian
souls, and to your own (I fear) perdition: contempning the prudent authority
of all good and learned men, which doctrine has no certane probatio^ except
that ye would think your own expolition of the Scripture (that repugneth
manifestly to all cunning men's) yneugh for to conferme a new doctrine of Faith
and Religion.

D. Feargussones answer.
ALl mist of affection set aside, ye require us by the mercy of God and Christ
Jesus love toward us all, to show you, where the mass is called
abhominatione or Idolatry, in the old Testament or new? whereunto we answer,
^e n^me ^f the ^sse (...) not in ^e Scrip ^ris.
that when ye find this word mass ather in the old or new Testament, then
shall we prove it to be Idolatry. This might serve you right well for an answer,
(...) should be also unto you such a desire (...) am assured ye were never able
to ac ^plish. But in the mean time until ^d it, list this might apeare rather
to (...) ^hift nor an answer: we say and (...) affirm, that wheresoever the

Lord IIesus, and this is life eternal that they know thee to be only very
God, and whom thou has sent, Jesus Christ, this doctrine we have professed at

Renats Epistle the Third Section.
BEhold I beseech you, that ye deceive not your selves, and namely in these last
and most perrellous days, of the which the holy write prophecieth and
affirms the great dangeres and mischief so that in the days, even the chosen
and Elect (if it were possible) therethrough shall be perverted. Ye know planely
if that ye look over the Scripture with humility the slight and desait of
Satan (Christ's and all Christianes enemies) for to misreule and disturb the
true Kirk and his furious interpryses also to deleit and put away the
remembrance of Christ Jesus ye misknow not. Take head therefore I adjure you
well-beloved and Christian brethren, that ye be not Seduced with his subteltie
and craftines, and being Seduced, that ye be not the instruments to pervert
others from the faith. ^athan can not take Christ's name from you but yet be
war I pray you, and I warn you of charity for your weill and Salvation, that
he pluk not Christ him self from you. Think I beseech you where, and by what
manner we have Christ treulie? Have we him not by his true word in the true
Sacrament? Have we him ^ot i^ the true Kirk by very faith? Have ^e not
lightlyed I make your selves iud^es, and contempned the true Kirk sit^uat upon
the montane? and this yneugh knowing of all men, Intruse ye not an only figure
for the treuh of Christ's live ^y body in the Sacrament and euchariste? They
know who has red the Scriptu^es and Doctors writings, that ye pro^one the
words of the Law, and not the Law it self, nor the true word of God, for
probation and setting forth of your doctrine, therefore ye reteane only the
name of Christ, but be war I pray you that ye put not Christ him self from
you, have ye not expelled him first in his Images? and thereafter in the
euchariste and mass. And last of all in exponing the Scripture otherwise then
it behooved, in whose room what other thing have ye set out but a Creatur or
creatures invent, that is your doctrine and teachement.

D. Feargussones answer.
IF that we did depend ather on men or men's doctrine, whither it were our own
or other men's, then no dout, we were very able to be deceived, and to deceive
others. But forasmuch as the doctrine that we are grounded upon, come ne uer be
the will of man (as says Peter) D^t. 1.
but by the will of God, we are assured not to deceive our selves, for he is no
deceauer in whom we trust, but rather the way the verity and the life, and him
we follow ^ohn. 14.
certeanely believing that then we can not walk in darkness, for we know as
says bid. 8.
S. John in his first general Epistle that we are of God, although the whole
world l^eth in wickedness. we know that the Son of God is come, and has given
^s a mind to know him that is true, and we are in him, that is in his Son
Jesus Christ, the same is very God and eternal life. This doctrine we have
lear 1. Ihon.
^ed of God, in it we trust, being assured that the gates of Hell shall not
preuale against us. math. 1^


True it is, that the Scriptures plain^y affirms in diverse and syndrie
places, that the latter days shall be full of dangers, and therefore most
carefully does the Spirit of our God, not only warn us of the dangers, but
also the mean to a^oyde them is manifestly-proponed to us ^n these words. He
that perseuereth unto math. 2.
^he end shall be saved. But as all shall be ^ll of perrel every where, so shall
not the Church lack her part, being assalted with ^als Christ's and falls
Prophets, who shall show such lying wonders, signs, 2. Tess^
and myrackles, that if it were possible ^he very chosen should be deceived.
But ^lissed be God that has not left these his most necessar admonitions in
so obscure ^arables that hardly may the matter be decerned, no but rather has
by his Apostles and diligent watchmen, painted out most lively, the manners and
doctrine of these falls prophets, Peter says. They 2. Peter
shall deny the Lord that boght them, and through covetousness make merchandrise
of the people. Was Christ Jesus alo^e (i the Popes Church) granted to be the
Lord that boght us with his blood? or were we not teached to be boght out of
purgatory by masses, which of these gredie beasts was boght for money, with
money other such damnable ways, whereby the way of treuth was evil spoken of,
which I omit for tediousnes, this remembering only as the fontane whereout of
the rest spra^g. These men that thus deminisheth the power of the Son of God,
to be vterlie ignorant of the Father, and with him to 1. Ioh. (...).

Christ and brother of James, calls them clouds Jude. (...).

(lacking ^e mystery of Salvation in his heart, and ^e Sermon of exhortation
banished from ^s mouth) is decked like a player in mi^al aparel with Crose and

chiefly to ^imothie, in these words. The Spirit ^eaketh evidently that in the
latter times some shall depart from the faith, and shall give head unto Spirits
of erro^, and doctrines of Deuilles which speak l^es through Ipocrycie, and
have their cons^ ence burnt with an ho^e yrne, forbidding 1. Tim. 4.

received with gi^ig of thanks of the^ which bele^ and know the t^euth, who
does not se (out such as be wilfully blind) the doctrine papistical most
lively discriued and handsomely set forth in this prophecy, for who in these
latter and dangerous days has forbidden Marriage, and has commanded

has done this but the Pope math. 15.

your own ^t. 7.
If ye would that we should obey your admonitio^s, let them bring forth some
fruit in your self, or else ye are like to be repulsed with this sentence.
Pihsition hail thy self. And although we do reject you for just causes,
principally for your intoxicat doc trine, think not therefore that these
Scriptures (whereof your admonitions are taken, concerning the latter days)
are of us carelessly passed over, no, God forbid, for they be warninges betuix
our^ eyes. The Apostle Peter has most carefully (...). 11.
warned us, of Satan's ^yght and fury, not forgetting also to istruct us how to
withstand him, in these words. Be sober and watch for your adversary, the

upon these promises we rest, and shall ^od willing unto the end, nether fear

^ppose we be fragel, yet will he not deny (...) self, but how comes it to pas
that ye perceive not the craft of this Serpent your self, whereof ye admonish
others so earnestly. For Satan has not one^e spoiled you of christ him self
(given you a white tepertane God to play you with) but also has spoiled a
great number of your masters men, even of the very name of Christ. For they
think it to base a name to be called Christians wherewith enerie man is termed
that is Baptized. And therefore are some of them called Frasiscans, so^e
Benedictinis, some Don^nicans and Agustmians, some Car^elites and Cartusians,
some Heremites and Iacobins, and some with one name and some with other, which
I irke to rehers. Hereby plainly witnessing that they are ashamed of the name
of Christ before men that he may deny them before his Father math. 10.
in any wise to apertean to him, but to be of the number of those filthy
locustes that Apoca. 9.
S. John remembers in his Revelation, to have come out of the bottomless pit.

Ye desire us to remember where and by what manner we have Christ treuly, then
ye labor to persuade us that he is enclosed in the Sacrament, and knet to the

but not to your adulterus Church, which ye would make men believe, were the true
Church of God, and so ye conclude that (...) have dispysed the Church sittuat
upon the montane, and has intrused a figure for Christ's body in the Sacrament.

This I trust be your meaning and the ^one of your argument, whereunto we ^er.
That the Lord Jesus being rea^ John. 16.
to leave the world and go to his Father, seeing his Disciples (who at that
present were carnal minded) sorry for ^s bodylie departing, made unto them
(...) solempned promise, that he would not ^aue them confortles, but if they
would John. 14.
^pe his commandments and teach his people also to observe all, and
whatsoever (...) had commanded them, that then but ^out he would be present with
them unto ^e end of the world, not catnally nor ma^cally math. 2^.
enclosed in a bit of coniured bread (...) which is now and then offered for
seicke (...) wine and Fearsy horses) but by his ho^e Spirit effectually working
i their har (...) that thing which his bodylie presence ^uld not do, whose
departing from them ^es utterly necessary and expedient, as he him self does
witness, in these words I tell you the treuth it is expedient for you that I go
away, for if I go not away John. 16.
the conforter which is the holy Ghost, will not come unto you, but if I
depart I will send him unto you. Marck these words ye carnal Capernaites (that
would pluck Christ's flesh from the right hand of the Father) that if ye have
his flesh yet still with you, ye lack his Spirit, for he affirms in plain
words that the Spirit will not come except he depart and be absent in body.
Now choose you, whither ye will want his body or his Spirit? or rather whither
think ye it better to imagine that ye have his body? for otherwise ye have it
nor, and so for your falls imagi nation, lack his Spirit, or to grant that thing
to be absent, which is absent in deid and can not come til the latter day, to
the end ye may be participant of that holy Spirit that God pours in the
hearts of his chosen, eue^ here in this life, whereby we cry Abba, Father. But
the question is soue answered on your part, I am assured Romans 8.
ye had rather play you with your myrrie conceats, contenting your selves with
that presence of Christ that you think ye have, nor to have his Spirit, except
that ye might win money thereby, as Simon Magus your predicessoure would have
done. For ye have win more by the Magical and merualous lying myrackle of
transubstantiation, whereby ye would make men believe that a piece of bread not
worth a quarter of a farthing, were changed in your masses, to the body of
Christ God and man, the same lenth and bread that he hang on the crose, by this
iugling I say ye have win more then ever ye did by his Spirit. But to the
purpose, we conclude that Christ is here present with his Church always
(according to his promise) by his holy Ghost, which who so has not
aperteined not to Christ with what gifts soever he be endued beside. Rom^. 8.
ye make our selves judges whither that we have lighlyed the treu Church or
not, sittuat upon the montane, if ye mean hereby the Church of Rome (as I dout
not but ye do) we deny simply that it is the true Church, but rather that
spiritual Babylone, whereout of the Lord has commanded his people to come,
that they Apoc. 14.
^e not partaker of her plagues. whither ye mean by this montane, that great
hill of ambition that Satan carried Christ to, when that he promised him the
whole Kingdoms of the earth, if he would worship ^ath. 4.
hi, which Christ refused, and your Pope Apoca. 17
has received, or if ye mean hereby the hills that are sittuat about Rome
(which S. John says. are 7. in number, which also Baptista Mantuanus
affirms, for (...). manueno libro^. de v^ta ^lasu.
he calls your Rome, Se^ollem vrbem) I can not well tell. An other hill or
hills whereon your harlot sits, I know none, and thought your meaning be not
hid from me concerning this matter, yet for the vanity of it, I leave it to be
interpreted by your self.

Ye affirm that we intruse an only figure for the treuth of Christ's body in
the Sacrament. They must have leave to lie that can not speak the treuth. who
ever hard any of us ather say priuatlie or s^ak openly in our preachings that
the Sacrament is but a bare figure of Christ's body. I am assured there is no
man able to prove it. But rather this is our doctrine of that most sacrete
and holy Sacrament, that as we agree not with you Papists that would make men
believe that the bread were changed in Christ's carnal and manly flesh by
transubstantiation (which flesh the heaven must hold unto the time that all
things be restored which God has spoken by the mouths of his holy Prophets
since the world begouth as witnesses S. Peter) So do we Act^s. (...).
not agree with them that judges the Sa cramentall bread and wine to be but
bare signs or figures only, constantly affirming and undoubtedly believing
that als verily as our teith eats the bread and our mouths drinks the
wine (whereby our bodies, as says David, is stre^thened, Psalm 104.
and our hearts made glade) so verily are we partakers of Christ's body by
Faith, whereby we are nourished to life everlasting, and this partaking
requires nether transubstantiation, inpanation, nor carnal present, but
requires the eleuatio^ of our Spirits by faith to heaven, there to be
partakers of Christ not with carnal teith, but with faith affectual. This manner
of partakig were the people taught in the primative Church, as witnesses this
sentence. Sursum cord* Sur^. corda. abused (...) the mas^
which was used at the ministration of the Lords Supper whereby the people we
moved to lift up their hearts above all earthly and sensyble things, whose
answer was, habemus ad Dominum we have them lifted up to the Lord, which words
most shamefullie were abused in your mischiuous mass, to your shame and
confusion.

And that Christ's body is a true natu rall body in deid, like unto ours in
all things sin except, and no fantasy which ^ebre. 4.
may be enclosed in a piece of bread, and so in 10. thousand places at ones,
and that the Sacramental bread is not changed in Christ's flesh and blood, as
the Papist dreameth, not only the whole Scrip ture, but all godly and
faithful writers do testify. And first S. Augustyne whose most plain and
evident sentences (for ^gustine.
the prufe of this purpose) if I should infer this lytie work should grow to a
greater volome then ather I am minded now to write, or yet time will permit,
being otherwaves occupied, principally in the fe ding of that flock whereof the
holy Ghost has made me ouersear. Sum yet I will produce to give the readers a
teast of the r^st. In his co^mentary upon the Psalms Agustine. v^ c^. ^ee ^8.

he has these words. Non hoc corpu^ est t^ (...) quod videtis et bibituri
illum Sanguinem quem fusuri sunt qui me crucifigent. Sed Sacramentum ^liquod
commendo vobis quod Spiritualiter intellectum viuific^ bit vos that is ye shall
not eat this body which ye se, nor drink that blood that they shall shed which
shall Crucify me, but I commend unto you a certane Sacrament (or mystery)
which being spiritually understood, shall quicke^ you. And in an other place.
Corpus Christi in quo resurre^it in In ^ne (...) ^iscle to Hierom^
vno loco esse oportet: veritas autem ^us vbique diffusa est. That is the body
of Christ wherein he arose must be, on forse in one place, but his verity is
spread abroad every where. His tractat upon John is full of such sentences,
and many other of his works also, as his Epistle to Dardanus, his book of
Christian doctrine, the notable work of the City of God, al which I omit
for lenth. And because that the latin sentences occupyeth room, and also that
every man understands them not, let it be sufficient to recite them in
Inglish, the treuth of the Allegatio^s and translating of them, who so doutes
of, let him examine the places alleged.

Tertuliane writing against Martione Tertulis Ubio. 4.
has these words. Christ taking bread and distributing it to his Disciples

lest when they hard his words they should say,. why do we then drink blood and
eat flesh? And so should be troubled, for when he spak before of those things

that Hierome have not so clerly, as the matter required, mad the conference
betuix Christ and Melchisedec yet has he treuly judged in this place of the
Sacrament, if I should rehears all such sentences as makes for this purpose
out of the ancient Doctors writings (as I have said before) this small treaty
would grow to a great volome, that I be not to tedious, therefore let these
inferred serve at this present, rea die hereafter to collect mo, if these ends
not the strife.

Ye say that they which have red Scriptures and Doctors writings, knows that
we propone but the words of the Law, and not the Law it self, nor yet have we
(say ye) Gods word for us, and so ye conclude, very magistraliter, as your
manner is, that we reteane only Christ's Name and not him self. There is no man
I am assured that has red the Scriptures and Doctors writings with judgment,
which does not know this affirmative of yours to be rash railing, lincked
full of lies. etc.

And then ye labor to show how we have expelled Christ, first ye say in his
images, and Secondly in the Euchariste and mass, and Thridly in exponing the
Scripture according to man's invention. Hitherto it might have appeared to men
of sklender judgment (as I have said in the beginning of this answer) that the
love of God had moved you to this matter, but blissed be God, eue^ the Father of
our lord Jesus Christ, that now ye have detected your self, bewraying that
which before ye covered with an exceading wide cloak of Hypocrisy disclosed.
Hipocrycie. Let an Ass be als well decked as may be with a Lions skin and yet
will his long ears declare what he is. Let a Uoulfe be never so well ^led with
a ^hepes skin, yet occasion being offered, he will show hi self to be a ravening
and blood ^hristie deuorer of those poor beasts, whose skin he was clothed
with. So al^hogh that hitherto ye have most craftily ^ouered your self with
Christ's name, yet ^ow thou do show thy self to be a filthy ^dolater, and
falls worshipper of God, and that the love to thy Idols and Ido^atrous mass
(which thou co^planes that ^e have expelled) has moved thee to ^rite, and not
the love of God and Sal^ation of thy brethren as thou pretends. ^hou fayest
that we have expelled Christ (...) his images, it became thee first to ^ue
prouen that he was present in yma^s, and then thy argument had been the
stronger. But that images are forbidden of God, and that his people shall abhor
them and flee from them, as from snares that catches the souls of ignorants
in the miserable captivity of Idolatry, and deuorcement from God, the whole
Scriptures do testify. First the Lord our God expressly forbids in the
Second commandment Exodus 20.
of the Decaloge, that we shall make any images, similitudes or lycknesses of
any kind of thing in the heaven above, the earth beneth, or in the water under
the earth. Secondly that if it shall come to pas that Satan shall fill any
ma^s heart with vanity to make images, then are we forbidden to render any
kind of reverence ather in outward gestur or in inuard mind. In these words
thou shall not bow down to them, nor worshep them. Thridly he promises to
punish the transgressors of this commandment, unto the third and fourt
Generation. This is the immutable decrie of the most hiest, concerning images,
whereupon we rest, not caring what men of how great authority, nor the wicked
world, be cankered custom has ather done or used to the contrary. How
grievously Idolaters are punished, the severe and rigorus execution used by
Moses against them (who yet was the meakest man on earth) evidently
witnesses, read the 32. of Exodus Nume. 12. Erod. 32.
The intysers to Idolatry must be killed although they appear to be holy, how
neir so ever they be of kin, freindship or alliance. Deuter. 15
The miserable (and unto this hour endless) captivity of the whole 10. Tribes

Seeing therefore that as the wise man says, they were not from the beginning,
nether shall continue for ever, with him Saple. 14
I conclude that they are miserable, and among the dead is their ho^e that
worshippeth and calls them Gods, that are the works of men's hands. Finally
whither we that depends upon God allone to receive our doctrine of his mouth
or ye that stablisheth your doctrine by the authority of the Church, of
Counsels and Doctors, which of us exponeth the Scrip tuce according to man's
invention. Let all me^ judge as they will answer to God.

I Require, o learned and lettered men, for the death of Christ's sake to weye
and consider this foresaid, for I burn when I se so expert me^ with a great
nom ber of others led by your persuation and exemple in so manifest perrel and
danger of their Salvation. Wherefore abhor and reject ye the Christian peoples
Sacrifice that is the mass? which we have figured by the Law of nature and of
Mayses, pro mised in the Prophets, which we have exhebit and given us in the
Euangel, which was received and authorized in the Primative Kirk, and has been
always used so often as a thing most necessar by all the Elect and predestmat
people of God, which thing most plainly witnesses, Dionisius Areopagita,
Ignatius with the rest of the holy Fathers of the primative Kirk, whose
judgment and authority in exponing and declaring the holy Scripture, namelye
of the Sacrifice of the mass. I pray you (o co^uing men) let us with sobernes
follow and not lean to our own wit and judgment in a matter of so great
importance. Let us stere up the negligence and sluggishnes of Pastors, not
tollarable, and let us plainly argew their abuses with the veheme^cie of Gods
word. And I pray God of his infinite mer ^y that we may confirm and keep the
Christian people in true Faith and god lines, and that we may edify and help
as belongs to Christian men, ilk one other of charity in Religion and godly
life. Because we oght to aduert most ^r ^u^spectlie that we pervert not the
treu faith and Religion, and fear lest we understand ^uer hie in exponing of
holy Scripture. And first of all we oght to provide that we leid in
captivity, our own wits and others, and that understanding we may have the
poverty and humility of Spirit which Christ our Lord placed in the fundation
of Christian building and has promised to recompense the same with the Realm
of heaven Mat. 15. The Lord mo^ grant us all to be so affected. And thus fair
ye well o learned men, in Christ Jesus. And requires you again that ye would
declare me manifestly as the Minister of Gods word oght to do, what ye think
of the mass, the Christian peoples Sacrifice, for so I hope it shall come to
pas that by quiet talking had on ather party and writings given and taken, we
shall be instructed by the holy Spirit, what we our selves should believe in so
weighty a matter and what we oght to propone to others, and set forth to trow.
For the thing that I trow and beleuis is teached by the holy Scriptures, the
holy doctors writings and consuetude of the Kirk. The same I as it ap^rteineth
to every Christian man to do. I profess simple and plainly with out any
simulation. Written at Edinburgh in the Palaice of the most noble Queen of
Scotland 18. calend of December. Remember I pray you, and prent in your minds
that in the last days the continual and daily Sacrifice is to be taken away,
Laws and statutes to be ^brogat and changed, and ye know by ^home, by the
Antichrist, and they that ta^th part with him, take head to your ^elues my
brethren I beseech you. God is ^itnes of what mind I deal with you.

D. Feargussones answer.
HOw the aforsaides are by us weyed and considered, let the indifferent ^ader
judge, what zeil it is that hither^o has, and yet still does burn you, I ^aue
already noted. Ye ask of us why we ^eiect the mass, which ye call the
Chri^tiane peoples Sacrifice, we answer. Because it is not that thing in deid
which ^e call it in word, as at lenth before I ^aue prouen, nether are ye
able to prove (...) Gods word that ever Christ appoin^ed his ministers to offer
the Sacramen^all bread and wine, in Sacrifice for their ^wn sins, and the
sins of the people, ^swel dead as alive. Cry out, and affirm ^his matter with
als many words as ye ^st, ye^ may ye not be believed until ye ^roue it by the
Scriptures, other Sacri^ces then Gods word teaches us, we may not with saif
conscience admit, except we wilfully provoke God to punish and consume us in
his wrath, as he did Nadab Zeuiti. 10.
and Abihu, and vterlie reject us, as he did Saul. S. Paul writing to the 1.
Samuel 13.
Romans exhorts us to give up our bo dies, a lyning Sacrifice, holy and
acceptable unto God, which he affirms to be Roma. 12.
our reasonable serving of God. The Apostle writing to the Hebreues, also
exhorts us to offer the Sacrifice of thanks geuinge always to God, through
Christ, which (he says) is the fruit of Hebre. 13.
our lips which confess his name, willing us also not to forget to do good,
and to distribute (he means our substance to them that ^edeth) for (says
he) with such Sacrifices God is pleased, other Sacrifices appertening to
Christian people, we know none commanded in the new Testament.

Ye boste much of Moses, of the Law of nature, the Prophets and the Euangel,
but out of none of the^ bring ye any prufe for your purpose. Ye affirm that
your mass was authorized in the Primative Church, and always used of Gods
chosen, and yet ye infer none of their excersices for your exemple, but the
bare names of two men, whose authority and strenth is to weak to withstand Gods
word.

As to Dionisius Areopagita, I will set his master S. Paul against him,
writing to the Corinthians, who having occasion to treat of the verity of the
Lords Supper (abused in that Church) rehearses 1. Cor. 11.
the words of Christ's institution, which of him he had received, faithfully
without adding to, or diminishing, which words and whole action there by him
recyted, how like they are to your mischeuous mass, I make your self judge.
Then whi there ^ght we to creadit the Elect veshell of God S. Paul that spak
not his own words but Christ's, or to Dionisse that has added unto them (if
it be treu that ye allege on him) judge also. Ye will never be able to prove
that, that Dionisse of who^ ye mean, was that Dionisius Areopagita that believed
Paul's doctrine, in the Acts Actis. 17.
of the Apostoles, and although it were, yet is he of no such authority as an
Angel of heaven, whom yet we are forbidden Sala. 1
to creadit, teachi^g any other doctrine then Paul has taught, but rather to
hold him accursed. But that ever Paul taught ather to Timothy, Titus, or any
other Minister that he did appoynte over any Church, the merualus craft of
massing, the Scripture makes no mention. Acursed therefore be the teachers of
it as the Apostle has commanded us to hold them. As to Ignatius and the rest
of your holy Fathers, I have spoken my judgment of them already, that is, that
I nether contempne them nor build my Faith upon them, seeing that they were but
men and so might be deceived, and also deceive others. As to your requeist,
wherein ye exhort us to follow them obsolutlie in exponing the Scriptures, it
is more then any Christian may admit, seeing that we may follow no man, further
then they follow Christ, nether in this case call any man Father or Master upon
earth, having one Father the Eternal ^th. 23.
God, and one Master Christ Jesus in the heaven, yea, and although that Paul

will not suffer us to trust in man, or make him the Pattern of our salvation,
lest we be accursed of God. As to the ^nggishnes of your Pastors we leave them

infinite mercy to deliver his people from falls doc trine, and give them grace to

Now ye bid us fair well, and thereafter ye require us to declare unto you
manifestly (as the Minister of Gods word oght to do) what we think of the
mass, which ye throughout this letter have called the Christian peoples
Sacrifice. This your requeist we dar not put back, not for that we judge that
ye will believe the treuth when it is told you, but because we are bound to give
a reconing of the hope that is in us, to every one that demands it. ^eter.

I have already declared unto you what Sacrifices are appointed for Christian
people, to offer, out of the 12. Chap. of S. Paul's Epistle to the Romans, and
13. to the Hebreues. But as to a Sacrifice for our sins daily to be offered
(as were the Sacrifices and oblations of the old Testament) appointed of God
unto the time of reformation, we understand that not only have we no neide so
to do (being (...). 9.
now already purged by the blood of Christ) but also whosoever he be that so
does, estemeth the Sacrifice of Christ insufficient, which the Apostle
affirms, he offered ones for all on the Croce. And as it is (says he)
appointed unto me^ that they shall ones die, and after that comes the
judgment, so Christ was ones offered (...). (...). (...) the 9.
to take away the sins of many, and unto them that look for him shall appear
the Second time without sin, unto Salvation. From the 7. Chapter unto the
midst of the 10. Chapter, he trauelleth at lenth in this matter, finding no
other fault with the Leuiticall Sacrifices, but that they were daily offered,
because they had not strenth to expel sin at ones, and therefore infers
that Christ's Sacrifice was the consumation and end of them, and all other
Sacrifices for sins. Forasmuch as he by one oblatio^ has done that thing
(to wit, consecrated for ever them that are Sanctified) which they be so often
offerring and Sacrificing, could not do, concluding, that where remission of
sin is, there rests no more offerring for sin. Cursed be he the^, that
offers for sin any more, seeing the holy Ghost has concluded the contrary.

As to your mass ye shall have our judgment of it in few words, and what we
do mislyke in it. First we mislyke the person that says it, and judges him
to be a blasphemer of Christ's death, because he takes upon him the office of
Christ, namely, he undertakes by that Sacrifice which he offered, to pacify
the wrath of God the Father, conceived against as well his own sins, as the
sins of them for whom he offers, whither they be alive or dead. But this
can no man do, but Christ alone, for of him and to him, alone were these words
spoken out of the heaven, by the mouth of his Father. This is my well-beloved
Son in whom I am well pleased, hear him. wherefore your ^ath. 3. and ^7.
priest in his mass taking the aforesaid office upon him, does all that in
him lies to spoil Christ of his dignity, and therefore worthy to be judged a
falls Christ, and a traitor to man's Salvation, for if Christ pronounces in the
Euangel, all such as came before him (vsurpinge the name of Messiah, or title
of Sauioures) to be thieves ^hon. 10.
and murderers. How much more worthy are they of that name, that dare
presume to be Sauioures, ather of them sellues or others now when he is come
and parfited the work of our Redemption. Secondly, we mislyke the whole action
of your mass, which from the beginning to the end, is nothing else but als
plain an Antithesis or co^traposition to the Lords Supper, as light is to
darck nes, or treuth to falshead. First the Lord Jesus when he institute this
Sacrament and did minister it (I dout not most sincerely) to his Apostles, was
no other ways clothed then his common custom was. And your preistes, after
whose ordoure I can not tell, for Arons preistes they will not grant them selves
to be, and according to Melchisedeces ordour there was never one but Christ,
then must they be Baals chaplanes, they I say dissagysed like players (every
piece of their cote co^teining a mystery) proceadeth to their mass. The Lord
Jesus sat down with Luke 22.
the 12. Apostles. They stand at an alter alone, he gave thanks unto the
Father before the Ministration, and they before 1. Cor. 11.
their mass rehearses there blasphemous Confiteor, wherein every S. in
heaven is made equal (or as we say) Iakfellow like, unto the Eternal God. He
preached the confortable promises of Salvation Ihon. 13. 14. 15. 16.
mixed with exhortations to mutual love and amity. etc. In that language that
they all might understand, they nether preach nor exhort, but occupyeth the
time with speaking to the wall, and now and then for the manersakes, one word
or two (turning them to the people) in a strange language that nether the
people nor the grea test part of those god makers them selves understands. In
giving the Apostles the bread, the Lord Jesus declared unto math. 26. mark. 14.
them in plain words, what it signifies namely his body, which should be
broken for them. In these words, take eat, this is my body which is broken
for you. They round and whisper their words, with a certane magical
susurration, as if it were treason to speak them that the people might hear,
saying, hoc est enim corpus meum adding this word enim at their own hand, but
this is not done without a mystery, for to this end say they do we it, that as
the Uirgin conceived Christ, with these five words, Fiat michi secundu^
verbum tuum so we may make Christ of Luke 1.

furthe, these profound mysteries every soul priest knows not, but only
the great Rabbines. All that were present with Christ were pertakers of the
Sacra meant, and no man is pertaker with them, mark. 14.
for they deuore all alone. But some of the^ will say, we debar no man if any
would take part, the contrary is true, it was never seen that ever a priest
would part, with a quarter of his God to another priest, no not with a lyck of
his dishe, and that is les, this I say they never did to their own brethren of
craft, much les to a lay man, as they did call them, I never knew any thing
that ever they might or did forbear to any man at that dosoned disione except
it were a kiss of the Patene, and that only to him that lifted their tail or
else to some gentilme^ that sat by, whom they would gratify. If temporal men had
been als evil fellows of their carnal brekfasts as ye were of your
fantastical Feasts, some of you had not worn so fat necks as ye did. Christ
gave unto his Apostles the fruit of the wine tree without any mixture, but your
mass is not ryghtly said, except there be commixtion of water and wine
together. In the Lords Supper both true bread and true wine is ministrat to
the communicants, and in the mass the papist affirms that there remaneth
nether bread nor wine, after their Incan tation, but accidents, as whytnes,
rou^dnes, and color. etc. when the Lord Jesus had finished his ministration,
the Evangelist says. They praised God with a Hymn or Psalm of
thankesgeuing. Bot math. 26.
when mass is done, there is nothing bot ^te ^issa est ather said or sung,
whereunto is added a latin blissing, with the aers of an empty cup. Now look
what ye think of your mass, for in my answer to the second Section of your
Epistle I have prouen it to be abominable Idolatry because that bread and
wine corruptable Creatures, are in it worshipped in place of God the Father and
Christ his Son, that it spoyleth Christ of his Preisthead, and so of his
Sacrifice, i^ that ye that offer it usurps his office upon you, I have pro
^e^ also. The wicked opinion of it, to wit, that it is Satisfactorie for
sins, in this argument also is included, and that the whole action of it in
all points dissagreeth with the institution of the Lords S^ per, the
conferring of the one action with the other above written sufficiently
proves. wherefore we judge that your papistical invention, the Idolatrous
Sacri fice of the mass, is to be rejected and abhorred of al true worshippers
of God as that, that is co^nelious and blasphemous to God the Father, and
Derogatio^ to the honor and dignity of the Lord Jesus his Son. This is it
that we think of your mass, and this doctrine we teach to the people out of
the infallible word of God, that indureth for ever, nether have we respect to

Ye desire us to prent into our minds that in the latter days the continual
and daily Sacrifice shall be taken away, understand ye this of your mass? if ye
do, the^ certanely, Master Doctor, your Theology is not only rude, but also
repugnant to the mind of the Prophet in this place, if ye mean of that sentence
that Daniel rehearses in the end of his 12. and last Ca. (as I think ye do)
for I know no place where this sentence (that ye have throwe^ for your purpose)
is written but in that place, if ye mean of that sentence, I trust the Readers
shall easylie perceive both your ignorance (if of ignorance ye have inferred
it) and otherwise your malice in throwing of this Text. Daniel (as he him self
confesses in the beginni^g of his Daniel. 9.
9. Chapter) understood by books, name ly of Ieremies Prophecy, that the Lord
had appointed his people to endure banishment out of their own cu^trie, and to
abyd captives in Babilo^ 70. years which years Ierem. 29
drawing neir an end, Daniel (as an cairful for his people and their returning
ho me) euerted hi^ self unto God by ardent and earnest prayer, desyring him not
to differ the time of their deliverance any longer, but for his own names
^aike (although they were not worthy) to restore them to their liberty, whil he
was yet speaking, praying and confessing his own sin, and the sins of his
people unto God. The Angel of the Lord is sent unto him, to otter unto him the
years determinat of their captivity, their returninge home, the reedifying of
the city, the coming of Christ, his slaughter, and destruction of the city
Jerusalem. By a vision is declared unto him in the 10. Chap. the cause of
Daniel. 10
^he hinderante or defferring of their deli^rance, which come by the means of
^ambises Prence of Persia. The king^omes of the earth and Monarchs, with their
Kings (as of Persia, Grecia, Egypt Syria and the Romans, one striuinge with an
other and all against God) are ^t lenth wonderful mystically recited in ^he
11. Chap. Finally in the 12. Chap. is Daniel. 11 and 12.
^eclared how the Church being eue^ scattered and dispersed, shall be delivered
by Christ's death, which should abolishe the ^aylie Sacrifice, which being
done, he Prophecies that the temple, and the city ^atbe distroyed by the
abominable de^ation, which is the Host of the Romans, mystically also
signifeing. By the thousand, two hundredth and nynety days and by the thousand
three hundredth and five and threttie days, the time from the deuastation of
Jerusalem to Christ's second coming in the Clouds, the Prophet also in the
mean time is certified that although he depart out of this life, yet shall he
stand up at the end of the days, in the general resurrection, to ring with
God in glory. Let all men now judge whither that this prophecy apperteineth
to the abolishing of the Iudaical Sacrifices or not, and then shall it appear
how falsely and ignorantly ye throw this place, as I have said, contrary to the
Prophets mind, adding of your own, that this Sacrifice shall be taken away in
the last days, where as there is no such word in the Prophecy, ^id it who so
list, but with such lies and additions has your kingdom (that now bosteth to
fall) been holden up.

To conclude ye say that Laws and statutes shall be abrogat by Antichrist and
Daniel. 7
his adherents, we are very well contented that the name of Antichrist be
ascribed un to that man, or those men that ever has abrogat, or now does
abolish any Law, statute or ordinance, that ever God in his

^tlie rage passes the bounds of all modesty. The first was Stephanus the
sext, this made tyrant soun after that he was made Pope, first of all abrogat
all the Acts of his predecessor Formosus, and gathering a Counsel they
concluded to take the body of the dead man out of the grave, (...) de vit^ pon^
and beside some other superstitions used toward hi, Stiue^, caused the two
fingers of his right hand to be stricken of, these two namely that he used to
consecrat his preistes with, and thereafter caused the fingers to be cast in
Tyber. The other, to wit, Sergius the third, thought it not yneugh to abrogat,
yet ones again, the Acts of the same Formosus, and to put all out of
authority that he had authorized, but caused the Second time the dead Cor^s to
be taken out of the grave and the head to be stricken from it, as if he had been
leuing, and the body as not worthy of Sepulcher, to be casten in tyber blood.
Great was this controversy (says Platyna) and a most wicked exemple,
specially this consuetud being afterward still almost observed of such as were
Popes, that ather they brak or utterly abrogat the constitutions and Acts of
their (...) decessors. Hitherto platyna, yet I am compelled to recite an
exemple mo of your holy Fathers, written also by the same Platyna, and so
conclude. Paul the Second of that name, before he was Pope, called Petrus
barbo an venetiane borne, he succeeded to Pius the Second, and immediately after
he was established in his dignity, did bear such hatred and inuy to all that
ever his predecessor had done, that straight way he abrogat al his acts and
statuts, and put out of office, all the learned men that the other had gathered
together, to be his abbreuiatoures, among whom Platina was one, who somwhates
more boldly then the rest, exhorted the Pope that their cause might be suffered
to come to trial and examination before the Judges. When the Pope had frowardly
looked on him a while, he brusteth furthe his answer in these words. Ita nos
(inquit) ad iudices renoc^s / ac si nescires omnia ^ra in Scrinio pectorie
nostri collocat^ esse. Sic stat sententia (inquit) loco cedant omnes / c^nt quo
velunt / nihil eos moror / pontifex suin mihi^licet pro arbitrio animi / ^orum
acta et ^ere et approbare. Hitherto Platyna that is to say, and do thou so
(says (...)) call us back unto the Judges, as if thou knew not that all Laws
were placed within the chist of our breist. Thus (says he) stands the
sentence. Let all Marck ^ood render this proud braging.
men give place, let them go where they list, I regard them nothing, I am
heigh Bishop, and it is lesome to me according to the arbitriment of my mind,
ather to break, or allow the Acts of others. The Lord open your eyes, ears
and mind, to se, to hear and consider the treuth, and considering it, to
imbraice it. For if this be not Antichrists voice, then shall it never be hard.
To the lord our god be praise for ever more, that thus has Illuminat our eyes
to se and espy the enemy to all ryghteousnes, to the end we may avoid him,
and so the plagues that God has prepared to pour out upon that beastly
kingdom, and the pertakers therewith. Thus have I answered (according to my
knowledge) this foresaid Epistle, although not so learnedly as some other of my
brethren could have done, yet (I dout not) treuly, and according to the
Scriptures of our God, whose power is sufficient to beat down all imaginations
