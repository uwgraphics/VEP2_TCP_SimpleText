TO ALL CHRISTIAN Parents, and Governors of Families; Grace and Peace be
multiplied.
IT is (as ye know, well-beloved) the Commandment of God, that Parents should
teach and instruct their children in the true Religion and worship of God, as
it is to be seen in these places following, Deuteronomy. 4.9.6.6.11.18, 19. Proverbs
22.6. Ephesians. 6.4. Examples also there are of many that did it, as, Abraham,
David, etc. Genesis 18.19. 1 Chro. 28.9 Proverbs 4.3, 4. Timothy knew the
Scriptures from a child, 2. Tim. 3.15. and that (no doubt) by the instruction
of his mother, and his grandmother, who are commended for their faith by S.
Paul, 2. Tim. 1.5. Secondly, the benefit that follows hereof, is great,
Proverbs. 22.6. And the want hereof is the cause of much evil to your
children, and (many times) of great grief to your selves. Be diligent
therefore and careful to perform this duty. Parents generally teach their
children to say the Lords prayer, the Creed, and the ten Commandments: and it
is a good and commendable thing for them so to do. But they are not there to
stay, (as if it were sufficient to say these things without book) but to go
further, and to teach them the meaning thereof. Many aged persons there be,
that can say the words, but understand little or nothing thereof: nay know not
so much as what the Creed is, but use it for a prayer. The reason heerof is,
they were not ^nstructed in their youth. That all therefore (even the simplest)
may be able to teach their children the meaning of the things aforesaid, I have
here framed, first of all, a very short Catechism for little ones; from the
age of four, to 6 or 7 years. In which time I think there is scarce any of so
weak capacity, but may be able to learn it. Secondly, I have framed another,
fit for such as are of six or seven, till they come to ten or twelve years of
age, and may in that time be easily learned: and the rather, because the first
is comprehended in it. Then thirdly, I have more particularly and largely set
down the meaning of each Article of the Creed, of the Sacraments, of every
Commandment, and of every petition of the Lords prayer: with diverse other
points necessary to be known of all Christians, and that before they come to
be partakers of the Lords Supper. And this also may the more easily be
learned, because the second Catechism is included in it. And in all three I
have labored for three things, namely, order, brevity and plainness. For this
I find by (almost 30. years) experience, (in the Ministry) that things
orderly, briefly, and plainly handled, are best remembered, and soonest
learned: and though the Answers be many, yet if they be short and plain,
both children and others will learn them with ease and delight. Concerning the
method and order here observed, it is this:

First, briefly it shows the benefit of Catechizing, what it is, and what be
the parts of it, Quest. 1. to Q. 8.

Secondly, it shows what God is, and sets down his works of Creation,
and Providence, and namely, man's creation. All which are comprehended in the
first Article of the Creed, Quest. 8. to 30.

Thirdly, it discovers our misery by reason of sin, Quest. 30. to 44.

Fourthly, it declares how we are redeemed from our misery, namely, by Christ,
where is showed what Christ is concerning his person, Quest. 44. to 57. Then
what he did to work our redemption, and to make it perfect, the which is set
down in the 4.5. and 6. Articles, Quest. 57. to 74. And what is the last work
that Christ shall perform on earth, Quest. 74, 75, 76.

Fifthly, it makes known, how all that which Christ has done, is made
profitable to us, Quest. 77. to 81.

Sixthly, it shows who they are which are sanctified and joined to Christ,
namely, the Church, and what benefits belong to the Church, Quest. 81. to 98.

Seventhly, it shows what is required on our behalf, that we may be
partakers of Christ and his benefits, namely, a true faith, what this faith is,
how it is wrought in us, and wherefore we are said to be saved by faith
only, Quest. 98. to 104.

Now because the Sacraments are ordained of God for the help of our faith, it
shows next what these Sacraments are, what things are thereby signified and
sealed to us, and what is required to the right use of them, Quest. 104. to
144. And forasmuch as that faith whereby we are justified, is not a dead, but a
lively faith, it shows what this faith does bring forth in us, namely,
repentance, and repentance good works: what these good works are, namely,
such as God has commanded, Quest. 144. to 159. And then follows in order the
meaning of the ten Commandments, Quest. 159. to 247. Then after that follow
certain points concerning the Law, as whether we can be justified by the
works of the Law? If not, then to what end the Law does serve, and wherefore
we are to do good works, how they are to be done, and whether they shall be
rewarded of God or no? Quest. 247. to 258.

Lastly, it shows that we of our selves can do no good work, but only by
the grade of God, and that the grace of God is to be obtained of us by prayer:
and then follows the meaning of the Lords prayer and what shall become of all
after this life, Quest. 258. to the end.

All which things are briefly, familiarly and plainly set down by Questions
and Answers that even the simplest may easily (if they will use the means)
both learn and understand the same. And because that in matters of Religion,
nothing is to be received, but what is plainly proved by the Scriptures, I
have at the end of almost every Answer, quoted the places of Scriptures, for
the proof of the same. And the places (for the most part) are plain and
easy, as you shall find if you turn to them. And that you may see that
whatsoever is necessary to be known, believed and practiced of us to
salvation, is contained in the Scriptures, I have also set down in order the
very substance of Divinity in Texts of Scripture.

Lastly, to the end that all may the more detest Popery, I have added a
Dialogue between a weak Christian, and a Minister, showing that Popery is
contrary to the very grounds of the Catholic Religion, and that therefore
Papists cannot be good Catholics. And this I have done, not in hatred of their
persons, (for I wish unfeignedly their conversion in this world, and their
salvation in the world to come) but in hatred of their false doctrine, and that
the simple may not be seduced with the title and color of Catholics and
Catholic Church. Although many sound and learned divines have of late years
fully laid open all points of Popery, and thoroughly confuted the same: yet the
vulgar sort, either for want of money to buy their books, or leisure to read
them (being for the most part very large) or else for want of knowledge to
judge of them (being learnedly written) know not so much as what Popery is: but
think (yea and sometimes speak it) that the Papists differ not much from us,
and that we might be easily reconciled.

For the good therefore of the simple and unlearned, I have briefly, plainly
and familiarly set down such special points, as they do hold contrary to the
very grounds of Religion: that so, such as yet stand, may be confirmed, the
weak ones kept from embracing Popery, and such as are of late fallen from us,
may (if Gods will be such) be reclaimed.

By Papists I understand such as cleave to the Pope in religion, and are
obedient unto him. And I think they will not be offended with the name, no
more then we are with the name of Protestants. And in setting down their
opinions, I deal not with them, as they deal with us, namely, charging us
with such things as we teach not, but rather utterly disclaim.

As for example: There was not long since (in a certain City of this
kingdom) apprehended a Jesuit: and among other things found about him, he
had a certain paper, wherein were 44 positions, set down as doctrines
maintained by Protestants: and of these 44. almost 20 of them were gross lies.
As for example:

First, that we hold and teach, that children are saved only by the faith of
their parents without baptism.

Secondly, that one must not baptize but at a Sermon.

Thirdly, that God does not only permit, but does cause sin.

Fourthly, that there is no Cup of consecration.

Fifthly, that one may preach without being sent, with such like things; which
are most notorious lies: for Protestants teach no such things, but rather the
contrary. If any have broached such doctrine, if they be known, they are
punished by our Church.

And this has bin their practice from time to time, in charging us with such
points of doctrine, as were never allowed of, but condemned by us. In setting
down therefore of their opinions, I allege either their very words, or the
sum thereof, and quote the places where the same are to be found. And I do
not set down the words of some private man, or of such as are of no account in
the Church of Rome, but of their Council of Trent; the Rhemists, Bellarmine,
and such as whose words and writings are approved and allowed of by the Church
of Rome.

And then at the end of every particular point of Popery, I quote also diverse
of our own late Writers, where the points are handled more at large: so that
if any be disposed to see what they hold, and how they are confuted, he may
turn to the Authors, and find the same. And because the Papists stand so much
upon antiquity, I have also set down the time when the most substantial
points of Popery came first into the Church. (See Doctor Abbot, in defense of
the reformed Catholic, page 109. to 121.)

There is one thing, which (it may be) some will not like of, and that is, the
using of some homely comparisons, and pleasant conceits: but I would have such
to know, that a Pill is a very bitter thing, and therefore men (many times)
before they come to swallow it, will roll it in honey, or some other sweet
thing, that it may go down the more pleasantly: and therefore I have done the
like with this my Pill, that so it may be taken with the more delight. And
herein I have done but as Elias did with Baals Priests, 1. Kings 18.27. and no
more then Esaias did with idolaters in his time, Esaias 44.16.

My request then to you is, that you will accept these four small mites, and
employ them for your own direction, and the good of your families. Teach your
little ones the first, and then as they grow in years, let them learn the
rest. And herein you are to have a respect to the nature and condition of your
children. If they be but of weak capacity, and have but weak memories, you
are to require the less of them. If that you would allow them some small time
in every week to learn the same, and every Lords day (after the public
exercises in the Church) you would spend but one hour, or half, in examining
them, you shall find, that in a few years they would even learn them all. And
further, this you shall find, that by teaching your families, you shall much
profit your selves, so that when you shall hear the Catechism expounded in
the Church (as Ministers are now commanded to do it) you shall by this means
understand the better what is taught, and profit a great deal the more by it.

You shall do well also to read over oftentimes the Texts of Scriptures (as
they are set down in order) and so you shall see how every point of doctrine
(deliuerd by the Minister in Catechizing) is confirmed. And concerning the
Catechism for Catholics, you shall do well also sometimes to read it, or
cause your children to do it, that so you may see what Popery is, and
accordingly take heed of it. These things if you be careful to perform, I
doubt not, but (in a short time) you shall find great good to come hereof to
your children, much comfort to your selves, and God hereby shall be glorified:
to whose most blessed and holy direction, I commend you now and for ever.

Yours to his uttermost, I. M.

the Sabbath?

A. From the equity of it. God has given us sire days for the works of our
calling; and has taken but one for his public worship and service: therefore
we must spend that in his service.

Q. Whence is the second taken?

A. From Gods own erample. God treated all things in six days, and rested the
seventh, so must we on the six days do our own works; but rest on the Lords
day, and sanctify it.

Q. Whence is the third reason taken?

A. From the end of the Sabbath. god has appointed it for our good, even to be

A. The blessing of long life and good ^ayes. Ephesians. 6.3

life, and the disobedient live long?

A. It is promised to the obedient, and performed so far as God sees it good
for them, Esa. 57.1, 2 2. Chr. 34.28

FINIS.
To the Christian Reader.
THere is one thing (Christian Reader) which I would have thee especially to
take notice of, concerning the former Principles, or Grounds of Religion:
namely, that nothing is to be received for a Principle of Religion, or true and
sound doctrine, which has not foundation in the Word of God, or is not
contained therein: for the Word of God (or the Scripture as we call it) is the
rule of all truth, and gives us a perfect direction, both for faith and
manners: and whatsoever Article and doctrine is necessary to salvation, is
delivered plainly in the holy Scripture; and therefore in reading this, or any
Catechism, you are not by and by to believe whatsoever is therein contained:
but to see and consider how every thing is confirmed by the Scriptures; for
your faith and conscience must be grounded, not upon the weak and imperfect
speeches of sinful men, but upon the pure and sure Word of God. And
therefore at the end of every answer, I have quoted some plain place of
Scripture to confirm the same, some few only excepted, which though in plain
words they are not to be found in the Scriptures, yet by good consequence they
are drawn from the Scriptures. And whatsoever is truly and soundly collected
from Scripture, is to be believed of us, as though it were expressly written. As
for example, when Christ would confute the Sadduces that denied the
resurrection, he alleges the words of God to Moses: I am the God of Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob. From hence this truth is strongly collected, viz. that
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob shall live, and rise according to their bodies:
because God (says Christ) is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
Therefore now this consequence, that Abraham and the Saints departed, shall
rise, must be credited no less then that express Scripture from whence
Christ drew it. And to the end that you may see, that all necessary points of
faith and manners are plainly expressed in the Scriptures, I have here in
order set down the sum and substance of Christian Religion, in certain
Texts of Scripture. The order of it is this: The true knowledge of God and of
Jesus Christ, which is life eternal (that is the way and means to eternal
life) is to be found in the Scriptures. Therefore first we begin with the
Scriptures: then we come to the knowledge of God, and of his works, as of his
eternal decree of Predestination, Creation, and Providence, concerning Angels
and men: in which, Providence is to be considered, the fall of Angels and man,
and the misery that followed thereof, namely, sin and death. Secondly,
follows Gods Covenant with man, namely, the covenant of works, and the
covenant of grace. Concerning the covenant of works, there is showed the
impossibility of keeping it, and to what end it serves. In the covenant of
grace is noted; First, the foundation of it, which is Christ the Mediator.
Secondly, the means of applying Christ unto us. In Christ we are to consider
his person, and office. His office is threefold. The application of the
covenant of grace, where is showed the union and communion which the elect have
with Christ. The means of the revealing and applying of the covenant of grace,
are either inward, as the Spirit of Christ, and faith; or outward, namely, the
Word and Sacraments, The manner of revealing it, is our calling unto Christ.
The persons to whom it is revealed, namely, to the Church. As the benefit we
receive from the prophetical office of Christ, is the revealing of the
covenant of grace, whereby we are made wise to salvation: so the benefit we
receive from the Priestly office of Christ is our instification before God. The
benefit we receive from the kingly office of Christ is our glorification, which
is partly in this present life, but fully and perfectly in the life to come.
Our glorification in this life, consists in this, that in our condition we
are made blessed, and made holy in our nature, which is Sanctification. The
rule of Sanctification is the Word of God, even the Law and the Gospel. The
effect of Sanctification, is Repentance. The notes of Repentance, are specially
two: A hatred of all sins, and the practice of good works. Among good
works, alms and prayer are specially commended to us. The special helps to
prayer, and to the performing of other good works, are vows and fasting. Then
lastly is to be considered, Gods dealing with man after this life, by bringing
all men to Judgment, which is either particular, or general. And to the end
that you may (in reading these Texts of Scripture) perceive, how one thing
depends upon an other, I have set down (over the Texts of Scripture) the
things whereof the places following do speak. If therefore you will
accordingly be diligent inreading the Texts of Scripture, I doubt not but (by
Gods grace assisting you) you shall in a short time much benefit your selves
thereby, and shall be able (when need requires) to prove any ground of Religion
by some Text of Scripture. And so I commit you to the merciful protection of
Almighty God, beseeching him to endue you with all saving grace, and to present
you faultless before the presence of his glory, with exceeding joy, through
Jesus Christ. Amen.

life, and they are they which testify of me. 2 Timothy 3.16, 17. All Scripture
is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be
perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works. Mark 12.24. Do ye not
therefore err, because ye know not the Scriptures, neither the power of God?

God, and Jesus Christ whom thou have sent. Heb. 11.6. He that comes to God,
must believe that God is, etc. John 4.24. God is a Spirit, etc. Exodus 34.6.
The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long suffering, and abundant in goodness
and truth, etc. 1 Cor. 8.4. We know, that an idol is nothing in the world, and

and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living
soul. Genesis 1.27. God created man in his own Image, etc. Ephesians. 4.24. And put on

we live, and move, and have our being. Mat. 10.29, 30. Are not two Sparrowes
sold for a farthing, and one of them shall not fall to the ground without your
Father? Yea, and all the hairs of your head are numbered. Prou. 16.33. The lot
is cast into the lap: but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord.

(Of the fall of Angels, and Man.)
2. Pet. 2.4. God spared not the Angels that sinned, etc. Jude 6. The Angels
which kept not their first estate, etc. 2. Cor. 11 3. The Serpent beguiled Eve,
through his subtlety, Genesis 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Now the Serpent was more
subtle then any beast of the field, etc. Eccles. 7.29. God made man upright,
but they have sought out many inventions. Romans 5.12. By one man sin entered
into the world, etc. for in him all have sinned. Psalm. 51.5. Behold, I was
borne in iniquity, and in sin has my mother conceived me. 1. Ioh. 3.4. Sin
is the transgression of the Law.

(Of the punishment of sin.)
Romans 5 12. By one man came sin into the world, and death by sin. Romans
6.2^. The wages of sin is death. 2 Thessalonians 1.9, 10. Who shall be punished with
everlasting destruction, from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of
his power.

(Of the Covenant of Works.)
( The Covenant of works is she Moral Law, put into men's hearts by God, and
afterward repeated by Moses.) Leuit. 18.5. Ye shall keep my Statutes and my
judgments; which if a man do, he shall live in them. Deuteronomy. 27.26. Galat.
3.10. Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written
in the book of the Law, to do them. (This Covenant all have broken, and
therefore are under the curse.) Ierem. 31.32. Which my Covenant they brake.
Gal. 3.19. Wherefore then serves the Law? It was added, because of
transgressions, till the seed should come, to whom the promise was made. Romans

(Of the Covenant of grace.)
( Genesis 3.15. I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy
seed and her seed, it shall bruize thy head, etc. Genesis 22.18. In thy seed
shall all the Nations of the earth be blessed. Heb. 8.10, 11, 12. This is the
Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, (says the Lord;) I will
put my Laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to
them a God, and they shall be to me a people. And they shall not teach every
man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying: Know the Lord; For all
shall know me, from the least to the greatest: for I will be merciful to their
unrighteousness, and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.

(Of CHRIST the Mediator.)
I. Tim. 2.5. There is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the Man
CHRIST JESUS. Heb. 9.15. And for this cause is he the Mediator of the new
Testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions
that were under the first Testament, they which are called, might receive the
promise of eternal inheritance. John 11. In the beginning was the Word, and
the Word was with God, and the Word was God. Verse. 14. And the Word was made
flesh, and dwelt among us.

(Of Christ's Prophetical office.)
(Christ performs this office, in opening and revealing unto us the will of
God.) John 17.26. I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it. John
15.15. All things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you.
Acts 3.22. For Moses truly said unto the Fathers, A Prophet shall the Lord your
God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me, him shall ye hear in
all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. Luke 4.18. The Spirit of the Lord
is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach the Gospel to the poor, to
preach deliverance to the Captives, and to preach the acceptable year of the
Lord.

(Of the Priestly Office of Christ.)
Christ performs this office, by appeasing God, and reconciling us unto God,
through his death and obedience 2. Cor. 5.18, 19. who has reconciled us to
himself by Jesus Christ. God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself,
etc. Ephesians. 2.16. And that he might reconcile both unto God, in one body by the
Cross, etc. Heb. 5.6. Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedech. Heb. 9.28. Christ was once offered, to bear the sins of many,
etc. Heb. 10.14. By one offering he has perfected for ever them that are
sanctified, Heb. 7.25. Wherefore he is able to save them to the uttermost, that
come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.

(Of the Regal or Kingly Office of Christ.)
(This Christ performs, by governing all things for the salvation of his
elect, and destruction of his enemies.) Dan. 7.14. And there was given unto him
dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations and languages
should serve him, etc. Luke 1.3. He shall reign over the house of Jacob for
ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end. Ephesians. 1.22, 23. And has put
all things under his feet, and gave him to be the Head over all things to the
Church, which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all. Lu.
^0.27. But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them,
bring hither and slay them before me. (Thus far of the Covenant of grace, of
Christ the Mediator, and of his threefold office) (The next thing to be
considered of, is the application of the Covenant to the Elect giving them a
part in Christ, and in all his benefits) Heb. 3.14. For we are made partakers
of Christ, etc. (The part they have in Christ, is, first union with Christ.
Secondly, thereby Communion.)

(Of our union with Christ, which is by the Spirit and Faith.)
Ephesians. 5.30. For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones,
1. Cor. 12.13. By one Spirit we are all baptized into one body. Ephesians. 3.17.
That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.

(Of our Communion with Christ.)
(The which is the participation of the benefits flowing from his several
offices. (The benefit we receive from the Prophetical office of Christ, is the
revelation of the Covenant of grace, whereby we are made wise unto salvation.)
Mat. 11.27. All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knows
the Son, but the Father: neither knows any man the Father, save the Son and
he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. 2. Tim. 3.25. The holy Scriptures
are able to make thee wise unto salvation, etc.

(The means of revealing the Covenant of grace, are both outward and inward.
The outward are the word and the Sacraments. By the Word is meant the Gospel
preached which contains and publishes the promises of salvation by Christ.)
Romans 1.16, 17. The Gospel of Christ is the power of God unto salvation, to
every one that believes, etc. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed
from faith to faith, etc. 2. Tim. 1.10. Christ has abolished death, and has
brought life and immortality to light, through the Gospel.

(Of the Sacraments.)
Romans 4.11. And he received the sign of Circumcision, as a seal of the
righteousness of faith, etc. Mat. 28* 19. Go ye therefore and teach all
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the holy
Ghost: Mark. 1.8. I indeed have baptized you with water, but he shall baptize
you with the holy Ghost.

1. Cor. 11.23, 24, 25. The Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed,
took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said; Take, eat,
this is my body which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After
the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped, saying, This cup is
the new Testament in my blood: this do ye as often as ye drink it, in
remembrance of me. 1. Cor. 10.16. The cup of blessing, which we bless, is it
not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not
the Communion of the body of Christ? (The inward means whereby the Covenant of
grace is revealed, are the Spirit and faith.)

1. Cor. 2.9, 10* 12. Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered
into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for them that love
him. But God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit. Now we have received
not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know
the things that are freely given to us of God. John 3.33. He that has received
his testimony, has set to his seal, that God is true. 1. John 5.10. He that
believes on the Son of God, has the witness in himself.

(Of the manner of revealing the Covenant of grace, viz. vocation or calling.)
Romans 8.30. Whom he did predestinate, them he also called. 2. Tim. 1.9. God
has saved us, and called us with an holy calling (The Covenant of grace is
revealed to the Church.) Mat. 11.25. I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and
earth, because thou have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have
revealed them unto babes. Ephesians. 5.25. Christ loved the Church, and gave himself
for it. (Thus much of the benefit, flowing unto us from ye Prophetical Office
of Christ. The benefit we receive from the Priestly office of Christ, is our
justification before God, through his righteousness imputed unto us, and
apprehended by us.) Rom 8.30. Whom he called, them he also justified. Romans
5.19. As by one man's disobedience many were made sinners: so by the obedience
of one shall many be made righteous. Romans 3.24, 25. Being justified freely by
his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ, etc. Romans 5.1. Being
justified by faith, we are at peace with God, etc. Acts 13.39. By Christ, all
that believe, are justified from all things; from which ye could not be
justified by the Law of Moses.

(Of the benefit of Christ's Kingly Office.)
(The benefit we receive fromthe Kingly Office of Christ, is our glorification,
whereby our whole nature, estate and condition is restored according to the
Image of Christ our King.) Romans 8* 29, 30. Whom he did foreknow, he also did
predestinate to be conformed to the Image of his Son, etc. Moreover, whom he
did predestinate, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also
justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified. Colos. 3.4. When
Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in
glory. Reuelat. 20.6. Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first
resurrection: on such, the second death has no power, but they shall be the
Priests of God, and of Christ, etc.

(Of Sanctification.)
Titus 3.5. Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to
his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy
Ghost. 1. These. 5.23. And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly, etc.
Ephesians 4.24. And that ye put on that New man, which after God is created in
righteousness and true holiness.

(Of the rule of Sanctification.)
(The rule and square of it is the whole word of God: that is, both the Law
which requires obedience, and the Gospel which directs us how to perform
it.) Ioh. 17.17. Sanctify them through thy truth; thy Word is truth. 1. Pet.
1.23. Being borne again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by
the Word of God. Tit. 2.11, 12. For the grace of God that brings salvation,
has appeared to all men, teaching us, that denying ungodliness and worldly
lusts, we should live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world.
(The Law is comprised in the ten Commandments.) Deuteronomy. 4.13. And he declared
unto you his Covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten
Commandments, and he wrote them upon two Tables of stone.

(Of the effect of Sanctification, viz. Repentance.)
Acts 26.20. But showed first unto them of Damascus, etc. that they should
repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance. Lam. 5.21. Turn
thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned, etc. 2. Cor. 7.10. Godly
sorrow works repentance to salvation, not to be repented of, etc. (The notes
or signs of repentance are specially two: the hatred of all sins, and the
practice of all good duties.) Psalm. 119.128. I hate every false way. ver. 6. I
have respect unto all thy Commandments. (The hatred of sin is showed in
spiritual warfare against it, which is the withstanding of all temptations
unto sin, from the devil, the world, and our own flesh, by the power of the
grace of God.) Ephesians. 6.10, etc. Put on the whole Armor of God, etc.

Ephesians. 4.27. Neither give place to the devil. Iam. 4.7. Resist the devil and
he will flee from you. 1. Ioh. 5.4. Whosoever is born of God overcomes the
world: and this is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith. Gal.
5.24. They that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh, with the affections and
lusts.

(Of good Works.)
Ephesians. 2.10. We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
which God has before ordained, that we should walk in them. Titus 3.14. And
let ours also learn to maintain good works to necessary uses, that they be
not unfruitful. Iam. 2.26. As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith
without works is dead also. Heb. 13.16. To do good, and distribute, forget
not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. Luke 11.41. But rather give
aims of such things as ye have: and behold, all things are clean unto you.

(Of Prayer.)
1. These. 5.17, 18. Pray without ceasing. In every thing give thanks, etc. 1.
Tim. 2.1, 2. I exhort therefore, that first of all, Supplications, Prayers,
Intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, etc. Iam. 1.5. If any
of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, etc. Mat. 6.9. After this manner
pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, etc. The special helps to prayer
and other good works, are vows and fasting. (A vow is a solemn promise to
God, of some lawful thing that is in our power, for the confirmation of our
faith, and testifying our thankfulness to God.) Psalm. 50.14. Offer unto God
thanksgiving, and pay thy vows unto the most High.

(Of Fasting.)
(Fasting is an abstinence for a time not only from meat and drink, but also
from all delights, for the furtherance of the special practice of repentance,
and the enforcing of our Prayers.) Joel 2.12. Turn ye even to me with all your
hearts, with fasting, etc. 1. Cor. 7.5. Defraud ye not one the other, except it
be with consent for a time, that ye may give your selves to fasting and prayer.

(Of Death, and the last Judgment.)
Heb. 9.2, 27. It is appointed unto men once dye, and after this the Judgment.
Acts 17.31. God has appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in
righteousness, by that Man whom he has ordained, etc. 2. Corin. 5.10. We
must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ, etc. Mat. 25.31, 32, etc.
When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the Angels with him,
then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: And before him shall be
gathered all Nations, etc. Verse 46. These shall go away into everlasting
punishment; but the Righteous into life eternal.

FINIS.
A Pill to purge out Popery; OR, A Catechism for Romish Catholics; Showing
that Popery is contrary to the grounds of the Catholic Religion, and that
therefore Papists cannot be good Catholics.
The Speakers.
A weak Christian. A Minister.


DIALOGVE I.
Christian. AMong the diversities of opinions that are in the world, how may I
know which is the truth whereto I must cleave, and who are the true Church and
true Catholics?

Minist a Believe not every spirit (that is, every doctrine, which men bragging
of the Spirit do teach) but try them whether they be of God, or no; b Examine
all things, hold fast that which is good. a 1. John 4.1: b 1. Thessal. 5.21.


C. Whereby shall I try them?


M. By the Scriptures, John 5.39. Acts 17.11.


C. I am unlearned, and the Scriptures are hard to be understood.


M. There are indeed many things in them, hard to be understood: (2. Pet.
3.16.) but such things as are necessary to be known of all to salvation, are
plainly set down. Prouer. 8.9. The meaning of which place is this:

The Word of God, in points necessary to salvation; is easy unto all that have
a desire unto it. Turn to the places of Scripture, added to every answer of
the Catechism, and you shall find this to be most true.


C. Is there no other way and means, whereby to try and know the truth and the
true professors thereof?


M. Yes, it may be done even by the aforesaid grounds of Religion. Whatsoever
doctrine is agreeable thereunto, is true, and to be received: but whatsoever is
contrary to the same, is false, and to be rejected. As many as do sincerely
and soundly embrace, profess, and practice the same, they are the Catholic
Church, (that is, parts and members of the Catholic Church) and true
Catholics indeed. But such as teach, profess, and practice things contrary
thereunto, are not the true Church, nor true Catholics.


C. The Papists say that they only are the true Church, and true Catholics,
and that we are not.


M. So the Jews cried: a The Temple of the Lord: b We are the seed of
Abraham: the children of GOD. a Jeremy 7.4. b John 8.33, 41.

But Christ told them, they were the children of the devil. Ioh. 8.44.


Chapter Are not the Papists then good Catholics?


M. No: but rather gross Heretics.


C. What is an Heretic?


M. One that does err in any fundamental point of Christian Religion, and
does obstinately teach, maintain and defend the same.


C. Do the Papists err in the fundamental points of Religion?


M. They do teach and maintain many false opinions, against the very grounds
of Religion; as by and by shall be showed in many particulars.


C. Are all Papists then heretics?


M. No: for there are (no doubt) many of them that do err of simplicity and
ignorance, and which would be brought from their errors, if they had the
means, namely, the Scriptures in their own language, preaching, catechizing,
and the like. We do not therefore account them all Heretics, but only those
before mentioned.


C. How do you prove that they are not good Catholi^ks?


M. I prove it thus: They are good Catholics, which are of sound faith and
good life. (Augustine lib. quaest. in Mat Chap. 11.) but Papists are neither of
sound faith nor good life: therefore they are no good Catholics.


C. How do you prove that they are not of sound faith?


M. Even by the Apostles Creed (which may serve instead of a rule, whereunto
the faith of all men ought to agree) contrary whereunto they teach many things.


C. Show me wherein.


M. The Creed is a confession of faith* containing the sum of the Gospel,
and of such things as are necessary to be believed of all that will be saved.
They have devised many other new Articles of faith besides, and contrary to the
Articles of the Apostles Creed: which they hold necessarily to be believed of
all that will be saved: As namely, indulgences and a treasury of saints
merits, the real presence, the Popes supremacy, Purgatory, and such like. In
the Council of Trent, the curse Anathema is pronounced upon all such as deny
these or any of them. Master Perkins first Vol. page 621. The Creed teaches
what every one in particular is to know and believe: and a true faith cannot
stand without certain knowledge. The Papists maintain an implicit, or an
ignorant faith; namely, that it is enough to believe as the Church believes:
though they know not what the Church is, nor what the Church believes. And
they commend this faith by the example of an old devout father, a Colliar, who
being tempted of the Devil, and asked how he believed; answered, That he
believed as the Church believed: being asked again how the Church believed, he
answered, As I believe: whereupon, the Devil (as they say) was feign to depart.


C. It should seem it was but a simple devil: for if he had bin wise, he
would have asked him this question; What if the Church believe that thou art a
fool; what would the Colliar think you have answered then?


M. I think he would have said nothing: for if he should have said, I believe
so too, the devil might then have begged him for a fool indeed. And yet such
fools are the simple and ignorant Papists, which content themselves with this
kind of faith: for thus one may reason with them; You are to believe as the
Church believes: but the Church believes that you are fools: therefore you
are to believe so to. This their implicit faith every one of himself may have.
The devils in some sense may be said to have a better faith then this: for they
know what is contained in the Scriptures, and believe it to be true, Mat. 4.6.
Iam. 2.19. This fond and ridiculous kind of faith, is a notable means to
muzzle people in blindness, superstition and perpetual ignorance. Again faith
is a certain and true persuasion of the heart, whereby we are persuaded, and
in some measure assured of the forgiveness of our sins, and eternal
salvation. The Papists say, It is presumption to be assured of salvation, and
will have men to doubt thereof: the which is contrary to the nature of true
faith. They call the certainty of remission of sins, a faithles persuasion:
and the faith of devils, not of Apostles. Council. Trid. Sess. 6 cap. 9.12, 13.
Rhemists Annot. 1. Cor. 9. Sect. 9.


DIALOGVE 2.
C. Show me, I pray you, what things in particular they teach contrary to any
Article of the Creed.


M. I could show you many, but I fear that then I should be tedious to you: I
will therefore set down only the chiefest. In the second and third Article is
described and set forth unto us both the person and office of our Mediator,
namely, that he is both God and man, a Prophet, Priest, and King.

Concerning his person, although in words they confess him to be God and man,
yet indeed they deny it: for they ascribe to him a body invisible and infinite:
they teach that he is corporally present in infinite places at once, which is
proper only to God, and contrary to the nature of a true body. And so in
effect they do even deny his Manhood. The Son of God is called Jesus,
because he is a Savior, yea the only and perfect Savior which saves us from
our sins: that is, has delivered us not only from the blame, or guiltines,
but fully also from the punishment due to our sins, Mat. 1.21. Acts 4.12.
Heb. 7.25.

The Papists teach, that there must also some satisfaction of our own come to
make up our perfect Redemption, Council. Trid. Sess. 14.6.8. Can. 11.15. They
will not be saved only by JESUS CHRIST but by the merits also of Saints, their
own merits, Popes pardons, etc. yea they ascribe that to others, which is
proper to Christ alone, and so consequently make them their Saviors: As for
example.

They ascribe to S. Francis the same titles, properties, power, and the very
same office due to Jesus Christ, and in all respects they make him like to
Christ: whatsoever Christ did, that (as they say) did S. Francis. And what is
this in effect, but to make him their Savior? That they do ascribe the former
things to S. Francis, is to be seen in a book written on purpose, to show the
conformity between him and Christ, called (The Conformity of Francis) the which
has bin confirmed by the authority of the Church of Rome. Pope Gregory the
Ninth, enjoined the faithful to hold and firmly to believe the things taught
in the said book, concerning S. Francis, and that he should be punished as an
Heretic that would think the contrary. Confor. F. 2. lib. 1 Fol. 3.


C. To whom else do they ascribe that which is proper to Jesus Christ?


M. To the Virgin Mary. They describe her nature by her name (Maria,)
consisting of five letters, and these (as they say) do import the five offices
to be exercised by her toward us. The first is, Maternitatis, of Mother-hood:
signified by the letter M: for she (as they say) is the mother of mercy,
through whom we obtain mercy. Her second office is Conseruationis, of
conseruing the treasure of God: signified by the letter A: which represents
Arcam thesauri, the chest of treasure: for in her (as they say) we shall find
an infinite treasure of the wisdom and grace of God. Her third office is,
Directionis et gubernationis, of direction and governing by example of her
life. This is imported by the letter R. and therefore she is named Regina, the
Queen. Her fourth office is, Iaculationis et repulsionis inimicorum, of
flinging and repelling back of enemies: signified by the letter I: and
therefore they pray thus to her: Tu nos ab host protege, et hora mortis
suscipe. Protect thou us from the enemy, and receive us at the hour of death.

Her last Office is Aduocati^nis, of Aduocation, imported by the letter A. from
whence they pray thus: O our advocate, turn thy merciful eyes unto us. And
what do they herein, but even place her in the room of Jesus, and make her
their Savior? These are the very words of Friar John Viguerius, (a Doctor,
yea and a public professor of divinity among them) in his Institutions to his
Catholic Theology, Cap. 20. Sect. 9. Fol. 214. And herein he is like to such
as can make Bells to sound, even what pleases their fantastical brain, and
as best may feed their superstitions humors.

Further they say, that she is the original or our salvation, the recouerer
of grace and forgiveness, our hope, our salvation, resurrection, etc. yea that
to her it is given to bruise the Serpents head, that she has done it, and
procured that peace between God and man, which no man could procure, Viguerius
Ibid. 214.215. Confor. Fran. in conclus. lib. 1. Is not this to make her a
Savior?


C. Surely yes: and I think it most horrible blasphemy.


M. Account you this blasphemy? what say you then to that which Carolus
Scribanius, a Jesuit has written of her? As namely, First, that the milk of
Mary may come into comparison with the blood of Christ. Secondly, that the
Christian man's faith may lawfully take hold of both as well as one. Thirdly,
that the best compound for a sick soul, is to mix together her milk, and
Christ's blood. Fourthly, that the sins and spiritual diseases of the soul,
are cured as well by her milk as by his blood. Fifthly, that her milk and the
merit and virtue of it, is more precious and excellent then Christ's blood.
These most horrible blasphemies, with many such like, are to be found in the
aforesaid Jesuits book: which M. C. has put into English, and sufficiently
answered, calling it, The Jesuits Gospel. Besides all these things, in a book
called, The Ladies Psalter, they have put out the word Lord, and put in the
word Lady. As for example Psalm. 110.1

The Lord said unto our Lady, Sit thou mother at my right hand, etc. The like
they do in the rest of the Psalms. And is not this good stuff, think you?


C. These books were written long agone, and it may be that they are now
rejected by the Papists.


M. The latter of them was indeed written long agone, but is not rejected, but
stands uncontrolled, or rather defended by the Jesuits, and those of the
principal. The former was written but lately. And whereas both the Author and
his book (as M. C. says) deserved the fire and halter, it was so far from
being misliked in the Romish Synagogue, or any way censured, that the book
has been reprinted, and the Author and his book stand enrolled, approved
and commended (in their great volumes set out for that purpose) for good and
Catholic. As they place S. Francis, and the Virgin Mary in Christ's room, so
do they the Pope also: ascribing that to him, which is proper unto Jesus
Christ, and may not (without blasphemy) be ascribed to any creature. They say
that the Pope is the Sun: the Church the Moon. The Pope is the Bridegroom:
the Church the Bride. The Pope is the head: the Church the body. And what is
this, but to place the Pope in the room of Jesus Christ; and even to say that
the Pope is Christ? Confor. F. 2. li. 2. fol. 10. That they do thus place S.
Francis, the Virgin Mary, and the Pope in Christ's room, and so make them
Saviors, is more at large and sufficiently proved (out of their own Writers)
in a little Treatise (set forth by M. Thomas Rogers in the year 1589)
entitled, An historical Dialogue of Antichrist and Popery.


DIALOGVE 3.
Chapter Hitherto you have showed, how the Son of God is called JESUS, because he
is a Savior, and how the Papists do place others in his room: Now show me
also why he is called CHRIST, and what that title signifies.


M. Christ signifies, Anointed: which title sets forth his Office: namely,
that he is our only true Prophet, Priest and King.


C. Do they teach any thing contrary hereunto?


M. They do even deny this Office of his, and so consequently, deny the
fruits of his coming in the flesh, 1. Ioh. 4.3.


C. Show me wherein they deny his Office.


M. Christ is a Prophet to teach his Church, and to reveal the will of God
unto us, to whom all are to hearken, Mat 17.5. Ioh. 10.27. Act. 3.22, 23. And
this he has perfectly done in the Scriptures.

They prefer their own blind traditions before the Scriptures: they lay
aside the Scriptures, accounting and calling them, Dumb Judges, A Nose of wax,
The black Gospel, Inken divinity, etc. Piggius Contr. 3. de Eccl. Hierarch.
lib. 3. cap. 3. A certain popish Doctor reasoning with M. Tindal, was not
ashamed to say, that we were better to be without Gods Law then the Popes.
They likewise set up Images to be Laymens books, and so in all this they deny
by consequence his Prophetical office. Christ is also a Priest, and that for
ever, after the order of Melchisedech, Heb. 7.24. And in this his office he
has none to succeed him. They acknowledge not this, but maintain still an
outward and corporal Priesthood, to offer up an outward sacrifice, even
Christ himself, Rhem on Heb. chap. 7.7. Sect. 7.8.


C. If this were true, why then, the Priest were become a Mediator between
God and Christ: the which is most absurd, to think that any creature should be
such a one.


M. It is indeed most absurd: and yet in the very Canon of the Mass they
intimate thus much, when they request God to accept their gifts and offerings
(namely, Christ himself offered) as he did the sacrifices of Abel and Noah.
And which is more absurd than this, (yea blasphemy for any to affirm) they (by
their former doctrine) do make the Priest to be more worthy, in some respect,
then Christ: for the person that does offer a sacrifice, is of more worth and
honor then the thing which he offers; but the Priest (as they say) offers
us Christ to God his Father: therefore the Priest that offers him, is of more
worth and honor then Christ, whom he offers.

As Christ is a Priest, so he alone, (and that but once for all) effred
himself: and by his one offering once offered, has made a full and perfect
satisfaction for all our sins, so that now there remains no more offering for
sins, Heb. 9.12, 14, 26* 10, 14, 18. They teach that in the Mass, there is
daily a sacrifice offered for the sins both of the quick and the dead: and so
they make Christ's sacrifice not to be the perfect and only sacrifice of the
new Testament, but set up another instead thereof.


C. They say that their sacrifice is not a new sacrifice, or another from
Christ's, but that it is the same.


M. The Author to the Hebrews teaches, that Christ's sacrifice neither may,
nor ought to be reiterated and repeated: for as it is but one, so it was but
once offered. And this word (Once) he uses five several times, Heb.
7.27.9.12.26, 28.10.


C. They say that Christ indeed was offered but once after a bloody manner: but
he is often offered after an unbloody manner.


M. This distinction of theirs has no warrant out of Gods Word: nay rather it
is directly against the Word: for, Heb. 9.22. it is said, Almost all things are
by the law purged with blood: and without shedding of blood is no remission.
From whence we may thus reason, Without shedding of blood is no remission: but
in the Mass is no shedding of blood: therefore no remission. And therefore it
is no sacrifice for sin.


C. Though this their distinction be not to be found in the Scriptures, yet it
is in the writings of the Fathers.


M. The Fathers indeed make mention of unbloody Sacrifices: but they hereby
understand not outward and bodily Sacrifices for sin, but the Spiritual
Sacrifices of Christians; and they so call them, in comparing them with the
bloody sacrifices of the Law, and with Christ's bloody Sacrifice.


C. The Papists do not say that the sacrifice of the Mass is an expiatorie,
but an applicatory sacrifice: that is, it serves not properly to make any
satisfaction to God, but rather to apply unto us the satisfaction of Christ
already made.


M. Their doctrine is, that it is a sacrifice propitiatory: that is, available
to obtain ( ex opere operato, by the very work wrought) remission and pardon
of all their sins: yea, that it is available to obtain all other benefits;
as peace, health, and such like, Council. Trid. Sess. 22. Can. 3. Bellarm. lib.
1. de Miss. cap. 25. lib. 2. cap. 9. But let it be (as you say) that they
account it but an applicatory sacrifice, yet this makes nothing for them. The
Sacrifices of the Law did serve to apply the virtue of Christ's Cross: and yet
the Apostle excludes them by this reason; that where there is remission of
sins, there is no more Sacrifice, Heb. 10.18. Wherefore if the Apostles reason
be good, it concludes also against their Sacrifice applicatory. Again, the
Apostle teaches, that therefore the Sacrifices of the Law are abolished by
the death of Christ; because they were but shadows of good things to come, and
could not make the offerers perfect, etc. Heb. 10.1, 2, 3. And therefore, this
kind of applying Sacrifice (which they feign themselves) has ceased. We need
not now a Sacrifice for the application of Christ's death: for Christ to that
end has appointed the preaching of the Word, and has instituted Sacraments,
whereby his death, with all the benefits thereof, are most fruitfully applied
unto us, Gal. 3.1. 1. Cor. 11.26. Again, this their applying sacrifice, is
against the nature of a Sacrament, in which God gives Christ unto us: whereas in
a Sacrifice God receives from man, and man gives something to God.


C. The ancient Fathers used to call the Supper of the Lord, a Sacrifice: it
should seem therefore, that there is some Sacrifice offered therein to God.


M. It is true that they called it so: not that Christ is therein offered a
Sacrifice to God, but in other respects. First, because that therein there was
an offering and giving of alms, bread, wine, etc. which are a Spiritual
Sacrifice. Secondly, they called the Sacrament, a Sacrifice, not properly, but
figuratively: because there was therein a representation of that Sacrifice
which was offered upon the Cross, and because it is a commemoration of Christ's
body, which he offered for us, and of his blood which he shed for us. Thirdly,
It is called a sacrifice, because it is an application of the Sacrifice offered
upon the Cross, unto our selves. Fourthly, It is so called, because of the
sacrifice of prayers and thanksgiuings: and because in the Lords Supper we
offered our selves unto God to be consecrated unto him, and serve him in body
and soul.


C. What is then your opinion of the Popish Mass?


M. It is an abbridgement of all superstition and idolatry: there is in it
adoration directed to bread: there is (as they say) the body of Christ offered
really in a sacrifice of propitiation: which was never offered but once with
shedding of blood. There is adoration of stocks and stones, invocation of dead
men, saying of Masses to the honor of Saints and Angels, worshipping of dead
men's bones, and such like abominations.


C. If the Mass be such an idol, and so contrary to Christ's sacrifice,
whence had it then its first beginning?


M. The Mass had this original: First, the Lords Supper was celebrated in
most simple and plain manner. Secondly, it began to admit some increase of
ceremonies, especially the offerings for the dead, which was but a thanksgiving
for them, until more then two hundred years after CHRIST. Thirdly, prayers
for the dead, got entrance into the Lords Supper about the year four hundred:
and then came in Purgatory, and the redemption of souls from thence by Masses.
Master Perkins. 2. Vol. 554.1. D. Again, you are to know that the Mass is
like a beggars cloak, patcht up with many pieces, whereof some were puts in at
one time, some at another. One Pope puts in one patch, another Pope puts in
another: and it was not fully patcht up, as now it is till twelve hundred
years after CHRIST, Acts and Monuments, Page. 1274, etc. And in the Canon of
the Mass, there are to be found a full half hundred of errors and
blasphemies, Synopsis, Papismi. the 13. general Controversy. quaest. 8.


C. But how can the Mass be so late and new, seeing that the Fathers in their
writings make mention of it?


M. The word (Missa) (which is now called the Mass) in the Fathers, signifies
a public meeting to the communion, and to prayers, or the solemn dismission
of that meeting, or even the form of their religious worship. And the Phrase
Missam facere, (used in some of the Fathers) does not signify to say the
Popish Mass, but to dismiss some out of the assembly. After the Sermon the
Catechumenists, (that is, such as learned the Catechism, and were not yet
admitted to the Lords Supper) are dismissed. And hereupon the Communion was
called Missa figuratively, because when it began, there was a dismission of
some, Perkins. 2. Volume 552.2. D. 553. Synopsis Papismi. the 13 general
Controversy. Quest. 2.


C. I am satisfied touching the Sacrifice of the Mass, by which (as I do now
plainly perceive) they do even deny the Priesthood, and the only sacrifice
of Christ: I pray you now to show me wherein else they deny his Priesthood?


M. Christ's Priesthood consists of two parts, Satisfaction, and
Intercession. As by his own Sacrifice once offered, he has made a perfect
satisfaction for our sins: so he now continually makes intercession to God
for us, Romans 8.34. Heb. 7.25. The Papists teach, that the Saints in heaven do
make intercession to God for particular men, according to their several wants:
and that having received particular men's prayers; they present them unto God.
And so herein they do also deny the office of Christ's Priesthood, Rhem. on
Luke. 16. Sect. 4. on 2. Cor. 1. Sect. 3. on 2. Pet. 1. Sect. 3. and in many
other places.


C. They say that Christ indeed is the only Mediator of Redemption, but the
Saints are also Mediators of Intercession.


M. This is but an idle distinction: for Christ only is the Mediator as well
of the one as the other. For in a true and sufficient Mediator, there must be
these properties: first of all, the word of God must reveal and propound him
unto the Church. Secondly, he must be perfectly just, and such a one as in whom
was no sin ever found. Thirdly, he must be a Propitiatour, that is, bring
some thing to God, that may appease and satisfy his wrath and justice for our
sins. Now, these three properties are not to be found in any creature, but in
Christ alone: and therefore he is the only Mediator of Intercession, as well
as of Redemption, Perkins. 1. Vol. 603.604.


C. Do they teach any thing contrary to the Kingly office of Christ?


M. Yes, they teach that the Pope is Christ's Vicar, and head of the Church;
that he can-make Laws to bind the Conscience; that he can make new Articles,
and abolish the old; that he can dispense with all the precepts both of the old
and new Testament: And so herein (and in many other such like things) they
deny the kingly Office of Christ.


C. It seems then to me (by this which you have said) that though in words
they confess Christ, yet in deed and in truth they deny him.


M. They do so indeed: for whosoever denies the office of Christ, (for the
performance whereof he came in the flesh) denies in effect, Christ to be come
in the flesh: but the Papists deny his office, therefore they deny him to be
come in the flesh: and so they are no good Catholics, but rather Heretics.


C. What should move the Church of Rome in words to acknowledge Christ, and
yet to deny his office?


M. It makes much for her profit, and by this means they do the more easily
deceive people. That their profit and advantage is the only end they aim at,
appears by a most blasphemous speech of a Pope of Rome, (Leo the 10.) who
being somewhat move dagainst one of his Cardinals, for alleging a place
against him out of the Gospel concerning Christ, answered him thus, Quan^um
nobis profuit is it a fahula de Christo? O what advantage has this fable of
Christ brought us? Sle^dan de sta^ Relig. etc. Reip. lib. 1 They are herein
much like to a Fowler, who spreading his net to catch Larkes, has tied to his
net an artificial Larks, a Lark in show, but not indeed. This he causes to
move and stir: the which the Larkes perceiving, and thinking it to be a Lark
indeed, they fall down by him, and so are caught in the net. So they have a
Christ in their mouths, to draw people to them, but it is a counterfeit
Christ. Or if it be the true Christ, yet they do but as the Larke-catcher
does, who many times has in his net a true and living Lark indeed, but it is
only to deceive the Larkes, and the more easily to catch them in his net. So
they profess Christ, have his Word and Sacraments among them, but it is only
to deceive simple people, and to make a prey of them.


DIALOGVE 4.
C. Do they teach any other thing con^arie to any other Article of the Creed?


M. Yes, diverse things. In the Article we profess to believe, that Christ was
conceived by the holy Ghost: and so he, and he only was conceived without
original sin. They teach, that the Virgin Mary was also conceived without
original sin: and that by this means it came to pass, that Christ was free
from all spot, Council. Trid. Sess. 5. cap. 1. de peccato originali. And so
herein they do altogether overthrow this Article of Christ's conception by
the holy Ghost, to whose only power the Scripture does impute Christ's holiness,
and not to the Virgin Mary, which was no less then all others conceived and
borne in sin, and did need Christ to be her Mediator as well as the rest of
mankind. There was a long time a foul stir in the Church of Rome, between
the Dominicans and the Franciscans about this point, Acts and Monuments, page.
732. It was the common opinion of Fathers and Writers until Lumbards time,
(which was about the year 1150) that she was conceived in Original sin,
Perkins. 2. Vol. 596. In the 4. Article we profess, that Christ suffered, etc.
by which he has made a full and perfect satisfaction for the sins of his
elect, and for the whole punishment thereof, both eternal and temporal.

The Popists teach, that Christ has satisfied for sins going before
Baptism: but concerning sins following Baptism, the fault is remitted by
the passion of Christ, and the punishment (which of infinite is made finite) is
to be satisfied for, by men themselves either here or in Purgatory: that is,
men themselves must satisfy the justice of God, for the temporal punishment
of their offenses, either on earth or in Purgatory.

There is (say they) a certain infernal place in the earth, called
Purgatory, in the which as in a prisonhouse, the souls which were not fully
purged in this life, are there cleansed and purged by fire, before they can be
received into heaven. Bellar. de Purgat. lib. 1. cap. 1. and cap. 3. lib. 2.
cap. 6. Rhem. on 1 Cor 3. Sect. 4. They say also, that it is an Article of
faith, to believe that there is a Purgatory; and that he which beliues it not,
is sure to go to Hell, Bellarm. ibid. lib. 1. cap. 15. But this is so far
from being an Article of faith, as that it is a mere fable, and contrary to
an Article of faith. The blood of Christ is the Purgatory of our sins, 1.
John 1.7. Afflictions are called the fiery trial, (1 Pet. 1.7. 4.12.) whereby
we are cleansed from our corruption, as gold is from the dross by fire. No
other Purgatory is to be found in the Scriptures. The Scriptures mention but
two sorts of men, believers and unbelievers; and but two places after this for
them, heaven for the one, and hell for the other, Luke 16.25, 26. John. 3.36.
Revel. 20.14, 15.21.7, 8. They that die in the Lord, rest from their labors:
which cannot be true, if any of them go to Purgatory. Their works follow
them, that is, the reward of their works, Revel. 14.13. If any man should have
gone to Purgatory, then the thief upon the Cross had gone thither: who
repenting at his end, wanted time to make satisfaction for the temporal
punishment of his sins: but Christ said to him, To day shall thou be with me
in Paradise. The doctrine of Purgatory came into the Church, out of the
heathen writers, for the Philosophers and Poets were the first that ever wrote
of it: and Popish Purgatory was unknown to the Fathers, many hundred years
after Christ, Perkins. 2. Vol. 568.569.


C. If Purgatory be but a fable, contrary to an Article of faith, then what is
the cause that the Church of Rome so stiffly maintains it?


M. There is great cause why they should so do, for it keeps in the fire in
the Popes Kitchen: for, if the fire of Purgatory were not great, the fire in
the Popes Kitchen would be but small; for, by this means they have store of
money for Pardons, Masses, Diriges, and other such like trumperies.


DIALOGVE 5.
C. Do they teach any thing else contrary to the Creed?


M. Yes: The sirth Article says, that Christ ascended into heaven, etc. and
the Scriptures say, that the heavens must contain him, etc. Acts. 1.11.3.21.
They teach contrary heereunto, namely, that Christ is corporally present in the
Sacrament, and that in many places at once: The which is contrary to the nature
of a true body, and contrary to the nature of the Sacrament, which is a
remembrance of Christ. Vigilius against Eutyches. lib. 4. says thus: When it
(that is, the flesh of Christ) was on earth, it was not in heaven: and because
it is now in heaven, it is not on earth. This is the Catholic faith and
confession. It is an Article of faith to believe the Catholic Church: and
faith is the evidence of things not seen, Heb. 11 1. Therefore the Catholic
Church is always unto the world invisible, and not to be espied but by the
eyes of faith: because things seen are not believed. The Papists teach, that
the Catholic Church is, and has but always visible, Rhem. on Mat. 5. Sect.
3. The Church is said to be Catholic, that is, universal, because it is not
tied to any one special place, but is spread abroad over the face of the earth.
They tie it to Rome alone, which can be but a particular Church, and not
universal. In the Church there is a Communion of Saints: and these are they
that are sanctified by the blond and Spirit of Christ, having the perfect
holiness of Christ put upon them, by imputation of faith, and the quality of
imperfect holiness powered into their heart by the Spirit of sanctification. And
such are the faithful here on earth. 1. Cor. 1.2. Psalm. 16.2.

The Papists acknowledge none to be Saints, but such as are in heaven. They
teach that the Pope can canonize Saints: whereas to make one a Saint, is only
the work of God, 1. Cor. 11. The Pope has canonized many that indeed were
never true Saints of God, but wicked men, and rank Traitors to their Princes,
as Becket, with many others.

This canonizing of Saints, was never heard of with the Fathers, until the
year 880. and then Adrian took up this authority. And Alexader the Third,
after him, confirmed it in his decrees.

In the Creed we profess, to believe the forgiveness of sins: that is, I
believe that God, for Christ's sake does freely forgive the sins of his elect,
and my sins also. And herein consists our justification, namely, in the
free forgiveness of our sins, and the imputation of Christ's right ousnesse to
us. The Papists teach many things contrary to this Article. First, that men are
to make satisfaction for their sins. Now: satisfaction for sins, and
forgiveness of sins, are contraries. If we satisfy in our own person, we
are not justified freely: if we be justified freely (as most certainly we are,
Rom 3.23.) then we make no satisfaction at all. If a man can satisfy and pay a
debt, then he needs no forgiveness: but if the debt be forgiven him, then it is
plain, that there is no satisfaction made. The satisfaction for our sins,
was made by Christ, and not by us.


C. Did not the ancient Fathers teach men to make satisfaction for their
sins?


M. The satisfaction which they maintained, was an ecclesiastical and public
mulct, or penalty imposed upon notorious offenders, thereby to testify their
repentance, and to satisfy the Church whom they had offended, Perkins. 1. V.
577, etc. 2. vol. 165.2. D. 166.

The efficient cause of our justification, is God alone. It is God only that
forgiueth our sins. Esa 43.25. Mar. 2.7. To. 8.33. They teach that the Pope can
forgive sins, and we know that he gives pardons, not only for the time past,
but also for the time to come: yea they teach that priests have full right to
remit sins, and they allege these places to prove it: Mat. 16.19. Ioh.
20.23. Now we are to note this, that as none can forgive a debt, but the party
to whom ye debt is due: so none can forgive sins, but God only, against whom
the sin is committed, Ps. 51.4. The power of binding and loosing committed to
ye Apostles and Ministers of ye Word, is, by declaring the will and pleasure of
God out of his Word, both to pronounce forgiveness of sins to al yt are truly
penitent: and the retaining of them to the impenitent. The Pope and his Clergy
are never able to prove themselves to be she true Ministers of Christ: and
therefore they cannot so much as challenge this latter authority and power to
themselves* much less she former, which is proper to God only. The motive or
impulsive cause, which moved God to justify us, was not any thing in us, but
only the grace of God, that is, the free good will and pleasure of God, To.
3.24. Ephesians. 2 8. Tit. 3.5, 7. They teach, that we are not justified by grace
only, but by works also, that is, by the merit of our works. And to this end
they have (of late years) devised a first and secand justification. The first
is, when a sinner (of an evil man) is made a good man: and this (they say)
comes only of Gods mercy by the merit of Christ. The second is, when one (of
a good of just man) is made better and more just, and this proceeds from
works.

But we are to know, that there are not two kinos of justification, a first
and second; but one and the same justification, considered in different
respects. In respect of Gods actual acceptance of a maus person,
justification is absolute: but in respect of the actual application, and
manifestation of Gods acceptance unto a man's conscience, justification is by
parts and degrees. (M. Scudder on the Lords Prayer, page 303. to 309.

And further we are to note, that the Papists second justification, is no other
then sanctification, which is an effect and fruit of justification: the which
is imperfect, and not able to justify us before God. Themateriall cause of our
justification, is the active and passive righteousness and obedience of Jesus
Christ, his inherent holiness, his fulfilling of the Law, his death, sacrifice
and full satisfaction.

The formal cause, or the form of justification, is the righteousness of
Christ, imputed of God unto us, Romans 5.19. Romans 4.5, 6, 7, 8. 1. Cor. 1.30. 2.
Cor. 5.19, 21. Phil. 3.9. The Papists detide this doctrine, that Men are
justified by the imputation of the righteousness of Christ: which righteousness
is not in us, but in Christ. The Rhemists call it a new no-iustice, a
fantastical apprehension of that which is not, Rhem. on To. 3. Sect. 7. They
hold them accursed that so affirm and teach: And they teach, that the only
formal cause of our justification, is the justice of God, whereby we are not
reputed and accounted just, but are made just indeed: and this justice is that
which every man has within himself, and is inherent in him, Council. Trid.
Sess. 6. can. 10.11. Rhem. on Phil. chap. 3. Sect. 3. The isntrumental cause
of justification on our part, is a true and lively faith, whereby we receive
and apply unto our selves the merry of God, Christ Jesus and all his benefits,
resting upon him alone for our salvation.

They teach, that faith does not justify, as an instrument in apprehending the
righteousness of Christ, but as a proper and true cause, it actually justifies
by the dignity, worthiness and meritorious work thereof, Bellarm. lib. 1. de
iustificat. cap. 17. They teach also, that faith is not the only cause of our
justification, but that there are other also, as hope, charity, almes-deedes
and other virtues: yea they say, that works are more principal then faith, in
the matter of justification: and pronounce him accursed that shall say, a man
is justified only by faith, Rhem. on Romans 8. Sect. 6. and on James 2. Sect. 7.
Bellarm. lib. 1. de iustificat. cap. 13. Council. Trid. Sess. 6. can. 9. These
and other such like things they teach, contrary to the doctrine of
justification, which is a maine ground of Religion. And if there were no more
points of difference between us; these were sufficient to keep us from
uniting of our religions: for hereby the Church of Rome does raze the very
foundation.


C. You said before, that we are justified freely: I would know how this can
be, if we be justified by the righteousness, and for the merit of Christ.


M. Because the decree of God the Father for our redemption, is free, and we
pay nothing again to God of our own. And therefore by the word (freely) our
merits are excluded, but not Christ's. By which it appears, that in respect of
our selves, we are justified freely of Gods mere mercy and grace, without any
respect of our own righteousness or worthiness, but yet through Christ, and for
his righteousness and obedience imputed to us: both which are signified by the
Apostle, Romans 3.23, 24.


C. Show me (I pray you) what is meant by (Merit) what the doctrine of the
Papists is concerning merit, and whether that our works be meritorious or no.


M. By (Merit) we understand any thing, or any work, whereby Gods favor and
life everlasting is procured; and that for the dignity and excellency of the
work or thing done. Now the true merit whereby we look to attain the favor
of God and life everlasting, is to be found in the person of Christ alone, in
whom God is well pleased. The Papists make two kinds of merit: the merit of
the person, and the merit of the work. The merit of the person is (as they
say) a dignity in the person, whereby it is worthy of life everlasting. The
merit of the work, is a dignity or excellency in the work, whereby it is made
fit, and enabled to deserve life everlasting for the doer of the work: See
Rhem. on. Romans 8. Sect. 5. We now do renounce our own personal merits, and
all merit of our own works, and rely only upon the merits of Christ, and we
hold that no works of ours can merit. That no man by any works of his can
merit, may be proved by the properties and conditions that must be in a work
meritorious, and they are five.

First, the work must be absolutely perfect: but all our works are imperfect,
as well in parts, as in degrees of accomplishment. In parts, because we omit
many things which the Law prescribes, and do many evil things which the Law
prohibiteth. In degrees, because the works of the Saints are unclean, Esaias.
64.6. Phil. 3.8.

Secondly, a man must do the work of himself, and by himself: for if it be
done by the help of another, the merit does not properly belong to the dooer.
But the good works which we do, are not ours, but are wrought by God in us.

Thirdly, a man must do the work, of his own free will and pleasure, not of
due debt: for when we do that which we are bound to do, we do no more but
our duty. But whatsoever we do, we do it as poor debtors, nay, we are worse
then poor debtors; we are miserable bankrupts, we have nothing, we have
less then nothing to pay, Luke 17.10.

Fourthly, the work must be done to the benefit and profit of him from whom
we look to be repayed. But no man by any work of his can bring any profit
unto God, Job 22.2.35.7. Psalm. 16.2.50.12. We may benefit men but we cannot
benefit our Maker, from whom we have received life and limb, soul and body,
and all that we have: we can give him nothing, and therefore can deserve
nothing from him, To. 11.35, 36.

Lastly, the work and the reward must be in proportion equal: for if the
reward be more then the work, it is not then a reward of desert, but a gift of
good will. But there is no proportion between our works, which are altogether
imperfect, and the excellency of those great blessings, and benefits which the
Father gives us freely in his Son, Romans 8.18. And therefore in this and the
former respects, there can be no merit in any mere man: wherefore it is no
less absurd to say, that we merit salvation at Gods hands by good works,
then if one should say, Thou have given me an hundred pounds, therefore thou
ought to give me a thousand.


C. Was not this doctrine of merit taught in the times of ancient Fathers?


M. Merit being taken in his proper sense, for due and just desert, was never
allowed of the sound Professors for a thousand years after Christ, Perkins
first Vol. 574, 575. second Vol. 535, 536 Such therefore as will be justified
and saved by their own works, and challenge eternal life by their merits, do
show themselves to be most proud and unthankful persons, and deserve most
justly to be condemned eternally


C. The Papists, at their end, do renounce their own merits, and profess
that they look to be saved only by the merits of Christ.


M. If there were nothing else but this, it were enough to prove their doctrine
of merit, to be a false doctrine: for if it were a truth, then a man is not
only in his life time to profess it and maintain it, but also in his death;
yea rather to dye for it, then to deny it. But seeing they in their life
profess it and maintain it, but at their death renounce it; it is a manifest
argument, that even they themselves do know, that it is not a true, but a false
doctrine.


C. If they know that it is not a truth, what makes them then in their life
time so stiffly to maintain it?


M. It serves greatly to maintain and uphold the Popes kingdom: for they
teach, that the ouer-plus of Christ's merits, and of the merits of Saints and
Martyrs, is the treasure of the Church, which being gathered together, and put
into a store-chest, is in the Popes custody, and he alone has the plenary
opening and shutting of this Chest, and the ordering and disposing of these
merits: by virtue whereof, he gives out Indulgences and Pardons when and to
whom he will: So that such as have not merits enough of their own, may have them
from thence. And so hereby he maintains and vpholds his kingdom: for heerby
comes in infinite wealth and revenues, Perkins. 3. vol. 1. part. page, 165.2.
D. 2. vol. 590. 2. a. In these and many other particular points, the Papists
teach contrary to the Articles of the Creed, and therefore are no true
Catholics, neither do they belong to the Catholic Church, as is thus proved:
Whosoever have not the Catholic faith, do not belong to the Catholic Church:
but the Papists have not the Catholic faith; therefore they do not belong to
the Catholic Church. That they have not the Catholic faith, is plain by that
aforegoing.


DIALOGVE 6.
C. Do they teach any thing contrary to the doctrine of the Sacraments?


M. Yes, many things. Christ ordained but only two Sacraments. The Church of
Rome has added to them five more, namely, Confirmation, Penance, Matrimony,
Orders, and ertreme Unction.


C. Are not these Sacraments indeed?


M. No surely: for there are four things necessarily required to make a
Sacrament. First, the authority of Christ commanding it. Secondly, the element
or outward sign, as the matter of it. Thirdly, the word of institution, as the
form. Fourthly, the end and use, to be a scale of our faith, for remission of
sins. These four things are not to be found, in their five latter
Sacraments, and therefore they are no Sacraments indeed. Master Attersoll on
the Sacraments, page. 119. to 150. Synopsis Papis. Controu. 14, 15, 16.


C. May not the Church then institute and ordain Sacraments?


M. None may ordain a Sacrament, but only the Lord. As none may put a sign and
seal to a man's last will and Testament, but only the maker of the Testament:
so none may ordain Sacraments (which are signs and seals of the new
Testament and covenant of grace) but only the Lord which made the covenant.
And therefore the Church of Rome, in doing the contrary, proves her self not
to be the true Church of Christ, but rather the Church of Antichrist. They do
also in many other things teach contrary to the doctrine of the Sacraments. As,

First, that the Sacraments do give grace, and namely, remission of sins, ex
opere operato; by the work wrought, Rhem. Acts. 22. Sect. 1.

Secondly, that not only faith does justify, but the Sacraments also, Rhem.
Romans 6. Sect. 5. Whereas Sacraments me signs and seals of justification. Romans
4.11.

Thirdly, that Infants dying without Baptism, cannot be saved, Rhem. John 3.
Sect. 2. They have also added many idle ceremonies to Baptism, as Cream,
Tapers, Salt, etc. with an opinion of salvation and worship annexed unto them:
yea in times past they baptized bells, but now they begin to be ashamed of
it, and say that they were but only hallowed, and consecrated to holy uses,
Bellarm. lib. 4. de. Pont. Romans cap. 12. Synopsis Papismi, Controversy 12.
Question 5. Concerning the Lords Supper, they have likewise most grosty abused
it in many things.

First, they take away the Cup from the Lasty: whereas the Church of Rome for
above a thousand years after Christ, used both signs in the Communion. The
Communion under one kind, was decreed, defined, and determined as a public
Law in the Council of Constance, about the year 1114. Perk. 2. vol. 554 2. b.

Secondly, they reserve the bread in boxes, pixes and other vessels of the
Church, for days, weeks, and months. They show it to the people, the Priest
lifting it over his head, and going with it in procession. All this is contrary
to the Sacrament: for it is no Sacrament, unless there be a giving,
receiving, eating, and drinking, Master Attersoll on the Sacraments, 386.387.

The reservation of the Sacrament was not allowed of, but rather found fault
withal by the Fathers, Perk. 2. vol. 557.

Thirdly, they adore, fall down and honor the Sacrament with divine worship,
calling it their Lord and God. A thing never heard of among the heathen
Idolaters, namely, to worship a piece of bread, or rather, a thin wafer.

The adoration in the Sacrament belongs unto Christ sitting in heaven: and is
an inward worship of the heart, or lifting up of the mind, being stirred up
with the outward signs. Pope Honorius the Third (in the year 1220) was the
first that ever instituted the adoration of the Sacrament. And after him Urban
the fourth ordained a feast in honor of the body of Christ. Perk. 2 Vol. 564.
Attersoll on the Sacraments. 388.389.

Fourthly, they turn the Sacrament into a sacrifice for the quick and the
dead, abolishing the fruit and remembrance of the death of Christ, disannulling
his Priesthood, giving him to his Father, whereas the Father has given him to
us, etc. ibid. page 390.

Fifthly, they maintain Transubstantiation. These are their very words: If any
man shall say, that there remains the substance of Bread and Wine in the
Sacrament, after the words of consecration, or shall deny that the whole
substance of Bread and Wine is changed and converted into the body and blood of
Christ (the forms and shows only of Bread and Wine remaining: which singular
and miraculous conversion the Church calls, Transubstantiation): let him be
accursed. Con. Trid. Sess. 13. can. 2. This their doctrine of
Transubstantiation, is a very fable to mock fools withal, and it ouerturneth
both the nature and use of the Sacrament, Attersoll on the Sacraments, page 45.
46. and page 365. to 369. If there were a miraculous conversion (as they say
there is) of the Bread and Wine, it would appear to the outward senses. For
all true miracles are wrought openly, clearly, and evidently to men's senses,
John 6.26. But the Bread and Wine, by the judgment of all the senses,
remains and appears to be the same in substance which it was before, of
the same quality quantity, color, taste, handling, smelling, virtue and
nourishment: there is not any one sense, or all the senses together, that can
judge otherwise of it, then it did before. If a man should be called in, when
the Bread and Wine is set on the Table, and bidden to consider well what he
there sees, smells and tastes, and then is willed to go forth, and to come
in again, after the Consecration is ended by the Priest, and to do the like:
and then* is asked what he thinks of it: he, no doubt, will answer (unless
fear of persecution make him to conceal the truth) I see, feel, smell, and
taste the same water-cake, and wine that I did before. I can perceive no
natural and substantial change therein. And therefore it follows, that
there is no miracle wrought, and consequently; no Transubstantiation at all.
The difference that is, is in the end and use only. Before consecration, it
was common bread and wine, ordained for the nourishing of our bodies. After
consecration, it becomes holy Bread and Wine, sanctified by the Lord, not so
much to feed the body, as the soul.


C. Did not the ancient Fathers hold this doctrine of Transubstantiation?


M. They knew nothing hereof, for at least 800. years after Christ.
Afterward begun the disputations of Transubstantiation, but not approved as an
Article of faith. The Church for a whole thousand years taught no other then
spiritual receiving of Christ. In the year 1215. Transubstantiation was
decreed and determined in the Council of Lateran, under Pope Innocent the
Third, and made a maine matter of faith, Perk. 2. vol. 558.559.


C. What say you then of their Transubstantiated, or consecrated host (as i^ is
called) or the bread in the box carried in procession and worshipped?


M. Surely it is nothing else, but a wheaten, or breaden god, or rather an
Idol, nothing inferior to Aarons Calfe, or Ieroboams Calves, or the Nehustan,
and piece of brass that Ezechias brake in pieces: nay, as vile and detestable,
as any Idol among the Heathen. And for a conclusion of their doctrine of
Transubstantiation, I will here set down a witty conceit which one showed me
not long since: I have kept the matter, but changed the meeter, to make it
sound somewhat the sweeter.)

The Priests do make Christ's body and blood,
Hereof none must once doubt:
They eat, they drink, they box him up,
They bear him all about.

DIALOGVE 7.
C. I am satisfied touching the first point, namely, that the Papists are not
of sound faith: but how do you prove that they are not of good life, seeing
they do so many good works?


M. I prove it thus: Where the doctrine is corrupt, the life cannot be good:
but their doctrine (as you have heard) is most corrupt, therefore their life
cannot be good. A true faith is the ground of a good life, and without which
it is impossible to please God, Heb. 11.6. Yea, whatsoever is not of faith, is
sin, Romans 14.23. A true faith they have not, and therefore their works
cannot be good, and such as may please God. That they have not a true and
sound faith, has bin showed in many particulars, and it further appears also
in this, that they do even wilfully reied she means whereby it is wrought,
namely, the preaching, hearing and reading the Word of God. They have not,
neither will they have the Scriptures to be soundly preached, read, and heard
in their own tongue. That they cannot abide to have them in their own
language, appears by this one example: One Pauier a Towne-clarke of London,
(in the time of King Henry the Eightth) hearing that the Scriptures should be
put into English, he spoke to this effect, and confirmed it with an oath: viz.
that if he knew that the Scriptures should be put into English, and that the
King would have them to be read in the Church, rather then he would live so
long to see it, he would cut his own throat: But (as Hall says, who heard him
speak it) he was not so good as his word: for, in stead of cutting his
throat, he hanged himself.


C. What is the cause that they cannot abide to have the Scriptures in their
own Language?


M. S. John gives the reason. For, every one that does evil, hates the light,
neither comes to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved and discovered,
John 3.20. If the Owl fly abroad by day, the birds by and by discern him,
follow him and fall upon him; and therefore he flies abroad usually in the
night, and then he is quiet. If the Scriptures should be suffered to be
expounded, and read of all Nations in their own language, then that Owl of
Rome (the Pope I mean) with all his fooleries and abominations, would be
discerned and discovered; and then the world would hate him* follow after him,
and persecute him, (even as the small birds do the Owl:) and therefore they
cannot abide the Scriptures in the vulgar tongue, but love darkness rather then
light, because these deeds are evil, Ioh. 3.19.


C. What say you then to their good works, as building of Churches, giving of
Alms? etc.


M. These and such like works, required in the Law of God, in themselves are
good, and to be practiced of all: but to them they are (as the Fathers called
the virtues of the Heathen) but splendidae peccata, glittering dross, and
beautiful deformities.


C. Do they teach any thing contrary to the Moral Law, and to the doctrine of
good works?


M. Yes, they do both teach and practice many things directly contrary to Gods
Commandments. They teach for good works, such things as are not commanded,
but rather forbidden in the Law of God, as namely, to go on Pilgrimage, to vow
single life, to fast forty days and forty nights, etc.

First, concerning set Pilgrimages unto certain Images: there was none of the
Fathers that did so much as dream of them for 600. years after Christ at the
least, Perkins 2. Vol. page 541, 542.

Secondly, the necessity of the vow of continency was established first, and
annered unto Orders, about 380. years after Christ, and that by Pope Siricius.
But it had no universal admission, until the time of Pope Hildebrand, in the
year 1070. Perkins 1. Vol. 583. to 587. 2. Volume 575, 576. Acts and
Monuments, 1151.

Thirdly, their doctrine of single life was nener commanded of God, nor known
in the Primitive Church, but has sprung up since, and is indeed the very
doctrine of devils, 1. Tim. 4.13. So is also their forbidding of meats for
religions sake. They teach also, that a man may fulfill the Law; yea, do
works of Supererogation, that is, more then the Law does require: and that
men of their abundance, may allot unto others such works of Supererogation,
Rhem. on 1. Cor. 9. sect. 6. 2. Cor. 8. sect. 3. This doctrine of theirs makes
the Law of God to be imperfect, and is directly contrary to the words of
Christ, Luke 17.10. And it was not known of the ancient Fathers. They spoke
indeed sometimes of supererogation, but in a far other sense then the Papists
do. There are no such works to be found in the person of any mere man or
Angel, but only in the person of Christ, God and man, Perk. 1. vol.
598.599.2. vol. 540.541.


DIALOGVE 8.
C. Show me, I pray you, in particular, what things they teach contrary to the
Commandments.


M. I could plainly prove unto you, that they do both teach and practice many
things contrary to every one of the Commandments: but I will only set down
the chiefest, and such as most men know to be true.

The first, Commandment concerns the inward worship of God: the ground of
which worship is the true knowledge of God; and without which none can truly
worship and serve him: for such as our knowledge is, such is our worship. 1.
Chron. 28.9. Psalm. 9.10. Ier. 9.24. The Papists teach, that ignorance is the
mother of devotion: but the truth is, it is the mother of superstition and
idolatry, Gal. 4.8. The Papists therefore being ignorant and without the true
knowledge of God, cannot truly worship him, but must needs be Idolaters,
worshipping they know not what. The first Commandment requires, that we have
the true Iehoua for our only God. They make Christ's body to be God, because
they hold that it may be in many places at once, which thing is proper only to
God. They make the Pope to be God, and that in plain words. Christopher
Marcellus said to the Pope, Thou art another God upon earth, and the Pope took
it to himself, Council Later. Sess. 4.

They give the power to the Pope, which is proper to God, and so make him to be
God. As that he can make holy, that which is unholy, pardon sins, etc. Perk.
1. vol. 400.1. and they give divine worship to creatures, and so make them
their Gods. The second Commandment concerns the outward worship of God, or
the form and manner of his worship. This Commandment they have clean put out
of the Decalogue, and to fill up the number, they divide the last into two. The
scope of this Commandment is, that no image is to be made of God, nor any
worship performed to him in an image, Deuteronomy. 4.15, 16. But they teach it lawful
to make images of the true God, and to worship him in them, and that there is a
religious worship due to them, Bellar. de imag. sanct. lib. 2. cap. 21. And in
the second Nicen Council it was decreed, that the Image of God should be
worshipped with the same worship that is due unto God. Their practice is
answerable to their doctrine: for they worship the Images of God, of Christ,
the Saints, the wooden Cross, yea a piece of bread.


C. They say, that they do not worship the images, but God, Christ, and the
Saints in the image.


M. Suppose that this were true, yet in so doing, they commit gross idolatry,
and the same that the people of Israel did, for which God plagued them greatly,
Exodus 32.5, 28. I think there is none so very a Calfe, as to think that they
did worship the Calfe it self. The Calfe was but a representation of God; and
yet they sinned greatly in making it, and worshipping God in it. The Heathen in
times past could say as much for themselves, concerning their worshipping of
Images, as the Papists now do: and yet as they were Idolaters, so are the
Papists: for as touching their superstition and idolatry, blood cannot be more
like to blood, or an egg to an egg, then one of them is to another. The
Heathen had for every nation and province, some peculiar god. Among them, the
Elements had their several gods to rule over them. The Heathen had a certain
god assigned to their cattle. The Heathen had peculiar gods for learning and
learned men, and for handi-crafts men. And all these have the Papists likewise.
The Heathen erected Altars, ordained Priests to offer sacrifices, fell down
before their idols, etc. So the Papists deck and adorn their images, go on
Pilgrimage to them, fall down upon their knees before them, and make their
prayers unto them. And what is all this, but to worship the very images
themselves, the which is most gross idolatry? Musculus on Psalm. 16. v. 4.
page. 139.140. Virels grounds, page 87. to 92. Attersoll on Philemon, page
63.64.


C. They say, that there be degrees of religious worship, the highest is
latria, and this is due unto God, the lowest is Dulia, proper to Saints, etc.
Bellarm. de imag. Sanct. lib. 2. cap. 25. The Scripture acknowledges one only
kind of religious worship, and that due only to God, Math. 4.10. Revel. 22.9.
And this distinction of theirs was not known and received into the Church,
till 400. years after Christ, Perk. 1. vol. page 696.2. vol. 530.


C. Was not the making and worshipping of Images approved of by the ancient
Fathers?


M. There was no use of Images among Christians, specially in their Churches,
for 379. years after Christ. Adoration of Images was never publicly
authorized till 788. years after Christ in the second Council of Nice, Perk.
1. vol. page 696.2. vol. 421.

If you be disposed to see more at large when images first came up, how they
were forbidden and condemned by Fathers, Emperors and Councels, and how all
that the Papists can say for them, is answered: then read the book of Homilies
against peril of idolatry: for I know none that has written more soundly,
fully, and plainly thereof.


C. Do they teach and practice any thing else against the second Commandment?


M. Yes, To the right worshipping of God, there is required a reverend use of
the means of Gods worship and service, the which are sincere prayer,
preaching, hearing of Gods Word, and the use of she Sacraments. Concerning
prayer, if must be made wish understanding, 1. Cor. 14. v. 15. Contrary
heereunto is their praying in an unknown tongue. In the purest Churches for
the space of 800 years at the least, divine prayer was never performed in a
tongue unknown to the people, Perk. 2. vol. 557. Concerning the Sacraments,
they do not rightly administer and receive them, but have added and taken from
them at their pleasure.

The helps and furtherances of Gods worship are specially two; howes and
fasting. The Papists make these to be parts of Gods worship: yea they make
fasting to be a work of satisfaction to Gods justice, for the temporal
punishment of sin, and a meritorious work, Rhem. on 1. Cor. 15. Sect. 7.
Perk. 1. vol. 596. Synopsis Papismi. The sixth general Controversy, quaest.
3.4. The 19. general Controversy, quaest. 8. In a word, all their carnal
ceremonies, devised by men, and wherein they place the worship of God, are
contrary to the second Commandment. The most of which ceremonies they have
borrowed, partly from the Jews, partly, from the Gentiles. Willet on Jude, page
215.216.


DIALOGVE 9.
C. Do they teach and practice any thing contrary to the Commandments
following?


M. Yes, The third Commandment concerns the glorifying of GODs name in the
whole course of our life. They teach men to give the glory which is proper to
God, to creatures, as to the Virgin Mary, the Pope, etc. They teach it lawful
to swear by Saints, and not by God only. They maintain perjury, because
they teach with one consent, that one being examined, may answer doubtfully
against the direct intention of the Examiner, framing another meaning to
himself in the doubtfulnes of his words. As for example, A man is asked
whether he were not such a day at the Mass, in such a place? They affirm that
he may say no, and swear unto it (although he were at it) reserving this to
himself; not with purpose to reveal it to the Examiner: whereas (in the very
Law of nature) he that takes an oath, should swear according to the intention
of him that has power to administer an oath: and that in truth, judgment and
righteousness, Jeremy 4.2. Thy are also egregious blasphemers of Gods name. They
have uttered most horrible blasphemies concerning the Scriptures. See Doctor
Willets four pillars of Papistry, page 49. to 61. The fifth Commandment
requires subjection and obedience to superiors, and namely, to Kings and
Princes, who are supreme and next under Christ, Romans 13.1, 2. 1. Pet. 2.13.
They teach that the Pope is supreme head, over all persons, etc. that he owes
no subjection to Kings and Princes, but has power to make them, and to put
them down at his pleasure. The Pope and his Clergy will not be in subjection
to them, but rather exercise Lord-ship over them. The Popes supremacy was
unheard of and unknown, till the year of Christ 600. It was first brochedby
the murdering Emperor Phocas, at the ambitious desire of the proud Pope
Boniface the Third, about the year 607. And since that time, the Popes have
showed their intolerable pride, in their behavior toward Princes. The Pope in
his writings calls himself, Seruus sernorum Dei, The servant of Gods
servants: but in his actions he will be Dominus dominorum, the Lord of Lords:
wherein he plainly shows himself to be that man of sin and Antichrist,
which exalts himself above all that is called God, 2. These. 2.4. This may
be showed by many examples.

Alexander the Third did tread upon the neck of the Emperor Frederick the
First, blasphemously abusing the words of the Psalm, Thou shall tread upon the
Lion and Adder, etc. Acts and Monuments, page 185. Pope Celestine frowned Henry
the Fifth with his foot, and with his foot spurned it off again, ibid. 221.
The Papists also teach and maintain disobedience to parents: for, they teach
that it is lawful for the child, being a Roman Catholic, to deny his duty
to his parents being Heretics. And as the Scribes and Pharisees taught, that
if the children did bring to their Corban* (that is, their Treasury) though
they neglected their parents, yet they were free: so they teach children to
give that they have to Monasteries, etc. wherewith they should relieve their
parents, Bucanus Common places, page 901.


DIALOGVE 10.
C. Do they teach and practice any thing contrary to the sixth Commandment?.


M. Yes, The sixth Commandment forbids us to kill, or hurt any man. They
teach it lawful for subjects not only to rise up against, but even to kill
their Princes the Lords Anointed (if they be excommunicated by the Pope) and
that it is a meritorious work so to do. This with other such like devilish
doctrines, and the Authors thereof, are to be seen more at large in Bucanus
Common places, concerning Magistrates: and in Master Taylour on Psalm 32. page
208. 209.


C. Can you name any that have put it in practice?


M. Yes, Pope Gregory the Seventh, called Hildebrand, hired one to kill the
Emperor. A Monk poisoned King John. Henry the Third, King of France, was
slain by a Friar. Yea Pope Sixtus Quintus highly commended the Friar for
doing of it. Henry the fourth of France was also slain by a Papist. Many of
them, (yea of their Priests and Jesuits) have attempted to kill our late
Queen Elizabeth, and our King James, with all his royal issue, and that after
a most barbarous manner. These Popish Traitors may very fitly be compared to
that base and unnatural bird the Cuckoo: who though he be hatched, fed and
brought up by a little bird, yet he deuoureth both the natural young ones, and
also the damme her self.


C. Are there none that teach and practice the killing of Princes but Papists?


M. This doctrine was never maintained by any Heretics (besides the Papists)
as our most Christian and learned King has showed in a speech of his, uttered
in the Parliament house, in the year 1605. by occasion of the Gunpowder
Treason: And herein you may see how contrary they are both to the doctrine and
practice of the Prophets, Christ, and his Apostles, who both taught and
practiced subjection, even to wicked and idolatrous Princes, and did never so
much as attempt to hurt them. As for example: Saul was a wicked King, for saken
of God, and one that did most cruelly persecute David, who was anointed to be
King after him. At two several times the Lord delivered Saul into his hands,
so that he might (without any resistance) have killed him: yea, Abishai
desired that he might strike him but once with his spear. But what said
David? Touch him not, for who can lay his hand on the Lords anointed, and be
guiltles? Nay, his heart smote him for cutting off the skirt of Saul's Robe, 1.
Sam. 24.4, 5, 6. etc. chap. 26.8.9, etc. And afterward, when one brought
tidings to David that he had slain Saul, what did David? Did he commend him
for it, as the Pope did the Friar? No, he caused him to be slain for his
labor, 2. Sam. 1.14, 15, 16. Now what think you of David?


C. He was a man after Gods own heart, endued with the Spirit of God.


M. It is most true: and therefore the Papists (which both teach and practice
the contrary) are endued with the spirit of Satan. S. Paul says, that to
forbid marriage and meats, is a doctrine of devils, 1. Tim. 4.1.3. If that be
a doctrine of devils, then much more is this. In the sixth Commandment is also
condemned all cruelty: yet herein they exceed and excel all others. And
this is a special note of a false religion; and yet this is one special
means whereby Popery is vpheld. See Tailor on Psalm 32. page. 204. to 208.
Solomon describes an harlot by three properties; cruelty, treachery, and
flattery, Pro. 2.16, 17, 18. As a dishonest and unchaste woman is thus
discerned, so is a corrupt religion. And these are the very badges and ensigns
of the whore of Babylon: Where they get the sword, they show all cruelty: where
their power fails, they work by treachery: where this speedeth not, they will
deceive by flattery and hypocrifie. See the Preface to Doctor Willets Treatise
on the Epistle of S. Jude, page 2, 3, etc.


DIALOGVE 11.
C. What do they teach and practice contrary to the seventh Commandment?


M. They hold and teach, that marriage is unlawful in the Clergy: and that
the marriage of Ministers is the worst sort of incontinencie and fornication,
Rhem. on 1. Cor. 7.9. Sect. 8. whereas marriage is the remedy against
fornication, 1. Cor. 7.2. They allow their Priests to keep harlots, (rather
then to marry) so they do it closely: for this caveat is given them: Si non
cast tamencaute. If thou can not live chastely, thou may keep a whore
warily. And what uncleanness and filthiness has bin committed by many Popes, and
Popish Priests, all the world knows. A taste hereof I will give you in a few
examples.

Pope John the 13. was an adulterer, and an incestuous person. Being found
without the city with another man's wife, he was so wounded of of her husband,
that within eight days after he died, Acts and Monuments, page 143. Pope
Sixtus the Fourtherected at Rome a Stews of double abomination, not only of
women, but also of men, ibid. 6. page 667. Alexander the Sixth committed incest
with his own daughter Lucretia, Guicciardine lib. 3. Innocentius the Eightth
had diverse bastards, and boasted of them. See Willet on Jude, page 188. They
had one Pope that did beget no child, but was begotten with child, and brought
it forth in going on procession: and that was Pope John the Eightth, who proved
to be Ioane, and not John. This they deny, but there was of late years
written a book by Master Alexander Cook: and another written in Latin by a
stranger, wherein they prove (and that out of Popish writers) that there was
such a one. For they sufficiently prove themselves to be men indeed, in
begetting bastards. It is an old saying, It must needs be a holy Procession,
where the devil bears the Cross: so it must needs bean holy, chaste and pure
Church, that has such unholy, impure, unchaste, and filthy, heads, as many
Popes have bin. And as were the heads, such was the rest of the body. Their
monasteries and monkish cells were detected of most infamous incests,
fornications, etc. as does appear in the inquisition made in the time of King
Henry the Eightth, Praefat. Balaei. de actis Roman. Pontif. See a little book
(lately set forth) called the Friars Chronicle. Contrary to the Eightth
Commandment are the Popes Bulls, Indulgences and pardons for sin: and all for
money. They sell such things as are not to be sold, namely, remission of
sins, and the merits by which men may come to the kingdom of heaven. But no
penie, no Pater noster, Synopsis Papismi. Controversy 14. part 3. Popes Bulls
and Indulgences (wherein is given absolution from the guilt of temporal
punishment) were not known to the Catholic Church, for 1000 years and more
after Christ, Perk. 2. vol. 589. And herein they maintain licenciousnes: for
what need one care what sin he commits, when for a little money he may
have, a pardon for it?

One Roger Holland (sometime a Papist) says thus, I was of this your blind
religion; having liberty under your auricular confession, I made no conscience
of sin, but frusted to the Priests absolution; he also for money, doing some
penance for me: which after I had given, I cared no further what offenses I
did: no more then he cared, after he had my money, whether he fasted with bread
or water for me or no, Acts and Monuments, page 2040.

C. Show me also, I pray you, what they reach and practice contrary to the two
last Commandments.


M. The ninth Commandment condemns all lying, and dissimulation, railing,
mocking, etc. They maintain equivocation, which (as the Secular Priests have
said) (Quodlibet 2. Art. 4. page 6.) you may term in plain English, lying,
and cogging. They are not orious liars, and slanderers, railers and workers,
Willet on Jude page 195 and 205. 212. They have falsified men's writings,
putting in, and putting out what they, please, as is to be seen in their
Index expurgatorius. See Perk. 2. vol. page 489, etc.

There have bin in times past games appointed for lying. If there were any such
now, the Papists would carry the whet stone from all the heretics in
Christendom. The tenth Commandment condemns original corruption, and the
very evil thoughts and lusts of the heart without consent.

They teach* that concupiscence in it self is not sin. These are the very
words of the Concell of Trent: This concupiscence (which the Apostle sometime
calls sin) the holy Synod declares, that the Catholic Church did never
understand to be called sin, because it is truly and properly sin in the
regenerate, but because it comes of sin, and inclines unto sin. If any
man think the contrary, let him be accursed, Sess 5. cap. 1. de pecc. orig.
Wherein they both decree against the Apostle himself, Romans 7.23. and also they
gainsay themselves: for if this concupiscence boil out of original sin, as
out of a fountain, and that is damnable: it follows, that conrupisence or
lust is also sin before God, and does deserve condemnation. They say that in
the regenerate it is venial. But this is an undoubted principle, that all
sins in themselves and their own nature are mortal. And concerning this
venial sin, it was not known among the Fathers for 700 years after Christ.
And thus you see, what gross things they both teach and practice contrary to
the Commandments of God: whereby it plainly appears, that Popery cannot be
of God: for thus I reason: Whatsoever religion does teach things contrary to
the Commandments of God, is not of God: but Popery does so, and therefore it
is not of God: and so by good consequence Papists cannot be good Catholics.


DIALOGVE 13.
C. Hitherto you have showed, that the Papists teach many things contrary to
the Creed, the Sacraments, and the ten Commandments: now tell me, I pray you,
whether they teach any thing contrary to the Lords prayer.


M. They do likewise teach and practice many things contrary thereunto, I will
but only name some of them. The Lords prayer teaches us to call upon God
only. They teach and practice prayer to Saints. In the first petition we pray
for the hallowing of Gods name. They give unto Saints departed, that which is
proper to God, and so dishonor Gods name. In the second position we pray for
the erecting of Gods Kingdom of grace in our hearts, and also for the means
thereof, namely, the preaching and hearing of Gods Word They hinder the coming
of Gods kingdom, in rejecting the Word of God, and in persecuting such as will
preach here and read it. Contrary to the third petition is their doctrine of
free will. Contrary to the fifth petition, is their doctrine of satisfaction for
sin. In the sixth petition, we pray for strength to withstand Satan and his
temptations. They teach people to drive away the devil with holy water, and
such like childish toys. These and other such like things they teach and
practice contrary to the Lords prayer.


DIALOGVE 14.
C. If Popery be so contrary to the grounds of Religion, then we may not join
with the Papists in their profession.


M. It is true indeed: we must therefore do as the Lord bade Jeremy (chap.
15.19.) Let them return to thee, but return not thou to them We may join
with them in respect of civil society, but not in respect of Religion: and
yet even then we are to take heed, lest we be corrupted by them: for he
that teaches pitch, shall be defiled therewith. Some think that our Religion,
and the religion of the present Church of Rome, are all one for substance, and
that they may be united: but they are grossly deceived: for a union of these
two religions can never be made, more then the union of light and darkness, and
that because the Church of Rome (as has at large bin showed) has struck at
the very foundation.


C. If Popery be so contrary to the very grounds of Religion, then what is the
cause that so many (yea, even of the more wise and learned sort) do embrace and
cleave to it?


M. One special cause of it is, that because men will not receive the love of
the truth, therefore God shall send them strong delusion, that they should
believe a lie, 2. These. 2.10, 11.

A second cause is ignorance of the Scriptures, and of the grounds of Religion,
for if men would well acquaint themselves heerewith, they should easily fee the
grossenes of Popery.

A third cause is, that Popery is very agreeable and pleasing to man's corrupt
nature: As for example: to be justified by our good works: to have Images to
worship God in: to live in ignorance: to have pardons for our sins: to serve
God in outward ceremonies, as in choice of meat, difference of days, etc.
these are things very agreeable and pleasing to our corrupt nature, and
therefore one special cause why so many embrace Popery.

A fourth cause is, the tyranny. of the Church of Rome, whose chief means to
uphold her religion, is fire and sword: for were it not for this, many
thousands in a few years would utterly renounce Popery.

A fifth cause why so many (specially of the Learned) do embrace it is pomp and
profit: that is, ambition and covetousness.

This was that which made the Scribes and Pharisees (even against their own
knowledge) to withstand Christ and his Gospel.

And this makes many learned Papists to do ye like. They know (no doubt) that
in some things they err: as it does appear by the words of Stephen Gardener
on his death bead.

The Bishop of Chichester seeing him to be in a desperate case, comfort him
with the hope of remission of sins by the merits of Christ. Gardener
heereunto answers thus: What, will you open that gape now? you may speak it
to me, and to such as are in my case: but if you teach it to the people, then
farewell all; meaning, our authority, pomp, and profit by absolutions, Masses,
etc. These are the special causes why so many embrace Popery.


C. There is one thing more that I would gladly know concerning the Papists,
and that is, whether a Papist may be saved, seeing that Popery is so contrary
to the grounds of Religion.


M. You are then to mark what a Papist is. A Papist (as the Rhemists on Acts
11. Sect 4. do describe him) is one that cleaves to the Pope in Religion, and
is obedient to him in all things.

Every one now that is under the jurisdiction of the Pope, is not to be counted
a Papist: for their are some even in Italy, Spain, etc. that hold the Grounds
of Religion, do sigh and groan under the Romish yoke, and desire to be freed
from it, yea would rejoice to see it.

Again, there may be some, that (for want of knowledge, and the means
thereof) are entangled with some points of Popery, but yet they hold the
foundation, which is CHRIST JESUS, and look to be saved by his merits, and not
by their own or any others. Such we account not Papists, our the true Church
and children of God. But by Papists, we mean such as cleave fast to the Pope
in religion, are in all things obedient to him, will not be reclaimed from
their errors, refuse to hear the Word of God, to read the Scriptures, or any
other good books. 'Of such we may boldly say, that if they thus continue to
the end, they cannot be saved.


DIALOGVE 15.
C. I do now plainly see, that Papists are no good Catholics, because they
are neither of sound faith, nor good life: but tell me (I pray you) who indeed
are the true Church and true Catholics?


M. All that do truly and sincerely embrace, profess, and practice the
aforesaid grounds of Religion, in what Country soever they live.


C. Is the Church of England the true Church?


M. Yes, for it has the special marks of the true Church: namely, the Word
of God sincerely and soundly preached, and the Sacraments rightly administered.


C. The Papists say, that there are diversities of opinions amongst us, that we
cannot agree among our selves, and that therefore we are not the true Church.


M. In all substantial points of Religion we agree both amongst our selves,
and also with all other sound Protestants in Christendom. In other things
there have bin, are, and will be diversities of opinions and differences to
the worlds end. They should first pluck out the beam of their own eyes: for
we can truly charge them with greater differences: As namely, with that sharp
and bloody contention between the Franciscans and Dominicans; and with the
late bitter contention between the Jesuits, and the secular Priests: wherein
the Priests did write as bitterly against the Jesuits (and namely, against
Parsons) as ever did any Protestant: nay there was never any Protestant Writer
that did lay such foul and odious crimes to their charge, as the Priests did.
And herein they verified the old proverb, When thieves fall by the ears, true
men come to have their goods. For one dissension that is among us, they have
(at least) ten among themselves. Doctor Willet (in his fourth Pillar of
Papistry) has set down at large,

First, the contradictions and diverse opinions of old Papists and new.

Secondly, the contradictions of the Jesuits among themselves.

Thirdly, that their stoutest Champion, Bellarmine, is at variance with
himself, shamefully forgetting himself, saying and unsaying: now of one
opinion, by and by of another. And no marvel, Oportet enim mendacem esse
memorem, A liar had need to have a good memory.

Fourthly, he shows the repugnances, inconveniences, and inconsequent
opinions which Popish Religion has in it selse. And thus you see, how they
charge us with that, wherein themselves are most faulty.


DIALOGVE 16.
C. Are there none among us, that maintain any strange and new opinions,
contrary to the grounds of Religion?


M. If there be any such, our Church does not approve of them, but rather
censure and punish them.


C. There be some that profess the former grounds of Religion as we do, and
yet say that there is no true Church among us: and therefore will not join
with us in prayer, hearing the Word, and in the use of the Sacraments, but
separate themselves from us: what say you of such?


M. I say, that they are possessed with the spirit of pride and singularity;
and that in so doing, they do even deny these Articles of faith the Catholic
Church, and the Communion of Saints, and are such as the Apostle speaks of,
Romans 16.17. Heb. 10.25, 39. Master Perkins (in his first volume, page 409.)
calls them a schismatic and indiscreet company, and says, that they are
full of pride, thinking themselves to be full, when they are empty, to have all
knowledge, when they are ignorant, and have need to be catechized. Another
says thus of them: The error of those men is full of evil, yea of
blasphemy, who do in such manner make a departure from this Church, as if
Christ were quitbanished from hence, and that there could be no hope of
salvation to those that abide here. And further he says, that if they cannot
find Christ here, they shall find him no where. The errors of these men you
may see in a little Treatise set forth by Master Bernard, called, The
Separatists Schism.


C. I pray show me by some example, that they ought not to separate themselves
from us, and that they do sin in so doing.


M. In the Church of Corinth, the incestuous man was not punished: fornication
was lightly regarded, yea there were some that even denied the Resurrection,
yet S. Paul does account and call them the Church and Saints: he does not
persuade any to make a separation, but does plainly rebuke them, and shows
how they should punish the evil doer. I speak not this to excuse any gross
sin that reigns amongst us: (for I wish that the same might be severely
punished) but to show, that where the Word is truly preached, and the
Sacraments rightly administered (as in our Church they are) none ought for any
cause to separate themselves: And, that such as do it, do sin grievously, I
will show you by a familiar example. A mother conceiuesh and brings forth a
son, and that with great travail and pain: She traineth him up to man's
estate, and that not without great care and labor: This son at length
espying some spot and blemish, or some infirmity in his mother, forsakes her,
and will not acknowledge her to be his mother, what would you now think of him?


C. Surely I should think such a one to be a very wicked and unnatural
son.


M. Even such are they, who (for some seeming faults in our Church) deny it to
be a true Church, and do separate themselves from it: whereas this Church
has conceived them, brought them forth, and nourished them. For if ever they
were truly begotten unto Christ, and borne anew, it has hin by our Church and
our Ministry, by which likewise they have bin trained up, and brought to that
knowledge which they have.


C. There are many amongst us that make great profession of Religion, but I can
see no good works come from them: nay, they are not only barren in good
works, but also live in some one gross sin or other. Are these the true
Church, and true Catholics?


M. Though they live in the Church, yet they are not of the Church: they are
but Hypocrites, and shall (if they repent not) have the reward of Hypocrites:
yea it shall be easier in the day of judgment for many Papists, then for them;
because by their barren and fruitless, yea wicked life, they have caused the
name of God, his Gospel, and the true professors thereof, to be evil spoken
of. Let all therefore that will be accounted the true Church, and true
Christians, be careful to adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all
things, and that by a godly conversation, and by doing of good works.


C. The name of God be blessed for this our conference, whereby I find my
self much edified. There remains yet one thing more, which I will demand of
you: and that is, how I may come to know and be assured, that I am indeed a
member of the true Church, and that I shall certainly be saved.


M. Be diligent to hear the Word of God preached. Read the Scriptures.
Receive often the Sacrament. Acquaint your self thoroughly with the aforesaid
grounds of Religion. Join heereunto earnest* and hearty prayer. Set apart some
time for these things, specially be careful to spend the Sabbath herein. And
to all these things join an holy conversation, indeuouring above all things to
have always a clear conscience toward God, and toward men. In doing this, you
shall at length come to that full assurance, whereof S. Paul speaks, namely,
that you are the child of God, and that nothing shall be able to separate you
from the love of God, which is in Christ, Romans 8.38.


Babylon is fallen, is fallen, Revelation 14.8. Praise, honor, glory and
power, be unto him that sits upon, the Throne, and unto the Lamb for
