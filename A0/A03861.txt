THE ARGUMENT of this Book.
THus mutch in Sum this present Work
of Moses does declare,
That God the World, and Frame of things
which therein formed are,
Of nothing did create and make:
and how he placed Man,
This Tabernacle to behold,
and wondrous Works to skanne:
Who vewinge these his gracious Gifts,
should praise his holy Name,
And Magnify him Day and Night,
entirely for the same.
But Man forgettinge quight himself,
and God that Rules on hye:
Committed Sin, displeased God,
and stumbled wittinglye.
Who through his Disobedience
enthrald himself in Woe,
And fell from God, from whom to him
so many Gifts did flow.
This notwithstanding, God our Lord
for his great Goodness sake,
Did him to Life restore again,
and unto Mercy take.
And him confirmed in the same,
by Christ the promised Seed:
By whom, he Satan, vanquish should,
Death, Hell, and doleful Dreede.
The wicked sort persistinge still
in their most froward ways,
(Forgettinge Gods great Benefits)
most lewdly spent their Days:
Yea, at the last so horribly
they fell from Sin to Sin,
Contemninge Preachers to them sent,
their Minds from Uice to win,
That God, provoked in his Ire,
(so with his will it stood)
At length did send upon the World
an Uniuersall Flood.
Assurance also here we have,
by proof before our face,
Of Abraham, of Isaac,
of Jacob, and the Race
Of other zealous Patriarchs,
how that his Mercy great
Does never fail them that be his,
and for his Grace entreat.
But lendes to them his helpinge hand,
in all their time of need:
He cheereth them, relieueth them,
and aydeth them with speed.
By Esau, Cain, and Ismaell,
and others of like sort,
Who ruffled here in worldly Pomp,
and bare a stately port,
It well appears, the Church of God
does not depend, ne stay
On worldly Estimation,
nor Shows of Tytles gaye.
And by the Fewness eke of those,
which have from time to time
Him worshipped in Sprite and Truth,
(deuoyd of spotted Crime)
We are to learn, that it does not
consist in Multitude,
But in the poor despised Flock:
and thus does he conclude:
That Man in Wisdom his, might be
confounded evermore,
And that the Name of God alone,
might praised be therefore.

Save that which in the midst does stand,

And so the men departed thence,

At last drew near and said, will thou

Thou may among the wicked sort

45
If I in Sodom City find,
fifty God declares that his judgments were done with great mercy, for so
much as all were so corrupt, that not only fifty, but Ten righteous men could
not be found there, and also that the wicked are spared for the righteous sake
that righteous are,
I will (said God) for fiftye sake,
both men, and City spare.
46
And Abraham, thus answered,
and said (O Lord) behold,
I that but Ashes am and Duste,
to speak yet am so hold.
47
It so may chance there shall lack ^iue,
of fifty righteous men
Will thou the City, and the rest
destroy, for want of them?
48
God said again, if I may find
but forty there and five,
I will the City save from harm,
and all therein alive.
49.
Said Abraham, the City (Lord)
may Forty righteous make:
God said, I will it not destroy
for Forty righteous sake.
50.
O let my Lord, not angry be,
that I replye again:
There may be Thirty found therein,
that righteous do remain.
He said, if I but Thirty find,
I will do no man pain.
51.
O see, said he, I have presum'de
my God to speak to, here:
There may be Twenty yet therein,
that righteous may appear:
Said God, then for those Twenties sake,
the City shall be clear.
52.
O Lord with me not angry be,
but let thine anger cease:
I will this once, If God refused not the prayer for the wicked Sodomites even

and after hold my peace:

Perchance, there yet may Ten be there*

Then Lot went out, and thus wise spoke
unto his Sons in law:

The Sons in Law took all for Jest

And so as though he seem'de to mock,
they let him go his way.
24.
But when the Morninge did arise,
these Angels Lot did call:
And caused him to haste away,
for fear least he might fall:
25.

and Daughters twain thee by,

And as Lot did the time prolonge,
the Men of God, (lo) caught

And set them safe the City out,
and thus to them did say:

And upon Lot God mindful was,

And him deliu'red from the mids

And Lot from Zoar did depart,
he feared there to dwell.
And in the Mountains chose a place,

And in those Days Lottes daughters saw

And none but Lot their father left,

And all his servants did command,

14
And in their ears declared that

The hearing of the which in deed

15
Likewise for Abraham he called

And what have I offended thee?
that thou have thus begone?

18
And therefore having such a wife,
as fair is to the eye,
Lest for her sake I perish should,
and so too tymely dye:
19
I said she was and so she is
my Sister as you see

And after from my Fathers house,

And me confess a Brother thine,

To wander thus about with me,

23
Abimelech the king then took
of Sheep, and Oxen store,
Of men servants and Women too,
and brought them him before.
24
And gave them unto Abraham,
for ever to remain,
And with the same delivered
Sara his wife again.
25
And said, behold before thy face,

But unto Sarah said the king

reproved so was she.
28
So Abraham to God did pray,
and God his voice did hear:
The King made whole: his Wife, and Maids,
did Children after bear.
39
For God thus plagued had the house
of Bimelech the King,
The Matrix of them all were stopped,

Till Abraham his Wife received,
thus happened the thing.

And Abraham gave to the King

And seven Ewe Lamdes did Abraham

Then Abraham rose early up,
in morn before the Sun,
His Ass he sadled and preparde

6
He took two young men of his own
and Isahack likewise
And wood did cleave, and ready make
to burn with Sacrifyce.
7.
Then Abraham with his young men
and Isahack also
Rose up and got them to the place
whereto God had him go,
8.
The third day Abraham lift up
his eyes and saw the place
Far of: and said to his young men
stay here with th'Asse a space:
9
I and the Lad will yonder go,
and worship as we ought,
And after come He doubted not but God would accomplish his promise, though
he should sacrifyce his son

so took they wood they brought,
10.
And laid the same upon the back
of Isahack to bear,
But he a Knyfe took in his hand,
and fire that was there.
11.
Together went they up the Mount,
and passing on the way
Then Isahack to Abraham
his Father thus began say
My father dear, who answered
thy Father's here my son,
Said Isahac here lackes as yet

13.
I see (said he) here is wood enough
and fire it to burn,
But where is the Sheep for Sacrifice

for Sacrifyce

And so together louinglye
upon the Mount they went.
15.
And when they came unto the place
which God had showed him
There Abraham an Alter made,
and wood he dressed trym.
16.
And took his sweet son Isahac
and bound him as he stood,
And laid him there the Alter on
aloft upon the wood.
17.
And as he stretched forth his hand,
therein he took the knyfe,
Myndyng therewith to kill his son,
and reaue him of his life:
18.
But then the Angel of the Lord
thus spoke from heaven hye:
O Abraham O Abraham:
he said, Lord here am I.
19.
Lay not thy hand, said th'Angell than
upon thy Child to kyl
Ne any other thing attempt,
whereby to do him ill.
20.
For now I That is, by ^trevve obedience thou have declared thy liuelye faith
know thou fear God,
by this that thou have done,
And have not spared for my sake
thy dear and only Son.
21.
And Abraham his Eyes lift up,
and lookte on every side,
And (lo) a Ram by horns was caught,
In bushie Thicket tide
22,
His Child he took and did vnbynd,
and from the Alter set:
And went unto the Thicket there,
from whence the Ram he fette.
23.
And offered for a Sacrifyce
the Ram that he so caught
In steed of his son Isahacke
whom he for offringe brought.
24.
And Abraham did call the place
Almighty God will see*
As it is said unto this day,
In Mount God seen will be.
25.
The Angel calde the second time
from Heaven to Abraham,
And said, I have my Signifyinge that there is no greater the^ he

So Abraham then turned back

Then down she went unto the Well,
and did her Pitcher fill,
Came up again, and homeward went,
she thought not to stand still.

The Servant then unto her ran,
and thus to her did say:

And hasted down upon her Arm,

My Master now is grown in Years
and therefore made me swear
Because I chief am in his House,
and all the rule do bear:
56
Thou shall not take for Isaac

58.
Said I unto my Master tho,
what if it happen so
The Wife that I would have for him,
refuse with me to go?
59
Said he, the Lord before whose face
I stand and walk in sight,
Will send his Angel in the Way
and guide thy course aright:
60
And prosper shall thy journey so
as thou a Wife shall have
For my sweet Son, of Kindred mine,
according as I crave.
61
So when thou come my Kindred to,
from curse then art thou free:
If they deny a Wife to give
eke Gyltlesse shall thou be.
62
And so this day unto the Well
I came, and there I stayde,
And in my heart, O Mighty God
of Abraham, I said,
63
If it be so, this Journey mine
thou prosperous wilt make:
Behold I stand the Well hard by:
where Maids will Water take,
64.
And when a Uirgin shall forth come,
and draw of Water clear
And then I say, Damsel I pray,
give me of Water here,
65
Out of thy Pitcher for to drink:
and she then say to me,
Drink thou, and I will also draw
For Camels these with thee.
66
That same is she, that shall be Wife
unto my masters Soune,
And whom thou God appointed have
before this thing begone.
97.
And yet ere I ar^end had made
of speaking in mine signifyinge that this prayer was not spoken by the mouth
but only meditated in his heart.
Heart:
Behold Rebecca then came forth
of Water to have part,
68
And on her Shoulder as she came
a Pitcher did she bear,
So went she down into the Well
and drawed water there.
69
Said I, I pray thee, give me Drink
thou honest gentle maid:
With have she took her Pitcher down
and bade me Drink: and said,
70
When thou have Drunk, I will go down
and Water draw also
And give thy Camels for to drink
before that I do go.
71
I drank, and she more Water drew,
and to my Camels brought
Then for to know whose child she was
I gently her besought.
72
My Fathers name is Bethuell
and Nahors Son: said she,
Whom Milcha brought forth unto him,
and Grandsire is to me.
73
I put the Earinge on her face
and Bracelets on her hand

in place where I did stand:
74
And blessed God of Abraham,
which had me thither brought,
To take my masters Brothers child
unto his Son unsought.
75
Now also if that thou will deal
truly with Master mine,
And that his Son may have to Wife
Rebecca Daughter thine,
76
Tell me: if not, that I may turn
the left Hand for to go:
Or if I shall: the right hand take:
my Master this to show.
77
Said Laban then and Bethuel,
this saying does proceed.
Even from the Lord of Heaven and Earth,
by whom it was decreed
78
We therefore can of good ne bad
say any thing to thee:
But as it pleases God to do,
his will fulfilled be.
80
Behold Rebecca is in sight,
take her and go thy way:
That she may Wife That is unto thy masters Son
be unto him
as God has said this day.
81
And when the Servant heard these words
he flat fell on the ground,
And worshipped God from whom al grace
and Mercy does abound.
82
And in a while the Servant rose
and from his Carriage fet
Rych Jewels Coucht in Silver fine,
in Gold eke likewise set:
83
And to Rebecca did them give
with Raiment rich in show,
To Laban and to mother hers,
rich gifts he gave also.
84
So sat they down to Eat and Drink,
both he, and they likewise
With him that came: the Night ore past
in Morning did arise
85.
And when the servant ready was:
let me depart (said he)

unto the Man thus spoke:
I pray thee, let the Damsel bide

87.
And if it be, but Ten Days space:
with thee then shall she go:
Said he, I pray thee hinder not
me in my Journey so:
88
Behold the Lord has prosperd well
my Journey in each thing,
Send me away to Master mine,
this happy news to bring.

We will (said they) the Damsel call

Whether or no to go or bide
she rather does desire.
90
And they Rebecca called forth
and said, will thou or no
Go with this Man? I will (said she)
and ready am to go.
91
So then they let Rebecca pass,
her nurse, and Abrams man.
And eke those Men that then were there
and with him thither came.
92.
And then Rebecca blessed they,
and thus to her did say,
Now into thousand thousands grow,
and God thee guyd always.
And that thy Seed That is let it be victorious over his enemy: which

93.
This done, forthwith Rebecca rose

Upon the Camells were they set,
and with this man did go.
94
And so the Servant took the charge
Rebecca safe to carry,
They took their leave, away they went,
and would no longer tarry.

Now from the way of Hagars Well,

And for to show their spite and Ire,
such rage was in their brain,
They went and filled all the Wells,

IT came to pass when Isaac

And that his Eyes were dim and dusk,

His eldest Son that Esau was,
he called and thus did say:

That thou for me may Uenson take

Rebecca heard, when Isaac
unto his son thus spoke:
And Esau went unto the field

6.
But she unto her younger son

Declared all what she had heard

And to the end the better she

She brought the garments gay to see

He'knew him not because his hands

Art thou Esaw my son? Said he
I am, and so confess.
Bring me thy venson onne to eat,
that thee my soul may bless,
26
And so he brough^e ^im meat and wine:
he eat and drank apace,
Com near my Son (said Isaac)
and kiss me on the face.
27
So he unto his father went,
and when he had him kissed,
He smelt the sauer of his Clothes,
and saying thus: him blut:
28
Behold the smell of my sweet Son

Which God has blessed with much increase

31
Also thy Mothers Children shall

And cursed be he, that curses thee:

And Isahac no sooner had,

And that young Jacob scarce was gone

33
But in from hunting Esau came,
and meat did ready make:
And to his father brought the same,
that he thereof might take:
34
And said, now ^ee my father rise,
and eat of Uenson mine,
Which am thy Son, and that thy Soul
may bless me, who am thine.
35
Said Isahack, why, who art thou?
I am (then answered he)

Then Isaac In perceiving his error, by appointing his heyr against gods

Of which I have before thou came

38
When Esau heard these words proceed
from Father in such sort,
He wept and cried exceedinglye
more then I can report.
39
And in the bitterness of Heart
unto his father spoke
And him besought, that blessing his

40
Said Isaac, ere thou came in
but even a little while,
Thy Brother has thy blessing ta^e
with subtlety and guyle.
41
He In the 25 Chap* he was so called because he held his brother by the heel:
as though he would overthrow him, and therefore is he here called an

For twyse he undermined me

42
First he my Byrthright took away

But father is no blessing left

My Son behold (said Isaac)

Besides, I have with Corn and Wine,

What can I do for thee my Son,

45
Ah Father mine (said Esau then)
is al thy blessing gone?
Or else of blessing had thou not
no more but this same one?
46
Bless me also, good Father mine,
most humbly do I pray,
And there withal did Esau weep
his Father then did say:

The hatred then was great that grew

Sauen Years does Jacob Laban serve
For Rachel, Labans Child.
Unto his bed is Leah brought,
And Jacob is beguilde,
He marieth both, and serves yet
seven years for Rachell more,
And Leah does Conceive, and bear
and prayseth God therefore.
THen Jacob lyfted up his Feet,
to pace his journey out,
And came to Country of the East,
and as he looked about:
2
Behold, in field there was At that Well vv^e he Flocks of Sheep watered
together.
a Well
and Flocks of Sheep hard by,
And on the mouth of that same Well,
a mighty Stone did lie.
3
So thither were the Flocks al brought,
that they might water take,
And then the Stone was rold away,
more room for Sheep to make:
4
And when the Sheep had drunk their fill
they put the Stone again
Upon the Well, til watring time
the Mouth did close remain.
5
Said Jacob then, unto those men,
my It appears that by these days their custom was to call even strangers
Brethren.
Brethren whence are y^e?
Of Haran Sir, (said they) we are:
and Shepeheardes as you see.
6
And know you Laban then said he)

We know him very well said they:
a virtuous man is he.
7
And is he in good Or peace, by the which word the Ebrues signify all

health or not?
I pray you do me tell.
In health (said they) and see where comes
his Daughter young Rahell.
Driving the Flock of Fathers Sheep
to bring unto this Well.
8
It is but early day (said he)
too sone have you brought hither:
It is not time the Cattle should
be gathred yet together,
9
But insomuch as ye be here
and by the Well remain,
Water the sheep and so depart
that they may feed again.
10
We may not so, our custom is
to gather all in one:
Then from the mouth of this same Well
we roll away the Stone.
And so we water all our sheep
and back again are gone.
11
While he yet talked with those men
young Rahel came apace
With Fathers sheep, for she them kept:
and when she was in place,
12
No sooner had young Jacob seen,
this Rahel in the face:
But from the Well he rold the Stone
and so in little space
13
He watered the Flock of Sheep,
that Rahel thither brought:
Which Flock of Sheep Laban (in deed)
his mothers Brother ought.
14
And Jacob there did Rahel kiss
and lifted up his voice,
And wept and shed such tears of joy,
as men that much rejoice.
15
He told her then, how that he was
her fathers brothers Son
She ran and told her father all,
what was both said and done.
16
UUhen Laban heard of Jacob there
his Sisters Son to be,
He ran to meet, and him embrast,
and welcome (said) to me.
17
And when he had him frendlye kissed,
home to his house him brought,
And Jacob there to Tha^ is, the cause why he departed from his fathers house,

Laban told
the matter all in thought

and eke my Flesh also.
And heee abode a Month with him
about his work to go.
19
Though thou (said he) my Brother be

Tell me what shall thy wages be
and I will geeue it thee.

This Laban now two daughters had,
and Lea This Lea was tender eyed, or blere eyed.
was the one,
And Rahel she, the youngst of twain
was fayr'st to look upon.
21
And Jacob Rahel loved well:
and therefore said in fine:
Seven years I will thy servant be
for Rahell daughter thine.
22
Much better it is said Laban tho
my daughter thine to be
Then his unknown a stranger borne,
and from my kindred free.
I am content it shall be so
abide here still with me.
23
For Rahel, Jacob thus became
to Laban bound as tho,
Those years with him few days did seem
his love increased so.
24
And when seven years expired were:
geeue me my wife, said he,
That I may know her as I ought,
for now I am set free.
25
Then Laban Father to the Maid
together straight did call
The Men and Brethren of that place
and so did feast them all.
26.
When The cause why Jacob was deceived was that in the old time, the wife
was covered with a Veil, when she was brought to her husband, in sign of
Chastity, and ^hamefastnesse.
Night was come, he Leah took
and unto Jacob brought,
And Jacob went as Custom was
to Rahel (as he thought)
27
But when the Morning did appear
the matter for to try,
Behold Leah, not Rahel it was
with Jacob that did lie.
28
Wherefore? (said Jacob) have thou played
this subtle part with me,
Did I not serve for Rahel thine
this seven years past with thee?
Wherefore have thou thus me beguilde
as al these People see?
29
To whom thus Laban answered:
the He esteemed more the profit that he had of Jacobs service, then either
his promise or the manner of the country, though he alleged custom for his
excuse.
manner of this place
Is not the youngest to prefer
before the eldest face.
30
Pass out this week, then shall this Maid
be geeuen to thee also,
And for the same thou shall me geeue,
seven years of service more.
31
So Jacob did, and passed out
the week as was the guise,
Then Laban Rahel gave to him
to be his wife likewise.
32
So Jacob now, two wives posses^
but Rahel loved he,
For whom he served Fourtene years,
and after was set free.

But Rahell, whom he lived best,
did barren yet become.
And Lea she conceived straight
and brought him forth a son. The birth of Ruben the first son of Jacob and

And Ruben called she his name:

And so her second Son she cal'de

For this says she my husband now,

Because I have three sons him borne,

And therefore she her third son nam'de,
and Leuy did him call.
40
And she the fourth time did conceive
and bare another son,
Said she, now will I praise the Lord
for this that he has done.
41.
And Judah called she this Child.
and so she bare no more:

To Lea did he give the same,
that then his Mother was:
Said Rahel, Sister give me of

15
Is It not enoughe, said Lea then:
that thou my husband have?
But would my Sons Mandragoras

16
If that thy Sons Mandragoras
thou wylt give unto me:
I am content that Jacob shall

17
So Lea gave Mandragoras
and Rahel was content:
At even as Jacob homeward came,
to meet him Lea went,
18
And said: come unto me sweet heart,
this Night I have the bought:
With my sweet Sons Mandragoras

19
And so that Night with her he slept
and God did Lea hear:
She did conceive and so by him

Said she, God has rewarded me

when Sheep most feeble be,
51
He did forbear his Rodds to lay,
whereby the stronger Sheep
Were Jacobs al: the weaker sort
were Labans for to keep.
52
Thus Jacob grew exceeding rich,
and had a mighty stock
Of Servants eke and Camels too
and Asses in his Flock.

How Labans Children grudge
against this Jacobs wealth:
Of Jacobs back return
homeward again by stealth:
Rahell her Fathers Gods,
upon Sheep hearing day,
The same did filche, and steal,
and bare them so away:
How Laban follows fast
Jacob to overtake:
And of the Heap of stones,
and cou'naunt that they make.
NOw Laba^s Children spoke in For the covetous think whatsoever they can not

that Laban thought in heart.
And Jacob heard how that they said
our Father feels smart,
2.
For Jacob has taken all away*
our Fathers was before,
And has him self this honor got,
by Fathers goods, and store.
3.
And Jacob Laban well beheld
his Countenance, and there:
Which was not now as heretofore
but as he angry were.
4.
And then the Lord to Jacob said,
return thee home again
Into the Land where Father thine
and Kindred do remain,
5.
For I will be with thee, says God,
whereof Jacob was glad.
And sent for both his Wives to Field^,
and to the Flock he had:
6.
And when they came his presence to,
I see (said he) at last,
Your Fathers Countenance, to me
is not, as in time past.
7.
How beit, The God whom my father worshipped.
the God of Father mine,
has bin with me this Night:
And both you know, how Father yours,
I seru'de with all my Might:
8.
And yet he often deceived me,
in chaunginge of my Wage:
But God no time would suffer him,
to hurt me in his Rage:
9.
For when he said the spotted Sheep
thy hired Wage shall be:
Then all the Sheep, bespotted were,
as you can witness me:
10
And when he said, the straked Sheep,
shall thee reward for Hier:
Then all the Sheep bestraked were,
as one would it desire.
11.
Thus has the Lord, your Fathers This declares the thing that Jacob did
before, was by gods commau^dme^t* and not through deceit.
Sheep
from him, now taken away,
And of his goodness given them me,
as you do see this Day.
12
It thus befell in Ramminge time,
when in a Dream I was:
Mine Eyes I lifted up, and saw,
and so it came to pass
13.
Behold the Sheep that steaked were,
and spotted here, and there,
The Rams, upon their Backs did Leap,
in Place whereas they were.
14.
And in my Dream This Angel was Christ which appeared to Jacob in Bethel and
hereby appears he had taught his vviues the fear of God for he talks as
though they knevve this thing.
Gods Angel spoke,
and thus began say to me:
Jacob: and him I answered,
Lord, here I am by thee.
15
Said he, lift up thine Eyes, and see
the Rams leap on the Sheep
That spotted are, and straked be,
and party Coullour keep.
16.
I have seen all that Laban does,
or can against thee make:
For I the God of Bethel am,
where thou didste undertake
17.
The Stone to pitch upon an end,
and did Annoynte the same,
And where thou mad'ste a solemn Uow
unto my Sacred Name:
18.
Now therefore rise, and get the hence
out from this Country here,
And back return unto the Land
where Rebecca.
Rebek did the bear.
19.
When Rahell, and her Sister to
did Jacob understand:
Has not (said they) thy service long,
bought us of Fathers hand?
20
For he has They were given to Jacob in recompense of his service which is
a kind of sale.
Soulde us unto thee,
and we therewi^h content,
And he consumed has our Coin,
and all we see is spent.
21.
But have we any Portion else?
or has he given us more
Then that thy Service long time Bought?
as we have said before?
22.
For all the Richesse, God has cane
away from Father so,
Is ours, and eke our Childrens to,
as God to thee did: she.
23.
And therefore whatso ever God
has spoken unto thee:
Do that, according to his will:
so happy shall we be.
24.
Then Jacob rose, and se^ his Sons,
and Wives on Camels back,
And carried thence his Flock away,
and nothing seem'de to lack.
25.
And all his Substance which he had
procured, as you bear:
His Riches, and Possessions too,
which he had gotten there
26.
He drove them forth to Isaac
his Father for to go
Unto the Land of Canaan
that he before came fro:
27.
Now when as Laban went to sheate
his Sheep as other ^id
Rahell purioynd her Fathers Gods:
and secretly them hide.
28
Thus Jacob Labans heart did steal
because he went away,
And would not let him understand
of his removing. Day.
29
So privily he went his way
with all that ere he had,
And past the River Euphrates
toward Mount Gilead.

And three Days after Jacobs flight

32.
And God by Night to Laban came
and in a Dream did say,
Take heed thou speak nothing but good
to Jacob in the way.
33.
Then Laban Jacob ouertooke
as he in Journey went
And Jacob in mount Gilead
there pitched down his Tent.
34.
And Laban pitched there his Tent
with Brethren his also
Said Laban unto Jacob then
what made thee thus to go?
35.
Why ^ast thou stolen my Or co^ueighed thy self away pryuelye.

and Daughters twayn with thee
As though they had with Sword and Targe

36.
Wherefore went thou thus secretelye
away from me unknown?
And did not say, let me depart
with that which is mine own?
37
And that I might with melody
have brought thee on the way
And kissed so my Daughters dear
at their departing day.
38.
Thou wast a fool thus wise to do
thou know I am strong
And able am to do thee ill,
and to revenge this wrong.
39.
But sure the God of He was an Idolatour and therefore would not acknovvledge
the god of Jacob for his God.
Father yours
spoke yesternight with me,
Take heed thou speak but that is good
Jacob unto, (said he)
40.
And though desire thus prick thee forth
thy fathers house to see:
Yet wherefore have thou filcht and stolen
my Gods away with thee?
41.
I was afraid, said Jacob then,
my Wives thou would denay,
And therefore did we privily
convey our selves away.
42
But where as Theft thou layest to me,
look where the same shall fall,
Let him straight dye, on whom its found
before our Brethren all.
43
Now search and seek, and if thou find
of thine that is with me,
Let me abide rebuke thereof,
and take it unto thee.
44.
But Jacob knew not how his wife
who Rahel had to name,
Had stolen away her fathers Gods
and closely kept the same.
45.
Then Laban came to Jacobs Tent
and Leahs tent also,
And searched in the mayde^s Tent
but found them not: and so
From Leahs Tent departing he
to Rahels Tent did go
46.
Now Rahel had ere father came
his Ydols taken out,
And hid them in the Camells Or litter.
Straw:
her father sought about.
47.
But still she sat upon the Straw
wherein the Ydolies lay,
To Laban then her father she
with feeble voice did say:
48
My Lord (said she) not angry be
most humbly I do pray,
That I do not arise to thee
for skarse I able may:
49.
Because the course of Women now
is on me all this day:
Thus Laban sought but found them not
and so went he his way.
50
Then Jacob wroth and angry was
and did with Laban chyde,
And said, what trespass have I done,
or what have thou espyde
51.
In me? or these that are with me
that thou should us pursue?
Thou ransackt have my stuff each whit:
have thou found us untrue?
52
What have thou found of all that is thine
abiding here with me?
Put it before our brethren here
to judge twene me and thee.
53
Behold I have these Twenty Years
been faithful Servant thine,
Thy Sheep and Goats not Barrayne were
but fruitful in the time.
54*
Ne did thy Ewes yet cast their Young,
the Rams eke of thy flock
I have not eat, but always have
maintained still thy stock:
55.
And what so ere was torn by Beasts
or perished in the Wood,
I never brought it unto thee,
my self did make it good.
56.
For of my hands did thou require
the same for to repay,
As though with Thieves it had been stolen
by Night or else by day.
57.
And in the Day the heat of Sun
consumed me full sore
And in the night the bitter frost
with cold did nip me more.
58.
Thus Day and Night in heat and cold
I seldom time have slept,
So careful was I on the charge
of cattle thine I kept.
59.
Thus have I spent these xx. Years
and in thy House remain,
And Fourteen of these twenty years
was for thy daughters twain
60
And six years service for thy sheep
I kept upon the Plain.
Yet thou my wages changed have
too many times certain.
61
Except the God of Father mine,
the God of Abraham,
And eke the God whom Isack feared
and God that to me came:
62
Had been with me, thou surely had
me empty sent away,
And given me naught for service long
as I have said this Day.
63
But God beheld my troubles great
and labors of my hand,
And thee rebuked yester night
thy self do understand.
64
Now Labans conscience moved was
and sought a Peace to make,
And therefore unto Jacob said
this will I undertake.
65
These Daughters twayn my Daughters are,
these Sons are also mine:
These sheep and al thou see beside
are mine as well as thine:
66
And what can I this Day then do
to these my Daughters here
Or to their sons, which they have borne,
that in my sight appear?
67
Come His conscience ^^proued ^im of his misbehau^our tovvard Jacob, and
therefore moved him to seek peace.
now therefore and let us make
A league most firm to be
Which may a wytnes be for aye
between my self and thee.
68
They both agreed and Jacob took
a stone, and set it right
Up, like a Pillar for to stand
In every bodies sight.
69
Then Jacob to his brethren said
take you up stones likewise
And so they did, and made an heap
as best they could devise.
70
And on the heap of stones that was
they sat them down to Eat:
Great friends, they were and gently did

76
These witness shall I will not come

And now the God of Abraham

But Jacob swear by the only God

And they did eat and in the Mount

The Messengers to Esaw went

And said, thy brother against thee brynges

This news made Jacob sore Albeit he was comforted by the Angels, yet the

he wist not what to say
Ne what to do, but yet at last
he did devise the way:
11
His people, sheep* and Cattle al
for to divide in twain
And took great pains to place the same
in order to remain.
12
Said he: If Esau come and smite
one part of people mine,
The other part, may leisure find
to save it self in time.
13
To God then Jacob said again,
O God of Abraham,
God of my father Isaac,

14
Thou Lord which ^a^ I should return
unto my Country back,
Among my kynred for to dwell

15
For I my self will be with thee
and do al for the best:
I say thou Lord wilt not forsake
poor Jacob thus distressed:
16
And yet O Lord I must confess
no whit I worthy am,
No not the least of mercies thine

That thou have shewde thy servant to,
by day and eke by night,
For with my That is, poor and with out al provision.

18
And now two Droues I gotten have,

20
Thou sayd'st O Lord I surely will
do good and good to thee.
And make thy Seed as is the Sand

The which can not for multitude,
of any numbered be.
21
And Jacob there abode that night,
and such as came to hand
He took thereof, and No^ distrusting Gods assistaunce, but using such means
as God had geeuen him.
Presents made
for Esau t'vnderstand.
22
Two hundredth Goats of Female kind,
and twenty Males also,
Two hundred Ewes and twentye Rams
did he appoint to go,
23
And thirty Camels Milk that gave
their Coltes them passing by,
With Forty Ryne, and Bullockes ten
that fair were to the eye.
24
Of she Asses he twentye took,
and Coltes ten, them beside,
Five hundred and fourskore were they
that Jacob did provide.
25
And so into his servants hands,
these Droues deliu'red he,
And eu'rye Drove was by it self
appointed so to be.
26
And he unto his Servant said?

And put a space tweene Drove and Drove,
and furthermore did say,
27
To him that foremost was of all
among the Droues to see:
If that my brother do thee meet

28
Whose man art thou? and whose are these?
and whither do thou go?
In humble wise with reverent speech

Sir these thy Servant Jacobs be,
and are by him ass^gnd

30
So likewise to the second Man,
the third, and all the rest,
Commanded he with Droues that came

31
And more (said he) thus shall you say,

For thus he thought, I will his wrath

And after will I see his face

33
So with these Presents forth they went

But Jacob with the company
abode behind that night.
34
And in the Night did Jacob rise
and his two wives also:
His Maidens twain, his Children all,

They both brast forth with Tears, and wept,

Then Esau lifted up his eyes
and did the women see,
And Children theyrs standing them by,
whence have thou these? says he:
8
And do these women and these youths*
belong or no to thee?
They are (said he) thy Servants Sons,

And last of all came Joseph forth

Said Esau unto Jacob then

12
My Lord said he, that favor I

Not so my Brother (Esau said)

14
Ah, nay, My Lord, but if I have,

For I this Day have seen In that his brother embraced him so lovingly

to take it for his own.
17.
When he these Presents had receiu'de,
let us (said he now go:
And I will lead the Way before:
my Lord (said he) not so,
18.
Thou know'ste the Children tender are,
the Ewes with Young be great,
So be the Kine under my Hand:
I shall my Lord entreat:
19
Least Men the Herd should ouerdriue,
but even one Day to try:
Both Ewes, and Kine, and all the rest
would perish by and by,
20.
And therefore let my louinge Lord
go on before, if^ please,
And I will softly after come,
and drive the Herd with ease:
21.
So as the Cattle may endure,
and Children able be:
I shall to He promised that which it seems his mind was not to perform.

Said Esau then, yet let me leave

That I may^ grace, and favor find,

For thereof have I need, my Lord,

So now again did Esau go
to Seir forth on his way.
And Jacob did his Journey take
to Suchot: which men say

the Tents and Bothes he made,
Wherein his Cattle from the heat

And Jacob built him there an house

And he this Dream his father told,

and said unto him: why?
16
What is this Dream which thou have dreamed

That I, thy Mother, and my sons,

And whether that the sheep be well,

And so he sent him from the Uale

but so befell the case:

A certain man by chance him found:
for Joseph went astraye,
And wandered up and down the fields
and myssed on the way,

And then the man thus asked him,
what sekest thou this Day?
I seek my Brethren, tell me where
they sheep do keep I pray,

They are departed hence (said he)

But cast him in the pit that is here

they did behold and see,

35
With Camels great that laden were,
with Balm, with Myrre, and Spyce:
Which going were to Egypt down,

36
And Judah to his Brethren said,
what shall it do us good
Our Brother Joseph for to kill
and secret keep his blood?
37
Let us go sell him to these men
that down to Egypt go,
And let us lay no hands on him,

And as the Merchauntes passed by,
they out from Pyt him drew,

NOw Joseph was to Egypt brought
by those that Marchantes were:
To one of Egypt they him sold,
whose name was Potiphere:

This Potipher an Eunuche was,
and one of Pharos Lords:
And of his House the Steward chief
and kept the Kings Records.

For every thing he took in hand
did all the Rest excel:
Thus in his Masters house did he
continue still and dwell.

His master the Egyptian
did see and understand
That God made all things prosper well
which Joseph took in hand.

Did make him Because god prospere him, and so he made religion to serve his

and gave him charge of all,

such favor Joseph found,
And Joseph was a Goodly Man
as went upon the ground.
9
That in so much his Masters Wife
her Eyes on Joseph cast,
And did desire the use of him
to lie with her at last.
10
But he refused so to do,
and said* Maistrisse, behold,

14
Yet notwithstanding Day by Day,
she Joseph still besought,
But he Refused so to do,
and set her speech at naught.
15
And did as much as lay in him
her company refrain
Because he would not lie with her
nor hear her babbling vain,
16
It happened on a certain Day
that Joseph could not choose

Because he business had to do

save she that meant to Sin.
18.
She caught his Garment fast in hand
and friendly to him said
I pray thee Joseph sleep with me,
but he the same denayed,
19
And left his Garment in her hand
and fled, and got him out:
She seeing this, her people calde
to come her round about.
20
And said, behold, my Husband has
an Hebrew hither brought:
To do us shame and villanye,
the Uerlet now has sought.
21
For he into my Chamber came
with me for to have slept:
I This declares, that where ^ncontinency is, there unto is joined extreme

And left his Garment him behynd

To keep until her Lord returnde,
to whom with Tears she said:

This Hebrewe which thou have home brought

And sought my honor for to spoil,
and reaue me of my Name.
24
But when I lifted up my voice,
and Cride that al might hear:
He left his garment him behind
and fled away for fear.
25
His Master hearing this of her,
believed al she said,
And being wroth he Joseph took
and him in Prison laid.
26
In place where Prisners of the Kings
in Fetters lay fast bound:
Thus Joseph there continued
in Prison under Ground.
27
But yet the Lord with Joseph was
and mercy did him show,
And got him favor of the Lord
that did the Prison owe.
28
And he that keeper was thereof
to Joseph did commit
The charge of all the Prisners there
to do as he thought fit.
29
For why, the Keeper meddled not,
but well did understand
That God did prosper every thing
That Joseph took in hand.

THe Butler and the Baker both
are into Prison thrown:
And each of them did Dream a Dream
and Joseph made it known.
ANd after this, it chanced so
that Pharo angry was
With Baker his, and Butler ek^,
whereby it came to pass,
2
That he to Ward committed them
where they in Prison lay

Thus were the Kings two Officers

while they did there remain.
4
It happened that both these men
in one Night being sad
In sleep did Dream, and each Man's Dream
a sundry meaning had.
5
When Joseph came as he was wont,
in morning them to see,
He them beheld with heavy cheer,
why be ye sad, said he?
6
We have this Night, said they to him,
Dreamed each of us a dream,
And have no body to declare,
what these our Dreams do mean.
7

to Or, can not god raise up such as shall Interpret such things

Yet tell it me: the Buttler first,
to show his Dream began,
8
And said: Me thought before me stood,
a Uyne that Buddes did bear:
And in the Uyne were Branches three,
that al be bloomed were.
9
And after Bloomes came Blossoms forth,
and Grapes at last did grow:
And with my hand those Grapes I took,
that ripe were to the show:
10
And wrong them into Pharos Cup,
and Wine thereof did make,
Me thought I gave the King the Cup,
and he the same did take.
Said Joseph then, I He was assured by the Spirit of god that his
interpretation was true.

11
Those Branches three, are these three Days,
that with this Day shall fall.
In which the King shall lift the up,
and give thee therewithal

and thou shall give also,
The King his Cup as thou were wont,
and so in favor grow.
13
But if thou chance to think on me
when thou art in good case,
Thy mercy then upon me show,
abiding in this place.
14
And put the King He refuses not the means to be delivered which he
thought God had appointed.
in mind of me,
and bring me out from hence,
For in this Dungeon was I cast,
not guilty of offense.
15
I am an Hebrew borne by birth
and stolen away was I,
And chopped and changde as Bondslaues be
this wretched life to try.
16
Now when the Baker saw and heard
the Butlers Dream was good,
He also unto Joseph told
his Dream, as he there stood:
17
Me thought (said he) upon my head
three Or as some Read, Baskets full of holes
wicker Baskettes were,
And in the uppermost of three
was sundry bakte Meats there:
And for the King me thought I did
these Cates and Baskettes bear.
18
And yet me thought the Birds did pecke
and still upon them fed,
And out of Basket did they eat
which was upon my head.
Said Joseph He shows that the Ministers of God ought not to-conceale that
which God reu^leth unto them.
then: this signifyes

19
The Baskettes three are days yet th^^^
that with this Day shall be:
For this Day three Days shall the King
take of thy head from thee:
20
And shall thy Carcass hoyse aloft
and hang upon a Tree,
And Birds that fly shall eat thy flesh
that we upon thee see.
21
It happened that the same third Day
was Which was an occasion to appoint his officers, and so to examine the^
that were in Prison.
Birth day of the King,
Whereon he feasted all his Men
with cheer and Bankettinge.
22
And that same Day he did lift up
the heads of both those twain
The Butler and the Baker eke
which Prisners did remain.
23
And so the Butler to his Place
he did eftsoon restore:
And took the Bakers Head him froe,
his Servants al before.
24
The Butler gave the King the Cup,
appointed to that Place,
The Baker hangde as Joseph said,
So all things came to pass.
But yet the Butler did forget
poor Joseph's heavy case.

King Pharos Dreams expounded are,

Chyefe Ruler is he made of all,
in Egypt to be done.
And Pharo changes Joseph's name,
and gyues a Wife to him.
By whom he had two Sons: to wit,
Manass' and Ephraim.
ANd two years after it befell,
that Pharo This Dream was not so much for Pharao as to to be a mean to
deliver Joseph and to provide for his Church.
D^eam'd a Dream,
He thought he stood a River by,
and saw come from that Stream
2
Seven Kyne that fatt^ and goodly were,
Which went before his face,
Into a Meadow fair and Green,
wherein they fed apace.
3
And after them, Seven other Kyne
came up that River fro,
That very Lean and Feeble were,
il fauord to the show*

Which stood the other fat Kyne by,
upon the River side,
And these Lean honger starued Kyne
with bare and pilled Hyde

Did eat up all the well fed Kyne

And in the same him thought to see
upon one stalk to grow,
Seven Ears of Corn both full and large
That Ra^cknes great did show.
7
He saw come up Seven other Ears
that s^lender were and thynne
Be blasted with the Eastern wynd,
as Scorched they had been.
8
And these last Seven devoured clean

And Pharo wak'te and looked about

nor meaning thereof show.
12
The Butler said unto the King,
I He confesses his fault against the King before he speaks of Joseph
call to Mind this day,
A Breach of promise that I made
when I in Prison lay.
13
Such time as Pharo angry was
and me to Prison sent,
And when the Baker of his House
a Prisner with me went
24
Thus when we both in Dongeon were,
it chanced in one Night
That each of us did Dream a Dream
which after fell out right.
15
There was with us a fair Young man
that was an Hebrew borne,
Who Servant to the Marshal was:
we nere him saw beforne.
16.
To whom we told our seu^rall dreams,
and he The wicked seek to the Prophets of God in their necessity, vvho^ in
their prosperity they abhor
again to us
(As afterward the same fell out)
the truth did then discuss.
17
I was restored (as he said)
to Office mine again,
And eke the Baker hanged was,
as he declared plain.
18
Then Pharo sent and did command
this The wicked seek to the Prophets of God in their necessity, vvho^ in
their prosperity they abhor
Joseph for to have:
Forthwyth from Prison they him brought
out from that filthy Cave.
19
And Joseph then did shane himself
as was that time the guyse:
And better Clothes did put him on
and went in cleanly wise.
20
So when he came the King before,
the King to Joseph spoke,
I have (quoth he) late Dreamed a Dream,
but none can truly make,
21
Interpretacion of the same:
but yet I have heard tell,
That when a Dream is told to thee,
thou can declare it well.
22
Then Joseph to King Pharo said,
my Lord the King shall see
That As though he would say: if I interpret thy Dream, it comes of God and
not of me.
God shall give an Answer good
to Pharo without me.
23
Said Pharo: in this Dream me thought
I stood a River by,
From whence there came.vii. Goodly Kine
well Fleshed to mine Eye
And in a Medowe did they Feed,
which was the River ny:
24
And after them I saw come forth
out from that running Brook
Seven other Kyne both Pore and Lean
and ill upon to look.
25
Such as before I never saw
within the Egiptian land,
So thynne, so bare, so pin'de away
skarce able were to stand.
26
And yet these seven i^ fauord Kyne
that Scaruelynges were and lean,
Did Eat up all the vii. fat Kyne
that goodly were and Clean.
27
And when they had devoured them,
a man could not perceive
That they had Eaten them: for why,
their Bellyes still did clea^^
28
Unto their Backs in Starueling sort,
as when they did begin:
So Lean were they, so il to see,
so pyned, poor and Thin.
29
I did awake, and Dreamed again
and then me thought I saw
Seven Ears spring out of good full Corn,
upon one Stalk or Straw.
30
And after them sprang out also
vii withred Ears of Corn,
So thyn, and blasted with the Wynd,
worse Corn was never borne.
31
And those vii Ears that withred were
and blasted with the Wind
Devoured up the Seven good Ears,
and nothing left behind.
32
This have I told my Southsayers
and Wise men of my Land:
But they hereof can nothing tell
ne ought do understand.
33
Then Joseph unto Pharo said:
both Pharoes Dreams Or both his dreams tend to one end.
are one:
And God does show what he will do
to Pharo even anon.
34
The Seven good Kyne do signify
Seven Years that happen shall:
The seven good Ears are Years also
but one Dream is it all.
35
Likewise the Seven ill fauord Kyne
that after them came forth,
That were so Lean, so poor and thynne,
appearing nothing worth:
36
Are eke seven Years: the blasted Ears
of corn that did appear.
Shall Be Seven Years of Dearth so great,
as Ear did never hear.
37
This is the thing that I have said
before my Lord the King,
And God to Pharo has declard
what he to pass will bring.
38
Behold Seven Years of Plenty great
in all the Land shall be:
And after them again shall rise
Seven Years of Penury.
39
Wherein such Famine shall abound,
and bring the Land in Thrall
That those Seven Years of Plenty great
shallbe forgot of all
40
Thus Famine shall consume the Land
that none remember shall
The plenty past, by reason of
the Honger that shall fall.
41
And where the Dream the Second time
to Pharo doubled was:
Behold, God has established it
shortly to bring to pass.
42
Now therefore let the King The office of a true Prophet is not only to shevve
the euilles to come but also the remedies for the same.
provide
for such a Man as knows
And understands what Wisdom is:
and set him over those
43
That do inhabit in the Land,
to bear the rule and sway
And under him such Officers
as may in time puruay.
44
And let them take the fyft part up
of Food through out the Land
That shall in those Seven plenteous Years,
fall in th'Egiptians Hand.
45
And let the same and Corn also
that they shall then provide
Be under the hand of Pharo brought,
the same to lay aside.
46
And that there may in Cities all
be stoare of Food to serve
Against the time of Hunger come,
that People may not sterue.
47.
And that the Land not peryshe may,
through Hunger that shall grow,
This saying pleased Pharo well,
and Servants his also.
48
And Pharo said his Servant to,
who then were him beside:
Where shall we find a Man like this,
in whom None should be preferred to honor that have not ye gifts of God mete
for the same.
Gods Sprite does bide?
49.
And Pharo unto Joseph said,
for so much as I see,
That God has showed these things to the,
which thou have told to me:
There is no Man that wisdom has,
nor Knowledge like to thee.
50.
Thou shall therefore over my House,
bear all the Rule and swaye,
And what thou speakste, my People shall
in every thing obey.
51
Only I will above thee be,
in Kingly Seat and Throne,
But otherwise, thou Govern shall
and Rule the rest alone.
52.
And said, behold, I have thee set
to Rule over the Land:
So took his Ring his Finger from,
and put on Joseph's hand
53
And him arayd in Cloth of Raines*
as Princes wont to wear
Likewise about his neck he put
a chain of Gold to bear
54
And set him up aloft to Ride
a Charret rych upon:
Which was of all that Pharo had
the best, excepting one.
55
And as he rode, they cryde before
to Joseph ^owe the Knee
Thus Pharo made him Governor
of Egypt Land to be.
56
Said Pharo then, I Pharo am,
but yet this understand,
Without thee shall no Subject mine
lift up his Foot or Hand.
57
And Pharo called Joseph's name
in Hebrew as we find,
Zaphnath Paaneah: that is to say,
the Opener of the Mind.
58
He gave Asenath to his Wife
to feed his joys upon
The Daughter of Potipherah
the Prince or Priest of On.
59
Then Joseph did prepare him self
the Land to go above
There (...) no pe^^e of Egypt Land,
that Joseph sought not out.
60
And His age is mentioned, both to show that his auctority came of god, and
also that he suffered Imprisonment and exile xii years.
Thirty (...) was he of Age
when he before the King
Did standin grace, and had the charge
to govern every thing.
61
Thus from the presence of the King
did Joseph now depart,
And went the Land of Egypt through
with humble Sprite and heart,
62
And in those seven years plentiful
late spoken of before,
The Earth of Corn, and sundry grain,
brought forth abundaunt store.
63
And Joseph gathered all the Food,
that those seven years did yield,
And look what City lay most near
the food of any field:
64
Within the same it was laid up,
unto the Off'cers hand,
This was the Order that he kept
through all th'Egiptian Land,
65
The wheat that Joseph up had laid,
to serve in time of need,
For multitude was like the Sand:
it number did exceed.
66
And ere the years of hunger came,
Joseph had two Sons borne,
By Asenah his wife that was,
of whom we heard beforne.
67
And he the first of those two Sons,
The birth of Manasseth.
Manasseth did he call,
For God (said he) made me Notvvithstanding that his fathers house was the
true Church of God yet the company of the wicked, and prosperity caused him
to forget it.
forget
my Fathers Household all.
68
And Ephraim did Joseph call,
his other second Son:
God has me fruitful made, said he,
or, in the Land of mine Affliction.
in mine affliction.
69
And when the seven years plentiful
were ended with their store,
Then came the seven years Famine forth,
as Joseph said before.
70
Though Famine fell in all the Lands,
yet Egypt Land was free,
For when the rest of Honger dyed.
yet Food was there to see.
71
And after this the Hunger came,
into th'Egiptian Land,
And then the people began to cry
for bread at Pharaos hand.
72
Said Pharao then, to Joseph go
and what he says to you,
The same perform, and you shall see
great goodness shall ensue.
73
The Dearth was great throughout the Land,
and Joseph went apace
To every Town where store was kept,
and sold in every place.
74
All Countries else, to Egypt came
of Joseph Corn to buy,
The Famine was so great abroad,
the want made many dye.
The Contents of the XLII. Chapter.
To Egipte Joseph's Brethren come,
some Vytayle for to buy,
And Joseph knows them very well,
and does his Brethren try.
And Simeon in Hold is put
in Prison of the king,
Till they unto their Father go,
young Benjamin to bring:
His Father's loath to let him go,
because he lou'de him best:
But at the last contented is
and grauntes to their request.
AND Jacob saw that there was Corn
in Egypt to be had:
Said to his Sons, why As men de^titute of Counsel.
gape ye one
an other on, so sad?
In Egypt there is Corn I hear,
therefore let us be glad.
2
Now get you down and thither go,
some Corn from thence to buy,
That we therewith may feed and live,
and not through Hunger die.
3
So went the Sons of Jacob down,
which Ten in number were,
And Brethren all by fathers side
to Joseph that was there.
4
But Benjamin who Brother was,
to Joseph in whole Blood,
Their father would not let him go,
but kept him back for good:
5
Least some Misfortune might him hap,
(as he of Joseph thought)
And so the Ten, to Egypt went
and Corn for Many sought.
6
And thus among the preasse they past,
with Money in their hand,
For yet the Dearth was very great,
throughout all Canaan Land.
7
Now Joseph being Governor
deliu'red with his hand
The Corn, and sold to all that came,
inhabiting the Land.
8
Among the which, his Brethren came
and fell before his face
Down flat upon the Ground they lay,
and him besought of Grace.
9
When Joseph had his Brethren spyde,
he knew them well enough,
And made him self al strange to them,
and spoke in words full rough:
10
From whence come you? they answered
from Land of Canaan:
To buy some vytayle for our Coin
in humblest wise we can.
And all this while they knew him not
from any other man.
11
Now, Joseph to remembrance called,
the Dream he dreamde of them,
Which he them told ere he was sold,
unto the Merchant men.
12
And said, you are but Spies I know,
which hither make Resort,
To see where as the Land is weak
the same for to report.
13
Not so my Lord, we come, said they,
some Uittal for to buy,
We mean but troth and are no Spies,
as deed it self shall try:
And are the Sons of one man all:
this Troth is, and no lie.
14
Said he, I know you are but Spies
what ere you bear in hand,
And hither are you come to see
the weakness of the Land.
15
Said they, thy Servants Brethren be
twelve, gotten by one man.
And he our Father does remain
in Land of Canaan.
16
Our youngest Brother Benjamin,
with him does bide this Day,
And Joseph that our brother was
is dead out of the way.
17
Said Joseph then to them again,
this makes me doubt you more,
To be but Spies upon the Land,
as I have said before.
18
And hereby shall I prove you true
or false in that you say,
Now here I swear by The Aegiptians which were Idolaters, used to swear by
their kings Life but god forbid death to svvere by any but by him: yet Joseph
dwelling among the wicked smells of their Corruptions.
Pharos life
you shall not go away:
19
Except your youngest Brother come
whom Benjamin you call,
Therefore send one who may him fetch
and come himself wythal:
20
And you in prison shall be kept
to prove this truth or lies,
Else by the Life of Pharao King,
I take you al as Spies.
21
And so he put them all in Ward,
wherein three Days they lay,
Then Joseph came to them again
and on this wise did say.
22
This do and Live, And therefore am true and just.
for I fear God,
and will not ly to you,
If you be Men that of your words,
will Just be found and true.
23
Let one of you in prison House
be bound for all the rest:
The other Nine shall victual have*
to carry of the best.
24.
Least Famine fall your Houses in:
but bring you unto me
Your younger Brother: that your words
may true appear to be,
And that you dye not through the same:
and so they did agree:
25.
One Brother to another said,
our Affliction makes men to acknovvledge their faults which otherwise they
would dissemble.
Sin was very great,
That we against Brother Joseph did,
when he did us entreat.
26.
Yea, in the Anguishe of his Soul
he gently us besought,
And we would not regard his Words,
but set the same at naught.
And therefore are these troubles great.

You would not hear, and now behold,

28.
They thought that Joseph had not known,
or understood their Tongue,
For that by an Interpreter,
he spoke to them among.
29.
When Joseph heard what moan they made
he turned aside, and Though he shevved himself Rigorous, yet his brotherly
affection remained.
wept.
And by and by with them did talk,
and still his Count'naunce kept:
30.
And Simeon he took from them,
and bound him for the rest:
And so before his Brethrens Eyes
was made a Prison Ghest.
31.
Then Joseph did command to fill
their Sackes with Corn good store.
And that their Money should be tied
within their Sackes before.
32.
Also he willed they should have
some Uyctaile for to spend.
As Homeward they should pass the way,
unto their Iourneys end.
33.
And thus did he: and they it took,
with show of thankful heart,
Their Asses did they Lade with Corn,
and did from thence depart.
34
And in their Traueil as they went,
an Inn they came unto,
Where one of them went to his Sack,
the same for to undo:
35
To give his Ass some Prouender,
and when he it unbound,
Behold, within the Mouth thereof,
his Money all he found.
36
And he unto his Brethren said,
I have undone my sack,
And lo, my Money is therein,
to me restored back.
37
Their hearts began to faint with fear,
and were Because their conscience accused them of their sin, they thought,
God would have brought them to trouble by this Money.
astonished sore,
And one of them to other said,
alas, alas, wherefore
Has God our God thus dealt with us,
to make our sorrows more?
38
At length their Father Jacobs House,
by Travel great they wan,
Who d^d Expect their coming long,
in Land of Canaan.
39.
To whom they told each thing that hapt,
and said unto him thus:
The Lord himself that is of the Land,
did roughly speak to us.
40.
Who said we came as Spyalls there
his Country to betray,
We are no Spies but truly mean,
did we to him then say.
41
And are in number Brethren twelve
the Children of one man,
One is away: the youngest is,
at home in Canaan.
42.
The Lord again then said to us,
hereby I shall well know,
Whether you mean as you have said,
or Spyalls be or no.
43.
You shall leave one of you behynd,
for to abide with me,
The rest shall take of food enough,
for Households yours that be.
44.
And if you bring the Youngest Son,
that Brother is to you,
I shall then think you mean but well
and all your sayings true.
45.
And so will I deliver you,
your Brother back again,
And you shall occupy the Land,
wherein you do remain.
46
And as they emptied al their Sackes,
their Father being by,
Each one of them his Money found,
within his sack to lie.
47
The sight whereof made Children all,
and Father theirs afraid.
That in so much the Aged man,
unto his Children said,
48
You have me robbed of Children twain:
for Joseph he is gone,
And Simeon the Lord does know.
what him is fallen upon.
39
If Benjamin you take away,
the youngest of you all,
I do foresee the sorrows great,
against me that shall fall.
50
Then Ruben to his Father said,
I have two Sons you see,
Slay them, if that I bring not back,
this Benjamin to thee.
51
Deliver him into my hand,
the charge of him to take:
And if I bring him not again,
my twain kill for his sake.
52
Said Jacob then, my Son shall not
that way with you down go:
His Brother Ioseph's dead, and he
is left alone, you know.
53
If some misfortune should him hap,
the way you would him have:
My hoarye hayres you shall then bring
with sorrow to my Grave.

When as young Benjamin was brought,
with Gifts returned they,
And Simeon deliu'red is,
from Prison where he lay,
And Joseph turns aside to weep,
that they might not him see.
They eat, and drink, and merry are
together, as may be.
WHen Jacob and his Ch^ldren had
consumed all their store,
He bade his Sons to Egypt go
to buy a little more.
For why, the Dearth was in the La^d,
among them very sore:
2
Then Judah to his Father said,
Ahlas, what shall ensue?
The man did charge us by an Oath
the which we all shall rue.
3
Except (says he) you hither bring
your Brother to this place,
I charge you that you do not come
nor see me in the face.
4
If thou therefore wilt send with us
our Brother for to go,
We will go down, and buy thee Food,
and bring enough we know.
5
But if thou will not send him down
we will not go at all:
The man for Spialls will us take
and thereby make us thrall.
6
For thus, said he, unless you bring
your younger Brother here:
I charge you that before my face,
you come not to appear.
7
Said Which was Jacob*
Israel, wherefore dealt ye
so cruelly with me,
As for to tell the man, you had
a Brother yet to see?
8
The man did ask of us (said they)
and straightly did enquire,
What Race our stock, and kindred was,
and asking did desire,
9
Is not your Father yet alive*
and have ye not (said he)
Another Brother, left at home?
it is even so: said we:
10
Could we then know or understand,
that he to us would say,
I charge you bring your brother down,
to come with you the way?
11
Then Judah to his Father said,
Send ye the Lad with me,
That we may rise and go for Food.
and bring the same to thee.
12
That thou, our Children, and our selves,
thereby our lives may save:
And not to dye through want of Food,
where we the same may have,
13
I will be Surety for the Lad
to bring him safe again,
Thou shall require him at my hand
to see him on my pain.
14
And if I bring him not again,
as I have said before,
And that thine eyes shall him behold,
blame me for evermore.
15
Truly if that we had not stayed
so long where no cause is
We had been there the second time
and come again ere this.
16
Then said their Father unto them,
if it must needs be so:
You shall this do at my request,
before that you do go.
17
Within your Uessels shall ye put
the best fruits in the Land,
And bring a Present of the same
and g^eue it in his hand.

of Myrre, and Nuttes also:

And double When we are in necessity or danger, God forbids not to use all
honest means, to better our estate, and Condition.
Money shall you take

And eke the Money that you brought

20
The same shall you take back again,

For why, perhaps, among themselves
it was some oversight.
21
Arise and take young Benjamin

And Our chief trust* ought to be in God, and not in vvorldlye means.
God Almighty bless you all,

22
God grant you mercy in the sight

and stood before the Eyes

27
But when they were in Joseph's house,
then were they all So the Judgment of God pressed* their Conscience.
afraid,
Among themselves they began to scanne,
and one to other said.
28
How that the Money was the cause,
that they were thither brought:
Which in their Sackes they carried home,
with Corn that they had bought,
29
And now will he a quarrel pick,
and to our charge will lay
Some thing: whereby in Bondage us,
and Asses ours to stay.
30
And therefore came they to the man,
that thither did them bring,
And at the Door of Joseph's House,
did tell him every thing.
31
O sir (Said they) we hither came
at first some Food to buy,
And as we came into an Inn,
of purpose there to lie.
32
We every one his Sack undid,
for things that seem'de to lack,
And each of us his Money found,
full weight within his Sack.
33
And we have brought it back again,
for so we thought it good,
And other Money in our hands
besides, to buy us Food.
We know not who our Money put
in Sackes where as they stood.
34.
Peace be to you then, said the Man,
and nothing fear at all,
For why? your Notwithstanding the corruptions of Egypt, yet Joseph taught
his Famely to fear God.
God has helped you,
which never fail you shall:
35.
And eke the God, of Father youres,
The Almighty God was he,
That put the Money in your Sackes,
for once it was with me.
36.
And then he brought out Simeon
their Brother left behind,
For Pledge of their Returninge back,
as Joseph had assignd:
37.
And so together were they led
by Joseph's Offycer,
Who Water gave, their Feet to wash,
and fetched Prouender
38.
For Asses theirs, that hungry were,
and weary by the way,
And they thus and their Asses too
in Ioseps House did stay:
39.
Where as the Brethren ready made
such Presents as they had,
Against that Joseph should come home:
and now they waxed glade
40.
Because they heard they should at Noone
eat Bread in Joseph's sight,
And thinkinge on the Off'cers words
them Joyful made, and Light.
41.
Now when that Joseph Home was come,
each one with Gifts in Hand,
Fell flat on Ground with Presents such
as Grew in Canan Land,
And him Presented therewithal,

42.
In courteous wise, he welcom'de them:
is Father yours (said he)
Yet still alive? and in good Health?
as you before toulde me?
43.
Our Father Sir, and Servant thine,
is in good Health we know,
And therewithal did bow themselves,

45.
Said he, is this young Benjamin?
of whom you spoke before?
My Son to thee God Mercy show,

46.
And Joseph hasted him away,
his Tears began to fall:
His Heart upon young Benjamin
did Yerne, and melt withal:
47,
So he unto his Chamber went,
that none might him espy,
And there a space did Weep, and shed
forth Tears aboundauntly.
68
And afterward he washed his Face:
and came out fresh to see,
He did refrain and straynd himself,
as it had not ben he:
And did command upon the Board,
that Bread there set should be.

And they prepared for him alone,

And much the Men among themselves

72
And there were brought them sundry Meats,

But Benjamin had, with the r^st,
so much and five times more.

And thus they sat, and merry were,
and had enough of Wine,

Joseph accuses Benjamin
of Theft, whereat they mourn:
And Judah is a Pledge become

AND afterward commanded he
and said his Steward to,
Go fill their Sackes with Corn and grain
as I appoint you, do.
2
And put both Corn and Food therein,
as much as they can bear,
And in the mouth of each man's Sack,
close up their Money there.
3
But in the Sack of Benjamin,
that youngest is of all,
My Cup, I mean my Silver Cup,
there We may not by this example, use any unlawful practices, seeing God has
commanded us to walk in Simplicity
put the same thou shall.
4
His Corn, and Coin, he hither brought,
likewise the same put in,
And so the Steward did in all,
as he commanded him.
5
And in the morning when the Sun
began abroad to show,
The men were sent away from thence,
and Asses theirs also.
6
And when they were the City out,
and not far gone away,
His Steward then commanded he
to follow them, and say:
7
Wherefore have you rewarded ill
for good that is done to you?
And for great Curtesye receiu'de
to show your selves untrue?
8
Is not the Cup wherein my Lord
does drink and Prophecy,
Conueighde away by one of you?
you have done naughtelye.
9
And so the Steward passed forth
and when he them oretooke,
He spoke those Words as Joseph bad,
whereat for fear they shook.
10
And said, Ah las, why does my Lord
declare such words as these?
God it forbid we should ought do
that might thy Lord displease.
11
Behold the Money which we found
within our Sackes to be,
We brought again from Canaan,
and gave it unto thee.
12
How then should we from thy Lords house,
steal Silver, Place, or Gold:
With whom so ever it is found,
let him be had in Hold.
13
And let him dye, and we also
will further promise make,
Bondmen to be unto my Lord
for his offenses sake.
14
Now then said he, it shall so be
as you have said to me:
He upon whom the thing is found,
shall now my Servant be.
15
And you be blameless of the Crime,
and Innocents abide,
And every man his Sack took down
and it, did open wide.
16
And at the Eldest they began
to make this Search: and so
From one to one, in their degree,
did search their Sackes a row.
17
And at young Benjamin they left,
within whose Sack they had
The silver Cup, that missing was,

That they their Clothes To signify how greatly the thing dyspleased them and

and every one took pain,

19
So Judah and his Brethren came
to Joseph, whom they found
At home in house, where they him left,
and fell upon the Ground.
20*
What Act is this said (Joseph then),
that you have done to me?
Do you not know such one as I
can truly Prophecy?
21
Said Judah then, what shall we say
unto my Lord as now?
What shall we speak? to clear our selves
Ahlas, we know not how.
22
The wickedness of servants thine

And we thy Bondmen are become,

Both we, and he, with whom the Cup
was found unto our pain.
23
Not so (said Joseph) God forbid
you should such dealing see,
But he with whom the Cup is Found
Shall Servant be with me
And you have leave in peace to go,
unto your Father free.
24
Then Judah drew more near to him,
and said, O Lord I pray,
Geeue leave that I in my Lords Ears,
a Word or two might say.
25
And let not Lord, thy wrath be mooude
against me for the same:
For thou art even Equal in authority, or next unto the king.
as Pharao is,
in Dignity and Name.
26
My Lord a question did demand
of us thy Servants here,
Have you a father, yea or no,
or else a Brother dear?
27
We have a Father that is Old,
unto my Lord, said we:
And a young Lad which he begat,
the youngest Son is he.
28
In his old Age he him begat,
when hoarye was his head,
His Father loves him passing well:
his Brother now is dead.
29
And he alone of Mother his
is left with him to be,
Then thou unto thy Servant said:
do bring him unto me.
30
That I may also set mine Eye,
upon this Lad to see,
And then again unto my Lord
in this wise aunswerd we.
31
The Child, Ahlas, cannot depart,
his louinge father fro:
For if he should, his father then
would Dye with Grief and woe.
32
Thou saydst again: except you bring
your Younger Brother down,
I charge you see my face no more,
in Country, Field, or Town.
33
So to our Father when we came,
that now thy Servant is,
And showed him what my Lord had said,
would not agree to this.
34
At last our Father said to us,
go down again you shall,
And buy for us a little Food,
that we may live withal.
35
We answered, we cannot go,
unless you grant this thing,
Our younger Brother be with us,
before my Lord to bring.
36
For we may not the man behold,
except our Brother go.
Our Father said: Rahell, my Rahel bare to Jacob Joseph and Beni^min
Wife,
bare me two Sons, you know
37
And one of them went out from me:
and I for troth did say,
My Son in pieces small is torn, Cap. 37.44.

as he went by the way,
And I did never see him since,
the time he went astraye.
38
Now if you take this Son from me,
and Death likewise him have:
Then shall you bring my hoary head
with sorrow to the Grave.
39
Now therefore when I shall come to
my Father and thy Thrall,
And that the Child be not with us

Saying his life dependes upon
the Life of this young Lad,
When he shall see the Child not come,

And dye he will for Sorrow sure,

ah las we wayle the thing.
42
Doubtless, thy Servant Pledge became

And said, if that I bring him not,
the blame then will I bear.
43.
Therefore I pray, let me abide,

And let the Child-with Brethren go,

For your good Preservation,

And five Years more are yet behind,

Wherefore God has sent me before,
in this same Land to be,
You to Preserve, and keep alive,
and your Posterity.
And by a great deliverance,
your Lives have kept, you see.
11
Now then you hither sent me not,
but Albeit god detesteth Sin: yet he turns man's wickedness, to serve to
his glory.

does see before his Eyes:

It is my Mouth that speaks to you
Expounder have I none
And in such Language do I speak,
as is to you best known.
19
And therefore do my Father tell,
what Honor I possess,
And each thing else that you have seen,
the same to him express.
20
Then fell he on his Brothers Neck,
with Tears out from his Eyes,
And Benjamin fell on his Neck,
and Wept on him likewise.

And Joseph all his Brethren kyste,
and Wept on them also,
And afterward they spoke with him,

Go, Lade your Beasts and so depart,

and come again to me:
I will you give of Egypt Land

And you shall eat the Chiefest Fruictes,

And I command thee thus to do:
from hence you Charettes take.
For Children yours, and for your Wives,
and for your Father sake.
With speed go bring your Father here,
that we may merry make.
26.
As for your Uessels and your stuff,

His Brethren did as he them had,

And for their Journey victa^l gave,

14
Then Israel to Joseph said,
now ^et my life depart,
Since I have lyu'de thy Face to see,
and that alive thou art.
15
Then Joseph to his Brethren said,
and fathers Household all*
I will go up and Pharao show,
and tell him what is befall.
16
How Father mine, and Brethren eke,
with Housholdes all that be,
Are come from Land of Canaan,
to Goshen me, to see.
17
And that the Men but He was not ashamed of his Father and kindred though they
were of base condition
Shepeheardes are,
and for because of that,
Their Sheep and Cattle have they brought
and al what ever what.
18
And if that Pharao call to you,
and ask of you and say,
What is the trade that you do use,
or how spend you the Day?
19
Then shall you say: thy Servants are,
as Fathers them beforne.
In tending Cattle occupied,
since time that we were borne.
20.
That ye may dwell in Goshen Land:
for eu'rye Shepeheard is
Among th'Egiptians hated much,
as men that do amiss.

Jacob before the King is come,
and Pharao does him give
Leave for to dwell in Goshen Land,
all Days that he shall live.
And Jacob makes Joseph swear,
with hand under his Thye,
When he is dead, to burye him,
where as his Fathers lie.
THen Joseph came, and Pharao told,
my Father now from fa?
And Brethren mine, then sheep have brought
and now in Goshen a^e.
2
And to thement the king might see,
what kind of Men they were,
Joseph presented to the King
Five That the King might be assured they were come, and see what manner of
people they were*
of his Brethren there.
3
Then Pharao di^ demand of them,
What is your trade? (said he)
Thy Servants, Shepeheardes are, said they,
as Fathers our have be.
And for to soiourne in the Land
is cause we come to thee.
4
For Servants thine, no pasture have
to keep our Sheep withal,
So sore the Famyn in the Land
of Canaan is fall.
5
And therefore now we humbly pray,
thou suffer us to Dwell,
In Goshen Land where by thy Leave,
we hope for to Live well.
6
Then Pharo unto Joseph said,
I understand and see,
Thy Father and thy Brethren are,
come hither unto thee.
7.
Behold the Joseph's great modesty appears in that he would enterprise
nothing with out the kings commaundment.
Land of Egypt lies
all open before thy Face
And in the best part of the same,
do thou therein them place.
8.
In Goshen Land let them remain,
and Soiourne there and Dwell:
And if among thy Brethren be,
in prowess that excel:
9.
Let them be Rulers likewise made,
over my Flocks of Sheep,
And other Cattle that is mine,
in safety them to keep.
10.
Then Joseph unto Pharo brought
old Jacob Father his,
And Jacob there saluted him,
and did him also Bliss.
11
What be the Number of thy Years?
said Pharo to him then,
Says he, my time of Pilgrimage
is six Skore Years and Ten.
12
Few be the Days that I have liu'de*
and also very bad:
And I have not those years attaind,
that my Forefathers had.
13
And Jacob then did Pharo bless
and did depart him fro,
And Joseph with his Father went,
and left the king also.
14
His Father and his Brethren all,
he placed out of hand,
And gave them Ground for to possess,
in best part of the Land.
15
Even in the Land of Rameses,
as erst the King did say,
Of Goshen which a City was,
where Pharoes Exodus 1.
Treasure lay.
16
And Joseph did provision make
of Bread wherewith to feed
His Father, and his Household all,
his Brethren and their Seed.
And as young Some read that he fed them as little Babes, because they could
not provide for themselves against that Famine.
Children, were they fed,
Such was the time of need.
17
For in the Land was want of Bread,
the Dearth exceeding sore,
In Egypt, and in Canan Land,
was never like before.
18
So that by reason of the Dearth
these That is the Land of Egypt and Canaan.
Countries famisht were,
And Joseph gathered all the Coin
and Money that was there

For to be found, for Corn and Grain,

laid it safe in Pharoes house,
as faithful Servants ought.
20
So that when Money failed them,
that Corn they might not buy,
Th'Egiptians all to Joseph came,
and on him did they cry:
21
And said, our Money all is spent,
geeue us therefore some Bread,
For why should we before thy Face
with Famishment be dead?
22.
Said Joseph then, your Cattle bring,
if Money yours be gonne,
And I will give you Bread to eat,
enough for eu'^y one:
23.
So they their Cattle brought to him
Horses, and Flocks of Sheep,
Their Asses al, and Heardes of Beasts
they wonted were to keep:
24.
And for the same he gave them Bread*
so mutch as might suff^se
For one whole Year, and then again
they came, and said thus wise,
25.
We will not now b^ee from my Lord,
sith that our Coin is gonne,
And that my Lord our Cattle has,
and Herds of Beasts each one:
26.
There nothing is among us left,
in sight for to be found:
Except it please my Lord to have
our Bodies, and our Grownd.
27.
Why shall we perish in thy Sight,
both we, and eke our For except the ground be tilled and sovve^ it perishes

By reason that the Ground is free
from Labor of the Hand?
28.
Buy us, and eke our Land also,
and give us Bread therefore:
So will we bind our selves, and Land
to Pharo euermor^.
29.
And therefore give us Seed to sow,
that we man live: not dye:
All the Land of Egypt becam Pharos
And that the Land for want of Tilth,
should not in wast thus lie.
30.
So Joseph now bought all the Land
of Egypt for the King*
And every Man his Ground had sold,
and every other thing.
Because the Force of Famins power
them greeuous^y did wrynge.
31.
And he the People did By this changing they signified: that they had nothing
of their own but received al of the kings Liberality.

abroad from Place to Place,
Unto the Cities such as were,
and so in time and space
32.
They were remou'de from side to side,
or to the Borders end
O^ Egypt Land, thus Joseph did
abroad the People send.
33.
But yet the Land the Priests possessed:
toeyrs, Joseph did not buy:
For they upon King Pharoes charge
continually did lie.
34.
And had their ordinary food,
such as the King them gave,
Whereby their Land they kept unsold,
and to themselves did save,
35
Than Joseph to the People said,
behold you see this Day,
I for the King you and your Land,
have bought, you not denaye,
36.
Lo, here is Seed for you to sow,
g^e Ear and Till the Ground,
And of Increase of Grain and Corn,
that thereon shall be found,
37.
You shall the Fifth part give thereof,
to Pharow for his share,
The rest is youres for Seed to Sow,
and for your better fare.
38.
You may the same at will convert,
to use for Food or Meat,
For you and for your Households al*
and Children for to eat.
39*
Said they, thou have our Liu^s preserved,
let us s^tch Grace yet find,
As we may P^ar^es Servants be,
to do what shalb'assignd.
40.
Then Joseph made it for a Law
remayninge to this Day:
Except the Land of the Priests which was not Pharaoes.
That they the fifte part of increase,
should unto Pharo pay.
41.
And Israel in Egypt dwelt,
as you tofore hero tell:
And in the Country of Goshen
did Multiply right well.
42.
For they therein Possessions had,
and Grew exceedingly,
And Jacob there liu'de Seuentene Years,
and then did after dye.
43
An hundredth, Forty and Seven Years,
did Jacob live in all:
And so when as the time drew near,
that he from Life must fall:
44.
He called Joseph unto him,
and said as does appear:
Cap. 50.7.

But carry me and burye me,

Said Israel, then Swear to me:

12
Then Israel beheld the Sons
that Joseph to him, brought,
And said to him, whose Sons are these
which after me have sought?
13
Said Joseph then, they are my Sons
whom The faithful acknovvledge all benefytes to come of gods fre mercies.
God gave here to me:
Bring them to me I may them bless,
for scarsly can I see.
14
For why, the Eyes of Israel
were Dymme and Duske of sight:
So that he could not well behold
nor well discern the Light.
15
Then Joseph caused his Sons to come,
Jacob did them embrace:
And holding them upon his knees,
did Kiss them on the Face.
16
To Joseph then said Israel,
my Son, I had not thought
Thy face for to have seen: and yet
God has me hither brought.

And I have seen thy Seed also

Then Joseph took them from his That is to say, his two Sons from the Knees

Not so my Father, this is he

28.
His Father so refused to do,
as Joseph badde him tho,
But said, I know it well my Son,

So he them blessed that Day, and said,

And Jacob set the younger Son,

24
When you pretended ill to me,
God turn'de it to the best,
That he might bring such things to pass,
as this day is expressed.
25
And many People saved alive,
that else had now been gone:
Fear not therefore, I^e norishe you,
and Children yours each one.
26
So kindly unto them he spoke,
and entertaynde so well,
It was more comfort to their heart*
then any tongue can tell.
27
Thus Joseph and his Fathers house*
in Egypt dwelled still:
He lyu'de an Hundredth years and ten,
and then did Death him kill.
28
The Children yet of Ephraim*
did Joseph live to see,
Unto the third descent of them
by order in degree.
29
Likewise he Machirs Children saw,
Manassehs Son that was,
Whom Joseph brought up on his knees,
and thus it came to pass:
30
That Joseph to his Brethren said,
I ready am to dye,
And God will surely visit you,
as time the thing shall try.
31
And bring you safe out of this Land
unto the Land he swear
To Abram, Isac, and Jacob,
and ryd you so from care.
32
Then of the Children of Isrell
an Oath did Joseph take,
And said, He speaks this, by the Spirit of Prophecy, exhotting his
Brethren to have full trust in gods promise, for their deliverance.
God (sure) will visit you,
for his great mercies sake.
33
And you shall carry hence my boanes,
thus did he Prophecy,
Being an Hundredth years and Ten,
and in that Age did dye.
34
And after, they embaulmed him,
and put him in a Chest
In manner as his Father was,
so him, The Egyptians dressed.
