THE GROUND of Christianity, Composed in manner of a dialogue between PAVLE and
TITUS, Containing all the principal points of our Salvation in Christ.

1. Peter. 3. 15. Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always
to give an answer to every one that asks you a reason of the hope that is in
you.

AT LONDON; Printed by Robert waldegraue, and are to be sold at the sign of
the Bear in Paul's Churchyard, by Thomas VVoodcocke. ANNO DOM. 1584.

To the right Honorable Lord, Fraunces, Earl of Bedford, one of her may
sties most Honorable privy Council, Knight of the Noble order of the Garter:
A. G. wishes prosperity in this world, with increase of peace, mercy, and
grace, and in the world to come life everlasting.
ALbeit (right Honorable) the multitude of foolish Pamphlets, and frivolous
toys, which in these our days are put in print, have brought almost no less
contempt of the faculty of printing, then discouragement to those that woulds
write more waightye matters: yet I thought it in conscience good for me to be
no more thereby discouraged from attempting any thing, which may either tend to
the glory of God, or benefit of his Church, then for a man to be squaimish to
eat, because he has seen another surfeit. It could not come in my mind
(though it rolled too and fro toward many) unto whom to dedicate this rude
and simple work of mine, rather then unto your honor, whose just and most
deserved comme^dation, as well in matters of religion, as also in all other
politic affairs, as I spare presently to utter; (because to praise any man
to his face* does seem rather fained flattery, then pure love) so the truth
it self deuoid of partiality, can not unjustly conceal, nor injuriously
suppress. I could easily have procured unto my self many pulbacks, lets and
hindrances* from attempting so aduenturous an enterprise, had not the assured
knowledge of your Honors singular humility, in abasing your self to them of
lower degree; fully persuaded me to the contrary. Neither the worthiness of
the writer, (who is as bold as blind Baiyard) nor the excellency of the work,
(as it proceeds from so base a workman) deserves in any wise so excellent a
patronage, but in that it redoundeth to the repairation of the ruins of
Christ his Church, whereof as it has pleased the Lord in mercy to make you a
maintainer, so you will no doubt from Day to Day, and time to time, show your
self a notable favorer, yea, even of the smallest stones in the building,
which (because they be neither graven with curious work, or pollished with
exquisite art) though some do rashly condemn, yet I know your honor will
not reject* but rather will consider, that notwithstanding the chambers of
Christ's church are in some places a trimming up with beautiful work, yet in
some other places (the groundsell being scarce laid) strong oken Timber, so it
be sound, may do more good, then fine fur if it be weak. The work which
I make bold at this time to shroud under your protection, is brief and pithy,
framed in manner of a dialogue, handling all the chief points of Chrstianity,
with many additions, no less profitable then necessary, for those that desire
to be further instructed in many points, where I thought it most requisite and
convenient. All men, yea even the simplest, have need now to get assurance
of salvation to themselves, not by works without knowledge, (which bewrays
intolerable Hipocrisye,) but first by true faith grounded upon the rock of
Gods word, and then by works proceeding from the same; that they may be able
to give an account of their faith, and to stop the mouth of the adversary in
the day of trial. The false Apostles are already craftily crept in, which
seek to undermine unstable souls, wresting and writhing the scriptures to
their own damnation, whose judgment is just: for the Lord has sent them
strong delusions, that they should believe lies, that all may be damned which
believe not the truth, but have pleasure in unrighteousness, and as they have
not regarded to know God, so God has delivered them up to a reprobate mind,
to do those things which are not convenient. The chief respect and final end
of this my small labor, according to my poor Talent, is to help the simpler
sort, whom I know (the more is the pity) to be yet besotted with ignorance,
whom I seek rather to enstruct, because they be not skillful, then to
confound the adversary, who is very subtle. Wherefore I present this small
work unto your honor, as a token of my unfeigned good will, and great zeal
toward you, being ready at all times, and in all places to perfourm all
other duties, wherewith the Lord shall enable me, with no less fervent prayers
to the Lerde for your health of body to his pleasure in this life, then
cuntinuall supplications, for the placing of your soul and body in the
heavens, with our chief Lord and Captain Jesus Christ, among the angels and
blessed saints, in the life to come, of which joy the Lord make your honor,
and all those that love the c^mming of Christ* partakers, for the same Christ's
same. Amen.

Your honors most bounden; Alexander Gee.

A Christian man's duty. The reward of sin. The ground of Christianity. In
manner of a Dialogue, between PAVLE and TITUS.
PAVLE. WHat is the chiefest duty of a Christian man in this life.


TITUS. The chiefest duty of man, and not of man only, but of all the
creatures in the world, in their nature is to set forth the Genesis 1, 26. ephesians* 1,
6. exodus 9, 16. psa. 8, 1.
glory of God.


PA. How shall we perform this duty?


TI. To perform this duty it is necessary to know unto what death we by our
selves are subject, what great salvation God of his Dent. 4, 37 and 7, 7, 8*
ios. ^4. 2 psa 44. 3. ioh 15, 16. act. 13, 48, and 2^, 14. romans 5, 6, and 9,
11, 1^, and 11, 7, 35. 1. cor. 4, 7. ephesians. 1, 4, and 2, 10. colo. 1, 12. 2 timothy
1, 9.
free mercy has given unto us through faith, and what thankfulness we owe unto
him for our deliverance.


PA. Tell me these things in order, first, what is sin, and what does it
deserve.


TI. 1. Ioh 3, 4.
Sin is the breach of the law of God, contained in the ten commandments: and
the reward of this sin is eternal death.


PA. Rehearse the ten commandments.


TI. Exodus 20. 1.
God spoke these words and said, I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee
out of the land of Egypt. etc.


Honor one only God. Images forbid^en. PA. What means this commandment,
thou shall have no other Gods but me.


TI. The meaning of it is, that I should acknovvledge but 1. Cor* 8, 4, 6 ephe.
4, 5, 6 1 t^m 2, 5.
one only God, that I should Deuteronomy. 6, 13 math ^, 10.
honor and fear him, that I should Math 22. 37 mark. 12, 30
cleave unto him, that I should not do after the abominations of any Deuteronomy., 75
esaias. 30. 22.
Idolatrous people, to worship stocks or stones, that I should not zach. 13.
12 deuteronomy. 13. 2, 3.
hearken to any false Prophets, that teach their own fantasies, and not the
word of God: that I should not seek to Deuteronomy. 8, 10 and 18, 11, 12. esa. 8, 19.
acts 19. 13. gal. 5, 20.
any Sorcerers, coniurers, witches soothsayers, charmers, or any such: but that
I should harken unto Mark. 9, 7.
Christ alone, and add Reave. 22, 18 19. prou 30. 6.
nothing to the word which he has spoken, but put all my Ierem. 17, 5 and 18, 7.
trust in God alone, Romans 10, 13 psalm. 50, 16 2 timothy 2, 22
call upon him alone, Malac. 10 math. 10, 28 luke 12, 5.
fear him alone, and Math 10, 37 phil. 3, 7. 8.
love him above all.


PA. What means the second commandment that we shall not make any graven
image?


TI. In this commandment be contained three things: first* that we should
not think God to be like either Deuteronomy 4. 15 etc. act. 17, 27 esai. 40, 18, 25
esai. ^6. 3.
man or woman, gold or silver, or any other thing, and therefore that we make no
image of God in any case. Secondly, that only John. 4. 24.
in spirit and truth we worship God alone, and beside him none Psalm. 97, 7
esa^. 44, 19 dan. 4, 18.
other, no Saint, no Angel, no creature, and therefore that we make no image
of any other thing, either to worship the image it self, either God, Saint, or
Angel, by the image, neither Abac 2, 18 ier^. 10, 14, 16.
yet to this end, to be the better put in mind of God by the image. Thirdly,
that we worship not God in any Deuteronomy 12, 32 and 5, 32, ios. 1, 7
outward worship according to our own fantasies, but only as himself has
commaudded in his word.


PA. What means the third commandment, Oth^^ forbidden. The use of the
Sabbath. that we should not take the name of God in vain.


TI. God charge us in this commandment these three things: first, that
Deuteronomy. 28. 58 59 p al. 8, 1 iere. 10, 6 2 ^hro 29, 13
we use with most high reverence the name of God whenever we speak or think
upon him. Secondly, Deuteronomy. 18. 10 11, 12. esai. 8 19 and 47. 9 mal. 1, 3, 5 gal.
5, 20.
that we never blaspheme the name of God by coniuring, witchcraft, sorcery, or
charming, or any such like, neither by curssing nor banning. Thirdly, that we
never swear by the name of God in our common Math 5, 35 36. iam 5, 2.
talk, although the matter be neue^ so true, but with fear and reverence make
mention of the name of the lord our God, Esai, 48, 1
in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness, to Iosu. 2. 12. 2 2 cor. 1, 23 2
cor. 11. 31. gal. 1. 20.
the glory of God, or maintenance of brotherly love, or also before a Ex 22, 11,
12.
Magistrate, in witnessing the truth when we are thereunto lawfully called. In
which causes we must swear by the name of God lone, neither by heaven nor
earth, ler. 5, 7 and 22 16. amos 8. 14 ephe. 1, 5.
neither by ^ooke, Saint, nor Angel, nor any creature. As for Mass, Cross,
Roode, or such other, we ought so to detest such manner of Idols, that they
should not once be named among us.


PA. What means the fourth commandment, Remember thou keep holy the
sabbath day?


TI. The hallowing of the Sabbath day is, to rest from Deuteronomy 5, 14 exodus 16, 26*
our labor in our calling, and in one place to assemble our selves together,
and with fear and reverence, to hear, mark, and lay Math. 13, 23
up in our hearts the word of God Acts 20, 7 and 15, 21 and 13, 15 16. luke. 4,
16
preached unto us, to Math 18, 19.
pray altogether that which we 1 Cor. 14, 15
understand with one consent and at the times appointed 1 Cor. 11. 33 acts 2. 42
acts 20. 7.
to use the Sacraments in faith and repentance, and all our life long to Number. 29
7. heb. 4. 9. 10.
rest from sin and wickedness, that the Lord by his holy spirit may work in
us his good work, and so Superiors honorable. Murder. Adultery. begin in
this life that everlasting rest.


PA. What means the fifth Commandment, Honor thy father and thy mother?


TI. The meaning of it is, that we should honor, that is to say, love, fear,
obey, and relieve our Leuit. 19, 3. and 3, 20, 22, 23. ephe. 6, 1, 2, 3.
Patents, or any other that are unto us in their steed, as our Exo 2^, 28. romans
13. 1, tit. 3, 1.
Princes, Rulers, and Magistrates, Heb. 13, 17. 1. these. 5, 12. 13
our Pastors, and teachers, our Ephesians. 6, 5, 6, 7. tit. 2, ^, 10.
masters, and all other which are above us in any calling placed by God, the
Leui. 19, 32.
aged and grayheaded. And also all manner of superiou^s, that they may be
honorable, they must put on a fatherly affection: and show them selves in
deed parents in col. 3, 19, and 4 1. ephesians. 6, ^, 9.
defending and guiding their inferiors.


PA. The sixth commandment, Thou shall do no murder, what means this?


TI. First, the Lord God forbids us herein, all Genesis 6, 9. deuteronomy. 5, 17.
killing, Mat. 5, 38, 39
fighting, and Col. 3, 12, 13.
quarrelling, all Leu. 19, 14.
reproaches, mockes, and ^aunts. Secondly, he forbids all killing in heart,
that is, all Leuit. 19, 17, 18. mat* 5, 21. 22. 1. ioh. 3, 15.
anger, and malice, all desire of Pro. 20, 22
revenge. Thirdly, on the other side he commands us to preserve life by
exercising Math 25, 35. 36* esai. 58, 6, 7 ezech. 18, 7.
the works of mercy and compassion toward our brethren, yea even toward our
enemies. Fourthly, Math. 5. 44. leui. 19, 18. uk 6, 17. romans 12, 17, 18, 8, 13,
19.
to love one another inwardly in heart as our selves, yea even our enemies and
them that hate us.


PA. What means the seventh commandment, that we shall not commit
adultery.


TI. We are forbidden herein, first all Romans 18, ^0 Ieuit. 19, 29 deuteronomy 23, 17.
adultery, formication, and all other H^b. 22, 23 24.
uncleanness in our bodies. Secondly, all vnpure Much. 5, 28.
thoughts and lusts of the heart. Thirdly, all other things which might entice
us to such uncleanness, as all E^ai 3. 16, 17. romans 13, 13.
unchaste behavior, Ephesians 4, 29. ephe 5, 3, 4.
filthy Where dome forbidden. Theft forbidden. Lying forbidden talk and songs
Deuteronomy. ^2, 11. esai. 3, 1^, etc.
wanton apparel, lewd and idle pastimes, Ephesians* 5, 18.
gluttony, drunkenness, Deuteronomy 22, 20 21.
houses of open whor dome, and whatsoever else may allure to uncleanness.
Fourthly, on the other side he commands us to keep our bodies and souls 1.
Cor. 6, 15 19, ^0. 1. these. 4 3, 4, 5.
chaste and pure, as temples of the holy gho^te: or if the 1. Cor. 7, 2, 9 heb.
13. 4.
gift of chastity be not given us, to use the lawful remedy appointed by God,
which is marriage.


PA. What means the eight commandment, Thou shall not steal?


TI. In this commandment the Lord forbids all Leuit. 1^, 11 de^^, 5, 19.
ephesians. 4, 28.
stealing and robbing in outvvarde d^edes, all 1. Thessa. 4, 6
deceit, all Exo 22, 21.
lying and oppression, all Deuteronomy. 2^, 14 ^am* 5, 4.
withholding of the laborers hi^e, all Deuteronomy. 10, 19.
vn^urteousnesse to the stranger, widow, and fatherless, all Amos. 2, 6.
gifts to pervert judgment, all Leui. 19, 36. deuteronomy. 25, 13. p^ou. ^0, 10 mich
6, 11.
false measures, coue^ousnesse, and whatsoever vvrongfull dealing. And on the
other side, he charge us that we be content with that Pro. 27, 27 1 Timothy*
6, 6.
portion of goods which the Lord gives us* Genesis 3. 19. phe. 4. 28. 2. ^he^. 3,
10
to apply our selves in our vocation and calling, to get our own living, and
to live of that which is our own.


PA. What means the ninth commandment, Thou shall bear no falls witness
against thy neibour.


TI. Herein the Lord God does command us: First, that we should never speak pro
19. 5, 9 and 21, 28.
falsely in witness bearing. Secondly, that not only in witness bearing, but also
in no other matter we should, E^h. 4, 25. p^a 25, 1, 2.
neither lie, flatter, nor dissemble. Thirdly, that we should never ^^l false
tales psalm. 15, 3. pro* 25, 18.
behind our neighbors backs, nor ^ear them of others, that we should never
Math. 7. 1 ^am 4, 12,
believe any evil spoken behind their backs, until we fully know the certainty.
Fourthly, in private off^ntes to speak Light desires restrained. None can
fulfill the Law. nothing, although it be true, to the 1 Peter 4, 8 1 cor. 13. 7
pro. 11, 12
hurting of our brothers good name, if by Math. 18, 15 16, 17.
private admonitions he may be vvon. Fifthly, on the contrary side, we must
carefully and boldly testify all truth, whatsoever we know to the
futtherance of justice.


PA. What means the tenth commandment, Thou shall not covet thy neighbors
house?


TI. Here in plain words God forbids all inward Romans 7, 7.
desire whatsoever is unlawful to be done, which desire is not only
sinful when we Genesis 6, 5 and 8, 21. prou. 20. 9.
consent unto it, but the very motion is enemy to God and banished from his
presence, for it is impossible those bodies should see God, which can nourish
evil concupisences in them, even as it is impossible 1 Cor. 15, 50.
that corruption should inherit incorruption, or that flesh and blood in this
similitude of Ephe 4. 22 collos. 3, 9.
old Adam should inherit the kingdom of God. So that by this commandment,
most clearly we may see the image of that man that pleases God, even such a
one in whom is nothing impure, neither in will nor nature.


PA. Can thou fulfill all these commandementes, without breaking any one of
them?


TI. These are the commandments of almightye God, the perfect fulfilling
whereof, Rom 3, 23 24 and 8, 3, 4 and 11, 32 1 john 1. 8.
no fle^h can attain unto, no although I do all that I can, yet I break them
daily, both in thought, word, and deed.


PA. What punishment does God appointe for breaking any one of them?


TI. The punishment for the breaking of the least commandment even in Math.
5, 28
thought, yea if it were but Iam. 2, 10. gal. 3, 10.
once in all my life, is the heavy wrath of God, Reward of sin. God is
merciful and just. which has no end, and Deuteronomy* 27, 26. gal 3. 10.
his everlasting curse, which contains all the torments that can be devised
both of soul and body, and in the scripture is called by diverse names, to
express the pain, Math* 10 28. and 25. 41 mark. 9, 4.
as hell fire the Mark. 9. 44.
worm that never dies, utter Math 22. 13. math. 25. 30.
darkness, Apoc. 19, 20. and 20. 14.
burning lake, second Apoc. 20. 6 and 21, 8.
death, damnation, and such like.


PA. Now I know what is sin, even the breach of the Law of God, and because
of the excellencye of Gods majesty, which by sin is offended, I see the
greatness of sin, and how it deserves eternal death, of which without
exception, by nature we are guilty But tell me now, is there no punishmente in
this life, by which we may recompense our sin.


TI. There is no sufficient recompense in the world, no goods nor multitude
of riches, no liberality to the ^uk. 17. 10.
poor, no whipping, nor Col. 2. 23
scourging, nor hurt of thine own body, nothing that thou can devise, so
precious is the Psalm. 49, 8.
redemption of the soul, and the continuance for ever.


PA. Yea but God is merciful, will he therefore punish sin so sharply
think thou?


TI. God is in deed a God of all 2 Cor. 1, 3. psalm. 145, 8 psalm. 86. 15 psalm.
111. 4 and 116. 5 joel. 2 13. ion^s 4. 2.
mercies, and father of all consolations, whose loving kindness has no end,
and in the great riches of his compassions he has appointed to make known the
glory of his majesty unto his children: but God is also Psa. 7. 9 and 11. 7 8.
romans 3. 4 john. 3. 33 2 chro. 12. 6 ioh* 9. 19. esai. 45. 2^ apo^. 16. 5.
just, and judges righteously, and therefore of justice and truth, he must
punish such as through infidelitye despise the riches of his goodness, and
disobey the word of his glorious power, with that punishment which he has
appointed for sin.


PA. Seeing then this punishment must needs be suffered, are we in our selves
able to suffer and overcome How we may be delivered from Gods anger. Salvation
only in Christ. it.


TI. None is able to suffer and psalm. 130, 3 mal. 19, 25, 26. apoc. 6, 16, 17.
overcome this great punishment of sin, being only man.


PA. Since that sin has condemned us to eternal death without already in our
selves, tell me now how we may be delivered from the anger of God, and pains
everlasting.


TI. Mark and I will tell thee, pray unto God to give thee understanding, and
to be lovv in humility of spirit, I will declare the salvation of the Lord
when we had sinned, and by sin had Ephesians, 5, 5, 6 heb, 3, 17
provoked God to anger, and so were Act, 26, 18 1. cor, 15, 22.
subject to Satan, hell, and condemnation, that the righteousness of God might
stand, it was necessary that these things should be born and suffered, the
anger of God, the tyranny of Satan, and the pains of Hell, which all
follovved sin, and therefore he that shall be a savior for out sins, Gal. 3,
13. 2. cor. 5, 21.
he must take this upon him, and in his own righteousness he must be delivered
again from them


PA. For so much as the justice of God requires, that sin be punished in
the nature of man by which it was committed, tell me then, where shall we
find such a savior.


TI. The Lord psalm. 25, ^4 colo 1, 27.
lighten our eyes, that we may understand the Ephesians. 3, 18
riches of his glorious mist^ry, the Lord reveal his secret unto us, the Lord
make us s^e with all his saints, what is the height, the breadth, the length,
and the depth, that we may sing unto him the praises of al his mercies. This
savior who^ we seek for, who for our sins must taste Heb, 2, 9, 10
death, and yet in the power of Rom, 1, 4
his own righteousness must rise from death to life, he cannot be psa, 74, and
49 ^, and 146, 3, 4.
found amongst the children of men. All the righteousness The Union of the two
natures in Chris^e and causes of the same. Pze. 14, 14. romans 4, 1, 2.
of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, it cannot recompense the least of all my sins.
Adam and Eve, while they b Genesis 3, 16, 17
were yet in integrity, they could not bear the sin of the eating of one
apple which was forbidden them: yea the Jude. 6.
angels of heaven when they kept not their first estate, but Ioh. 8, 44.
fell away from the truth in which they were created, they could not bear
up their sin, but it 2. Pet. 2, 4.
vvayed them down to hell, and bound them for ever in the chains of darkness:
so that in men and angels there i^ no hope, but God that is Ephe. 2, 4.
rich in mercies and who^e compassions have none end, he sent his own son
in the Romans 8, 3.
similitude of sinful flesh to be a Redeemer, and to condemn sin in the
flesh, so that this is the Savior sent into the world, even Jesus Christ the
righteous, in Col. 2, 9.
whom the fulness of the Godhead does dvvell bodily, that when there was no
salvation in all creatures, God might 2. Cor. 5, 19.
be in Christ, and reconcile the world to him self.


PA. Seeing then the odds and variance is between the immortal God and
mortal man, and that the mediator betvveen them must needs have of the
nature of both the parties, which are to be agreed, and also have ageement
with both the parties, or otherwise he should have no mean to agree them,
show me the reasons thereof.


TI. As it was necessary that Christ should be Math. 3, 15. romans 5, 1^. 2. cor.
5, 21.
god, or else he could not have been so perfect righteous as the law of God
required, nor yet have borne the heavy burden of si^^ so it was also
necessary, that he should be 1. Tim. 2, 5. romans 1, 3, and 8. 2. g^l. 4, 4, 1,
10 2, 30. heb. 1, 10 11.
man, or else he had been righteous only to him self, and we through him had
not been sanctified: for it could not be that we should All shall not be
saved. What is true says. have been partakers of his grace, if he had not
been partaker of our nature; nor we could not have been free from the wrath of
God, and rigor of his law, except our nature in him had felt his fathers
anger, and he perfect man for us had been accurssed: For God had so appointed,
that the soul that had sinned, it should dye, and he is not Number. 23. 29.
like unto man that he should repent, but the word that he had spoken, he would
surely accomplish: and therefore that God might be righteous in his judgments,
Christ was man like unto us, and so in our flesh offered himself unto death,
as if he should have said unto his father, Execute, O God, thy judgments
against man; and Psalm. 40. 4 heb. 10, 7, 8.
lo, behold me a perfect man, I will be are them. And thus was our savior
Jesus Christ perfect God, that he might be stronger then Satan, and take sin
away and Luke 23, 47 romans 1, 3. 1. tim 15, 1. ioh. 4, 2. 1 pet. 2. 22.
perfect man, that we might have part of his redemption, who in all things
was like unto us, sin only excepted.


PA. Since Christ God and man has thus paid the punishment of our sins, are
we now all discharged before God?


TI. No, not every one shall be saved by Christ, but they alone that do
believe, and in a Ios. 3 16. 36.
true faith take hold o^ his mercies, which believers are discerned from others
by not vvalking Romans 8, 1.
after the flesh, but after the spirit.


PA. What call thou this true faith?


TI. This true and lively faith is a full Col 2. 2. 1 john 3. 2. ephesians, 3, 2 and
1, 18 rom 3. 38. 39.
persuasion and assurance of my Rom* 10. 9. ephe. 3, 17, 18.
heart, grounded upon the Romans 4, 3* and 10. 8 and 1* 16
promise of God, and wrought in me by the holy Ephesians. 1, 17, 18 1 cor. 1. 22 and
5, 5. 1 cor. 2 10 and 2, 4, 14.
Ghost, whereby I am fully assured that whatsoever Christ has wrought for man's
salvation, pertains Sins forgiven and punished. Christ's righteousnes^^ i^
ours* not only to others, but even to Ephesians. 3* 17* 18* 19.
me, and is wholy mine, as surely as if I my self had performed the same in
mine own person.


PA. How can it be that thy sins are forgiven thee, and yet according to
Gods truth, fully punnished with that punnishment which God has appointed
for sins?


TI. By this my true faith, I see my sins both to be forgiven, and yet fully
punished: for in Jesus Christ to satisfy 2 Corin. 5. 21. romans 3. 25. 26.
Gods justice, they be 1. Ioh. 2. 1. 2. galat. 3. 13. rom 4. 25.
fully punished, and yet to me they be 2 Cor. 5. 19.
^orgiuen, because in me they be not punished, but in Christ for me, to set
forth Gods mercy, and therefore shall never be laid to my ^sai. 50. 8. romans
8. 33.
charge. In this manner therefore I see the Lord my God to be most merciful and
just.


PA. Yea, but although the punishment of thy sins be paid in Christ, yet seeing
there can no unrighteousness dwell with God, how can thou stand before Gods
judgment seat as righteous, seeing thou haste no righteousness but such as is
stained with so many sins.


TI. I stand as just and righteous before the throne of God, not clothed with
mine own righteousness which I have wrought in mine own perperson, but
with the 1 Cor 1 30. 2. Corin. 5. 27.
righteousness of Jesus Christ, which righteousness being taken hold upon by
a Abac. 2. ^, romans 3. 28. ios. 3. 18. gal. 2. 16. and 3* 11. ephesians. 2. 8.
true and lively faith, is made mine. Thus am I just in the sight of God, not in
respect of mine own works which I have wrought, but taking hold upon
Christ's works to be mine by faith.


PA. Does not this make men run into all sin and wickedness.


TI. No, for this true faith, as soon as it is wrought The sum of our faith.
One God in distinct persons. in us through the holy Ioh. 3. 3. 5 ephesians. 4. 20*

detest, hate, loath, and abhor sin in all men, but specially in our selves,
and make us to have our whole Rom 5. 11.

us also to Romans ^. 11. 12. mat 7. 17. ioh 15. 5.
express the same in our life and conversation, or el^e it is no true faith,
but a Iam. 2 17.
dead faith.


PA. Rehearse the ^umme of this faith.


TI. I believe in God the father almighty, etc.


PA. Why m^kest thou mention of God the Father, God the Son, and God the
holy Ghost, seeing there is but one God?


TI. As the scripture teaches us most plainly that there is but one God, so
likewise it teaches us, that in this dinine essence three persons do subsist,
being in deed distinct in their several properties, the father, Ma^h 3. 16.
and 28. 19. 1. ioh. 5. 7.
the son, and the holy Ghost, which three persons are one God Act. 17. 22.
deuteronomy* 4. 12. 1. cori. 12. 11.
eternal, infinite and most perfect in it self. And when God shall give us
such eyes as shall be able to see the glorious majesty of his Godhead, then we
shall have also such heavenly wisdom as shall easily perceive the distinction
of the persons. In the mean while we will believe the truth of his eterna^l
word, and hate and detest all contraty heresies.


PA. God grant unto us all this sobriety. But tell me now, what beleeuest thou
concerning God the Father?


TI. First I believe that God the Father through Christ, into Io^. 1. 12. romans
8. 1. 11. galac. 3. 26.
whose body I am grafted by faith, is not only a Romans 8 25. 16 2 Corin. 6. 18.
father of other faithful, but even my father, and therefore loves Romans 5. 8.
9. ^s^. 54. 6. 7. 8.
me. Secondly, that he Christ God and man. Christ our Lord and Savior. is
almighty, that is, that he has all Esa. 45 5* 6. 7. 12 and 46 10. 11.
power in his hand, guiding and ruling all things, so that nothing can be done
in Amos. 3. 6. psa. 139. 7. 8. 9. 10.
heaven, earth nor hell, without his providence.


PA. What beleeuest thou concerning God the Son?


TI. I believe that Jesus Christ is one God, Romans 9. 5. 1. ^^h 10. 11.
in sub stance with the Father and the holy Ghost, took Romans 1. 3. math. 1. 20.
flesh of the virgin, and is become perfect man, as I am, in all things, sin
only excepted, Heb. 2. 14. 15
and in my nature has wrought for me whatsoever is needeful for my salvation.


PA. What means the name Jesus?


TI. Jesus is as much to say, a Math. 1. 21.
Savior, because he has saved his people from their sins.


PA. Why is he called Christ?


TI. Because he was ordained of the Father, and was anointed of the holy Ephesians
4. 7. ioh. 3. 34. luke 4. 18.
Ghost the highest prophet and Doctor, which has opened unto us the secret
counsel, and all the will of his Father concerning our redemption and
deliverance, and the Heb. 9. 26. 28. and 7. 25.
highest priest, who with one sacrifice and offering of his body, and no mo,
has appeased Gods wrath, bought us again, and continually makes
intercession for us to his Father, and a king which governs us by his word
and his spirit* and defends and keeps the salvation which we have gotten
by him.


PA. In what respect say thou that he is our Lord.


TI. Not only because we are his creatures, but chiefly because he buying 1
Cori. 6. 20.
again our bodies and souls from sin, not 1. Pet. 1. 18. 19. Act. 20. 28.
Apo. 5. 9.
with gold nor silver, but with Christ is our Lord. Suffered under Ponce Pilate.
Crucified dead and buried. his precious blood, and also delivering them from
the captivity and tyranny of the devil, to set them in full spiritual
liberty, and to lead and govern them as a spiritual king, and to make them
partakers with him of his heavenly kingdom, has Mala. 1. 6.
claymed us for his own proper Servant and peculier people, which he has
vvoon to him self, and can by right belong to none other Lord or master.


PA. What meanest thou when thou say, He suffered under Ponce Pilate.


TI. Because the manner of death which men do suffer by the sentence of the
Judge, and under the title of Justice, is more Deuteronomy. 21. 23. philip 2. 8. gal.
2. 13.
shameful, slaundrous, and terrible, then if a man should dye naturally in his
bed, therefore Christ took on him our person to show him self before an
Psalm. 2. 2. act. 4. 27. 28.
earthly Judge, and to be condemned by the Math. 27. 26. john. 19. 1. 13. 19.
mouth of Pilate, he being then Judge, that thereby we might be cleared before
the judgment seat of God.


PA. What meanest thou when thou say Christ was crucified, dead, and
buried.


TI. I mean that he paid the whole and full satisfaction for our sins,
which he took upon him he was bound, to unbind us, condemned to Esa. 53 12.
Romans 1. 8. 1. Pet. 2. 24.
deliver us; he suffered great and infinite shame, to deliver us from all
confusion; he was nailed Colos. 2. 14. luke 23. 33.
on the Cross, to fasten thereon our sins, he dyed and sustained the curse
and malediction which was Gal. 3. 13. 14.
due to us, to appease the wrath of God for ever by his only oblation once
made, he was Math. 27. 57. 58. mark. 15. 43. luke 23. 52. ioh. 19. 40.
buried to approve and verify his death, and to vanquish death, even to the
house thereof, that is to say, even to the grave, wherein he felt no
corruption, to declare How Christ de scended into Hell. that even in dying, he
had overcome and vanquished death.


PA. What meanest thou concerning this, that Christ descended into hell?


TI. I mean that (whether we do take this word Hell, for 1. Sam. 2. 6.
Psalm. 18. 4 and 9. 13 and 30. 3. act. 2. 24.
death it self, and for the extremest and greatest perils, dangers, and
griefs, dolors and anguishes, that a man can suf^er here in this world, and
whereby he may be brought unto his death, and consequently for 1. Cor 15. 55
the sling and power of death, for the judgment and wrath of God, and for the
bottomless pit of all miseries and calamities: when our Savior Christ was
so ou^ragiously dealt vvithall, when he did sweat Luk 22. 44.
blood, when his soul was heavy, even unto he Math 2^. 38.
death and when he was hanged most opprobriously, de^pitefully and haynously
betwixt two thieves, as Math. 2^. 46. psalm. 22. 1.
forsaken of God and all creatures, vvithour aid, help, or comfort, and so
hanging on a tree, did give up the ghost, bearing the cuisse, and anger of God,
which is a very hell, and feeling upon him the condemnation, pains and
torments that were due unto us for our sins) then wen the in deed down into
hell, which thought to ouervvhelme him, but it could not, because h^e was both
without sin, and also the true and natural son of God. And doubtless most
especially he descended into hell, when he did by his divine power make all the
elect, whose souls were in Abraham's bosom, to feel Ioh. 5. 25. 28. and 11.
25. 26. rom 14. 8. 9. Colo 1. 15. 14. 19. 20.
the efficacy, strength, and virtue of his death that he suffered for them, and
the fruits of his passion and bloudshedding. But on g 1. Pet 1. 19. Ioh. 8.
24. 1. cor. 15. 54. 55. heb. 1. 14. 15.
the other side, he went unto the hell of the damned, when they did feel and
understand through his The Fruits of Christ's death. Christ's resurrection.
Christ's ascension. godly might, that they were depryued of the merits of his
death and passion, and of the grace, health, and salvation, purchased unto his
elect and chosen children.


PA. What fruit haste thou by this death of Christ?


TI. First, I believe that this death and punishment which Christ suffered,
is Heb. 9. 12. 13. 2. 28. 1 pet. 2. 1. 1. ^ohn. 2. 2.
the appeasing of Gods wrath, and a full satisfaction to God for all my sins.
Secondly, that Galat. 5. 24. romans 6. 6. 7. 8. 11.
as he is dead for sin, so he will cause sin to dye in my mortal body.


PA. What pro^it have thou by the rising again of Christ?


TI. First, I am assured by his rising again from death, that he has 1. Cor.
15. 55. 56. romans 8. 33. 34. romans 4. 25.
overcome death, hell, and sin, and has finished my justification. Secondly,
that as he is risen from death, so he causes me as a member of him to Romans 6.
4. colos. 1. 2. 3.
rise from sin and delight in righteousness. Thirdly, he rising again by his
own power never to dye any more, is a sure pledge to me, that 1. Cor. 15. 16.
20.
my body shall in like manner rise again, and be quickened in him for ever.


PA. What is the meaning of this, that Christ ascended into heaven?


TI. Christ as touching his manhood is Act. 1. 11. and 3. 2.
only in heaven, but in his Math. 28. 20.
Godhead and comfort of his hol^ spirit he is with us to the end of the world


PA. What good gettest thou by the ascending of Christ into heaven?


TI. First Christ his ascending into heaven is a su^e pledge unto me, that Ioh.
14. 3. phil. 3. 21. collos. 3 4. 1. these. 4. 17.
I shall in like manner as a member of him, by his power be received into heaven
in the same nature wherein he is ascended. Secondly, Christ's ascension.
Judgment. Holy Ghost. Catholic Church. Christ having ascended into heaven
makes Romans 8. 34. heb. 9. 24. 1. Ioh. 2. 1. 2.
continual intercession for me.


PA. What is the meaning of this, that Christ sits at the right hand of the
Father?


TI. Christ sits at the right hand of the Father, that is, has Mat. 28. 18.
ephe. 1. 28. 21. 22.
all power given him of the father over all things.


PA. What fruit do thou receive by this, that Christ shall come to judge
the quick and the dead?


TI. To me that am a member of Christ, it is a singular comfort, Math. 24. 31.
and 25 34. luke 21. 27. 28. 1. The. 1. 10.
when I know that none shall be my judge, but he that is my Savior: but
terrible it will be to those that flee from Christ, Math. 25. 41. luke 21. 25.
26. 2. These. 1. 8.
when they shall see him come to judge them, whom they in their life time
refused to be their Physician and Savior.


PA. What beleeuest thou concerning God the holy Ghost?


TI. I believe that God the holy Ghost dwells in my heart, as the Romans 8. 9.
11. 15. 16. 17. gal. 4. 6. ephesians. 1. 17. 18.
seal of mine election, and persuadeth me that Christ's benefits are all mine,
and works in me that I dye unto Ephesians 4. 23 24. collos. 2. 11. 12. 13.
sin, and live unto righteousness.


PA Now tell me what call thou the Catholic Church?


TI. The catholic Church is the Romans 8. 29. ephe 1. 10. 11. 12. math. 16. 18.
ioh. 10. 16.
whole company of true faithful people, which ever were since the beginning
of the world in all places, which also be now, and shall be to the end of
the world: of the which number I believe that I am Rom 8. 16. 2. cor^n. 13. 5.
one, I believe that God 2. Tim. 2. 19.
knows them al, and has a most tender care over them, and that he has and
will Communion of Saints. Forgiveness of sins. Resurrection of the body.
take them all unto his ^lory.


PA. What call thou the Communion of Saints.


TI. The communion of Saints, is the society that we which believe have with
God, through Christ Jesus* and which all we have one with another, as 1. Cor
12. 13 and 10. 17. ephesians. 4. 15. and 5. 30. col. 1. 18. romans 12. 5.
members of our head Jesus Christ, whereby we are Luke 11. 28. gal. 6. 2 ph*
2. 1. 2. 3. 4.
ready to communicate al Gods benefits both spiritual and temporal, to the
mutual help and comfort one of another, according to the mea^ure of faith
which we have received of God in this life.


PA. What is it to believe the forgyuenesse of Sins?


TI. I believe that Jesus Christ has wholy 1. Ioh. 2. 2. col 1. 14. 19. 20.
21* 22. 1. Gor. 1. 30. esa. 53. 4. 5. 8. 12. romans 3. 23. 24 25. and 5. 8. ^.
Cor. 5. 19.
appeased God for my sins, and paid the full punishment due to them, and
therefore that they be freely forgyuen me, and shall never be laid to my
charge.


PA. What beleeuest thou of the resurrection of the body?


TI. I believe that after this life ended, my soul Eccles. 12. 7. Luke 16. 22.
and 23. 43.
shall go to God that gave it, and that my body shall rest i^ the grave till
the appointed time, and then I shall Job. 19. 26. 27. 1. Cor. 15. 42. 43. 1.
Cor. 15 53. 1. these. ^. 13.
see God in my flesh, I my self shall see him, and mine own eyes shall look
upon him, even in this body, made glorious and without al corruption like unto
the body of Christ


PA. What is that thou say of life everlasting?


TI. I believe that when God shall Job. 19. 25. Dan. 12. 2* Ioh 5. 28 (...)
11. 24. phil 3. 11. 1. the. 4. 14.
raise again this body, and join again in one, my body and soul, that then my
body shall be without al corruption, no more subject to any change, but that
Life everlasting. Of our self will. The Sacraments defined. death it self our
last enemy shall be taken away, and svvallowed up in victory, and I shall
live, so Luke 20. 36. apo. 20. 5. 6. romans 6. 11.
that I shall never dye. God strengthen us by his spirit in the inner man* that
we may be able to comprehend with all his Saints, what is the length, the
breadth, the height, the depth, that we may know the Law of Christ, and be
filled with all fullness of God


PA. The Lord increase this says in us. But tell m^, have we this faith in
our own power to believe of our self will.


TI. No, but says is the gift ^^h. 2. ^. phil^. ^. 29. 2* These. 1. 3. and 3. 2.
of God, even as our salvation likewise is, and of our selves there is not one
of us that can so much as name the Lord Jesus, but it is wrou^ht in (...) by
the holy Ghost Ioh. 17. 20. Romans 14. 17. 1. tim. 3. 15. 1 Cor. 1. 21.
through the preaching of the word, confirmed, and made strong through the use
of the same word and Sacraments.


PA. What call^st thou Sacraments?


TI. Sacraments be Genesis 17. 11. Exodus 12. 3. 4.
outward signs ordained of God for the greater assurance and strengthening of
our faith, being unto us Rom 4 11.
sure pledges of those benefits of our salvation which we receive in Christ to
be outs, and are represented unto us ^y the outvvarde signs of water in
Baptism, and bread and wine in the Supper. They serve also for a mark of
our profession, whereby we differ from other people which be heathen.


PA. How many Sacraments be there?


TI. There be two 1 Cor. 10. 1. 2 ioh. 19. 34.
Sacraments, that is to say, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord.


PA. What strength of faith have we through our Baptism?


The use of Baptism. Of the Lords Supper. TI. Baptism is a seal and token by
which God will have me assured that Mark. 1. 4. act. 21. 16.
my sins are forgiven me, and that my life is acceptable in his sight* for as
the water vvasheth away the filthynes of the body, even so should I through
the holy Ghost be thereby fully certified that the Act. 22. 16. ephesians 5. 26. tit.
3 5. 6. 1. Pet. 1. 2. and 3. 21. 1. job. 1 7. 8.
blood of Christ being sprinkled upon my soul by the Act. 15. 9.
hand of faith, has vvashed away both the giltinesse of my sin, and the
punishment due to the same. And as after our outvvarde vvashiug the body is
more comely, so after our Baptism the spirit of God works in us that sin
Rom 6. 3. 4. 5. 6. etc.
is dead in our mortal bodies, and we be risen up into 2. Cor. 5. 17. gal. 5.
24. 25.
newnes of life, and in whom soever baptism has not this work, he may well
have the name, but in deed he is no Christian.


PA. What strengthening of our says do we find in the use of the Lords Supper?


TI. The Supper of the Lord does through the holy Ghost strengthen my faith,
that I should not doubt, but as surely as I receive the bread, and wine into
my body to become of perfect substance with my flesh, 1. Cor 1. 30. and 10. 16.
so Christ has given him self wholly to become mine, and nourishes my soul
to everlasting life, Romans 4. 25.
his death and passion is my deliverance from sin, his 2. Cor 5. 21.
righteousness is my justification: even so surely confirmed unto me, as if I my
self had performed in mine own body that most holy obedience unto his father,
which he alone fulfilled. Thus I receive the Sacraments as signs and seals
of the righteousness that is by faith.


PA. Are not then the bread and wine in the Supper of the Lord, turned into
the body and blood of Christ?


No transubstantiation. Preparation to the Lords Supper. TI. The bread and
wine as touching their nature and substance, are Mat. 26. 29. mat. 14. 2^ 1.
cor. 1^ (...) 1^. and 11. (...) 2^. 28.
not turned, but as touching the use of them, they differ from common bread and
wine, in that they are appointed of God to serve unto us as Romans 4. 11.
seals and pledges of those benefits which Christ to his body wrought for us.


PA. Now then for as much as the Lords Supper in respect that it is holy, it
must have the guestes holy, and it refuses them that be profane, and in
respect that it is mystical, it must have such guestes which are able by their
well practiced senses, to distinct the inward mysteries from that which
appears to the eyes: and in that it has a remembrance, it requires a
mindful heart of the good turn received. Tell me therefore in what manner
ought thou to prepare thy seife to the receiving of th^se mysteries?


TI. In preparing my self to receive the Supper of the Lord, I ought
diligently to observe these three things. First, to 1. Cor 11. 28
examine my self whether I 2. Cor. 13. 5.
stand in says or no, which I shall know if I feel my 2. Cor. 1. 21. 22. and
5 5. ephesians 1. 13.
heart Romans 8. 15. ephesians 3. 12.
assured by the spirit of God, that the 1. Ioh 1. 12.
puni^hment of my sins is fully discharged in Christ: and that whatsoever he
has done perteyneth not only to others, but even Esai. 53 6. 7. 8. 9. etc.
ephesians 3. 17. 1. tim. 15 16.
to me. Secondly, to examine my self, whether I find my self inwardly 1 Cor.
4 4. ioe. 2. 12. 13. mat 26. 15. 2. co^. 7. 10. 11.
sorry for my sins, with an inward hatred and lothing of sin, and an Rom 6.
4. 5. 6. 7. 8. and 8. 11. phi. 3. 13. 14.
earnest desire and sure purpose wholy to conform my self to the will of
Gods word. Thirdly* i^ any offense be betwixt others and me, that I Mat 5. 23
24.
reconcile my self unto them. All these things, although they ought earnstly
to be considered in the whole course of our Lu. 1. 74. 75.
life, yet Our works imperfect. True causes of well doing. then especially when
we come to the Supper of the Lord.


PA. Since that this is then the doctrine of salvation, that when we were dead
through sin, God of his great mercy sent his son to be made man, to dye for
our sins, and to fulfill all righteousness, Math. 315.
that he might bring again life into the world, and so give that life unto
every one whosoever should receive the holy Ghost to believe, that so we might
be saved by faith, who before were condemned by our works. VVhereto then now
serves our weldoing, or what avails it to do good works?


TI. True it is, our good works deserve Esai. 64. 6. pro. 35. 7. psalm. 16 2.
nothing at Gods hand, for in his sight our good works are not good, and all
our righteousness is like a defiled cloth, and were they never so many, yet
by them God receives nothing at our hands, and all our well doing extends
not unto him: and therefore if we will ask any thing by works, we must
ask of them of whom we have de^erued it, at the hands of God we can ask
nothing, and therefore as touching merit, we will let our works alone, but we
have greater causes of well doing, and which ought more to enforce us, then
either life or death: we must do well, first to shevve our thankful Romans 6.
11. 12. and 12. ^. 1* pet. 2. 5.
hearts to our Savior Christ, and to testify our love toward him, with
keeping his commandementes: by which works, we make our election more
certain unto our selves. Again, we ought to do well, that our example may
call our brethren unto righteousness that they also may become with us of the
household of faith. But the greatest cause of all other is, that in our
vveldoing we ^et forth the Mat. 5. 16. 1. Cor. 6. 20. 1. pet. 2. 12.
glory of God, and What is required in good works. Five things to b^ obs^r^ed
Prayer. his holy name is praised in our good works. This ought to be so
precious in our eyes, that ten thousand helles and heavens should not so much
move us. This is the excellency of verue, that God in it is glorified, and this
is the great horror and confusion of sin, that God in it is dishonored.


PA. What works, call thou good works?


TI. Our good works can never be good and acceptable in the sight of God,
unless in doing them, we keep these two things: first, that they be framed
according to the Ephesians 2. 10. Colo. ^. 20 21. tit* 1. 14 deuteronomy. 12. 32. ^sai.
29. ^3. mat 15. 9.
will of Gods laws and commandments. Secondly, that they proceed from an
heart Romans 24 23. heb 11. 6.
purged by faith. If either of these two points be lacking, our works are
abominable in the sight of God, although they appear never so glorious in the
sight of men.


PA. Because prayer is our especial means which God will have us use to
increase in faith, tell me what belongs to true prayer?


TI. It is requisite in true prayer, that we observe these five things.
First, that we make our prayers Psalm. 56. 15. and 81. 9. romans 10. 13. ^am. 1.
5. math. 4. 10.
only to God Ioh 14 13. and 15. 16. and 16. 23.
through Christ, and not to Saints. Secondly that we be inwardly 2. John. 5 14.
Ioh. 4 23 24. Psalm. 51. 17. and 145. 18. 2. ero. 20 12. math. 1. 7. rom 8. ^6.
touched with the need of the thing we ask, having our mind wholly bent
thereupon, and not carried away with bye thoughts. Thirdly, that our prayers
be grounded upon ^am 1. 6. math. 11 24. 1. John. 5. 15.
Gods promises, with full assurance that they shall be granted, so far as the
Lord does know them to be meet and needful for us. Fourthly, that we Luk
18. 1. 2. 3 ande romans 12. 12. 1. these. 5. 17. Col 4. 2. ephesians 6. 18.
continue in prayer although we obtain not our requests as the first. Fifthly,
that we ask not those things which we think ^am. 4. 3. romans 8. 26.
good in our own fantasy, but 1. Ioh. 5. 41.
only that which God commands The Lord Pr^yer. The manner and order how we
should ^ra^. us to ask of him, all which things be contained in the Math. 6.
9 luke 11. 1. 2.
Lords prayer*

TI. Not only to kindle 1. Pet. 5. 11. apoc. 17. 12.
in our hearts, to desire the glory of God, but also to teach us that this
prayer is grounded upon none other then God only, and that we should not
think the kingdom of God to be vveake and void of force and might. Also
that he only is to be honored, praised, and glorified, and that his power is
infinite, perpetual, and everlasting. And in this word, Deuteronomy. 27. 15. 1. chro.

God, and our hope is confirmed, that those things which we ask are granted
unto us, by which our consciences are pacified, and so we end our prayers.


PA. Tell me now briefly the effect of all that thou have confessed.


TI. By the ten commandments I see my sin, and how I have deserved the
wrath of God and everlasting damnation, from which because I could not be
delivered by mine own strength, the holy ghost by the preaching of the
Gospel, has wrought in me, faith in Christ my Redeemer, A Godly Prayer. by
which I am assured that he has borne the punishment of my sins, and made
me heir with him of everlasting life. And of this that I should never doubt,
he has given me two Sacraments, as outvvarde signs and tokens to be seen and
felt of me, that as surely as I see my self made partaker of them outwardly,*
so the holy ghost inwardly instructing me, I should not doubt but inwardly
to be partaker of Christ him self, with all his benefits, that in him and
through him, I shall have life everlasting. And thus being regenerate by the
holy Ghost, my vvayes should be directed by the same spirit, to walk in
righteousness and holiness all the days of my life.


FINIS.
A Prayer containing the effect of that which goes before.
ALmighty God and most merciful Father, I see in thy blessed laws and
commandments, the greatness of my sin, and the dreadful punishment due for
the same, yea 1. King. 8. 46. 2. chron 6 36. eccle. 7. 21. 1. john* 1. 7.
I see (O Lord my God) the whole course of my life to be almost nothing else
but a continual breaking of thy holy laws and commandments The thoughts of
my heart either in vanity or else in open wickedness, are in number infinite,
and through the abundance of them my mouth is daily provoked to speak, and my
body stirred up to do and execute contrary to thy holy will. A Godly Prayer.
And again (O Lord) I see thy heavy wrath, vengeance, and judgment against
sin to be intolerable, so that the least wicked thought and most secret
cogitation of my heart procures thy wrath and curse, which have none end,
the torments of hell, and everlasting fire, yea although in all my life I had
but once in thought broken any one of thy commandments. Exodus 20. 5. luke 18.
7. 8. psalm. 5. 5. 2. cor. 6. 14.
And I know, O Lord God, that thou art true and just, and can not abide sin
and wickedness, but vvilt justly punish every sin with the self same
torments of hell which thy justice has appointed. This O Lord my God,
throws me down and amazeth me, so that I know not what to do. I look
into my self vievving mine own power, whether I am able to overcome this
punishment of sin or no, and I see that the most cruel and paynefull
punnishmente that I can devise to my self, as in whipping my body all the
days of my life, wearing hair cloth, pining my self with fasting, or any
other pain. I see, I see, (O Lord) that all this punishment is not sufficient

overcome this horrible punishment of sin. I look to men in this world,
even to them that challenge to themselves the titles of holiness and hye
perfection, but alas, I see no remedy in them, I find no difference, for all
are in like fault and condemnation, al have gone out of the way, al are made
altogether un profitable, there is none that does good, no not one. All by
nature are the children of wrath, all are as A Godly Prayer. Esa. 119. 167
sheep going astray, and therefore have need to turn unto the chief
shepherd and hye bishop of their souls. Thus vevving the whole race of
mankind, alas! I see no hope among the children of men, for all their
holiness, righteonsnesse and perfection, is not able to satisfy for one of
the least of their own wicked thoughts, much less for mine or others,
seeing the punishment is by thy just decree and sentence thy everlasting
curse. Wherefore I am driven from my self, and all that I can do to ^eeke
this punishment ^ischarged othervvhere, or else to quayle and perish for ever,
under the heavy burden of sin, I see there is no hope for me in An gelles,
Saints, and mortal men, but only in that perfect man Christ Jesus thy dear
son, in whom I see the full punishment of my sins fully paid, satisfied,
discharged and overcome. In him I see death vanquished, the pain of hell in
victory svvallovved up, the curse satisfied, and the eternity of the
punishment through his everlasting power ouerreached: This I see, O Lord, by
the eyes of says, being through thy holy spirit fully assured, that all the
whole punishment of sin paid by my Savior Christ, is not only paid for
other men, but also for me and my sin. This assurance of my faith being thy
only work in me, I beseech thee in mercy to strengthen and Luk^* 17. 5.
increase, for I feel it often full of wavering and doubting. Grant that I
may daily more and more in my soul and conscience feel my self knit and
grafted into the body of thy son, vvherby I may be assured that what soever
he has done, pertains to me, and is fully and wholy mine, that I may
through the power of his death, feel sin A Godly Praeyer. Romans 6. 6. 7. 8 and

daily die in me, and through the power of his resurrection feel my self
risen from sin, to have my full joy and comfort in those things which be
agreeable to thy holy will and commandments, utterly hating and abhorring

even in this life, I may still look for thy blessed hope and Act 17. 31. 1.

What it is to give glory to God. PAVLE. WHat is it, I pray thee tell me, to
give glory to God?


TITUS. No man can yield true glory unto God, without the true knowledge of
Christ. 1. Cor. 20. 31 ephe. 4* 3. 21. judge. 15. apoc. 4. 9. and 5. 13. and 19.
7.
Verily man was created to this end, that he should glorify his Creator. But
through the fall of our first parents, it came to pass that neither he knew
God aright, Romans 1. 20. 21
no^ glo^ified him aright. If thou demand what it is to give glory unto God:
to give glory unto any body, is nothing else but to attribute true virtue unto
him, as when some King deals justly vvis^ly, valiauntly, and mercifully, his
subjects yield him glory, that is to say, his subjects like well of his
doings, and with singular good vvi^l do blaze them abroad. And in like wise
is Joshua. 7. 29. 1* sam. 6 5. ioh 9. 24. VVisdome of God.

Job 12. 13. rom 16 27. iere 51. 15. Righteousness of God.

glory given unto God, when his virtues are rightly acknowledged and felt, as
his wisdom, his righteousness his puissance, his mercifulnes, his truth, and
such others. The wisdom of God is seen in this, that he repaireth again men
whom he had created to his glory, so as he might be his son borne of a
virgin, recover again the image of God, which he had lost through sin, and
so give glory to the wisdom of God. His righteousness is seen by this, that he
would not receive into favor man that had sinned without amends made for the
wrong that he had done, for where as it was of necessity that either man must
have perished everlastingly for his sin, or else that some one of mankind
must have made satisfaction unto God, abiding punishment for all What it is to
give glory to God. mankind, God gave his own Son, who taking manhood upon
him, has in the same satisfied the righteousness of God, and therefore is the
pra^se of righteousness vvorthily attributed to God, for the birth of Christ our
Lord. Fortitude of God.

Genesis 3. 15. nehem. 9* 30. esai. 28. 2. and 49. 26. iere. 50. 34.


His puissance is commended in that he has through Christ overcome the
Serpent and his seed, yea and rooted out his kingdom, so far forth as
petteyneth unto all them that take hold by faith upon this Jesus that is
borne. Mercy of God.

Psalm. 145. 8. jonas. 4. 2. esai. 55. 7.


His mercifulnes shines in this, that by his son, and for his sons sake,
he takes again into favor mankind forlorn and oppressed by the tyranny of
the diu^l, and overwhelmed with exceeding great miseries, calamities, death,
hell* and damnation. This mercifulnes of God exceeds all the works of God,
which both the good Angels and elect men shall set out euerlastinglye: yea, and
the very devils shall acknowledge, though against their wills. His truth is
made manifest in this, that bearing Gods truth. Psalm. 100. 4. and 117. 2. and
119. ^0.
in mind his promises of old time, he performs that which he had promised
long ago: for at such time as our first parents fell into sin, he promised
them the Genesis 3. 15. galat. 4. 4.
seed of the woman, which should tread down the head of the serpent, and
this promise he fulfilleth now in giu^ng us his son. For these virtues
therefore glory is to be given to God, and God glori^ied.
that especially by those that feel his benefits. This glory is then rightly
yielded unto him: A General Faith. The meaning of the word Symboll. knowledge
of him.


PA. What is the meaning of the word Symboll?


TI. A Symboll by interpretation is a badge, mark, vvatchvvord, Ioh. 13. 35.
toke^ or ensign of acknovvledging, whereby the Soldiers of one side are
known from the enemies. It signifies also the part that is gathered of every
man in any thing, as when every man gives his shot. This conf^ssion of says
is called by this name, for these two causes.


PA. What difference is there between general and true faith?


TI. General Faith. Iam. 2. 19.
The general faith is that which crediteth the word of God, that is, which
believes al those things to be true that are contained in the Scriptures
concerning God his incomprehensiblenes, power, righteousness, vvisdome, mercy
toward the faithful and godly, and most earnest severity tovvard the
unbelieving and ungodly, and likewise al other True Faith. 1. Tim. 5.
things taught in the Scriptures. But the true faith goes further, as I shall
show by and by, for thus far not only ungodly men, but also the very devils
do Iam. 2. 19.
believe, and therefore neither are they in deed Of true Faith. faithful, nor
are so called. But the true faith, as it nothing doubts that al things taught
in the word of God are most certainly true, so does it also embrace the Genesis
15. 6. rom 4. 3. 23. heb 11. 11.
promises made concerning the mercy of God the father, and the forgiveness of
sins to the faithful through Jesus Christ, which promises are properly
called the Gospel, which faith whosoever have, they do not only fear God
as the most mighty Lord of all, and the most righteous judge, which the most
part of the ungodly and the devils themselves do, but also they love him as
their most bountif^ll and merciful father, whom as they travel in all things
to please, as becomes obedient children, with godly endeavors and works
which are called the fruits of faith, so have they Ephesians. 3. 12.
a good and sure hope of obteining pardon through Christ when as men they
svvarue from his will, for they know that Christ whom they trust upon,
appeasing the wrath of his father, their sins shall Rom 4 8. psalm. 32 1.
never be impured any more unto them, then if the same had never been
committed, and though them selves have not satisfied the law, and their du y
toward God and men, yet believe they that Christ with his most full
observing of the law, has abundauntly satisfied God for them, and are
persuaded that by this his righteousness and observing of the law of God,
themselves are accounted in the number and state of the Rom 8 16. heb. 10. 22.
23. 1 Ioh 4. 13. 19.
righteous, and that they are beloved of God, even as if themselves had
fulfilled the law. And this Romans 3 22 and 4. 9. gal. 2. 16. ephesians. 2. 8.
is the justification which the holy* Scriptures declare that we obtain by
faith. These things can not be in the devils or in wicked men, for though
they fear, or rather with horror do dread Additions. Faith defined. Adam and
Christ opposed. God as most mighty and righteous, for that they know he
will take vengeance of their ungodliness, yet can they neither have any trust
in his goodness and mercy toward them, nor any recourse to his grace, nor
enter into any endeavor to obey his will. Therefore their faith, although they
doubt not of the truth of the word of God, is Iam. 2. 26.
called a dead faith, for that like a dry and dead stock it never brings
forth any fruits of Godly life, that is of love to God and charity toward
men.


PA. What is true faith?


TI. There is but Ephe. 4. 5.
one faith or confidence in God, which faith is the Math. 13 11. and 16 17.
mark. 9 23. 24. luke. 17. 5. john 1. 13. and 6. 44. 65. acts. 16. 14. and 22.
14. romans 12. 3. 1 cor 2. 5. ephesians. 2. 8. and 6. 23. philip ^ 29. colloss. 2. 12.
2. these. 1 3. and 3. 2. hebr. 12 2. 2. pet. 1. 3. 1. john. 5. 20.
gift of God, even as our salvation likewise is. This faith is not the only
bare notice or acknowledge of God and the historye of the Gospel, but the
assured consent and undoubted belief of the heart, to and in the promises of
God, in the which forgiveness of sins, the favor of God, quietness of
conscience, the holy ghost, righteousness, victory against sin, death, and
hell, and finally everlasting life, are freely offered, and most truly given
through Christ. Man made after the image of God, did fall from that blessed
estate, to the condemnation of him self and all his posterity, and Christ for
man being thus fallen, did oppose himself to the justice of God a mediator,
paying the ransom and price of redemption for Adam and his whole posterity
that refuse it not. Again, like as al Romans 3. 10. psalm. 14. 1. 3. and 13. 53.
they that be borne of Adam, do taste of his malediction, though they tasted not
his apple; So all that be borne of Christ, which is by faith, take part of the
obedience of Christ, although they never did that obedience them selves which
was in him.


Christ's Prophetical office expounded. PA. What signifies this word Christ?


TI. Christ signifies John.. 3. 34. ephesians. 4. 7.
anointed, and because that in the ancient Church of Israel, the Prophets,
Kings, and sacrificatours were anointed by the ordinance of God, in testimony
of their vocation and office, they were called by that name, and likewise
because they were true sigures of the very anointed of the Lord, which is the
very son of God, which was anointed by the holy Ghost, who was given to him,
without measure above all other me^: Ioh 3. 34. ephesians. 4. 7.
and Jesus Christ was also named with that name, as well because of the same
unction, as because that al those offices were enjoined him by the father.


PA. What difference put thou between the office of a Prophet of Jesus
Christ, and other Prophets?


TI. First it is, that God has not spoken in his church in the person of
Jesus Christ only, Heb. 1. 1. 2. deuteronomy. 18. 15. math. 21. 11. luke. 3. 16. ioh
6. 14. and 7. 40 and 9. 17. acts 3 22. and 7. 37.
in the manner that he has heretofore spoken by his Prophets in sundry sorts
more cou^^t and dark, but has spoken by his own son plainly and with an
open face, and has showed unto us by him the doctrine of salvation so fully and
Psalm. 22 23. math. 22. 16. and 23. 23. 8. 10. ioh 1. 18. and 3. 2. and 13. 13.
and 17. 6.
perfectly, that we may not attend any other perfection in this world, that none
may add any thing more unto the doctrine that he has brought, and that none
ought from that time forth to look for any more ample or perfect
revelation and manifestation of the will of God. Secondly it is, that Jesus
Christ is not a Prophet, having none other power but to show forth the word
of God by word of mouth, as the other Ministers of the same do, but beside that
he has the power to Luke. 24. 32. ioh. 17. 6. romans 15. 18. 19. 2. cor. 12. 9.
heb. 1 3.
imprint the same in their hearts, by the virtue of his holy spirit, and to give
it Math. 7. 28. mark. 1. 22.
virtue The union of two natures in Christ, and causes of the same. and
efficacy in them. And therefore in as much as he is man, he has planted and
watered by his outvvard ministry, but in that that he is very God he has
also power to give the 1. Cor. 3. 6.
increase, and does daily give it by the ministry of his servants, and in so
doing he does there daily the office of a Prophet.


PA. Why must Christ our mediator be of two natures?


TI. It is necessary that the same mediator should be very God and very man
together in one very person, chiefly for three causes. The first is, that if he
had not been very Genesis 3. 15. esaias. 11. 10. romans 15. 10. galat. 4. 4. john. 1.
14. romans 1. 3. romans 8. 2. romans 9. 5. 1. corin. 1. 30. heb. 1. 10. 11. math. 3.
15. romans 5. 18. 2. corin. 5. 21. coll^ss. 1. 22. tim 2. 1. 5. 1. john. 4. 2.
man, he could not have suffered in our flesh and nature, that which he has
suffered and was to suffer for us, where upon this inconvenience would
ensue, that he should not have borne for us in our nature and flesh, the
wrath and curse of God which we had deserved, and then he should not have
satisfied the judgment of God through his obedience: to put away by the same
in our flesh and nature the rebellion, by the which we have deserved his
judgment. Secondly, if he had been but only man, and had not been united
with God, being very John 1. 14. esaias. 9. 6. iere. 33. 16. acts. 20. 28.
romans 9. 5. galat. 1. 12. philip. 2. 6. titus. 2. 13. 1. john. 5. 20.
God and very man in one very person, he could not have been able to bear
this burden of the wrath of God, which is so great and importable, but that
he should have been svvallowed up, how just or innocent soever he should have
been. Thirdly, he should not have been able to have brought salvation and
life to man, if he had not had the fountain in him self by mean of his
divine nature. Mat. 18. 28. luke. 1. 21. 32. 55. 42. 43.
Finally, they be so united together, that they remain alvvayes in their very
nature, in Diverse sorts of Sacrifices. one very person: and being so united,
they (...) us not two Jesus Christ's: to wit, the one God, and the other man,
but one only, which is very God and very man, together in one only person,
as the body and soul of man make one only man, and one only person, and not
tvvaine, for there is not one Jesus Christ, which being but only God, could
have saved man, but could not have dyed for them, and another being but only
man might die for them, but could not have power to save them, nor to bear
the judgment of God for their sins.


PA. Though the Sacrifices of the old law be ended, and though Christ's
Sacrifices be a full and perfect satisfaction for our sins, does there now
remain no other Sacrifices in the time of the Gospel?


TI. Yes, the scripture calls the children of God a holy 1. Pet. 2. 5. Genes.
5. 10. and 1. 6.
priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable unto God by Jesus
Christ, by whom we offer the sacrifice of righteousness, and the Sacrifice of
Psalm. 4. 5.
faith. Moreover, the Lord has promised that he will not refuse the sacrifice

broken heart. And they also do offer Sacrifice to God, that offer praise and
thanks giving, which is the fruit of the lips that confess his name. And
the prayer of the faithful is as incense* Heb. 13. 15. psalm. 41. 12.
and the lifting up of their hands, is as evening Sacrifice. The Lord refuses
the old ceremonial Sacrifices of the law, but he requires Mat. 1^. 17. Ose.
6. 6. 1. Sam. 15. 2^.
mercy, and knowledge of God and obedience in their stead. Also to do good and
to distribute Heb. 13. 16. phil. 4. 18.
to give alms to the maintenance of the Minister, and of the pore, are a sweet
smelling savor, and a sacrifice acceptable and pleasant to God. Who may
sacrifice for sin. And Saint Paul in the twelfe to the Romans says, I
beseech you brethren, by the mercies of God, that you give up your bodies a
living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable
serving of God.


PA. What Sacrificer may offer Sacrifie for sin?


TI. There is none other true and perfect Sacrificer, which may offer unto God
perfect sacrifice, to make an agreement between him and mankind, but Jesus
Christ only, for so much as he is perfect and without sin. Esa. 43. 11.
ose. 13. 4. iere. 17. 5.
Beside which reason, this is also to be noted, that even as the pain due to
our sins is infinite, even so the sacrifice of Jesus Christ is of merit and
virtue infinite. And the reason thereof is. because he is not only without
sin and without spot, but also because he Heb. 1. 1. 2.
is the true and natural son of God, and his human nature is joined to his
divine nature, which is infinite, of the which the human nature takes his
virtue, for his human nature could not give life of it self, except it
took it of the divine nature, which is the fountain, and therefore Jesus
Christ has said, Ioh. 6. 63.
The flesh profits nothing, to wit, if it be considered as separate from his
divine nature, and from his holy spirit: but it is the spirit which gives
life, that is to s^ye, God dwelling in Jesus Christ corporally (as Saint Paul
s^ith) to wit, really, and in deed reconcileth the world to himself.


PA. How can the death of Christ alone make sufficient and full amends for the
sins of the whole world?


TI. John. 1. 29.
Behold the lamb of God (says John) which From whence grows the estimation
of Christ's works and passion. takes away the sins of the world, for of
the vndiuidable and unspeakable union of the Godhead and manhood in one person
grows the worthiness, estimation and endless merit of all the works and
passions of Christ. Therefore when it is said, the son of man has 1. Cori 6
20. 1 pet. 1 18. 19 acts. 20. 18. apoc. 5. 9.
redeemed us by the desert of his passion, a work of inestimable price and
incompara^le value is named, because the same son of man that has suffered,
is also God. Also the death of the son of man is a satisfaction, because it
is the death of such a man as is God. The obedience of the son of man is our
righteousness, because it is the obedience of a man that is God. So the son of
man forgiueth sins, because he is God Math. 9. 6. mar. 2. 5. 7. 9. luke 5 20.
and 7. 48.
The flesh of Christ is the food of life, because it is the flesh of a man that
is God. And although the Godhead in Christ suffered not, but 2. Cor. 13. 4. 1.
pet 4. 1.
his manhood only, (as says Peter) Christ suffered in the flesh, yet his
passion extends to his whole person. In so much that whatsoever reproach is
done to Christ's Mat. 1. 18. 28 luke 1. 38. 42. 43.
manhood, the same redoundeth to the reproach of his whole person according to
this sentence, 1 Cor. 2. 8. john. 3. 13. acts. 20. 28. 1. john. 1. 1. and 3. 16.
they have crucified the Lord of glory. In consideration whereof the Church
confesses the son of God to have suffered, because he suffered in the
manhood which he had taken upon him.


PA. How manifold is the meditation of Christ's passion?


TI. The healthful meditation of Christ's passion is sixfold. Gal 7. 9. 8^ 11.
7 8. john. 3. 33. romans 3. 4 2. chro. 12. 6. job. ^. 19. esai. 45. 27. apoc. 16.
5.
The first is that thereby will come to our mind how great the wrath of God
must needs have been for the sins of men, which could A healthful
meditation of Christ's passion. not be appeased by the work of any creature,
but that of necessity the only begotten son of God must do, to pacify
Gods wrath by making this rightful satisfaction for sin. 2. Chr. 30. 9.
nehem. 9. 31. psalm. 7. 12. esai. 30. 18. ier. 31. 20. joel. 2. 13. jonas. 4.
2. luke 6. 36. romans 2. 4. iac. 5. 11. 2. pet. 3. 9.
The second is, that thereby will come to our remembrances how unmeasurable
and unsearchable has been the mercy of God the father, who rather would
that his only begotten son should suffer most ^itter death, then that
mankind whom he had created, should perish. Peradventure thou may surmize
that God could have delivered mankind by some other mean What art thou that
will teach God what he might have done, think thou upon Gods justice and mercy
together, for as his mercy moved him to save, so his justice moved him to look
for rightful amends of the vvrong. Man sinned, and for so doing he must
either perish or Math. 3. 15. romans 5. 18. 2. cor. 5. 21.
make amends. Now To. 3. 23. 25. acts. 20. 28. esai. 6. 3. 11. romans 14. 23.
heb. 11. 6.
man being no more but man, could not satisfy Gods justice, and other then
man, none ought to do it. Gods wisdom therefore found through mercy, a
remedy in this case, which was, that the eternal son of God should Romans
8. 2. 2. corin. 5. 21. heb. 4. 15. 1. pet. 2 22. and 3. 18. and 1. ioh. 2. 1.
become man, by means whereof he both was able to satisfi^ Gods justice,
because he was God, and ought to do it, because he had taken man's nature upon
him. Thus in Christ's passion appears mercy to be myxed with justice, and
wisdom has tempered them both. The third is, that thereby will come to
mind the most excellent and unspeakable love of the son of God toward
mankind, who vouchsafed to turn the wrath of his father to himself, and to
abide so slanderous a death, and that for his enemis, Romans 5. 10. The fourth
is, that thereby will come to mind A healthfu^l meditation of Christian
passion. the true mean whereby the fruit of our Lords passion may be applied
to thee, so as it may be for Application of Christ's death.
thy soul health. This applying of it is brought to pass three ways, by the
word, by faith, and by the sacraments. By the word, as it were by the hand of
God, is the benefit of the Lords passion offered unto thee: where, and as
often as he Gospel of Jesus Christ is preached, and the Ministers of the word
do in Gods stead show the 1. Cor. 11. 26
fruit of our Lords passion to all that hear the gospel. Again when the
benefit of the Lords passion is thus offered, as it were by the hand of
God, it must be received by faith, as it vver^ a certain hand of man, the
which faith the Romans 10. 17. ep^e* 1. 18. 19. 1. cor 12. 5. 9. 11. ioh 17. 20.
romans 14 17. 1. t^m 3* 15. 1 cor. 1. 21.
holy ghost works in men that hear the Gospel, and obey. Genesis 17. 11. exodus
12. 3. 4. romans 4 11.
Furthermore it is sealed up with either Sacrament of Baptism, and of the
Lords Supper, and the strength and use thereof, is painted out as it were in
tables. Therefore when thou rehersest the article of thy belee^e concerning
the passion of the Lord, persuade thy self firmly, and believe most
assuredly, that the son of God suffered death for thee, which thing if thou
do, thou art partaker of the Lords death, in so much that all the whole
obedience of Christ is thy acquitall from 1. Cor* 1. 30.
sin, and rhy righteousness. But there is a double obedience to be marked in
Christ, his obedience of the Cross Gala. 3. 13.
and his obedience of the Law, which was his perfect fulfilling of the
same. Like as his obedience to the Cross is our cleansing from sin ^ Ephesians. 2.
15. colos. 2. 14.
so his obedience of the law, is imputed to us for our righteousness. The fifth
is, that when we be thus made partakers of the Lords passion through faith, it
will come to our remembrance Additions. Christ's passion and resurrection.
what is the lot of the Godly in this life, for like as Christ has suffered, so
will he have the rest of the godly to Romans 8. 28. 1. these. 1, 6, 1, pet. 4,

suffer, that they may be conformable to the image of the son of God. For
therefore do we suffer with him, that we may be glorified together with him,
Romans 8. The sixth is, that we shall call to mind what thing Christ is, who
has redeemed us with his own blood, require th at our hands; for now since we
are redeemed by him we must obey him. What wills he? First that we should
renounce his enemy the devil. John 8, 11. romans 6, 4, 12. heb. 12, 1. 1. pe. 4,
2. 1. ioh 1, 6.
Secondly, that we should fly sin, that we offend not God again wittinglye
and willingly with our sins. Thirdly, that we give our selves to holiness
and Godliness, and that we serve him in true fear Luke 1, 75 Ieuit. 11, 44

all the days of our life: which thing if we do, we shall obtain the end
of our faith; that is; the everlasting salvation of our souls, which God the
father grant unto us through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.


PA. Shevve me thy judgment of the resurrection of Christ.


TI. VVhiles that we are yet in this mortal life, we must to the uttermost
of our power express this ^ayth and belief, that we have in the Act. 1. 2.
and 10* 40. 1. cor. 15, 5, 6
resurrection of Christ, and of our rising again through him in our conversation
and living, walking still a new life, which in this world is to rise again
with Christ as S. Paul testifies, saying, We Act. 2, 38 col. 2. 12. romans 6.
3. gal 3. 27
are ^uried with him by baptism for to dye, that likewise as Christ was raised
from death by the glory of his father, eue^ so we should also walk in a new
life. For if we be grant in death like unto him, even so must we be in the
resurrection. These words shall the e^sio^ be understood, if we^ will
consider and mark that Additions. Of Christ es resurrection* the whole life
of our Savior Christ ought to serve us in steed of an example or pattern,
whereby we should make our selves conformable unto him spiritually, in those
things that have been truly and really, or in very deed fulfilled in his body,
and can in no wise be fulfilled in ours; as for an example, our savior Christ
has been conceived by the holy ghost, born of the virgin Mary, he has been
crucified and put to death, he did rise again the third day, and ascended into
heaven. Al those things can not be performed not fulfilled in our bodies as
they were in his. But let us endeavor our selves that our spirit or inward
man may be fashioned and made conformable unto him in these things. Psalm 51. 6
genesis 6, 5, and 8. 11. heb. 15. 16 roman. 3. 4.
Our bodies are conceived and borne in sin, not by the holy Ghost, nor in the
womb of a virgin, as our savior Christ was: but they are conceived by the
carnal copulation of man and woman, and of corruptible seed. That we may
therefore be conformable unto him in this point, let us come unto his true
Church and believe his gospel, and when we be in the true church of Christ,
which is both our mother and a chaste virgin, we shall be 1. Pet. 1 23
conceived and begotten in it by the incorruptible seed of the word of God
our heavenly father, and by the virtue of his holy spirit, and shall be borne
again the children of God, and made new creatures, we shall put off the old
man, and put on the new, bearing the image of the new Adam, which is Jesus
christ, as we have 1. Cor. 1. 5
born the image of the old Adam* and of the man of sin. After that we be thus
conceived by the holy ghost, and borne of a virgin, which is the true church
and spouse of our savior Christ, the residue of our life must also be
conformable Additions. A mortifiyng of the flesh. unto the life of our Savior
Christ, as o^^ spiritual conception and birth is. We be not crucified and put
to death as he was, but we do learn of him to bear the Math. 11 29
cross with him, and to be crucified unto the world, that the world may be
crucified unto us, as S. Paul vvryteth of him self. But to be Galat. ^. and
5. 24. and 6. 14.
crucified and dead unto the world, is to be crucified and dead unto sin,
and to be crucified and dead unto sin, is to forsake sin, and to be no
more a servant unto it, then the dead be wont to serve the living: For as the
dead has no more to do with the living, but are separated from them, so
they be dead unto the world, that has forsaken it to serve the living God,
Romans 6. 6. 13. 14. ^2.
and that will not fashion them selnes after it, nor walk after the flesh and
the concopilcence of it. Now it is impossible that they that be thus dead unto
the world, should not live unto God, and that the world should not be Romans
6. 2. colos. 3. 3* 4.
dead unto them; as contrariwise, they that live unto the world, and the world
unto them, they are dead unto God, as S. Paul has written of the Widow that
lives in pleasure, saying: 1. Tim. 5. 6. math. 8. 22. ihon. 8 2^. ^phe. ^ 1.
^poc. 2. 11. and 3. 1.
That widow that lives in pleasure, is dead eue^ yet alive, because she
lives unto the world, and is dead unto God, that was the meaning of our
savior Christ, when he said unto the young man that would go and bury his
father, let the dead bury the dead, follow thou me. When we dye then unto
the world, we rise again unto God, Again we practice spiritually in us the
example of the death of Christ, when we do Rom 8. 13. ^ cor. 4. 10. 11. 12.
colos. 3. 5.
mortify out earthly members, when we offer ou^ bodies a lively sacrifice to
God, when we do slay with the sword of Gods word, and also burn The fruits
of Christ's resurrection. with the fire of his spirit, our concupiscences and
carnal affections, which are the brute beasts that we sacrifice unto God,
that the offering and sacrifice o^ our bodies may be reasonable. Romans 1^. 1.
Then we dye with our savior Christ, when we do kill and mortify our old
Adam, we do also rise again with him, when 1. Cor. 15.
we do put on Jesus Christ, and be apparelled with him, when we serve to
righteousness, and despise this world with all the pomp and pride thereof,
having our minds and Luke. 1. 75.
conversation in heaven, where we do seek for our Savior Jesus Christ,
sitting on the right hand of God the father.


PA. Show me the fruits of our Lords resurrection.


TI. One fruit of our Lords resurrection is, that it is the power which is
shed into the believers, which makes them able to rise from vices unto Romans
6. 4. and 9. 11. ephe 3. 23. colloss* 3. 1. 2.
virtue. I his power is bestowed on us in baptism, and confirmed in the Lords
supper, so that we be not behind hand with our parts, and yet this power is
felt in those only that are borne again of immortal seed. Another fruit is
the example* for Paul says, Christ rose again to the intent we d Romans 4.
25. and 5. 15. and 6. 4. 5. 11. 12. 1. cor. 15. 20. 1. the. 4. 14 etc
might walk in newnes of life. Those therefore that follow their own vices,
living wickedly and uncleanly, do testify by their own doing that they
despise Christ, whose resurrection is set before us as a glass to see how
we ought to lead our life: for they think that Christ was scourged,
crowned with thorns, and shed his blood upon the Altar of the cross, to the
intent that they may give over themselves to all outragiousnes, tyranny, pride,
and lusts, and after this manner as much as in them ly^th, they How Christ's
body is present to our faith crucify the son of God anew, we therefore who
coue^ not only to be called, but also to be the sam^ that we are called, that
is, Christians, must think upon the matter as it is in deed, namely that
Christ died for the Rom* 4. 25 and 5. 8. 1. cor. 15. 3. gal. 1 4. ephesians. 2. 16

cleansing of such men's sins as receive faith in him, and live in true
repentance, by mortifiyng the old man, and quickening the new man.


PA. Do thou think that Christ is present with us in body?


TI. If we may liken great things to small, Christ's body is so present to our
faith, as the Son when we see it is present to our eye, for no one thing
subject to our senses, comes more near to the likeness of Christ, then the
Sun, which though it still abide in the heaven, and therefore in very deed
touches not the eye, yet the body of the sun is present to the ^ight,
notvvithstanding so great a distaunce of place betvveene: So Math. 26, 11 ioh.
12, 8 and 14 2. 2, cor. 5, 8 phil 1, 23. 1 p^ ^, 8. Act. 3. 21
the body of Christ, which by his ascending is taken up from us, and has left
the world, and is gone to his father, is in dee de absent from our senses:
yet onr faith is conversant in heaven, and beholds that son of
righteousness, and is verily in presence with it there present like as ou^ sight
is present with the body of the sun in the heaven, or as the sun is with
our sight in earth. Moreover as the sun is with his light present to all
things, so is also Christ with his godhead, spirit, and power, present to
all* and fills all.


PA. What think thou of the death of the Godly?


TI. The judgment of the world is not to be approved, for it ^arethlesse for
spiritual death, then for Death not dreadful to the Godly. ^atural death, it
esteems less eternal death then temporal death, or else would men leave
sin, which procures both the one and the other, I mean Apoc 2, 11 and 21, 8.
1. tim 5, 6.
spiritual and eternal death: and they 2. Cor 5, 1, 2 phil 1, 23 heb 2. 15. 2.
pe ^ 14
temporally do die, that by natural death they might enter into the full
fruition of eternal life, which none can inioye nor enter into, that here
will not temporally dye: that is, that will not labor to mortify their
affections, and crucify their lusts and concupiscences, for by obeying them
at the first came death, as we may read Genesis 3. If Eve had not obeyed her
desire in eating* the forbidden fruit whereby she dyed spiritually, Gen 2, 17
ephesians 2, 1 ^am 2, 15
none of these kinds of death had ever co^m^n unto man, nor been known of us.
Therefore as I say we must Rom 5, 12 heb 6, 27 deuteronomy 31, 14 joshua 23 14. 1. sam
26 10 job 14, 5 psalm 89, 48 ioh 7, 30 ^om. 5, 1^
needs here temporally dye, that is mortify our affections, to escape the
spiritual death* and by natural death not only escape eternal death of soul
and body, but also by it as by a door enter into eternal life, which Christ
Jesus our Savior ^ath procured and purchased to and for all that be in him,
translating eternal death into a Act 7, 60. deuteronomy 31, 16 math 9, 24 ioh 11. 11.
12. 13 1. cor 7, 39 and 11, 30. 1 these 4, 13.
sleep, or rather into a deliverance of soul and body from all kind of
dangers, miseries, and sins, by reason where of we may see that to those
that be in Christ, that is, to such as do believe, which believers are
discerned from others by not walking after the flesh, but after the spirit,
to those (I say) death is no damage, but advantage, no dreadful thing, but
rather Job 6, 8, 9
desirable, and of all messengers most merry, whilst he is looked upon with
the eyes of says in the Gospel.


PA. What beleeuest thou of God the holy Ghost?


Of the holy Ghost. TI. I do believe him to be the Lord and given of life, Ioh

who dwelling in us, does with his light illuminate our minds, that we may

do possess and enjoy in Christ, so that we may by good right call him the

master and teacher of truth, the author of light, the Well and Fountain of
wisdom, knowledge and understanding. This is he that does purge and cleanse
us from all filthiness, and over sprinkleth us with his sanctitude and
holiness, that we may be made the worthy Temples of almightye God. This is
he, that with his effectual Esai. 44. 3. John. 3. 5. Heb 10. 22.

water. The same is he that consumes and burns away the inordinate lusts
and concupiscences of our flesh, kindling our hearts with the divine love of
God and of heavenly things: wherefore he is called by good right fire. The
same spirit also is called, 1. John. ^. 27. 2 cor. 1. 21.
oil or unction, by reason that his working moll^fieth the hardness of our
hearts, and makes us receive the print of that image Jesus Christ, by whom
only we are sanctified. Finally, this is he that by his inspiration does make
us wholly to live John. 6 6^. galat. 5. 16. romans 8 9.
unto God, so that we be no more led by our own ^enlualitie, but follow only
his motion and guiding. Therefore is it said of Bernard very well, what good
does the spirit or holy Ghost in vs^^e does warn move, and teach: he does
warn our remembrance, he does move our vvilles, and John. 14. 26. 1. John. 2.
27.
teach our reason. Therefore if there be any goodness in us, it is the fruit of
his grace and virtue, but all our gifts without him are mere darkness of the
mind, and wicked perverseness of the heart.


PA. How understand thou the eight of the Romans and 15. verse, where
he speaks of the spirit of bondage, and spirit of fear?


TI. One and the self same spirit of God brings forth two effects, the
first is called the spirit of bondage or fear, which engenders in us fear
and sorrow. Heb. 12. 18. for first by the law and threatenings, it makes afraid
those men that are to be justified, and breaks and vexes them with scourges
and stripes of the conscience, that utterly dispairing Satisfaction made by
Christ. Christ bears our sins of them selves, they may fly unto Christ,
unto whom when they are come, and that they embrace him by faith, they are
not only justified, but also are freely and of their own accord stirred up to
just, upright, and holy works: The other is the spirit of grace and adoption,
which is given us by the preaching of the Gospel, the first belongs unto
Romans 8, 15
servants, the second unto sons. Gal. 4. Romans 8. 18. 2. Tim. ^. 7. Heb. 10.
29. Yet does it not hereof follow that all Prophets and Patriarchs were
servants: or there were no Sons before the revealing of the gospel, but
it compares the gifts of the one with the other, abasing the gifts of the
Law in respect of the gifts given under the Gospel.


PA. Is it then sufficient that Christ is dead and that he has yielded to God
his father on such an obedience, yea, (I say) is it sufficient for the
sualuatio^ of man, that the son of God was made man to bear the judgment,
the wrath and curse of God in their own nature and their own flesh?


TI. If that were enough all should be saved indifferently, as well the
Reprobates as the elect, and the vnbele^uers as the faithful.


PA. What is more required then?


TI. That the same satisfaction which Jesus Christ has made to God his father
may be communicated and aplied to us that believe, for the unbelievers have
nothing common with Jesus Christ, but that they are men of the same human
nature, but the Ioh 3, 16 and 15, 19 and 13, 1 1. ioh 2, 2 and 4 14
faithful have this more, which is the principal, that all that they have is
common to Christ with them, Participation between good and (...) and that
which Jesus Christ has is common to them also.


PA. What is it that Jesus Christ may take of the^, for as much as they be all

TI. He takes upon him their Ioh 2, 2 and 3 5 rom 4, 25. 1 pet 2. 24 gal. 1,

sins, and the pain which is due to them, as though he him self had
committed them, and that he were guyltie to discharge and deliver them.


PA. He takes then nothing of us but only the evil which is in us.


TI. What other thing may he take, seeing there is no other thing in us, but
the nature of the aliance and Communion that Jesus Christ has with the
faithful, and that the faithful have with him by the Esai 48, 16 act 13, 2
act 20 28. 1. cor 12, 6
power of the holy ghost, which joins them with him by true and living
faith, for otherwise there should be no perfect communion, and so the aliaunce
should not be full, if there were no participation of good and evil, such
as it should and ought to be among those which be allied.


PA. Then on the contrary, it must be, follovving the nature of this communion
and aliaunce that we receive of Jesus Christ, the good things that are in him,
as he does the evil that is in us.


TI. It is so to be understood.


PA. According to that which thou haste said, the Church does not only
obtain remission of sins but also the victory against sin, death, hell, and
the devil, and likewise eternal life, the which Math 2^, 39 ioh 13, 34, 35

Jesus Christ has wone for it, because she is the spouse of him, and that she

virtue of faith in him. Now then, I would have thee tell me the mean that the
Lord uses in this spiritual marriage.


TI. No marriage can be made except the husband and the wife do give the faith
of marriage the one to the other, the which imports all that which belongs
to true marriage. For the true foundation of marriage, lies in that Faith which
the husband and the wife do give the one to the other, and therefore men
say, that they which have so given their faith, are assured by promise that is
made on both parts, which can not be don but by words, whereby the husband
and the wife declare their will and consent. Even the like is done by the
ministry of the Mark. 16. 15. romans 1. 16. 1. corin. 1. 9. tit. 2. 11. 2. pet.

self to him, even as he has given him self to her.


PA. Whence has this word (Iustificare) been borrowed, and what
signifies it?


TI. This word (Iustificare) to Justify, has been of S Paul borrowed of
the common use of the law, Deuteronomy. 25. 1. pro. 17. 15. esaias 5 23. romans 8. 33.
psalm. 51 4.
for in judgment to justify a man, it is to asloyle or quit him of the crime
that is laid to his charge, or that he is accused of, and to pronounce him
righteous, just, innocent, and guyltles. After the same manner, when we say
that God does justify us, our meaning is, that God does Esai. 53. 11. romans 3.

our charge, or that we can be accused of, and Signification of the word
Iustificare. Differences of righteousness. that he does pronounce us just and
righteous in his sight, that is to say, that first he does pardon and forgive
us our sins, he covers them, and does in no wise impute them unto us, but

imputes unto us righteousness, not our own which is none at all, but the
righteousness of his son our savior, and so through his righteousness does
both save and make us blessed.


TI. Saint Paul did dispute and reason against them which did attribute
justification to works. Difference and reco^ciliation of S Paul and S. ^ames.
But S. James did write against them which did utterly contemn and despise
good works. 2. And therefore Paul shows the causes of our justification,
James shows the effects and fruits of the same. 3. Paul declares how we
are justified. James declares how we are known to be justified. Paul
excludes works as not the cause of our justification, James approves works
as effects proceeding of the same. 4. Paul denies that any good works can
be in them that be not justified, James affirms that they which be justified
can in no wise be without good works.


PA. What difference is there betvveene the righteousness of the law and the
Christian, the Pharisaicall righteousness, and the righteousness of the Gospel?


TI. The first difference between the righteousness of the law and the
Christian righteousness is, that the righteousness of the law, is of the Math. 3.
15. and 5. 20. act. 13. 10. rom 2. 13. and 10. 3. 4. etc. tit. 3. 5. heb. 9. 8.
r^ue. 3. 15. 1^
works of the law, but the righteousness of the Gospel is without the works of
the law. The second is, that the righteousness of the law is the
righteousness of the worker, but the righteousness of the gospel is the
Righteousness of the law. Of the Gospel. righteousness of the believer. The
third is, that the righteousness of the law is not* imputed freely, but comes
to pass of the desert of a man's own obedience, but Hab 2, 4 rom 1, 17 rom 3,
11 gal 3, 11 heb 10, 38 gen 15, 6 act 10, 43 rom 3, 24 rom 4, 5, 8, 24 ^phe 1,
^ and 2, 8 psalm 32, 1 gal. 3, 8 2 corin. 5, 18
the righteousness of the gospel is imputed without desert of a man's own
obedience. The fourth is, that the righteonsnes of the law is a formal
righteousness, as which is framed to a man by his just dealings, but the
righteousness of the gospel is an imputed righteousness, when the just deal^ngs
of Christ are imputed to him, that believes. Therefore that man is said to be
justified according to the form of the law, which of an Leuit. 18, 5 ezekiel.
20, 11 romans 10, 5. gal. 3, 12.
unrighteous person becomes righteous, through his own just dealing and
fulfilling of the law, according to this saying. The man that does these things
shalliue in them: but he is said to be justified after the manner of the
Gospel, who of a guilty person is made not gilty, by reason of Christ's Esai
53 11. rom 3. 20 and 5. 18.
righteousness, which is taken hold on by faith. The righteousness of the law
is a perfect obedience of a man to the law of God, but the Christian or
gospel righteousness is Christ's obedience imputed to him that believes. A
Genesis 15, 27 and 17, 1 job. 1, 8 luke 2. 25 psalm 10, 1, 6.
righteous man after the law, is he that deals justly and uprightly,
according to the meaning of the law: but he is righteous after the gospel, to
whom God ^orgiueth his sin, and Psalm 32, 1. rom 4, 8, 24
imputes Christ's righteou^nes, and whom he accepts to eternal life freely
for Christ's sake. Justification Romans 10, 5 Ieuit. 18, 5.
after the law is an abling os a man before god, for the soundnes and
perfection of his obedience to gods law* but christian or gospel righteousness
is an abling of man before God, is an embracing by ^aith of the soundnes and
perfection of Christ's obedience to God the father. Thus have we difference
betvv^en the christian righteousness, and the righteousness of the Righteousness
o^ the law. Of the Gospel. law. Now let v^ see how the Christian
righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the Pharisees. The christian
righteousness exceeds the Pharisaicall in these four things. In cause,
quality, effect, and end The cause of christian righteousness is God, Christ's
desert and faith taking hold of the benefit offered: but the cause of
Pharisaicall righteousness, is man's hypocrisy, ignorance of Gods righteousness
and an outvvarde Esai 29. 13 mat. 15, 3, 6, 9 mark 7, 7. collos. 2, 8, 22
observance of men's traditions. The quality of Christian righteousness, is the
obedience and fulfilling of the law in Christ: but the quality of
Pharisaicll righteousness, is but only an outward visure of feined and Mat. 6.
2. 16. and 15, 7, and 23 5, 27. mark 7. 6 luke 11. 39. and 20, 47.
counterfeit holiness. The effect of Christian righteousness, is newness of
spirit, the fear of God, true godliness, invocation, true humility,
patience, and a beginning of obedience toward Gods law, in so much that a
man being justified by faith, desires nothing so much as to obtain God. To
be brief, his chief pleasure is in the law of the Lord, after he knovveth
that damnation is taken away by Christ^ merit: but the effect of Pharisaicall
righteousness is, pride, glorying before God, superstition, disdain of ou^
neighbors, and to be short, such as e Mat 7, 17 1^ 19. and 12. 33 luke 6. 44
the* tree is, such is the fruit, for an evil tree can not bring forth good
fruit The end of Christian righteousness is, to have Romans 5. 1.
peace with God, to have access unto God, to give glory unto God, and finally
to obtain everlasting life freely for Christ's sake: but the end of
Pharisaicall righteousness is, to give Math. 5. 20 luke 11. 39.
praise to a man's own self, and to take it from god, and to vaunt among men,
upon which at length shall ensue horrible punishment, unless there be a The
honor of justification is attributed to faith. turning unto the Lord.


PA. Show me now what is the cause why Justification is ascribed to faith?


TI. The honor of justification is attributed to Genesis 15. 6. heb* 2. 4. act.
13. 39. romans 1. 17 and 3. 12. and 4 5. and 5. 1. and 10. 4. 6 gala* 2. 16.
ephe. 2. 8.
faith chiefly, because man does acknowledge himself by the same, such as he is
of his own nature, to wit, a poor and miserable sinner, the child of wrath,
subject to death and eternal damnation, therefore spoiling, empting, and
making him self all naked and void of of all his own justice, and of al his
trust in his own works and merits, he does embrace Jesus Christ to be clad
2. cor. 5. 21. romans 6. 19. gala. 2. 16. 21. and 3. 9. 10. phil. 3. 9. tim. 1.
9. tit. 3. 5. heb. 11. 7.
with his justice, to the end that by it his sins may be covered, in such sort
that they come not in account at the judgment of God. And to speak yet more
fully, I say that faith instead of bringing to God any thing that is of man,
brings him to Jesus Christ, to receive of him thereby that which he can not
find in him self, to wit, the e Luke 7. 50. and 8. 12. ephe. 2. 8. 1. pe^. 1.
9.
righteousness of Iefus Christ, which makes a man righteous before God, even as
though he were wholy innocent, for as much as God esteems him for ^uch a
one, accepting the justice of his Son Jesus Christ for full satisfaction, and
allowing the same to him, as though it were proper to the man to whom it is
allowed.


PA. What commodity brings it?


TI. It brings also this commodity, that whereas before he could do nothing
but evil, this faith does 1. Cor. 30. 32 1. these, 4. 3.
sanctify him, disposing him to the obedience of the will of God, and to all
good works, to the end that he may serve to justice and to holiness, Luk
17. 5.
vvheras before he served to in justice and to sin.


PA. How does faith sanctify man?


F^^th sanctifies man. Kinds of Sanctification. TI. In this sanctification of
man by faith, two things are to be considered First, because that Jesus Christ
having taken our own flesh in the Womb of the Math. 1. 16 23, 25. luke 1.
30. 31. and 2, 7.
virgin, has sanctified him in his, which thing the holy ghost has testified,
when in form of a Dove he descended upon Jesus Christ which is our head, in
whom all his members are forth with Sanctified. Secondly, Romans 5, 1. rom 8,
16. heb 10* 22, 2^. 1. john 4. 13.
because that faith which embraces and receives wholly Jesus Christ with all
his gifts and graces, is never in man without the spirit of him, nor the
Spirit of him, without his fruits, which are altogether contrary to the
works of the flesh; to wit, of the corrupted man that is not regenerate by
the spirit of God.


PA. Expound now to me the kinds of sanctification, and the difference of them.


TI. I will say unto thee for the first, that we must put difference in this
matter, between the cause of our salvation, and the testimony of the same, and
then afterward between the sanctification by Jesus Christ which is imputed to
us, and that which is joined to our person.


PA. What think thou to be the cause of our salvation?


TI. Math. 20, 2^ mark 10. 45. john 11, 5^. act. 20. 28. rom 4. 15. and 14. 9.
1. cor. 5, and 7^ 15. 3.
Jesus Christ dwelling in us by faith.


PA. What meanest thou by the ^estimony that we have of the same?


TI. The Sanctification whereof we now speak.


PA. How do thou understand that it is the testimonye of our salvation, and
of the cause of the same and not the cause it self?


TI. For because it testifies that Jesus Christ dwells Kinds of
Sanctification and the difference of them. in us, as the effect testifies of
his cause.


PA. What follows thereof?


TI. That the cause is there, seeing we see the effects, to wit, John 17.
10. 11. and 20. 21. 22. 23. 25. 26.
Jesus Christ with all his gifts and graces


PA. And what inconvenience were it to hold our Sanctification for the cause
of our Salvation?


TI. For the better understanding of all this matter, it is meet that I
expound it to thee


PA* What difference do thou put betvveene the sanctification of Jesus
Christ which is allowed us, and that which is joined to our proper person,
and then the fruits of the same?


TI. I do call Sanctification properly that which we consider in the very
person 1. Cor. 1. 30. 31.
Jesus Christ, the which sanctification is not properly ours, as a qualitye
coniunct to our person, but only by imputation.


PA. What meanest thou by that imputation?


TI. That it is allowed unto us, as his psalm. 32. 1. Romans 4. 8. 24. Gal. 3. 8.
Ephe. 1. 5. 2. cor. 5. 18.
justice is attributed and allowed unto us by the justification which we
obtain in him by faith.


PA. Is that the cause why S. Paul says, that 1. Cor. 1. 30 3 2.
God has made Jesus Christ unto us wisdom, justice, sanctification, and
redemption?


TI. There is no doubt of it, but it must be considered, that beside this kind
of sanctification that is so imputed and allowed unto us, there is yet another
that is joined to our very person, not only by imputation, but as a quality
sticking in us, which proceeds from that first kind of sanctification whereof
Kinds of sanctification and difference of them. we have even now spoken.


PA. What virtue has every of them in us?


TI. The first does fully sanctify us before God, because it is full and
perfect.


PA. The other, is it not of the same nature and force?


TI. No, for it sanctifies us but in John 1. 16. ^ol. 1. 10. and 2. 9.
part.


PA. For what cause?


TI. For because it is but begun in us, and not perfect, wherefore it cannot
fully sanctify us, except it be full and perfect.


PA. And when shall it be so?


TI. When our regeneration and reformation to the image of God shall be.


PA. It shall not then be in this mortal life?


TI. It is true: but it shall be in the life to come, in the which our life
which is now hidden in Jesus Christ shall be showed, and what we be shall
appear, when we shall be made like unto the glorious body of Jesus Christ.


PA. What difference put thou betvveen these two kinds of Sanctification?


TI. I call the first perfect: for that is is the very sanctification, not
only of that which Jesus Christ is sanctified in his flesh and human nature,
but also by reason whereof he is called the holy one of holy ones, for so much
as by the communication of the same 1. Pet. 1. 15. 16. 2. pet. 3. 10 11.
he does sanctify all his elected, to make them holy without blame before God,
who has chosen them thereunto.


PA. If it be the same sanctification wherewith Jesus Christ is Romans 8. 30.
sanctified, and does sanctify others, it is very certain that it can not be
but perfect.


Testimonies of our salvation. TI. If it be perfect in him, it is also perfect
in us, in so much as dwelling in us by faith, we have him with all the
holiness that he brings with him, the which we cuer dravv out of him, as of
his true fountain, the which we have in our selves when we have Jesus
Christ.


PA. If we have in Jesus Christ the fountain of all holiness, whereby we are
continually and perpetually sanctified, what other imperfect sanctification
may then be in us?


TI. That which we consider in our own proper flesh and nature, regenerate
and renewed by the spirit of God, which is as it were vvatred with the
streams of that fountain of all sanctification, to make us bring forth the
Heb* 6. 11, 12 2. pet. 1. 10. luke 19. 8, 9. act. 2. 44.
fruits of true sanctification and holmesse, in the stead of the fruits of
sin which it brought forth in time before, as the earth, which being cursed
and barren, is afterward made fer tile, and bears better fruits by the
blessing of God.


PA. Thou vvilt then say, that this second kind of sanctification is not
only adherent to the person of Jesus Christ, and that it is not only ours by
imputation, as is the first, but that it is also adherent to our flesh and
nature, as a new quality which Jesus christ has put into us by his holy
spirit, which makes our flesh holy in it self, to do afterward holy
works.


TI. It is even so.


PA. Thou will then say also, that Philip. 1, 9. 1. pet 2. 12. 3. corin. 15.
58. luke 19, 8. 9.
the holy works which men do being so sanctified, be the fruits of the same
sanctification?


TI, It is even so. But because there remains continually much of our natural
corruption in our Holy works testimonies of our salvation. flesh, whilste we
are in this world, there can proceed from us no work so holy, but that it is
found very Genesis 8. 2^. and 1. 18. 27. esai. 6. 5. ezekiel. 16, 15. exo. 30 20.
act. 21. 24 psalm. 51. 5. john 3. 5. heb. 9. 14.
foul and far of from the perfect holiness which God requires of us in all
our works.


PA. What will thou then conclude by that?


TI. That our works be so far off from worthiness to be presented for
satisfaction and to obtain salvation by them be they never so holy, that if he
should judge of them according to the rigor of his judgment, he should find
nothing therein but matter of 1* Cor. 4. 7* romans 4. 4. 5. and 6. 23.
condemnation.


PA. Thou may not deny for all that, but the good and holy works are very
agreeable to him.


TI. If it were otherwise, they ought not to be done, but thou must note
therein that they be not acceptable unto him as cause of our salvation, but as
Math. 5. 16. 1. pet 2. 12.
testimony of the same.


PA. How understand thou that they be testimonies of our salvation?


TI. In that they testify that Jesus Christ is in us, and that he there
works by his holy spirit: wherefore it follows that we be justified and
sanctified by the Romans 5. 1. and 8. 7.
justice and sanctification of Jesus Christ, the which God beholds, and for
the regard thereof he does bear with the imperfection that yet remains in
us, and does pardon us that wherein we do yet daily offend him.


PA. It seems to me that thou will say in effect, by all this discourse
which thou have made, that what regeneration and sanctification so ever there
be in our flesh and nature, we are not yet for all that so pure and so perfect,
but that we must have continual Gods wo^de the foundation of true Faith.
recourse to the justice and 1. Cor. 1. ^0.
sanctification of Jesus Christ, which is ours, not as a quality of justice and
sanctiti^, sticking and joined to our person, but only for that it is allowed
and attributed unto us, as though it were our own proper.


TI. So it is, and therefore Jesus Christ has said to the same effect, that
he John 13, 10.
that was already washed had not need to wash his fe^te.


PA. What means he by this manner of speech?


TI. That albeit we be justified already, sanctified and purified of our sins
by the says that we have in him through his word, yet for all that, forasmuch
as there rests in us always certain filthiness and corruption, which
proceeds of our corrupted nature, which is not yet thoroughly well renewed and
reformed to the Genesis 1. 27. VVil. 2. 23. 1. Cor. 15. 49. Ephe 1. 23. 24. Colos.
31. 10
image of God, we have alvvaies need to go to 1. Cor. 6. 11 Act* 22. 16.
wash and cleanse us of our filthiness in the true fountain of all purity,
justice, and sanctification which is opened to us in Jesus Christ, for we have
no remission of any one sin of ours, but only in 1. Ioh. 2. 2. and 3. 5. 1.
Pet. 2. 24. Gol* 1. 4. Act. 10. 34. Ioh. 1. 29. Heb. 9. 26. 28. Romans 5 8. 1.
Tim. 1. 15. 2. Pet. 1. 9.
him, by the means of ^ustification that we have by faith in him.


PA. Can our works in no wise please God?


TI. There is no man that may do any work which may be acceptable to God,
if first the person which does it, ^ee not acceptable to him. Now sin of
his nature deserves the wrath of God, and not his love and favor. Therefore
because al men are sinners there are none which are agreeable to him, and if
their persons be not agreeable to him, no more can their works please him so
long as he does consider them in their own nature without Gods word the
foundation of true faith. his grace in Jesus Christ, by whom only man is
made agreeable to him.


PA. Can any thing done with a good intent be to Gods honor?


TI. Nothing can be done to the honor of God, not with a good 1. Sam. 13. 11
and 15. 11. 13 2. Sam. 6. 6. 7.
intent but that which is come according to his word, for the word of God is
the very true and only rule of all good intents, and of the honor wherewith he
ought to be honored.


PA. But if a man think to do well, and does that which he does to none other
end but to honor God, is not that enough?


TI. No, for then it had not been needful that God should ever have given a
law to man to teach him but that he had only commanded that every man should
do that which liked him, where he has done clean contrary, saying, Deuteronomy. 12.
8. Pro. 14. 12. Esai. 3. 7. and 66. 3. 4. John. 16. 2. Genesis 48. 18. Number* 11. 28
iud. 17. 3. Math. 16. 22. Mark. 9. 38. Luke 9. 54. john 13 8.
Do not every one of you that which shall please you, but that only which I
command you.


PA. But if they which served God according as they have been taught of men,
do the same faithfully, may they then do it without faith?


TI. Yea truly, for as there be no good intentes, but those which are governed
by the only rule and Ioh* 4. 23. 24. Esai* 29. 13. Math. 15. 9. Deuteronomy. 12. 32.
and 5. 32. Prou. 30. 6. io^h. 1. 7. Apo. 22. 18. 19
will of the word of God, even so is there no true Faith but that which has
certain and sure foundation in the same word and will, which only is just
and reasonable, and ought to be a rule to all reason and justice unto men.


PA. When thou do any thing at adventure, can thou do it with certain
assurance?


TI, No, because Faith and doubt are as contrary Gods words the foundation of
true Faith. Two sorts of vocation. as is to be certain and uncertain, will say
this never without true Romans 8. 16. heb. 10. 12 23. 1 ioh 4. 13. 19. romans 3.
27. and 4 19. and 8. 16. ephe. 3. 12. heb 10. 22. 1. john 4. 13* and 5. 19. 1.
cor. 4. 4. and 9. 26. tit. 3. 6.
assurance of that which he believes and follows, because she is buildcd upon
the sure word of God, by the which she is assured of his good will, and she
does nothing at adventure, but is ever certain that that which she believes,
and that which she does, is pleasant unto God.


PA. What commodities does this assurance bring to men?


TI. Two, whereof the first is, that man have the Majesty of God in such high
estimation, and bears him so great reverence, that not only he will not
willingly Romans 6. 1. 1. cor. 6. 11. 1. pet. 4. 1.
offend him, but also he will not put himself in any hazard, and do any
thing at adventure, when there is question of the service and honor of God,
and therefore he will ever be assured of his will, for in whom a man has his
chief trust, to him does that man reverence, and service, such as he knows
shall please most. The second is Act. 23. 1. and 22. 16. 1. cor. 4. 4. 2. cor.
1. 11 17 and 4. 2. heb. 13. 18.
the quietness of a good conscience that man has by that mean, when he is
assured that he pleases God by an assurance so certainly founded upon the
witness of God himself?


PA. Show me the sorts of vocation, and the difference of them.


TI. Ther^ are two sorts of vocation, the one Vocation o^twards.
outward, and the other inward. By outward vocation I mean a common and
general vocation, by the which God does call by the outvvard preaching all
those to whom the gospel is preached, be they chosen or reprobates* and by
inward vocation, I understand Vocation inward*
that, whereby God does not only call man by the outward preaching of his word,
but makes Two sorts of vocation. The will of God toward (...). them to fear
the power and Romans 8. 3^. 1. cor. 1. 9. 2. pet. 1. 10. Jude. 1.
efficacy of the same by his holy spirit, in such sort that they do not only
hear it with their outward ears, but do also receive it into their hearts by
faith, whereby they are justified. The very Mat. 20. 16. and 22. 14. luke 14.
24.
reprobates may be called by outward vocation, but it profits them nothing,
except the inward be there joined with it, and as concerning them, it serves
them but to their greater condemnation, forasmuch as the grace of God was
offered unto them, and they have rejected it through their ingratitude and
unbelief, as though it had never been offered unto them, yet in the mean
time it is not altogether in vain, for it serves to declare better the
peruersity of men, and to make them more inexcusable at the Judgment of God,
and to set forth the better his great justice in their just condemnation. It
then follows by that which has been said, that those which are not called
but only by this outward calling, are not also justified, nor consequently
glorified.


PA. How has God always accustomed to utter his will to men?


TI. By his Psalm. 119. 10^ deuteronomy. 4. 2. and 5. 32 and 18. 5. and 28. 14. and 30.

word, and by some outvvard signe^ for look what the word puts into men's
ears to be conveyed unto the mind, the same thing does the sign set before
the eyes to be seen, to the intent that by them as it were with windows, a
certain light might be conueyned in unto the soul, so as the word and the
sign might be a double warrant audible and visible, the end and drift of
which is all one. Howbeit so as the interpretation of the sign is to be
fetched alvvaies out of the vvor^^ alone.


How the sacrament is to be understood. PA. What meanest thou by this word
Sacrament?


TI. They be sacraments so called, Math. 3. 11 and 20. 26. 27 28. Mar. 16. 16
ioh. 3. 5 Act. 2. 38. and 8. 36. 37. 38. 1. Cor. 10. 16 and 11. 24 Gal. 3 26. 27
because there is in them seen one thing, and understood another thing, that
which is seen has a bodilye kind and shape, that which is understood
has a spiritual fruit. And Christ is the 1. Cor. 10. 2 3. 4. Romans 4. 11
matter, or if thou will the substance of all Sacraments, forasmuch as in him
they have all their perfectness, and do promise nothing without him, yet in
treating of sacraments you must observe a distinction, for a sacrament, not
only signifies that the figure and truth are there contained, but that they do
not so hang together, but that they may be served, and that in the very
conioyning the thing mus^e alvvaye be discerned from the sign, that we give
not to the one that which belongs to the other. The Sacraments are common
to al, but the Genesis 17. 23. Heb. 12. 16 Math. 26. 25 Act* 8. 13
grace is not common, which is the power of the sacraments, as in Baptism
the washing of regeneration is common to all, but the grace it self whereby
the members of Christ are regenerate, is not common to all. Let this remain
certain, that there is no other Rom 4. 12. 1. Co, 10, 2, 3, 4 Rom, 2, 19. 1.

forth Christ unto us, and in him the treasures of the heavenly grace, but they

faith, even as wine or oil, or any other liquor, though you power it on
largely, yet it will run beside and perish, unless the Vessels mouth be
open to receive it, and the vessel, though it be wet round about on the out
side, shall nevertheless remain empty and void within. Beside this we
must bevvare least we should How the sacrament is to be understood. think
that there is some secret power knit and fastened to the Hag, 2, 13, 13 Math,

sacraments, that they may of them selves give us the graces of the holy ghost,
like as wine is given in a cup, whereas only this office is appointed to
them by God to testify and stablish to us the good vvil of God toward us,
and do profit no further unless the holy Ghost ioyn him self to them, which
may open to our minds and hearts, and make us partakers of this testimony,

unto us those things that are given us by the liberality of God Muse. common
places in the tit. of Sacraments Attic* 6, 8, 9
To this effect speaks Musculus, As the sacraments be signs of grace, so do
they signify grace: as they be the seals of the justice of Faith, so they do
seal and confirm it: and they do confirm us, not as the very ensealing spirit
him self does, but as ensealing signs. As they be figures and forms, so in
the outvvarde similitude they do figure and represent the things signified: as
they be the first principles, so do they first instruct in the principles, and
as they be remembrances, so do they renew the benefits of the heavenly grace
in the minds of the faithful, for Beza. Confe* cap. 4. Artic. 44, 46.
God him self with the most present power of his Spirit, is present with his
own institution, least the ministration which he has ordained of the
sacraments, should be fruitless and vain. And therefore he truly
perfourmeth in deed whatsoever he promises and figureth in signs, neither do
the sign^ Of the nature of Baptism^. want their effect, that the author of
them may be proved true and faithful. Here also it is to be noted, that God
inwardly works that which the minister figureth and testifies by outvvard
doing, least that be drawn to a mortal man, which God claymeth to him self
alone. The same thing does Augustine wisely touch. How (says he) does both
Moses sanctify, and God, not Moses for God, but Moses with visible sacraments
by his ministry, but God with invisible grace by his holy spirit, where also
is the whole fruit of visible sacraments, for without this sanctification of
invisible grace, what do those visible sacraments profit?


PA. What means Christ when he says, Baptizing them into the name, or in
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost?


TI. He does not simply command them to baptize such as do believe, but to
consigne them in Math. 28. 19 mark. 16. 15.
baptism into the name, that is to say, into the possession, right, religion,
and grace of the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit, to be the
people of God, the partakers of his covenant and grace. Exodus 3. 14. psalm. 22.
22. John 17. 6. math. 7. 22 and 28. 19. john 1. 12. act 3* 6. phil. 2. 9.
And if we do expound into the name, that is to say, into the Faith and
confession of his name, or into his possession, power, and jurisdiction, or
into the strength and power, or into the covenant and grace, of the father,
and the son, and the holy spirit, it is no matter, for all this is true and
agrees with the nature of baptism.


PA. Tell me, must we be nourished with spiritual meat and nouriture into
eternal life, and that by a spiritual manner agreeable to the spiritual birth
and Of regeneration. life, into the which we are regenerate by Baptism?


TI. We are not regenerate in baptism by any corporal or material seed of
the body and of the blood of Jesus Christ, nor by any natural manner, as we
are naturally begotten by our fathers and mothers: Romans 6. 3. 1. pet 1. 18. 19.
but that regeneration and new birth is wrought by a seed incorruptible,
spiritual, and divine, by the which we are begotten into the church, by the
virtue of the holy Luke 12. 12. john 3. 9. 8. and 1. 33. and 6. 63. and 14. 17.
26. 1 cor. 1^. 4. 6.
ghost, by whom we are regenerate into a new life.


PA. It is not also said, that Jesus Christ does give his body and his blood
in Romans 9. 3. 1. cor. 12. 1^. 13. ephesians. 4. 15. 16. and 5. 30. gal. 3. 27.
baptism, as he does in the supper. Likewise the water is not called therein
the body and the blood of Jesus Christ, as Jesus Christ does in the Supper
call the bread and wine, by the name of them.


TI. Albeit that the water be not there called in baptism by that name, do
thou not think for all that, that the body and blood of Jesus Christ be there
distributed and Mark. 1. 4. john 3. 5. act. ^ 38. tit. 3. 5.
communicated unto thee in the same as well as the Supper.


PA. I do so understand it.


TI. Thou vvilt then ordain a baptism without Jesus Christ.


PA. Wherefore?


TI. Because thou can not have Jesus Christ, except thou have him wholy,
and very God, and very man, and that thou have true communion with his body
and with his blood, not only in the Supper, but also in baptism.


PA. Show me the cause thereof?


TI. It is because that the baptism does no Of Regeneration. less send us to
the death and passion, and to the body and blood of Jesus Christ, then does the
supper, forasmuch as that is proper to all Act, 2, 38 Romans 6, 34 1, Cor, 10. 16
and 11, 24 Gal, 3. 27 1, pet, 2, 2^
sacraments*


PA. Thou speak as though baptism and the supper were one very sacrament,
and that there were no difference between them.


TI. Not so, for albeit we do as well participate of the blood of Jesus Christ
in baptism as in the supper, yet notwithstanding there is difference in the
participating, and in the manner ther^of, in respect of the benefits of Jesus
Christ, which are signified and communicated unto us as well in the one of the
sacraments as in the other.


PA. Declare unto me more easily that which thou now speak of.


TI. Although the body of Jesus Christ be not given unto us in baptism as
for spiritual food, as it is in the supper, that notwithstanding, it is there
given unto us in very deed, as 1. Cor, 6, 15 and 12, 27 Ephe, 4, ^5 and 5, 30.
a garment of innocence, justice, and holiness, to cover all our sins before
God. And therefore S. Paul say th, that all those which are Gal, 3, 27. Rom,
6, 3, 4. 1. Pet, 3, 21*
baptized, have put on them Jesus Christ.


PA. And of the blood what say thou?


TI. Albeit that it be not given to us in baptism as for drink, as it is in the
supper, yet notwithstanding, it is there given unto us for a spiritual washing
of our souls and consciences, whereby Jesus Christ does Act ^22, 16 Ephe, 5,
26 Tit. 3, 5, 6. 1, Pet. 3, 21
purify and cleanse his Church in this lauer of regeneration, to the end he may
make it pure and clean without spot or wrinckle, and a holy and glorious
church.


PA. I did never yet so well understand these Of the Lords Supper. points.


TI. How do thou then now understand them?


PA. That even as a garment or a cloak do serve to cover the body, even so do
the innocence, justice, and holiness of Jesus Christ, serve us to cover our
sins at the judgment of God, to the end that there appear no one spot of
them in his sight.


PA. And touching the blood of Jesus Christ, what think thou?


TI. I think that the Math, 26* 28. Ephe, r, 7, and 5, 25, Gol 1, 14, 20 Tit,
3, 5, 6 Apoc, 1, 5.
blood of Jesus Christ is called the washing of souls and of consciences, not
as though they must be washed and dipped in the blood of Jesus Christ, as one
would vvash and dip a body that he would wash and make clean, or some other
such like thing, but that the holy Ioh. 3, 5. Rom, 8, 15, 16. Heb, 9, 14 and
10, 22
ghost speaks so to give us to understand that which thou have said, to
wit, what the water of baptism signifies, concerning the washing and
purification of our souls and consciences in the blood of Jesus Christ.


PA. What is the Lords supper?


TI. The Lords supper is the gathering together of the faithful of Christ,
and the public ministry of the new Testament, in which the Sacrament of the
Lords body and blood is given and received, according unto the institution
Math, 16, 26 Luk, 22, 19 1, Cor. 11, 24 26.
of our Savior Christ, by the mystical breaking of bread, and the blessing
of the Cup in the Communion of the church from his table, and therewith the
memory of the only Sacrifice which was Heb, 5. 6, and 7, 26, and 9, 11. 12,
and 10, 9, 10. Rom 5, 8. and 6, 10. 1. Cor, 15, 3 2, Cor, 5, 14. 1. Pet. 9. 18.
^
once performed for our salvation upon the Altar of the Cross, The meaning of
these words Hoc est corpus meum. is celebrated with thanks giving, and the
exercise Math. 22. 39. romans 1. 3.
of Christian love.


PA. How expoundest thou these words, Hoc est corpus meum.


TI. There can not be a more convenient exposition, then when the Sacramental
words be Sacramentally expounded, the proper properly, the spiritual
spiritually, and the 2. Corin. 2. 6. ioh. 6. 56. 57. and 7. 4. 56. romans 8. 11.
12. and 12. 1.
mystical mistically. For the Sacramental words require none other meaning
or interpretation then even as they be spoken, but the manner of the thing
which is declared and uttered in them, is not propet, but Sacramen tall: for
the which I do say, that 1. Ioh. 2. 29. and 3. 10
Sacraments are Sacramentally to be expounded, as for example, Genesis 17. 10 11.
and 33. 20. exodus 12. 11. deuteronomy. 31, 11. ioh. 14, 6. and 15 1. act. ^. 24. romans
4. 11, 17. 1. cor. 10. 4. 16. tit. 3. 5.
Circumcision is the covenant, and the Lamb is the passover, I take no word
here otherwise then in the proper sense. Circumcision as it sounds, is the
very carnal cutting of the foreskinne, and the covenant is nothing else but
the same which God made with that people. And the Lamb was but a natural
Lamb which they killed at the Lords commandment, and the Passover was
spoken of none other, but of the Angel which stroke the Egyptians, and yet
for all that, the manner of the speech whereby Circumcision is called the Lords
covenant and the Lamb the Passover, is not proper and natural, but
Sacramental, nor it can not be said, that Circumcision properly and naturally
is the Covenant, and the Lamb the Passover, but as that was the sign
Sacramental of the covenant, so was this also of the passage of delivery. In
like manner in this present case, whereas the Lord says. This is my body, it
is Tertul. against Mar^i^ lib. 4. Orig. in Leuit. Hom. 7. and upon the Rom 4.
book 4. chap. Cip. 2. book. 3. chap. Hierom. upon 26. of Math. Ambrose of Sac.
4. book 4. chap. and 5. and 1. 1. Cor. cap. 11. August. de Catechis. cap. 26.
Contra Adimat. cap. 12.
a Sacramental speech, because of the Of the Lords Supper. Sacramental
manner of the Predicate, or of that which is reported, for that it is reported
of bread, not properlye but Sacramentallye, that it is the Lords body given
for us. I do leave to each word his proper signification* that the bread be
very bread, the body the very body of the Lord, and that is be is, but I can
not make the manner of the predicate, or report to be proper, unless I
should make an intolerable confusion and unreasonable in this matter, but
Sacramental, and convenient to a Sacrament. Therefore let us agree in
judgment, that the bread of the supper is the very body of Christ crucified,
and dead for us, as he said; Take* eat, this is my body which is delivered
for you, and so let us keep these words every one in their proper
signification, and when the manner is asked how bread is the lords body, let
us say that it is a report or speech not natural, but sacramental, so that the
bread is the Lords body, neither naturally, nor corporally nor personally* no^
really, but sacramentally. Iren. lib. 4. cap. 34. Tertul. against Marcio lib.
40. and against the Jews.
To be sacramentally, is to be according to the nature and mean of a sacrament,
as the bread in as much as it is a sacrament of the Lords body, in that
respect it is the Lords body given for us, in such order and way as is
convenient to sacraments, like as by the order and way of his own nature it
is bread. And it is therefore called the Sacrament of the Lords body, because
that by his ordinance it is the holy sign and remembrance of his body given
for us, by breaking and distribution of which, he does recommend the communion
of his body, and remembrance of his death unto his Church. It is one matter to
say of any thing what it is in deed of it self, Of the Lords supper. and
another matter to say what it is in this place at this present in some
special deed and purpose, according to the will and meaning of him that
appointed and gave it. If a man take this saying, Hoc est corpus meum, in a
natural sense, it is made impossible and unreasonable. But if a man take it in
the sacramental sense* shall be said of bread, not what it is naturally and
substantially, but what the Lord vvoulde have it to be sacramentally, and for
what he would have it taken, and to what use he appointed them the breaking,
distribution, and communion of it.


PA. How is Christ's body present to the receyuers?


TI. Christ's true body is truly present to them that truly receive him, but
John 6. 50 1. cor. 10. 14. ephe. 3. 17.
spiritually And so is it taken after a spiritual sort, for when he said, This
is my body, it is all one as if he had said, This is the breaking of my body,
This is the shedding of my blood, as often as you shall do this, it shall put
you in remembrance of the breaking of my body. And the shedding of my blood:
that as surely as you receive this sacrament, so truly shall you receive the
benefit promised by receiving the same worthily This I say that Christ
enters into us, both by our ears, and by our eyes, with our mouth we
receive the body of Christ, and tear it with our teeth, that is to say, the
sacrament of the body of Christ. Wherefore I say and affirm, that the virtue
of the sacrament is much, and therefore Chysostom many times speaks of
sacraments no otherwise then of Christ himself. No man sees Christ upon the
earth, he is seen with the eyes of our mind, with faith and spirit.


Of the Lords Supper. PA. How do our bodies receive Christ's natural body?


TI. As Christ, not after his manhood, but after his divine nature, lives
naturallye by his Father, which divine nature of his, works also in his
manhood an immortalitye: so our spirit and soul receiving the natural body
of Christ in the mysteries by John. 6, 35 acts. 4, 10, 12 rom 4, 24, 2^ and 5,
8 and 14. 9.
faith, do receive also then nature of his body, that is, his pureness,
justification, innocence, power, glorification, life, eternity, and beatitude,
the operation whereof redounding likewise unto our bodies, do make the same
also capable of the same glory and immortality. And thus it is true, that as
Christ lives naturallye by his father, so we live naturally by the body of
Christ, eaten in the mysteries, having respect both to the manhood of him and
of us, for as the flesh of Christ, in respect of bare flesh, lives not
naturally by the father, but for that it is joined to his divinity, so our
flesh lives not naturally by Christ's body eaten in the Sacrament* for then
every wicked man eating the sacrament should live naturally by him, but for
that our flesh Rom 9. 3 1 cor. 12, 12 13. ephesians. 4. 15, 16 and 5. 30 gal 3. 27.
is joined to the spirit and soul which truly ^ateth the body of Christ by
faith, and so only the bodies of the faithful do live by eating the body of
Christ naturally, in participating the natural properties of the body of
Christ.


PA. After what ^ort is Christ present in the supper?


TI. Christ that sits in heaven, is present in the supper in mystery and by
grace, and is ^olden of the godly, such as communicate him, not only
sacramentallye with the hand of the body, but mu^he Of the Lords Supper. more
holesomly with the hand of the Cyp. of the Lords supper Agust. upon John,
treatise 25 Origin in Math cap. 15.
heart, and by inward drinking, he is received: but by the Sacramental
signification he is holden of all men. The Sactamentall sort of eating Christ's
body, is iterated as often as the Lords supper is celebrated, which is not
iterated often times to this end, that we should iterate the eating and
receiving of the Lords body in very deed, like as we do with corporal meat,
which does perish after it is eaten, but to the intent that in celebrating the
remembrance of the Lords death, according unto his institution, we may feed
our faith in him, and offer a sacrafice of praise unto our Redeemer. For as the
bread of life once truly eaten and received, vvasteth not after it is eaten
and received, so it does not require to have the iteration of eating and
receiving, for it sticks by them, feeding them into everlasting life which
are once made partakers thereof. Hereof I do admonish men, because of the
ignorant, that they do not refer the iterating of this eating and receiving
to the very heavenly meat it self, but unto the sacrament thereof. The Ioh 6,
35. 51 54. 55. 1, corin. 11, 28, 29. 1, cor. 6. 15. and 12. 27. ephesians 4 15. 16.
and 5. 30.
continual and vncessing sort of eating Christ's body is not sacramental, but
spiritual, and that only have power and efficacy to feed unto everlasting
life, whereunto we must apply those things that be written in the sixth
Chapter of John. This is obtained by faith only, by which we incorporate into
Christ, and being once incorporate, do live in a continual fruition thereof,
by the grace of the redemption purchased by his flesh and blood. 1. Cor. 1. 30.
ephe. 1. 7. mat 2. 28. 1. tim. 2. 6 luke 10. 45 heb 9. 12. 15. 1. pet. 1. 18.
19 20.
To eat and drink the flesh and blood of Christ in this sort, is to be
continually refreshed, and continuallye to enjoy this Heavenly food, for as
Of the Lords Supper. Augustine says, This grace is not consumed with bitings,
This manner of John 6. 40. 41. 47. 48. 51. 53. 54. 58.
eating is to enjoy the everlasting life purchased by Christ's death, not only
in faith, but in very deed. The spiritual eating which I do acknowledge to be
in the Lords supper, does derogate nothing of that which I have said of the
coutinuall and vnceassing fruition of the body and blood of Christ, for that
spiritual eating is nothing else if it be well considered, but a certain
putting in ^uk. ^2. 19. 1. cor. 11. 24. 26
remembrance of this, whereby, and by the efficacy of calling to remembrance,
the grace of Christ once received is revived again in the hearts of the
faithful communicantes, by the faith in Christ's word, which is set fotth in
the supper* And this kind of chewing the cudd which is used in the Sacrament
of the Lords body and blood by faith, is not unfitly called the spiritual
eating, forasmuch as by it the heavenly meat is called up again into the mouth
of the heart to be ruminated, and does so by the sweetness thereof most
pleasantly ref^esh our spirit* and the meat is also by this order made more
sauory and effectual.


PA. Tell me what it is to be spiritually present?


TI. To be Ioh. 6. 40. 6^.
spiritually present, is to be in a spiritual sort, that is, in such sort as
appertains to spirits. Wherefore when we say that Christ is spiritually
present in the supper, we do not mean of the invisible presence of his body,
which the papists do appoint under the forms of bread, but of that way that he
is present by the working of his spirit fe^ding and refreshing their minds
which do receive with sincere and true faith that which he gave at his last
supper. The truth of the sacrament delivered Of the Lords Supper. by Christ,
is not in the Ioh 6. 54. 55* 56. 63.
corporal presence of his body in the bread, but in the truth of the word and
the efficacy of his invisible grace Our whole salvation does stand in this
point, that the Math 20. 24. rom* 4. 25. gal. ^ 20. ephesians. 5. 2. 1 timothy 2. 6. tit
2, 14 heb. 1. 3. and ^, 27 and 9, 14 26, 28 and 10, 3 5, ^, 7, 10* 12. 14.
body of the only begotten son* is given for us to God the father unto death,
to be Math. 20, 28. gal. 3, 13 and 4, 5. 1 timothy 2, 6. tit 2, 14. 1 pet. (...)
19. apoc. 5. 9
an offering of propit^ation or mercy, and the ransom of our redemption. And
therefore we believe that Ch^istes death is auailable to the redemption of the
world, to the forgiveness of our sins, and for our reconcilement with God
the father. Moreover we believe that our only succor and refuge is to fly
to the mercy of our father by Jesus Christ, and assuredly to persuade our
minds that he is the obteiner of forgiveness for our sins, and that by
Math. 20, 28 titus 2. 14. 1 peter 1. 19 ^poc. ^. 9.
his blood all our spots of sin be washed clean, that he has pacified and
set at one all things by the blood of his cross, that he by the same one
only sacrifice which he once offered upon the cross, has brought to effect
and ^ulfilled all things, and that ^or that cause he said when he gave up the
ghost, John 19, 30.
It is finished, as though he would signify that the price and ransom was
now full paid for the sin of all mankind. Lastly, we agree in this unity in
the Lord, that that redemption once made in verity for the salvation of man,
continues in full effect for ever, and works without ceassing unto the end
of the world, that the sacrifice Heb. 5, 6 and 7 26 and 9 11. 12. ^4 and 10 9.
10.
once offered, cannot be consumed, that the Lords death and passion is as
effectual, the virtue of that blood once shed, as fresh at this day for the
washing away of our sins, as it was even the same day that it flovved out of
the blessed side of our savior.


Of the Lords Supper. PA. What couenances or similitudes be there in the
Lords supper?


TI. There must be three similitudes in this sacrament, a similitude of
nourishing of unity, and of conversion. The similitude of Ioh. 6. 35. 53 54,
55.
nourishing is this, that as the bread and wine do nourish our bodies, and
comfort our outvvarde man, so the body and blood of Christ be the meat and food
of our souls, and do comfort the inward man. Secondly, the similitude of
unity is this, that as this loaf of which we eat, was made of many corns
of wheat by the liquor of water knoden into dovve, and yet is but one loaf,
and as the wine was made of the juice of diverse grapes and yet is but one cup
of wine, so all they that eat Christ's body and drink his blood, being
many, Romans 9. 3. 1. co. 12. 12. 13 ephesians. 4, 15, 10 and 5. 30. gal. 3, 27.
are made one body and flesh, by the liquor of charity and love, are made (I
say) the mystical body of our savior Christ, which is his church, not his
natural body, for the bread is a Sacrament not only of his natural body, but
also of the congregation and mystical body, and therefore S. Paul says that
albeit we be many, yet notwithstanding we are one loaf and one body.
Thirdly, the similitude of conversion is this, that as the bread and wine is
turned into the substance of our bodies, so by the receiving of Christ's body
and blood we are turned Ioh. 15, ^, 6 7 1 cor. 6. 17. 2 peter 1. 4

Three manner of Sacraments. A Table declaring three manner of presence, eating,
and union, with diverse and sundry respects, how the holy real body of Christ
our savior, both in the Sacrament and besides the Sacrament, i^ present,
eaten, and united to us.

of Christ was really present once here on earth with us, and shall be again at
the day of his coming Otherwise it is not here really present, but only to
our faith really apprehending his body in heaven, and here feeding upon the
same in earth. And thus is he present only to good men, whether with the
Symbols or without the Symbols.

The body of Christ is spiritually present, when either the body of Christ is
present to our Ioh. 6. 40. 63
spirit and faith, or when the virtue of his body is present, and redoundeth to
our bodies and spirits by grace, and this differe^h from the other real
presence above in this, that the one has respect to the body apprehended, the
other to the thing that does apprehend.

The body of Christ is sacramentally present by Genesis 17. 10. 11. and 41. 26.

his body: and this sacramental presence pertaining to the outvvarde mouth of

sacramental presence ought not to be alone, but to be joined with the
spiritual presence, etc.

we eat the body and blood of Christ, not with mouth and teeth, but with
faith only, whensoever we believe on the passion of Christ, being the true
bread of life and the only food of man's soul: and thus is he eaten but only

of good men, asvvell beside the Sacrament as with the Sacrament, and of this
eating speaks the sixth of John, and so was he eaten in the time also of the
old law.

Sacramentally we eat with our bodily mouth the mysteries of bread and
wine, not being the Real body in deed, but representing the Real body in
deed, that is, Aug. de ciui*tat lib. 21* cap. ^5 Aug. Treat. upon John. ^6
Non panem Dominum, sed panem Domini. And this eating, if it be not iovned
with the other two above, it profits nothing, and so is eaten only of the
evil, if it be adjoined, then is it eaten of the good, and them it profits.

Really and corporally the body of Christ is united to us by his incarnation,
and the partaking of our flesh* spiritually he is united unto us when the
properties of his holy body, as his innocence, power, glorification, life,
eternity, and beatitude, are united to our bodies and spirits, which comes
by our faith in him, according to his words John 17. 21.
John. 17. Ego in ^is and tu in m^. And this uniting standing by grace, comes
as well beside the Sacrament as with the Sacrament, only to the Godly.

The body of Christ sacramentally united: The Sacrament, as it is not the Math

any Real conjunction between Christ's real body and ours, but represents
the same, declaring that as the material bread digested in our body is united
to the same, so the body of Christ being received John 6, 35 acts 4, 10, 12
rom 4, 24 and 5, 8 and 14, 9 1 cor. 10, 5, 6 ephe. 3, 17.
by ^aith, changes our spirits and bodies to the nature of him. To the
sacramental presence and eating of Christ pertains two things chiefly to be
considered, that is, Mutation, Operation. Mutation is substantial, or
accidental. Mutation substantial is, vvherby one substance is changed into
another, as John 2. 9.
water into wine, the rod of Exo. 4, 2, 3, 4 and 7. 11. 12.

No mutation of substances in the sacrament.


* Aaron into a Serpent, etc.

And this mutation, which they call transubstantiation, Math. 26. 26 27, 28. 1
cor. 10, 16, 17 and 11, 24, 25.
belongs nothing to this sacrament, for then accidents of bread should also
be changed as the accidents of Aarons rod were changed with the substance
into a Serpent.

Mutation accidental. And of this mutation speak the Theodoret. 1 dial

things, first in the use, second in name, and third in honor. In the use, as
when the use of common bread is changed into a mystical and heavenly use, In
name, as when the name of bread and wine pass away, and are changed into the
name of the body and blood of the Lord, and so is the name changed. In honor,
as when the bread and wine, which before were received not with honor, are
now received with honor and reverence, not that we honourthe bread and
wine, but the things represented by them, as in a kings Letters and seal
we honor the king and not the seal.

Operation in the sacraments and of the sacraments Of three manner of presence.
is to be considered. The operation of the word in the sacrament is this, to
change not the ^ substance b 1 Cor, 10. 16 17. 1 cor. 11. 24 26 27. 28.
of the sacrament, but that the substance thereof remaining, may be made the
body of Christ, that is sacrament of the body of Christ. And this Operation
can not come but by the holy Ghost, whereof Augustine lib. 3 cap. 4. de
Trinitate says, Pa^^non sanctificatur in Sacramentum tam mag^um, ^si operante
inui^^^^liter spiritu Dei: The operation of the Math 3. 11. ioh. 3, 5 and 15,
3. romans ^, 9, 10 1 cor. 10, 1, 2, 5 ephe. 5, 25, 26. 2 pet. 3. 21.
sacraments is thought of the Papists to give grace, which in very deed give
not grace of their own work, but only serve as instruments and means of
that grace and life which comes from God. So Peter calls it, Verb^^ vit^,
The word of life. And S Paul calls the gospel of Christ, the power of God
to salvation, not that they of them selves give life and salvation, but that
they are certain means and instruments of that life and salvation which
comes to us from God.

To the spiritual presence and manducation of Christ principally belongs
the sixth Chapter of John, albeit two sorts of bread are there specified
bodily or sacramental bread, and spiritual bread. Bodilye or sacramental
bread of the old Testament, signifies Christ to come, Number. 11, 6 and ^6.
24. psalm. 106* 14. exodus 17. 6. ^ cor. 10, 3, 4.

signifies Christ being already come, as the holy Euchariste. Augustine in

not taste of the meat of everlasting life, the Lords body and blood, although
that he amongst the rest do participate of the bread and cup of the Lord.

PA Let me hear what thou think concerning perseverance in prayer?


TI. Concerning perseverance in prayer, Christ him self reaches us by the
parable of the Luke 11. 8 and 18. 1 and 21, ^6. romans 12. 12 ephe. 6, 18 collos.
4, ^ these. 5 17 1 timothy 2, 1 1 peter 4, 7.
three loaves, and of the widow, and of the wicked judge, whereby we are
taught to continue in prayer* with all earnestnes and fervent supplication, and
never to faint or give over until we be assured in our spirit that our prayer
is heard. The prayer of the humble (says the son of Syrach) goes through
the clouds, it ceasseth not until it come near, and it will not depart
until the most hie God have respect thereunto Behold (says David) Psalm. 12^.
2*
as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their masters, and as the eyes
of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress, so our eyes wait upon the Lord
our God, until he have mercy upon us. And thus must we not cease to do,
until we may boldly say also with David. Psalm. 66. 19 20.
The lord has heard the voice of my vveping, the Lord has received my prayer.


PA. What comparison is there betvveen the old man and the new?


TI. A man that is regenerate, consists of two men, as a man may say, namely
of the old Romans 7, 6 ephe. 4 22. ^ pet. 1. 23 collos. 3. 10.
m^n, and of the new man. The old man is ^ike to a mighty Grant, whose birth
is now perfect: but the new man is like unto a little child, whose birth is
not perfect until the day of his general resurtection. The old man therefore
is more strong, lusty, and stirring, the^ is the new man, because the birth
of the new man A comparison betwe^ne the old man and the new. is but begun
now, and the old man is perfectly borne. And as the old man is more stirring,
lusty, and stronger then the new man, so is the nature of him clean Romans 7.
15. ^6. 22. 23.
contrary to the nature of the new man, as being earthly and corrupt with
satan's seed, the nature of the new man being heavenly, and blessed with the
celestial seed of God. So that one man, in as much as he is corrupt with the
seed of the Serpent, is an old man, and in as much as he is blessed with the
seed of God from above, he is ^ new man And as in as much as he is an old man,
he is a sinner, and an enemy to God, so in as much as he is regenerate, he Romans
6. 5, 6. 7 gal. 5. 19. 16. 1. pet. 2. 24. 1. ^ohn 3. 9.
is righteous and holy, and a friend ^o God, the seed of God preserving him
from sin, so that he cannot sin as the seed of the serpent, wherewith he
is corrupt even from his conception, inclines him, yea enforces him to sin,
and nothing else but to sin, so that the best part in man before
regeneration, in Gods sight is not only an enemy, but emnitie it self. One
man therefore which is regenerate, well may be called alvvayes just, and
alvvayes sinful: Col 3. 10. 1. john. 3. 9.
just in respect of Gods seed and his regeneration, sinful in respect of Sa
tans seed and his first birth. Betwixt these two me^ therefore there is
continual conflict and war most deadly. The flesh and old m^n by reason
of his birth that is perfect, does ofter for a time Romans 7. 15.
prevail against the new man, being but a child in comparison, and that in
such sort as not only other, but even the children of God them selves think
that they be nothing else but old, and that the spirit and Psalm. 51. 12.

cecytie or blindness and corrupt affections, do often shadovve the sight of
Gods seed from shining in Gods children, as though they were plain

holds his hand under his children in their falls, that they lie not still as
others do which are not regenerate. And this is the difference betvveene Gods
children which are regenerate and elect before all times in Christ, and the
wicked castavvayes, that the electly not still 1. Ioh. 3. 8, 9.

again by reason of Gods seed which in them lies hid as a sparkle of fire
in the ashes, as we may see in Peter, David, Paul, Mary Magdalene, and other,

whom he has given this dignity, that they should be his inheritance and

spiritually, all that we have perteining to him, yea even our sins, as all that ever he has pertains to us, even his whole glory, so that if Satan
should summon us to answer for our debts or sins. In that the wife is no
suitable person but the husband, we may well bid him enter his action against
our husband Christ, and he will make him a sufficient answer. For this end
(I mean that we might be coupled and married thus to Christ, Psalm. 45. 11

and so be certain of salvation, and at godly peace with God in our
consciences) God has given us his holy word which has two parts, a^ now the
children of God do consist of two men, one part of Gods word being proper
to the old man, and the other part of Gods word being proper to the new man.
The part properly pertaining to the old man, is the law. The part properly
pertaining to the new man, is the gospel. The Romans 3* 20 and 5* ^0 and 7. 7
gal. 3. 19. 1 timothy 1, 9
law is a doctrine which commands and forbids, requiring, doing and
avoiding, under it, therefore are contained al precepts, threatenings, promises
upon condition of our doing and avoiding. 2 Cor. 4, 6 ^ tim. 1. 10 ephesians. 6,
15 acts 13, 26 and 28. 28 romans 1, 16.
The gospel is a doctrine which always offers and gives, requiring on our
behalf not as of worthiness, or as a cause, but as a certificat unto us, and
therefore under it are contained all the free sweet promises of God, as I am
the Lord thy God. In those that be of years of Acts 5. 20 phil. 2, 15 math.
25, 19 mar. 16, 15, 16
discretion it requires faith, not as a cause, but a^ a certificate or
instrument A comp^rison between the old man and the new. whereby we our
selves may be certain of our good husband Christ and of his glory: and
therefore when the conscience feels it self disquieted for fear of Gods
judgment against sin* she may in no wise look upon the doctrine pertaining
to the old man, but upon the doctrine only that pertains to the new man in it,
not loking for that which it requires; that is faith, because we never believe
as we should but only on it which it offers and gives, that is on Gods
grace and eternal mercy and peace in Christ. So shall she be in quiet when she
looks for it altogether out of her self in Gods mercy in Christ Jesus, John
13, 23
in whose lap if she lay her head with Saint John, then is she happy and shall
find quietness in deed, when she feels her self quiet, then in Gods
name let her look on the law, and upon such things as it requires,
thereby to bridle and keep down the old Adam, and by little and little to
mortify the lust of sin, until in the end she be holy like as her Husband
is: for as the Wife will keep her bed only for her husband, although in other
things she is contented to have fellowshippe with others, as to speak, sit,
eat, drink, go: So our Consciences which are Christ's wives, must needs
keep the Cantic 1, 15 and 3. 7.
bed, that is, Gods sweet promises, alonely for our selves and our husband,
there to meet together, to embrace and laugh together, and to be joyful
together, if sin, the ^awe, the dinell, or any other thing would creep into
the bed, and lie there, then complain to thy Husband Christ, and forthwith

PA. Because Gods election and predestination are the greatest mysteries of our
salvation, and although joyful to the godly, yet fearful to the wicked, ^
vvoulde at the last have thee shevve me thy knowledge in them.


TI. Predestination is as well to the reprobate as to the elect. Election only
pertains to them that be saved: predestination in that it respects the
reprobate, is called Reprobation, in that it respects the saved, is called
election, and is thus defined. Predestination is the eternal Genesis 27. 20. ephe.
1. 11. prouer. 20. 24. iere. 10, 23. math. 10. 29. genesis 45. 8.
decreement of God, purposed before in himself what shall befall of all men,
Ephe. 1. 5. 6. romans 9. 23. 2 these. 2, 13. 1. pet. 1. 2.
either to salvation, Exodus 9. 16. prou. 16, 4. rom, 9, 22.
or damnation. Election is the Deuteronomy. 4* 37. and 7, 78. psalm. 44, 3. john 15,
16. acts, 13, 48 rom 5, 6 and 9 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. etc.
free mercy and grace of God in his own will through faith in Christ his
son, choosing and preferring to life such as pleases him. In this definition
of election, first goes before the mercy and grace of God, as the causes
thereof, vvherby are excluded al works of the law and merits of deserving;
whether they go before faith or come after. So was Genesis 25. 21. mal. 4, 2
rom 11.
Jacob chosen and Esau refused, before either of them began to work.
Secondlye, in that this mercy and grace of God in this definition, is said to
be free, whereby is to be noted the proceeding and vvorking of God not to be
bound to any John 3, 8 math. 3, 9 john 8, 39.
ordinary place, or to any succession of chair, nor to state or dignity of
person, nor to worthiness of blood, but all goes by the mere will of his
own purpose, as it is written, Spiritus vbi v^lt spirat etc. And thus was
the outvvard race and stock of Abraham after the flesh refused, which seemed
to have the pre-eminence. And another seed after the spirit Notes upon Gods
election. raised up to Abraham of the stones, that is, of the Gentiles. So was
the outward Temple of Jerusalem and chair of Moses, which seemed to be of
price, forsaken, and Gods chair to be advanced in other nations. 1 Samuel 15, 23
28. luke 1, 52.
So was tall Saul refused, and little David accepted: Esai 61, 1. math* 11, 5
and lu. 4, 18 and 3. 5. 1 cor. 1, 20 16. 27.
the rich, the proud, the wise of this world rejected, and the word of
salvation daily opened to the poor and miserable abiects, the high mountains
cast under, and the low valleys exalted

him that runs, but in God that shows mercy. So we see how Israel ran
long and got nothing, The Gentiles uneath began to set out, and yet got the
game: So they which came at the first hour did labour^ more, and yet they
which came last were revvarded with the first. The vvorking will of the
Pharisee seemed better, but yet the Lords vvil was rather to justify the
Publicane. The elder son had a better will ^o tarry by his father, and so
did indeed, and yet the fat Calfe was given to the younger son that ran
away. Deuteronomy. 10. 17. 1 chronicles. 19. 7 job. 34, 19 acts 10, 34 romans 1, 11 gal. 1.

Whereby we have to understand: how the matter goes not by the will of man,
but by the vvil of God, as it pleases him to accept, according as it is
vvritte^, John. 1. 3.
which are born not of the will of the flesh, nor yet of the will of man, but
of God. Furthermore, as all then goes by the will of God only, and not by
the vvil of man, so again here is to be noted, that this will of God never
goes without faith in Christ Jesus his son. And therefore fourthly is this

faith in Christ his son, which Faith in Christ to usward makes altogether,
for first it certifieth us of Gods election, for whosoever will be certain
of his election in God, let him first begin with his faith in Christ, which
if we find in him to stand firm, he may be sure and nothing doubt, but that he
is one of the number of Gods elect. Secondly, the said faith and nothing else,
is the only condition and means, vvhereupon Gods mercy, grace, election,
vocation, and all other Gods promises to salvation do stay, according to the
words of Saint Paul, If ye abide in the faith. Col. 1. Thirdly, this faith
also is the immediate and next cause of our Ioh. 3, 16 and 5, 24 and 7, 38 and

his grace, election, vocation, and other precedent causes, do save and justify
us, upon condition if we believe in Christ. So this faith only in Christ

condition is the next and immediate cause which by Gods promise works our
justification, according as it is written. Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou
shall be saved, thou and thy whole house. Act 6. And thus much touching the
definition of election with the causes thereof declared, which you see now to
be no merits nor works of man, whether they go before, or come after faith,
but only the mercy of God through faith. For like as al they that be born of
Adam do taste of his Romans 5. 12 1. cor. 15. 22 45 47. eccle 40. 1 and 14.

Christ, which is by faith, take part of the obedience of Christ, although they
never did that obedience themselves which was in him. Romans 5

order and connection of causes is diligently to be observed, because of the
Papists which have miserably confounded and inuerted this doctrine, thus
teaching, that almighty God, so fa^ forth as he foreseeth man's merits before
to come, so does he dispense his election. And again, the Lord recompenceth the
grace of the election, not to any merits preceding, but yet grants the same
to me ^its which follow after, as though we had our election by our holiness
that follows after, and not rather have our holiness by Gods elect on going
before. But we follovving the scripture say otherwise, that the cause only of
Gods election is his own Ephe 1. 4. 5. 11 and 2, 10. collos. 1. 12. ^ tim. 1,

Papists falsely pretends, but only by election, and Ephe. 2. 8. philip. 1.

being so linked with Gods mercy and election, that wheresoever election goes
before, there faith in Christ must needs follow after. And again, whosoever
believes in Christ Jesus, through the vocation of God, he must needs be
partaker of Gods election, whereupon resulteth now the Faith (...) us we are
chosen. Notes upon Gods election. third note or consideration, which is, to
consider whether a man in this life may be certain of his 1 Cor. 2. 10. 11.

election. To answer to which question, this first is to be understood, that
although our election and vocation simply in deed be known to God only in
him self from the beginning, yet notvvithstanding it may be known to every
particular faithful man, a poster^^re, that is, by means, which means is faith
in Christ Jesus crucified, for so much as by his faith in Christ a man is
justified, and there by made the child of salvation. Reason must needs lead
the same to be then the child of election, chosen of God unto eternal life:
for how can a man be justified but he must be saved, and how can a man be
saved but by consequence it follovveth that he must also be elected? and
therefore of election it is truly said, we must judge of election by that which
comes after, thatis, by our faith and Esa. 53. 1. and 54. 13. ioh. 12. 39.

belief in Christ, which faith although in time it follovveth after election, yet
it is the proper and immediate cause assigned by the scripture, which not
only justifies us, but also certifieth us of this election of God. For
election albeit in God it be the first, yet to us it is the last opened, and
therefore beginning first with creation, I come from thence to redemption and
justification by faith, and so to election, not that faith is the cause
efficient of election, being rather the effect thereof, but is to us the cause
certificatorye, or the cause of our certification, whereby we are brought to
the feeling and knowledge of our election in Christ. For albeit that election
first is certain in the 2 Reg. 1^. 18. romans 11. 3. 2. tim. 2. 19.

is the The elect cannot perish. Notes upon Gods election. Math. 13. 22* and 24.

thing that gives to us our certificate and comfort of this election,
wherefore whosoever desires to be assured that he is one of the elect
members of God, let him not clime up into heaven to know, but let him descend
to himself, and the^e search h^^ says in Christ the son of God, which if he
find in him not fained by the working of Gods holy spirit accordingly,
thereuppon let him stay, and so vvrap him self wholy both body and soul
under Gods general promise, and cumber his head with no further speculations,
knovving this, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish. Ioh. 3. shall not
be confounded. Romans ^. shall not see death. Ioh. 8. shall not enter into

1^. shall be raised in the last day Ioh. 6. shall find rest in his soul, and
shall be refreshed. Math. 11. Now then forasmuch as we see faith to be the
ground vvhereupon depends the whole condition of our justifying, let us
discuss in like manner, what is this faith vvherof the scripture so much
speaks, for the more plain understanding of the simple, for many kinds
there be of faith, as a man may believe every thing that is true, yet not every
truth does save, neither does the Math. 7. 22. luke 12. 47. romans 1. 32. 1.
cor. 13. 2. iam 2. 26. titus 1. 16.
believing of every truth justify a man. He that be leeueth that God created
all things of naught, believes truly. He that believes that God is a just
God, that he is omnipotent, that he is merciful, that he is true of promise,
believes well, and holds the truth.

Christ ^y ^^yth received. Notes upon Gods election. So he that believes that
God has his election from the beginning, and that he also is one of the same
elect and predestinate, has a good belief, and thinks well, but yet this
belief alone, except it be seasoned with another thing, will not serve to
salvation, as it auayled not the old Jews, which so thought of themselves,
and yet think to this day to be Gods elect people; Only the faith which
avails to salvation, is that whose object is the body and passion of Jesus
Christ crucified, so that in the Act of justifying, these two, faith and
Christ, have a mutual relation, and must alvvayes concur together, faith as
the Action which apprehends, Christ as the object which is apprehended: for
neither John 17, 21 romans 9, 5^ col. 2, 7. 1 cor. 10 16. romans 8, 50. 1 corin. 1,
30.
does the passion of Christ save without faith, neither does faith help,
except it be in Christ. As we see the body of man ^ustained by bread and
drink, not except the same be received* and conuayed into the stomach, and
yet neither does the receiving of every thing sustain man's body, except it be
meat and drink which have power to give nourishment. In like fort it is with
faith, for neither does the believing of every thing save, but only faith in
the blood of Christ; neither again does the same blood of Christ profit us,
except by faith it be received. And as the sun being the cause of al light,
shines not but to the^ only which have eyes to see, nor yet to them neither
unless they will open their eyes to receive the light, so the passion of
Christ is the efficiente cause of salvation, but faith is the condition whereby
the said passion is to us effectual. And that is the cause why we say with the
scripture, that faith Genes. 15, 6 hahak. 2, 4 math. 9, 22 mark 5, 36 ^uke 7,
50 acts 10, 43 and 15, 9. romans 3, 23, 24 28 and 4. 5 and 5. 1. galat* 2, 16 and

only justifies us, not excluding thereby all other extern Christ and faith
must not be separated. Notes upon Gods election. causes that go before, as
grace, mercy election, vocation, the death of Christ, etc. al which be externe
causes vvorking our salvation through faith. But when we say, that faith only
justifies us, the meaning thereof is this, that of al internal actions,
motions or operations in man given to him of God, there is no other that
contenteth and pleases God, or stands before his judgment, or can help any
thing to the justifying of man before him, but only this one action of faith
in Jesus Christ the son of God, for although the action of praying, fasting,
alms, patience, charity, repentance, the fear and love of God be high gifts
in man, and not of man, given of God to man: yet be none of al these actions in
man imputed of God to salvation, but only this one action of faith in man, upon
Christ Jesus the son of God, not that the action it self of believing, as
it is a quality in man, does so deserve, but because it takes that dignitye
of the object, for faith, as it is an action in man, is not to be considered
alone, but must ever go with his object, and takes his virtue thereof. Like
as the looking up of the old Israelites, did not of it self procure any
health unto them, but the promise made in the object, which was the brazen
Numb. 21, 9 john 3, 14.
Serpent whereupon they looked, gave them health by their looking up; Even so,
after like sort are we saved by our faith and spiritual looking up to the
body of Christ crucified, which faith to define is this. John 3, 15, 16, 18.
