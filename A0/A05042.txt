The Lamentation of a new married man, briefly declaring the sorrow and grief
that comes by marrying a young wanton wife
To the tune of, Where is my true Love,
YOu Batchelors that brave it
So gallant in the street,
With Musk and with Rose water,
Smelling all so sweet:
With shoes of Spanish leather,
So f^a^ely to your feet,
Behold me a married man.
Before that I was wedded,
I lived in delight,
I went unto the dancing school,
I learnd at Fence to fight:
With twenty other pleasures,
That now are banished quite,
I being a etc.
When I lived single,
I knew no cause of strife,
I had my heart in quiet,
I led a pleasant life-
But now my chiefest study
Is how to please my Wife,
I being a married man.
Quoth she, You do not love me,
To leave me all alone,
You must go a gadding,
And I must bide at home,
While you among your minions,
Spend more then is your own:
This life leads a etc.
Do you think to keep me
So like a drudge each day,
To toil and moile so sadly
And lame me every way?
I Will have a Maid, by Lady,
Shall work while I do play,
This life etc,
Then must I give attendance
Upon my Mistress heels,
I must wait before her,
While she does walk the Fields,
Shee^l eat no meat but Lobsters,
And pretty Girgs and Eeles,
This life etc
Then must I get her Cherries,
And dainty Rathern Pears,
And then longs for Codlings,
She breeds Child she swears
When God knows it is a cushion
That she about her bears,
This life etc.
She must have Rabbet suckers,
Without spot or specke,
I must buy her Pescods
At sixteen groats the Pecke
She must have Eggs and white wine
To wash her face and neck:
This life etc.
If once to pass it comes,
That she is brought to bed,
Why then with many dainties
She must be daily fed,
A hundred toys and trifles
Comes then within her head:
This life etc.
Against that she is churched,
A new Gown she must have:
A dainty fine Rebato
About her neck so brave:
French bo^dies, with a Farthingale
She never linnes to crave
This life etc.
Abroad among her Gossips
Then must she daily go:
Requesting of this favor
A man must not say no,
Lest that an unkind ^uarrell
About this matter grow
This life etc.
To offerings and to Wedings:
Abroad that she must prance,
Whereas with lusty youngsters
This gallant dame must dance:
Her husband must say nothing,
What hap soever chance:
This life etc.
And then there is no remedy,
She must go to a play,
To purge abounding Choler,
And drive sad dumps away:
She tarries out till midnight,
She sweates she will not stay,
This life etc.
When home at last she comes,
To bed she gets her soon,
And there she sleeps full soundly,
Till the next day at noon,
Then must she eat a Cawdle
With a silver spoone
This life etc.
Therefore my friends be warned,
You that unwedded be,
The troubles of a married man
You do most plainly see,
Who likes not of his living,
Would he would change with me,
That now am a etc.
Where I was wont full often
Good company to keep.
Now I must rock the Cradle,
And hush the child asleep,
I had no time nor leisure
Out of my doors to peep.
Since I was a married man,
The Second part. To the same Tune.
An answer sent to the young married man.
Written most friendly by his gentle Wife Nan.

Alack wherefore lament you,
your happy wedded state:
Therein you show great folly,
repentance come to late
To make your self a mocking stock
with every scoffing mate
Now you are a married young man.
In youth, do well remember,
Your mind was all on pride:
Deceiving sport and pleasure,
Your lavish thoughts did guide,
It Is time such foolish fancies
should now be laid aside,
Now you are etc,
When you lived single,
Your time, you vainly spent:
Unto unlawful pastime.
Your youngling wits were bent
But now you must learn wisedo^e,
discredit to prevent,
Since you are etc,
An alas to estimation,
Longs to a single life,
What were you but skip Jack,
Before you had a wife,
A ma^e for every madcap,
a stirrer up of strife,
Till you were etc,
A Wife has won you credit,
A Wife makes you esteemed
An honest man through marriage
Now are you surely deem^d.
And you shall find at all times;
A wife your dearest friend,
Now you are etc.
Then is it right and reason,
Your wife should pleased be,
It is a happy household
Where couples do agree,
It has delight the Angels,
such Concord for to see,
Then blessed is the etc.
If I do blame your gadding
It is for love, be sure,
Bad company does always
Ill counsel still procure
The man that will be thrifty,
must at his work endure,
While he is etc.
This works his commendations
Amongst the very best.
The chief men of the Parish,
his quaintance will request,
And then he shall be called
To office with the rest
When he is a etc.
He shall be made a Head^orough
Unto his credit great,
At what time all the neighbors,
His friendship will entreat,
And then it is most decent,
he should go fine and neat.
UUhe^ he is a married young man,
Then bareheaded unto him,
A number daily flocks:
To help him by his office,
from many stumbling blocks:
Then comes he to be Constable,
and set knaves in the stocks:
Thus rises a etc.
His wife shall then be seated
in Church at her desire,
Her husband he is sideman,
and sits within the Quire,
Then he is made Churchwarden
and placed somewhat hier,
Great joy to a etc.
Then seeing all this credit
by marriage you do find,
Unto your wife it is reason,
you should be good and kind
And sometimes wait upon her
according to her mind
As best fits a etc.
If friendly you go with her
to walk out of the Town,
Why the^ you may have pleasure.
to give her a green Gown.
To have so great a favor,
some m^^ would give a crown
UUhich (...) etc.
As for the Pears and Apples,
you give me in the street.
The Cherries or the Codlings,
for pretty women meet,
At night I give you kindly
a thousand kisses sweet
Great joy to a etc.
A hundred other pleasures.
I do you then beside,
In bringing forth your Children
great sorrow I do bide.
For twenty Gowns and Kirtles,
the like would not be tried,
By any fine young married men.
Why should your scorn the Cradle
I tell you sir most plain,
There is not any pleasure.
but sometimes breeds pain,
If you will not be troubled.
why then good sir refrain
to play like a married young man
FINIS.
Printed by the Assigns o^ Thomas Symcock.
