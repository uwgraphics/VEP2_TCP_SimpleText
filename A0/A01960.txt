The praise of all women / called Mulieru^ Pean. Uery fruytfull and delectable
unto all the reders.

Look and read who that call. This book is praise to each woman.

WHat time ye crabbe hes course had past
And Phoebus atteyned the Aquarye
The self same time wha^ it frose fast
Amyddes the month of Ianuarye
I in my bed, and sleep in mine eye
A sodeyne assemble before me did appear
And women they seemed by abyte and chere.
A wake they said, sleep not so fast
Consider our grefe, and how we b^ blamed
And all by a book, that lately is past
Which by report, by the was first framed
The scole of wom^n, none auctour named
In prynte it is passed, lewdely compyled
All women whereby be sore reuyled.
Consider therein, thine own good name
Consider also our infamye
Send forth some other, contrary the same
For thine and outs, both honestye
The Pean thou wrote, and lies the bye
Be quycke herein, prolonge not thus
As thou would our savor, now do for us
Amongst all other, one b^ldely pressed
Obey said she shall thou / be thou ned so strong
Her male and he^ ^antell, she threw on my breast
For I am she said she, thou have do most wrong
A wake a wake, thou slepest over long
Uenus am I cleped, my name shall not be hyd
Now sharpen thy pen, and write as a the bid.
Of truth it is, write on quod she
The nature of man inclyneth to sin
Rather than virtue, and reason is why
Each nature does end, as it does begin
Salt will be water, thought none be therein
The tree of the cote, does take his verdure
The fruit whe^by, is known sweet or sour.
So at ye beginning, where man had that use
Of wit and reason, to be ruled by
By cause he offended, he made excuse
The fault allegynge, to the femynye
God to have dysceyued, if it would have be
And as he tho, to lie begone
So to this day, he holds on.
Of us pore women customably
Without cause just, to rail and jest
No nature naturate, under the sky
Fysshe, foul, worm, ne be
But with their own kind, the live at rest
Man of all other, of manners so rude
Can not say well by his symylytude.
A great abuse, and shamefully hold
Such frowardnes, in hand to have
The self same thing, which most they should
Laud and love, it to deprave
And that of need* which most they crave
So to improper, great folly it is
For in no wise they may us long mys.
Record the goodness, of god almighty
At the creacyon, which he began
Perceiving it could not endure a right
Without any help made to the man
Faciamus (said he) and made Eve than
The woman the man, to help and assyst
It follows therefore, we can not be mist
How be it, ye men fast pore and prye
All that ye may us women again
Nothing left out, ye may come by
Of holy writ, nor thot poets do feign
All is alleged as thing certain
And what that makes not, for your purpose
Shall be interpretate, with a lewd gloss.
Exemples many, faint and feeble
Mo than ye may well iustyfye
And say it is a thing impossyble
Any one good woman found to be
Which evil saying to ratyfye
A sense of Solomon ye aledge, which says
Mulierem fortem quis inueniet.
But as to that thou shall not tarry
Longer than needs to make report
As at this time them to contrary
By any exemple, the next to retor^
Taken an now of the living sort
Continue thy process, till thou may espy
A place therefore more necessary.
How should this world continued be
Man I mean in his most need
Were not women, what were ye
Examples many, hereof may ye read
And over that ye se in deed
How by the virtue of the femynyne face
Mirth increases, and thoughts give place.
Pri. Re. xviii.
Exempled in Saul, when he should fight
Agay^st the army phylystyne
Had neither heart, courage ^e might
Ne wist not what to do the^in
With hongry thought him self to pyne
Had not the woman him counseyled and f^^
For fear in that fury, Saul had be deed
When ye lie sick and like to dye
Who then attends you unto.
Were not the woman, there might ye lie
Donge in your den, as bestes do
The woman is ever ready to go
For this and that to watch and wake
You to recover many labors to take.
If that your finger other head ache
Or else what ayleth you, hand or foot
There can no medycyne the pain a^^ake
Without the woman be your bote
Lap you warm in clothes soft
A kercheyffe bond unto your hedde
And in her arms bear you to bed.
Night and day than must she wak^
And ready be at the first call
A culles or some caudel make
As for the sick does best befall
Oneles the woman come withal
No man can get him up to sytte
Thereof to taste morsel or bytte
Thus of ye woman great pleasures ye have
Which man to man can not suffyce
And yet ye do us all deprave
Saying we be neither sad ne wise
And that no profit by us does ry^e
Where as in truth record I can
As many arise as by the man.
A woman plain did first invent Ou^. meth* li.v.

All manner grain to inn and sow
Ceres named by comune assent
And for her wisdom, the people did know
Honors divine they did her show
And as her merytes did than express
They named her the good goddess.
And in like manner a woman found Isido. l^.i. ant. ix.

The letters first that we now write
The A.B.C. as they do stand
Whereby we use our minds to endyte
One to another full and perfyte
Carmenta called as I remember
Mother unto the famous Euander.
Pallas the daughter of Iupyter
August. de ciuita lib. v^i. and Oui. in fast. etc.
Through her entere and pured brain
The goddess named of the artyfycer
Of wolle and oil, first found the vain
For which inuencyon the story is plain
Preferred she was before Neptune
To give the name to Athenes town.
Soppho the poetresse did also find
With the harp to sing the tune to wrest
Which greatly conforteth man's mind
With syghes of sorrow over pressed
i. Reg. xvi.
Saul the king could never have rest
Till Dauyd had harpyd a fytte or two
The malygne spryte, would not him fro.
The Sybbilles.xii. did prophecy
The sone of god should man become
One of them showed the mystery
Unto Octauyan in the son
Many is the years, that sith is run
And yet the church does occupye
The self same Sybbilles prophecye.
Hystoryes many I could forth lay
That makes well with the feminye
Of like sentence I dare well say
And grounded on good auctoryte
How be it because that poetry
Is taken now in such despyte
Of other reasons, I will thou write
But first this questyon, ^ske quod she
Demurely, and after a gentyl rate.
To whom be holden more are y^
Unto the man that you begat*
Or to the woman puerperate
I know no reason for your excuse
But that it should your selves confuse.
As soon as the woman, does conceive
Full diverse is her appetyde
Both belly and heart does rise and heu^
The stomach seldom satysfyde
For many sundry meats provide
Long for more than she may get.
And many a sorry morsel ete.
In case she may it not obtain
Hard she escapes with the life
And in her labor such is the pain
That as god knows the urgent grefe
Without a gracyous prerogatyfe
Ware thing, no doubt, impossyble
She should escape, and after have hele.
And when she is delivered
Syke and weep contynually
And as ye know but little considered
With many a man, the more blame he
Who but the woman must keeper be
Provide for every ragge and cloute
And in her arms bear you about.
In case the man such labor should tak^
I mean to bear you to and fro
His armer and shulders would so ache
That lame he would be of both two
The sely woman has never do
What in her arms and in her lap
Night and day she must you wrappe
Little or nothing may she rest
But always besy you for to keep
Arise and feed you with her breast
And all to still you when ye weep
Where of your self, ye can scant crepe
She must be ready to give you pappe
From wind and wether, you warm to lap.
The man may lie and snowre full fast
When that the wife must watch and wak^
Out of the bed her arms cast
The cradell to rock till they both ache
The babe also unto her take
And when he is unclean beneth
Must be content with many ill breath
Shyfte him often, wype and wesshe
Clou^es and clothes new prepare
And be it hard or be it nes^^e
She woman must do a way the ware
Thus has the mother all the care
All the labor and dyssease
Where as the father does what him please.
When that ye draw nere, xii. months old^
Than may the woman another rest ne sytte
But ^uer dadle you in sure hold
Till time that ye have found your fyt
Her breasts ye ^ere with many a byt
And scratche also with your sharp nails
And yet the woman you never fayles.
Where as the man would sure dysdayne
And be therewith impacyent
And peradventure stryke again
Another be eftsons so dylygent
If ons ye did him dyscontent
For as ye se when him myslyketh
The man daily his chylderne stryketh
The mother tendreth them always
And scant can suffer them in the wind
Of them in doubt both night and day^
Lest any male chance should them blind
Ough^ you not then to the woman to be kind
How be it ye have no better sport
Than of the woman evil to report^
Some say the woman had no tongue
After that god had her create
Untyll the man took leaves louge
And put them under her palate
An aspyn leffe of the dyuel he gatte
And for it moves with every wynd^
They say women's tongues be of like kind.
I say the fable rehearsed before
The truth well known is but a lie
All the clerks that ever were
Do write the same and testefye
That god made all thing parfetlye
How should the woman then t^nge have none
And be of gods creacyon,
Because that Eve our prime parent
The will of god did ons transgress
They blame all women in like consent
And make them self always fauteles
There be of women as of men doutles
All be it that diverse have offended
Yet ought not all to be reprehended
All manner clothe is not like fine
Nor yet all men complexyoned like
Some more of color, some more sanguyne
Some malancolye, some fleamatyke
Some long and small, some short and thycke
Not every man of one compleccyon
Nor every woman of one condycyon
Why should the woman then be blamed
More than ^he man, and he like bad
Me thynkes ye ought to be ashamed
And also in conscience sore adrade
In case that ye any conscience had
To. ii.
Wytnes saint Paul; it does no man beseme
Worse of a another than of him self to ^ome
Admytte that woman ^yrste offended
The man persuadynge to transgres
A woman was she, the fault that amended
By mean of her great humblenes. Genises.

Of man's restore the chief foundres
Eve was she that made us thrall
And Mary was she that ^oused all.
And over that in genesye
I find it written, that god did make
The woman for man an help to be
Not of vile earth out of the lake
But of a rybbe that he did take
Out of the man's right side
And the woman made of thing well tryde
Like as ye s^ by experyenc^
Gold torged ^f lead* ^ren and tynne
And is him self in his first essens
No better than the matter he was first in
And now more valued than man wyn^
Like so did god the femynyne
Plasmate of the ma^culyne.
Ye se also the rich Rubies
And other stones of hye ^eco^e
Set in gold at point deuyse
And in thing of small value
In symblable wise hy^rselfe Jesus
Would of the woman i^carnate be
Maiden and wife his mother Mary.
And sithe that god the woman create
Of thing thus pured, and not the man
To the end she should help him algate
Of congruence it follows than
That in no wise mysse ye can
The man (as who says) is the adiectyue
And the woman is plain the substantyue.
For as witnesses the accidence
The adiectyue may nothing do
Oneles it be under pretense
Of other substance put thereto
The man ^nlyke effect also
Without the wonans helping hand
By him self may not long stand
If a man without woman's consent
Might have redrest the first offense
It had not neded the omnipotent
To hau^ come him self to make y^ admendes
The woman was chosen by divine assenc^
To be through her humylyte
The well of our tranquily^y.
And who that lysteth the truth to try^
Shall find in the Bible through and through
That god did favor the femynyne
Many times as well as you
And in the woman did of renew
Against all natural dysposycyon
In steryll age parentall fruycyon.
As first in the book of Genesy^ Ge. iii. i. Reg. i. Iudici. xiii. iiii. Reg.
iiii.

Of Joseph, Isaac, and Samuel
With other mo in places sundry
As of Sampson ye may find well
Like of the Sunamyte befell
The Bible read and ye shall find
That these were borne past course of kind.
And in like case Elyzabeth Luce. i.

The mother, of holy Johan Baptyst
Saint Anne also as scripture says
Conceived Mary mother of Christ
Mary also that man never wist Math. i.

Conceived by grace both god and man
Maiden and mother both now and than
Thus have ye sure certifycate
That god much favors the femyn kind
Sithe he him self after such rate
Tendreth in them the devout mynd^
And furthermore no doubt I find
That god permytted man to make
Wonders many for the woman's sake.
As first we find by divine s^yracyon iiii. Reg iiii.

Done by the prophet Helysy^
A little oil and all by miracle
Made to increase and multyply Ibedem.

And to his hostyes by prophesye
Gave a child, and to the same wife Ibedem.

Restored he sone from death to life.
Over tha^ it may not be nayde
When man had broken the precepte
Seeing him self so nakedly arayde
For shame among the leaves (...) crepte
God him called, he no ^ot^ stepte
But blamed the woman for his consent
To fortyfye his his evil intent
But what said god, look and read
Genes.
Maladicta terra in opere tuo
Cursed be the earth thou do on feed
And sweet for thy living thou shall also
Mind had he none to call for grace tho
So where god made him of earth or than
If he cursed the earth, he cursed man
So of the woman it can not be said
For she of a rybbe was made before.
But for she was so lightly betrayde
Penance she had, but not so sore
Cursed was she not, how be it evermore
God said in chyldynge when she did lie
With sorrow her sede shusde multyply.
That man was cursed often we read
Gene. 9.iiii. re. ii Tren. i^. et Mala. ii.
Besides that I rehearsed have
As Chayn and Cham for their lewd deed
And those yt the prophet did mock and deprave
With other (no few) where as god gave
Many tym^s unto the woman
His blessing as well as to the man.
Thus all thing pondred in balance play^^
God favors always the femynitye
We then to have them in dysdayne
Stands not well with equytye
And who so said the good rare be
I durst adventure my heed to lose
To prove he lies that makes that gloss.
Thousands or two I dare well say
Of them that yet here living be
In full record forth bring I may
And seek not far out of the country
I could also many^estly
Diverse rehers and their names tell
The place assygnynge where they do dwell.
How be it as now it shall suffyce
Nf them that gone be many years past
Example to take and this treatise
By their goodness to make sure and fast
That none hereafter presume to cast
Fables forged of wylfull mind.
Against the devout femynyne kynde^
Abraham married one Sara^ Genes^^ xiiii.

A perfyte woman as other be mo
In word and deed always ready
To be obedyent him unto
God bad Abraham that he should go
Out of the land Cananye
In to Egypt from his kyn nigh
How be it before he thither came
In his conce^te thus waded he
Called his wife, and said good dame
One thing I will thou do for me
By mean dear wife of thy beautye
I doubt if thou be known my wife
That I perchance shall lose my life.
Say therefore my suster thou art
That I may fare the better for the
I shall (she said) with all my har^e
And else what do, that ye bid me
To help you in necessyte
There shall no p^rsone have knowledge other
But that ye be my natural brother
So into Egypt when that they came
Sarra was sent for to king Pharao
And for her sake was Abraham
The better take with friend and fo
Her brother she called him, he bad her so
How be it god punysshed the people sore
Till Pharao ot her had made restore
Ge. xx.
And in like manner afterward
When that he came to G^ratye
Abraham the bette^ farde
By reason of his w^^e Saray
God lykewys^ punysshe^ grievously
So that the king ^bym^lech
Gave him his wy^e wi^h a so^^ cheke.
Like case befell with Isaac
And Rebecca his trusty wife
Which in likewise did her forsake
And all for to enlength his life
The woman was his prerogatyfe
How say ye now by your lewd fable
Were not these women profitable.
God preserved Sarra twyse
And ons Rebacca gracyously
In case that they had done amys
It had be long of the man suerly
God would there should be no such folly
In the woman if ye mark well
Record Saara the daughter of Raguel.
To s^uen diverse married was she Thobi. vi. and.iii.

And always maiden arose them fro
Because the man would by and by
His carnal lust with her have do
No reverence given the sacrament unto
At night the devil was there always
And strangled them before the day.
Preserved was the femynyne
Because she was so virtuous
S^rangled were the masculyne
Because they were so vycyous
Sodom and Gomore, the lecherous
In brymstone we read does boil and bran Ge. xx.

For the myslyuynge of the man
The daughter of Jacob amyable Dyne
For the foul rape upon her done
Geneses xxxiii.
Her brethren two brought to ruin
The c^te and slew the masculyne echon^
Emmor the father and Sychem the son
God would they should such revel mak^
And on the men such vengeance take
Of Dauyd the daughter fair Thamar
ii. Reg. xiii.
Whom her own brother Amon by name
Faynynge him sick and she not ware
Against her will, she not to blame
Unlawfully used to his own shame
Long time bewailed her evil chance
In token plain she took repentance
Iosue. ii
Because Raab did them defend
From Iosue sent to Ierico
Holy write does her commend
And iustyfye her life also
Luce. vii.
Mary magdalyne another of tho
For her great ^ayth and contrycyon
Of all her crimes she had remyssyon
Whereby apereth plain and euydent
What grace is given the femynyne
For small offense so sore to repent
Recorded in Thamer and in Dyne
Where stubberne and styffe is the masculyne
A^am ^o wytnes which had no grace
Mercy to ask for his trespace.
And furthermore admyt the case
That many women have sore offended
And thousands mo done well often hase
Should all the name be dyscommended
Because the best nombre be reprehended
If that should be report me then
What might be spoken of the men
Large be the volumes in every nacyon
For ever in cronycle to remain
If ye perceive, and note the fasshyon
Euydens enough ye shall have plain
Against one woman, men twain
Ye twenty I dare auowe doubtless
Which be improued for their lewdenes
In token that man should be content
His wife to love especyally Genesis xxi

Abraham had strayte commandment
To follow the mind of Sarai
And so expulsed by and by
Agar his harlot out of his house
Against her maystres presumptuous.
How be it because of repentance
For none example of like folly
God did accept her meke penance
And quyte for gave her by and by
The angel was sent and bad her hye
Home again and know her dame
And god would multyply her fame.
Ibidem.
Again she came, her masters content
And ^ate Abraham one Ismaell
Which pas^ynge all other was more fervent
And passing reason more cruel
Than ever yet ye hard of ^ell
His ly^e during to war he was mouyd
He loved no man, nor none him loved.
So can be not read of any woman
Namely in wryttynge autentycall
To be so cruel as was this man
At war to be with one and all
O that ye men can fight and braule
And kill ^che other comenly
Which is not seen in the femynyne.
How be it there is found in holy wryt
That some women have done like case
Not to them self but marked to it
Of god only, b^ special grace
Such deeds marcyall to bring to pass
Judith. xiii.
That man might not Iudyth to wytnes
Which slew alone mighty Holofernes.
And in like case of Delbora
Whom god elect his prophet to be
The death to declare of Sisara

Where and when to sygnyfye
And gave her also more specially
Knowledge in many other cause
And made her judge over the lawse,
At mount Thabor as she did tell Iudic. v.

T^is captain dyscomfe^ fled out of ye thronge
The wife of Abner named Iah^l
Sisara slew lyenge a long

That she sauyd the Jews and hanged Aman.

A^uaunsed much in every place
Commandment gave for any case
The mydwyues of the Hebrean line
To kill and slay all masculyne.
And this we read in places two
But god would not the excercyse Ibedem.

So that the woman would it not do
But made excuse, after this wise
Abhorringe the shamfull enterprise
And said the Hebreans, in their needs
Can help them self and do such deeds.
About which time holy Moses
Into this world was brought and borne Exo. ii.

Three months kept in secretnes
Magre Pharao, though he had sworn
In a v^ele of russhes, to have be lorne

For their hye virtues excellent
As faith, wisdom, and mere pytye
With (...) in aduersytye
To wytnes the profyte^ Solda and Anne
With Saba the queen, to Solomon that came.

The testament new also tells me
After that Christ ^hese words had said

Luc. ii.
That faith in man was clear d^ceyde
In Mary his mother, both wife and maid
Ioh. xx.
It never failed, for the f^mynyne
In Thomas it failed for the masculyne.
Before also ye shall w^ll find
The woman was ever promp^ and redye

Of Chr^tes birth to belyue the mysterye
Where as the woman, old Zacharye
Blamed of the Angel, lost his sight
Elysabeth him knowleged, ^uyn ^urth right.
Ioh. xx.
Great was the love of the femynyne
During the daungeour of his passion
Record therein good Magdalyne
Which never backed, but followed on
Where his disciples were fled and gone
Often the sepulcre she did vy^yt
And long there weeping would she sit.
She with his compers Mary's two
Marce. xvi.
Salomye and Iacobye with oils pure
For synguler love they bare him to
Sough^ him laid in sepulture
Supposing their oynteme^ces should hi^ recure
For well the ^ekenynge by his saying p^ayne
He would reuyue, shortly again.
God him self praise to her gave
At table sitting for the oil she spend
And openly the men did deprave Lu^. xxi

Said pore have ye daily, but I must wend
Her also except he, in mytes that did send
In G^z^philacum, before the rich man
And Martha likewise, yt called hi^ gods son.

And she also that nature led iii re* iii.

Rather her chyld^ quycke to for go
Than Solomon should part him in two
The wife of Pylate did pytye more
The turnement of our Sauyoure
Than all the men that than there were
The scrybes and the pha^isys to there power Luc. xxi

The works of Christ blasphemyd each hour
The woman pre^ent said I make you ware
Blessed be the belly that the bare.
When he arose, Math. xxvii. xxviii.

Tho whom apered he, I pray you first
Sure for ought that I can here
To women two, or any man wist
To her that him with her breast nursed
To Mary Magdalyne, and bad her go Ioh. xx.

And his apostoles tell it to.
Luc. viii
Seldom I find that Christ did blame
Any one woman properly
Or that any woman so fare past shame
So ly^le to set our savior by
As Peter d^d Christ to deny
Luc. vii.
Christ blamed Peter, now and than
For lack of faith, and called him Satan.
And where Scribes malycyouslye
Brought unto him adulteram
The woman he saved, gratiouslye
wrote in the dust, to the men's shame
Johan. viii.
Do no more women, said he the same
Now tell me plain if ye so can
Did he ever like miracle for any man.
The woman al^o of Cananye
Whose daughter posseit was of a devil
Seized not on Christ to cr^e
Math. xv.
Her daughter to he^e of that sore yuyll
Christ herd her well, and held him still
To the end all men, might notyfye
What faith was in the femynye.
The man he blamed of Ipocrysye
Johan. xiii.
And also upon the Saboth day
Helyd the woman gracyouslye
Eyghtene years long that sort syke lay^
And mekely did the Samaritane pray

Where o^ the man he asked none.
And also at the wom^ns request
Because they lacked necessary Ioha^. ii.

Turned water to wine at the feast
Kept in Cana Galylye
At the instaunce of Martha or Mary
He raised Lazarhole and sound
Four days buried under ground.
Where as he wept full tenderly Ioh. xi.

To the woman that him often fed
Martha the one the other Mary
Weep and by wayle their brother deed
As farforth yet as ever I read
I can not find that he did make
Any like sorrow for the man's sake.
And over that the treuth does prove
The saying of Luke who so well wayth
It was a very sclender love Luce. viii*

And a less token of any faith
In the man the E^angelyst says
In Judas by name his master that sold
With a false kiss and thyrty pens gold.
Thus may ye see by holy wryt
That women be no cast awayes
Neither they that live as yet
Nor those that were in the ancient days
Proved I have who so denayes
For more wytnes I shall report
Of later time and so be short
The church mylytant does ones yearly
A ^euen thousand vyrgins ha^^^e in on^
So many of men I can not e^pye
Sithe time the world first ^egon
All be it they were not women echoue
Yet for the woman was pryncypall
Like name is given unto them all.
I read of seven ^lepynge men
And also of.iiii. coronate
Now two and three* of thousands ten
Of one alone with his a^^ociate
Of forte knights martyry^a^e
But of a.xi. thousand never
Could I find as yet together.
All be it there be of the i^fant s^ate
Of innocen^es I m^a^e many one
Yet have these vyrg^us immaculate
If any comparyson may be thereto
More mede of god, I suppose ^o
These ^yrg^us for god dyed wyllyngly
The infantes by force and knew not why
Much other things aledged might be
Aucro^ysed by holy wryt
Besides much more in p^yetrye
In sundry m^tyrs craf^ely knyt
Wh^che only I ^ut^e to omyt
On^^s it ^e o^ two or of three
To write them all (...) will not be
As first of Luctes the noble wife Oui^. in fast. li. primi. August. de ci. li.

A myrrour to all other of goostly fame
Which wylfully with a small knyfe
Slew her self in avoiding shame
And thereby saved her old good name
What time Tarquyne new made king
Had her forlayne, she not willing.
Where Rome besyeged was about
By Cor^olane then exulate Vala^. li. primo

So that no man durst ons pere out
For fere of lesynge of his pat^

Her arms cast cross, her here to rent
Most woefully forth thus she went.
Large were y^ teres that from her eyes ran
Her ^restes before him when she dysplayde
Behold she said thou unkind man
Thy natural mother thus wretchely arayde
Nature should move the, though will denayde
To war with other than thy natyfe country
Peace said he mother so shall it be.
Whose act to be had in mem^rye
A law forth with the Romyanes let make
From that day forward to the femynyne
E^he man should vow for Ueturys sake
Granted also that the woman might take
To her attire broche, ow^he, or ring
Ueluet pu^ple or any other t^ynge.

Where as before through queen Uasthye
All honor was take the woman fro
By reason of her obstynacye
In ^y^obeyinge king Assuero
Now was re^tored with much more to
Many men saved that might have been slain
And the city set frank fre again.

When Portia hard that Brute was deed
Longer to live no hour thought she

Ovid. eplar. ^i. primo.
Because she could no knyfe come by
In much like case Penelope
To put of wedding till Ulyxes came home
Untwyned at night that in the day she ^poue.
And as it comes unto my mind
Of one hystorye catholycall
Which almost clean was left behind
Daniel. xiii.
As nothing worthy memoryall
That one remembered conclude I shall
The hystory I mean of good Su^an
Falsely accused by the man.
Attempt she was of rybaldes two
With them to have dea^ed, she nolde consent
They he^ accused, and said she had ado
With a young man, and should be brent
God k^owe the woman innocent
And caused the infant Danyell
To speak to the people and the treuth tell.
A babe to speak was a strange marvel
The people assembled on every side
The tales both varyed that they did tell
Whereby it was known the rybaldes lyde
The woman saved and the treuth tryde
Her false accusars by comen assent
To dye forthwith had just judgment.
Which things remembered with other mo
That might parchaunce ^nlarge this book
Estates comenly where I go
Trust their wyu^s to over look
Baker, brewer, butler, and roke
With other all, man medleth no whytte
Because the woman has quycket wit.
My lady must receive and pay
And every man in his office control
And to each cause give ye and nay
Bargayne and bye and set all so^e
By ^ndenture other by court roll
My lady must order thus all thing
Or small shall be the man's winning
A further proof herein as yet
By comune report we here each day
The child is praised for his mother wit
For the fathers condycions depraved always
And over that your self will say
Surgeons advantage, by women small
Because they be no fyghters at all.
An end therefore hereof to make
Me thynkes these men do nothing well
So wylfully to brag and crake
And against all women so to geuell
And yet who so that lengest does revel
And this book redeth I know plainly
Shall say: or be shamed, tongue I lie.

The author.
GO forth little book god be thy speed
Oodre thy self accordyngly
Set naught by him y^ does y^ read
In case he warble the to deny
Not one so good ^ut he has an enemy
Hyde not thy face for a proud crake
Let him be known that did the make
Go forth queckely with pase demure
Of one prerogatyue sure thou ar^e
Set for to be in hye honor
In mids of the ^ole femynyne heart
Next god they will all ^ake thy part
Hill the with sylke and lymme the with gold
Now pass on thy way thou may be boide.
Glory be thy garment so worthy thou art
Of ^yluer thy clasyes, and of fine gold
So true is thy proce^^e in every part
In the hye Ierarchye thou may be enrolde
None other like the that ever was sold
Highest of all other in truth is thy dytye
Lygth where thou shalt now fa^ewell from me.
If question be moved who is thine author
Be not ado^ad to v^ter his name
Say Edwa^de Gosynhyll took the labor
For woman head the for to frame
Call him thy^e author, do not asshame
Thanks lokes he none for, yet would he be glad
^taffe to ^tand^ by that all women had.
Thus ends this frutfull treatese of the prease of women^ called Mu^erum
