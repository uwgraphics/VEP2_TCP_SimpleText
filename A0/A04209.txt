A pleasant new Ballad to sing both Even and Morn, Of the bloody murder of
Sir John Barley-corne.
To the tune of, Shall I lie beyond thee.

AS I went through the North Country
I heard a merry greeting:
A pleasant toy, and full of joy,
two noble men were meeting.
And as they walked for to to sport,
upon a Summers day,
Then with another nobleman
they went to make a fray,
Whose name was sir John Barley corn,
he dwelt down in a dale:
Who had a kinsman dwelt him nigh,
they called him Thomas Goodale.
Another named Richard Beer,
was ready at that time:
Another worthy Knight was there,
called sir William White Wine.
Some of them fought in a Jack,
some of them in a Can:
But the chiefest in a black pot,
like a worthy noble man.
Sir John Barlycorne fought in a Boule,
who woune the victory:
And made them all to fume and swear,
that Barlycorne should die.
Some said kill him, some said drown,
others wished to hang him hie:
For as many as follow Barly-corne,
shall surely beggars die.
Then with a plough they plowed him up
and thus they did devise,
To bury him quick within the earth,
and swore he should no rise.
With harrowes strong they combed him
and burst clods on his head:
A joyful banquet then was made,
when Barly-corne was dead.
He rested still within the earth,
till rain from skies did fall,
Then he grew up in branches green,
which sore amazed them all,
And so grew up till Mid-sommer,
which made them all afeard;
For he was sprouted up on hie,
and got a goodly beard.
Then he grew till S. James tide,
his countenance was wan,
For he was grewne unto his strength.
and thus became a man.
With hooks and fickles keen,
into the field they hide,
They cut his legs off by the knees,
and made him wounds full wide.
Thus bloodily they cut him down
from place where he did stand,
And like a thief for treachery,
they bound him in a band.
So then they took him up again,
according to his kind:
And packt him up in several stackes,
to wither with the wind.
And with a pitch-forke that was sharp,
they rent him to the heart,
And like a thief for treason vile,
they bound him in a cart.
And tending him with weapons strong,
unto the town they hie,
And straight they mowed him in a mow
and there they let him lie.
Then he lay groaning by the walls,
till all his wounds were sore,
At length they took him up again,
and cast him on the floor.
They byred two with holly clubs,
to beat on him at once,
They thwacked so on Barly-corne,
that flesh fell from the bones.
And then they took him up again,
to fulfill women's mind
They dusted and they sifted him,
till he was almost blind.
And then they knit him in a sack,
which grieved him full sore:
They steeped him in a Fat, God wot,
for three days space and more.
Then they took him up again,
and laid him for to dry,
They cast him on a chamber floor,
and swore that he should die
They rubbed and they stirred (...),
and still they did him turn,
The Malt-man swore that ^e (...)
his body he would bu^ne.
They spightfully took him up (...)

A new Ballad for you to look (...) deal with (...).
MA^s Malt he is a Gentleman,
And has been since the world began,
I never knew yet any man
that could match with master Malt sir,
I never knew any match Malt be once,
The Miller with his grinding stones.
He laid them so close that he crushed his bones,
you ^euer knew the like sir.
Malt, Malt, thou art a flower.
Then ^^t beloved in every bower,
Thou can not be missing one half hour.
you never saw the like etc.
For laying of his stones so close,
Malt gave the Miller a copper nose,
Saying thou and I will never be foes,
but unto thee I stick sir.
Malt gave the Miller such a blow,
That from is horse he fell full low,
He taught him his master Malt for to know,
you never saw the like sir.
Our hostess maid she was to blame,
She stole master Malt away from her dame,
And in her belly she did the same,
you never saw the like sir.
So when the Malt did work in her head,
Twice a day she would be sped,
At night she could not go to bid,
nor scarce stand on her feet sir.
Then came in the master Smith,
And said that Malt he was a thief.
But Malt gave him such a dash in the teeth:
you never saw the like sir,
For when his Iron was hot and red,
He had such an ache all in his head,
The Smith was feign to get him to bed,
for then he was very sick sir.
The Carpenter came a piece to square,
He had Malt come out if he dare,
He would empty his belly, and beat his sides bare
that he know not where to sit sir.
To fire be went with an arm full of chips,
Malt hit him right between his lips,
And made him lame in both his hips,
you never saw the like sir,
The Shoemaker sitting upon his seat
With master Malt he began to fret,
He said he would the knave so beat,
you never saw the like sir.
Malt peept his head out of a hall,
The shoemaker said, he would drink him up al,
They ^umled together till down they did fall,
you never saw the like sir.
The Weauer being in his loome,
He threatened master Malt to bu^n,
When he had knit on to the thrum,
you never saw the like sir.
And such a Court some Weauers held,
They would pay our hosts when they had seld,
But when every one had his part and deald,
they knew not where to sit sir,
The Tinker he took the Weauers part
Because he is touching unto his Art,
He took the pot and drenke a quart,
the world was very quick sir,
Malt had of him his own desire,
He made him tumble into the fire,
others he lost his burling ire,
^e has not found it yet sir.
The Tailor he came in to grind his she^res.
Malt and he were together by the ^ares,
Great is the company Malt still reares,
you never saw the like sir.
For when his pressing Iron was h^t,
He pressed a board in stead of a coat,
And sailed home in a fether-bed boat,
you never saw the like sir,
So then the Tinker did sound his pan,
Then said master Malt I must be gone,
I am the good fellow that helps eatch one,
you never saw the like sir.
The Tinker then that he was feign.
With Malt to hau^ about or twain,
Malt hit him sore in every vain,
you never saw the like sir.
Then bespake the Tinker anon
He said he would prove himself a man,
He laid on Malt till the housse was gone,
the Bung and the Tinker fell sick sir.
The Sayler he did curse and ban,
He bad the boy, go tap the can,
I Will have about with Malt anan,
you never saw the like sir.
Aboard they went to try their match,
And there they played at hop and catch,
Malt bestowed him under the ba^ch,
and made him keep the ship sir.
Then came the Chapman traveling by,
And said, My masters I will be w'ye,
In deed ^^staer Malt my mouth is dry,
I will gnaw you with my teeth sir.
The Chapman he said on a pace,
Till store of blood came in his face,
But Malt brought him in such a case.
you never saw the like sir.
The Mason came an Oven to make,
The Bricklayer he his part did take,
They bound Malt to the good-ale stake,
you never saw the like sir,
Then Malt began to tell his mind,
And plide them with Ale, Beer and Wine,
They left Brick-are and trowell behind,
they could not lay a brick sir.
Then came the Labourer out with his hood,
And saw his two masters how they stood,
He took master Malt by the whoo^,
and swore he would him strike sir.
Malt he ran and for fear did weep,
The Labourer he did skip and leap,
But Malt cast him into the mortar heap,
and there he fell a sleep sir.
The Butcher came to buy a sheep:
He said he would make Malt to creep,
But Malt made him the cat to whip.
you never saw the like sir.
The Glouer came to buy a skin,
Malt hit him right above the chin,
The pewter John came doubling in,
you never saw the like sir.
And laid on head, arms, and joints,
Took away his gloves, and gross of points,
And swore they had paid him in quartes and pints,
you never saw the like sir.
Thus of my song I will make an end,
And pray my hostess to be my friend,
To give me some drink now my money is spend
then Malt and I am quit sir.
FINIS.
