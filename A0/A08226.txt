destruction. and so God to have the Praise of all / through the Love.

3. Therefore hear the Word of the Lord / ye all which now make Battle /
or are Men-of-warre* all ye Nobles / Lordes-of-the-campe / Capitaines /
Horsemen and Souldyers / and all which deal with Weapons-of-warre / to the use
of Battle: Make now Plowsheares Isa 2. a. Math. 4. a.

wildernessed Land / and to prepare all unprepared or untilled Fields / to a
mollified Earth / To thentent that Bread-corne may be sown therein / and
multiply itself through the Rain and Dew of Heaven: and that meet or apt
Deu. 28. (...) Za^h 1^. a.
Fruits may eauenso be reaped and gathered of all Lands / To the end that
there may be always Bread-corne in-store / to a Food of Satisfyinge / and that
the Children of Men may always have Isa. 33. ^. ^5.
Bread for to live by.

Amos. ^. a.
great Hunger or Lack of Bread fall over the Land / that ye all (when the
Hunger comes) pine not away: but may then have Corn for your Food / and Bread
to live by.

5. Wherefore consider now / that the Land is very hand / and the (...) a. b.
33. b.
Earth / very stubbourne: in such-sort / thatreversed; for the Hardness cause;
the Fields are waren dry / and become unfruitful of ye good Seed.

6. Although the Rain and Dew fall thereupon / yet notwithstanding the same
soketh not ther-in / to the Moisteninge of the Earth.

7. Albeit that Seed be sown thereon / yet comes it not to Fruitfulnes.

8. And although the Seed get a little Growinge therein / yet has it not any
Math. 25. Mark. 4. Luke 8.
Deapnes of root: and cannot therefore endure the Heat of ye Sun.

9. For that cause it either withers of itself: orels the Esa. 5. b. 32. c.
Math. 13.
Thistles and Thorns keep it down: so that it gets not his Fulness of ripe
Seed / to Fruitfulnes. For it has not any Growing-vpp to his Perfection /
Because the Earth is so utterly unprepared / and desolated with Abominations.

10. SEeing now that the Earth is not plowed / nor prepared to bring-fourth
Fruit / therefore lies the Land euery-wheare thus 4. Esd. 16.
wildernessed / and unfruitful of good Corn 3. Reg. 18. ^. Ier. 12.14. a.
^am. 2.4. a.
. There is scarcely any-wheare Corn to be found / for to sustain the Life
of Men.

11. Oh! What a Woe / 4. Esd. 15.16 Esa. 24. Apo. 8.
Calamity and Misery cometh-ther over the poor People which dwell upon the
Earth / and seek out of ye unprepared Earth / which bringeth-fourth
nothing-els but Math. 13.
Weeds / Thistles Genesis 3. d. Heb. 6.
/ and Thorns; their Meat for Food and their Peace on Earth / through
Exercisinge-of-warre. and consider not that the Earth is Genesis 3. d. Deu. 28.
curssed / for the Wickedness cause of the People: and therefore lies barren of
Corn / to the Food of Life / and utterly void of the Peace of Christ. And
if there com not any other Provision into the Minds or Understanding of the
Rulers of the Earth / and of the People which dwell thereon / so must they all
Psa. 8. d. Ier. 14. a. Iam. 1.4.
pyne-away / Heb. 6.
inherit the Curssinge with the Earth / and perish in great Misery.



13. Wherefore use ye now no Prudencie / O ye Counsel-lordes over the
Countries / to the end that the People might get Bread / and live peaceably
ther-with?

14. Wherefore think ye not bytimes / what is most profitable or needful for
you: and whereby ye might live longest in Peace / O ye Men-of-warre / ye all
which now make Battle? For lo / ye let the Land lie wast: and have turned
/ armed / and provoked yourselues to Battle / one against an-other.

15. Ye slaye one another of you / with your Swerdes. ye destroy each-other
/ with your Spears. and consider not that the Land lyeth-wast and
waxeth-wilde by itself.

16. Therefore awake bytimes / and look into the Destruction your-selues. Esa.
1. a. O^^ ^. d. Zach. 9.
Break now your Swerdes and Spears to-peeces: and forge your Swerdes into
Plowsheares / and your Spears into Sickles: and geeue you to the
Tillinge-of-the-grounde / for to plowe the Earth / and to prepare the same unto
Fruitfulnes of Seed.

17. Bide no-lenger Men-of-warre one against another: but become
Tillers-of-the-grounde / and bring the Earth Genesis 1.
under you / to Fruitfulnes / that it may bring-fourth good Seed / for to live
by / So shall ye thenreversed; in the time of Harvest; have much to reap 2.
Cor. 5. Gal. 6.
/ and obtain great Riches: and all Peace shall meet you.

18. But if ye do not so: nor yet consider / that it Math. 16.
slain with the Sword.

19. It is true / we have heard that Christ spoke / in times-past; to his
Disciples / saying / Luke 1^.
Whosoever has a Wallet / let him take it: in like-maner also a Scrippe: But he
that has none / let him sell his Cote / and bye a Sword. But now says the
Love of Christ: Whosoever has a Sword / let him not sell it: but forge it / Esa.
2. ^. O^e^. 2. d. Zach. 9. c.
make thereof a Plowsheare / and become an Husbandman. For it must all be
fulfilled / whatsoever is written of Christ Luke 22. d. 24. g.
/ To thentent that the End or Fulfillinge of all that is written / 4. ^^d. 5.
1. Cor. 1^. 1. Tim. 1. a.
may be the Love.

20. This is the everlasting Esa 32. d. 54. d 66 d.
Peace / according to the Scripture. For what is written of Me / says Christ /
Luke 12. d.
has an End or Fulfilling. and that End or Fulfillinge / John. 17. d. 1.
Cor. 13. b. 1. Tim. 1. a.
is the Love which bideth for ever / according to the Promises.

21. Therefore look into the Time / and consider well whereto the Promises
stretch. Notreversed; verelie; to That which goes before and ceasseth: but to
the Tocominge / that ceasseth not / but shall bide for evermore.

22. For although in the Time when Swerdes were needful or required / there
were Luke 22. d.
two Swerdes found / yet is notwithstanding the End promised to be in Esa.
9. a. 32. d 57.60. d. 66. Dan. 2. d. Ephesians. 2. c.
Peace / under the Love.

2. But if ye will nowreversed; in this New and gracious Day of Love; yeat
fight and make War one against another / and not once cal-to-minde the
tocominge Deuteronomy. 28. (...). 8.
Hunger / which shall* O all ye Men-of-warre; fall upon you therout / when as
ye are bee^ vtterlie-weerye and tired in your War or Fightinge / So think
then upon the Infelicitie and Misfortune which is published unto you before.

3. For behold / the Days com / says the holy Spirit of Love yea / they are
alredie in the door; that your 4. Esd. 6.
Binnes or Ambries shall be found with out Bread / and your Barnes without
Corn: that your Lights also shall Job. 18. a ^1. b. ^8. b. Pro. 1^ a 24.
go-out / and that ye* like the Math. ^^. a.
foolish Virgins; having no Oil in your Lamps / shall find yourselues
buried in the Darkness / like unto the Dead.

4. At that time verelie / much Calamity and Esa. 13. a.
Misery shall com upon you: and much Land shall then lie so utterly wast /
that it cannot be tilled again: andreversed; as a Wilderness; be ouergrowen
with Pro 24. ^^a. 5.
Thisiles and Thorns. and ye shall be constrained to behold with great Sap.
5. 2.
Discomforte / the Misery of yourselues / the Curse of the Wicked / and the
Malediction of the Earth / and greatly lament and bewail your-selues / with
Wringinge-handes / that ye have not harkened unto the Pro. 5. b.
Counsel of the Elders in the Service of Love / nor ben obedient unto the
holy Spirit of Love / nor to his godly Testimonies.

5. Seeing then that ye have loved yourselues / Ier. 7. c. 9. c
your own Counsel / according to the Mind of your Good-thinkinge / Lusts /
and Desires / and Pro. 1. c.
despised the proffered Grace of the Love of Jesus Christ / So shall ye also
plainly perceive / that the Wisdom reigns not by you / and that ye have
not the true Ier. 8. a.
Word of the Lord / liuinglie in you: and shall eauenso find yourselues
shutt without the Kingdom of the Love / and separated and Sap. 5. a.
estraunged from all lovely Beeinge.

6. Therefore Eccle. 3.
have now a regard unto this Time / wherein the Love and Equity is exercised /
and the Virtues required: and consider what is most profitable or needful for
you / and take Warninge. For behold / it goes presently / eauenlike as the
God of Heaven has heer-to-fore spoken thereof / through his holy Propheates.

7. If therefore the Children of Men convert not / nether yet leaue-of from
their Folly and Error / So shall then all the Romans 2. b.
Evil or Infelicitie which is for to com over ye Ungodly / fall alsoreversed;
as a Luke 21.
Snare; upon them. For the Swerdes are Psalm. 37.
alredie naked / and drawn out of the Scabbardes: and eueryone is busylie
occupied with his Spear.

8. All that is any-what / and can bear Stick or Staff (whether he be
young or old / little or great) will now fight / and applies him unto
Battle 4. Esd. 6. b. 1^. d. 15. b. c. 16. ^ Math. 24. b.
for to make War: and gets him a stowte Courraige to the
Exercisinge-of-warre / for to take-in-hande and atchiue Martial-affaires /
boldly and without discomfiture.

Iere. 25. d. Joel. 1. a. b. Amos. 8. b. Soph. 1. b.
For the Hearts of the People are kindled to Battle. They shall fall on the
Edge of their Swerdes / and slaye Nah. 3. a. 4. Esd. 16 c. Luke 21. c.
one-another upon the Earth.

10. But after that shall the great Hunger com: little Amos. 8. b.
Corn be found to live by: and the People shall seek Lam. 2. d. 4.
Bread / for to sustain their Life withal.

11. But* alas; when the great Hunger and Dearth or Lack of Bread shall fall
upon them / then shall they be feign to feed themselves with Ier. 6.8. b. ^3 d.
^^. d. 29 b. Ezech. 13. b. c.
strange Bread: Howbeit / not find nor com-by the Satisfyinge or Fulness of

12. When they then ware hungrye again / and knowe-well that they cannot live
by the strange Bread / nor be satisfied therewith / So shall their Souls Lam.
2. c. 4. a
fainte or be vnlustfull / through the strange Bread / and much evil
Corruption of the Pestilence shall take-holde of them.

13. Than whatsoever dyed not of Hunger / and whatsoever is escaped the Sword
/ and ye at remained-ouer therfrom / shall, through bitter Wofulnes; in great
Luke 21. d.
Desperation or Faint-heartednes / seek to dye Iere. 7. d. O^^c. 10. a. Luke
23. c. Apoc. 9. a.

great Infelicitie of the Ungodly / and the Misery which shall take-hold of
them: yet shall they not be able to escape ye Plagues.

Lam* 4.2.
slain with the Sword / then they that shall remayne-ouer to the strong
Pestilence.

15. And upon all such as stand not submitted under the Obedience of the Love.
nor humbled under the Preservation of the Service of Love / shall all this
fore-sayed Infelicitie not fail to com: and they shall Ier. 42. b. Apoc. 9. a.
not be able to avoid nor escape the same.

16. There shall also great Tribulation / Affliction / and Misery be beholden /
in all Islands / because they have not soughtreversed; in the Service of Love;
the upright Ways of the Lord / nor loved the Life of Righteousness / Esa. 5. d.
4. Esd. 7. c.
nor yet had any desire to the Service of Love* but Pro. 1. c.
refused / and resisted or sclau^dered the same / and eauenso turned-back
themselves: Going-fourth according to their Deuteronomy. ^9. a. Ier. 7. c. 9. b.
Goodthinkinge.

17. But what avails it / their Goodthinkinge will yet in the end / betray /
deceive / and begyle them all: Howbeit many of them will not presently
believe the same. But when as the Plagues have caught them / then shall they
understand the same in great Sap. 5. a.
Misery / andreversed; in their Misery; rufullie lament / that they have so
shamefullie neglected the proffered Grace / despised the Good / and not
geeuen-care to the Pro. 5. b.
Instructions of the Service of Love / nor yet taken-heede to the Godlynes of

18. For they shall behold and know / that the old Heauenreversed; wherein
they put their trust; and the old Earthreversed; whereupon they have builded;
shall all be Esa. 51. b. 66. ^. Pet. ^ b. Apoc. 21. a.

19. But the Love shall remain in her Service / as a fast Stony-rocke: which
Love / in her Service can 1. Cor. 13. a.
begyle noman. For in her Service / she is a sure unremovable Stay and
Salfgarde / and her Counsel is vndeceitfull: for She is nothinge-els in
herself / but Life and Peace.

20. Therefore shall it allreversed; whatsoever is or beco^eth and be changed /
and consume or vanish-awaye. But the Love in her Service / shall 1. Cor. 13. b
remain for-euer: and all what is of-one-minde with the Love / shall never
perish. but obtain the eternal Life / and possess the same everlastingly.

21. SEeinge now that the Love is the Pleasant-garden of the Lord / so shall
they all that are of-one-minde with her verteous Nature / have the Unity with
the Love / and live according to the Lust or Will of the Lord.

22. They shall eat of all the Trees of the Lord-his Pleasant-garden / and of
the Tree Genesis 2. b. Apoc. 2. a. ^2.

everlastingly.

23. For the Death shall be Ozeae. 13. a. 1. Cor. 15. f. Apoc. 20. c.

the Ways of Death / or which lead unto Death / shall be locked or made-fast
