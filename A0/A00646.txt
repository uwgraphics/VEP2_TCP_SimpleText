Ad Lectorem, Sufficit scire locum esse in Carcere:

It is enough to know, too much to see
That in the Compter there is room for thee.
TO ALL CASHEERD Captains, or other their inferior Officers, heedlesse and
headless young Gentlemen, especially elder brothers, forsaken Seruing-men,
Rearing-boyes, Broken-Citizens, Country-Clients, or any other of what art or
fashion soever, that shall by chance, rather mischance, be irresistably
encountered, and so become tenants against their wills, within the Territories of
this ensuing Commonwealth, greeting and meeting, rather at an Ordinary then
here.
Worthy Gentlemen;
I Rest assured this small volume (being no Elephantine load of Mogoulian
story, compiled by the wandering Pawne-Knight of Troy) will be bought and read
over by many, how it will be censured. I know not, or how I shall be reputed
for publishing it, to deal plainly, I care not, so it bring future benefit to
my Country, And some present benefit to my self.
and content to the judicious, to whom I commend it for two especial reasons.
The first stands grounded on these three points* a Prospectiue Glass, an
Instructiue Book, and a Suspectiue blow. For as Prospectiue set to the sight
of a man's eye, will draw the Object so near the sense, that he may discern
whether his opposite be friend or foe, and make haste too, either to embrace
the one, or shun the other, before he come near him: so in this glass, a
young Gentleman may plainly perceive the folly that reigns in others, and
seek to eschew them before they take hold, which will hurry him into these
inconveniences. It is a book to instruct young heirs to keep out of books
and bonds, which oftentimes are the maine cause of their overthrow, and brings
that long suspected blow upon their shoulders, which if it chance to light
here, they may clearly discover the Keepers large conscience, and be throwly
instructed to shun their extortion. My second reason is an Apology, to
shield me from those wounding tongues, that may perhaps tax me for writing so
harshly against Citizens, Prodigals, Sargeants and other Officers, to such I
answer, let the galled jade winch till he break his heels against my buckler,
which thus I advance. How much I reverence and respect the Right Worshipful
Order of this famous City in their just proceedings, let my best and utmost
service be a true witness. Neither seem I to carpe at the bounty or large
expense of young Gentlemen, whose means and birth are correspondent. No, no,
I rather encourage and commend their worths, for of such there are too few, and
for their sakes only, I have discovered what trappes and snares are daily set
by careless Unthrifts, to wind them into the like ruin they themselves are
in* They have strange devices, and a certain kind of longing to cast their
estates in a consumption, by which their persons may lie languishing under that
infectious disease, wherewith they themselves are poisoned, by the incurable
plague of poverty. Concerning Sargeants, I hope there are none so shallow
conceited, to think my pen so full of vinegar, to write against their mere
profession, which in a well-gouern'd State is so necessary. I rather wish they
were as free from abusing their place and office, as I am from disliking of it,
and then a shorter chapter would serve to discover their sinister devices and
treacherous dealings, which I have observed so carefully, that if any of the
fraternity of the Mace-mongers chance to fall sick at the conceit, let them
but diligently view it over, and they shall find as comfortable cordials to
refresh the heart, as I did from that cold cawdle when they first arrested me,
which I willingly bestow upon them in requital. But me thinks I hear some
curious Critic murmr before he has read over half the preamble, because I
entitle it a Commonwealth, and begin it so singly with my self: to such I
answer my unwilling experience and not reports of that they shall read
hereafter, emboldened me to write the truth, that I have tried, which may
beget belief in those that read, if not, I wish it may be their good fortunes
to go the voyage, and let them confute me if they can. If any shall object
what reason I have to discourse of the four branches, before I come to the
maine body of the Commonwealth, and stand so long on them, deferring their
expectations, let them rest satisfied with this answer. A building cannot be
raised without a groundwork, or a tree will seem naked without branches, and
a man wanting limbs to support him, is but a decrepit body, which I
considering have adorned this Ocean with complete Rivers, which are indeed the
best Benefactours that belong to it. The first three chapters show how
distress and oppression joined hands to wound my weak and unprovided estate,
by which single example, all o her may discern the true usage they shall
receive from the kind Keepers, if their means once fail or their friends for
sake them. The four chapters following, lay open the four arms or currents,
with their several natures, that bring supply to this body or maine Ocean,
which in the last three chapters is lively anatomized. The cruelty of Keepers
and the misery of Prisoners. For the truth of which I have quoted an authority
in the margent, and for your delight mingled it with many pleasant discourses,
which I freely send abroad to all, either to those that have been passengers
through this troublesome Ocean, and know the danger, or to any that shall
hereafter, upon special occasion, before'd to make proof of this relation.
Lastly, to those that have no desire to venture this voyage, but will rather be
contented to sit at home and read the the discovery. I commend it with as much
love as Keepers bear to prisoners purses when they have money in them, wishing
it might prove as delightful to them, as their ill dealings were hateful to
me, and so farewell. From the Compter in Woodstreet. 1616. October. 23.

CHAP. I. Containing, 1. The manner of my arrest. 2. The description of a brace
of Sergeants. 3. Their counsel to me, 4. My coming into prison. 5. The
Description of a Iaylor. 6. And my entertainment into the Masterside.
WAlking (not long since) in an evening through the city, when the Heavens were
muffled up in clouds, as many of our modern Gallants faces are in their
cloakes, and being in a fixed meditation with my self, a Trinobantine Burger
(coming in haste) ran full but at me with his head, so that he had nigh
goar'd me into the kennell, (I took him to be some complete harnessed
benchbeleagerer, for he had a wrought nightcap on his head to keep the
broth of his wit warm, satin sleeves, a taffata ierkin to cover his canuasse
back; and a pair of velvet hose.) I, for his unexpected courtesy, not
forgetting to give him the good time of the night, up with my sword scabbard
and all, and took him a sound knock o'rethwart the pate, that if the most
head-strongst ox that ever was sacrificed in Saint Nicholas Shambles, had
received but half such a blow, it would have staggered him; but he like a
valiant and provident Tradesman, bare it off with his Sinciput and shoulders
and ran away.

I (as glad I was rid of him as he of me) posted as fast to my lodging, as a
releast prisoner (hey ho a prisoner) from the Iayle, for fear he should run to
the Compter and enter an action against me; but having escaped the Charybdis of
this danger, I instantly fell into the Scylla of a more deep and dreadful
then the first, for as I was making homewards, a brace of Bandogs belonging to
one of the Compters, most cowardly came snarling behind me, and fastened on my
shoulder, giving me this salutation. Sir we arrest you in the Kings Majesty's
name, and we charge you to obey us.

These Ravens had no sooner croak't out this ominous message, but I looked as
blancke as those that sold all their estate, and ventured it at a lottery and
drew blancke, or an old Usurer when he hears of a Privy seal, or a
coppy-holder plow-holder when be is served with a Sub poena; but all could not
prevail, I was forced to obey them for fear of further inconvenience, so
rendered my weapon into their hands; and my body to the Laws of my Sovereign,
telling them the thunder I so much feared, was now fallen on mine head. Yet the
thought of my arrest did not so much affright me as the cou^tenances of those
peuterbuttond, shoulderclapping Catch-poles that seized on my body. The one had
a face ten times worse then those Jews that are pictured The description of a
brace ^ of Sargeants.
in Arras-hangings whipping Chirst, his black hair hung dangling about his
ears like Elfelockes, that I cannot be persuaded, but some Succubus begot him
on a Witch, his nose was precious, richly rubified, and shined brighter then
any Sumners snout in Lancashire. The other of these Pagans had a phisnomy much
resembling the Sarazens head without Newgate, and a mouth as wide vaulted as
that without Bishopsgate: I was in a great doubt whether he were an Englishman
or no, for I was certified a Dane begot him on a Switzers wife: and to make him
show the more like himself, his ill-fauoured visage was almost eaten through
with pock-holes, (the Grand I hope) so that half a parish of children might
easily have played at cherry-pit in his face.

These Furies had no sooner fastened their sharp flesh-hookes on my shoulders,
but they (as their fashion is) began to exhort me to patience, telling me, I
ought not to be incenst against them, for they were but the Ministers and
Executioners of the Law, and that the Mace which they held in their clutches,
was put into theirs by the hand of Justice, that they were both for the good of
the Commonwealth, and the discharge of their own consciences, sworn to
execute their office though it were upon their own father, that I being so
gracious in the Court, could not long be detained in the Compter, that after I
had been resident there but one quarter of a year (if it should be my ill
fate to stay there so long) I would not lose the rich experience I should
learn there for ten times so much debt I was arrested for. And lastly, swore
as they were Christians, they would do me what kindness lay in their power,
either persuading my Creditour to come to a reasonable composition, or provide
me Bail, the Cormorants told me true, for they swore as they were Christians
they would do me good, but being contrary to them, playde the Jews, and
falsified their oaths with me, for I never saw them after I was mewed up in
the Compter. But before I was matriculated in one of these city universities,
by persuasion they got me into a Tavern not far from (the enchanted Castle)
the Prison, and there milk't me out of all my money to stuff their paunches
with wine and good cheer: but their guts and garbidge being full-gorg'd, they
told me it was time to repair to the Compter, for if the Sheriff their master
should be certified of their detaining a Prisoner so long after an arrest, it
would be a great prejudice to them, and small good to my self: so I
discharging the reckoning, wishing them choked, and all their fellow varlets,
that ever after should taste of my bounty (when I began to sent their rogery)
came over with them, so bid them farewell and behang'd.

But here is one serious point not to be slipped over, for the Cerberus that
turned the key of the Compter-gate, no sooner saw those hell-guides bringing me
in, but he set the door as wide open to receive me, as Westminster Hall is in
the terme-time to country Clients, which put me in mind of that odd old
verse in the Poet,

Noctes atque dies pate^ atri ianua Ditis. I no sooner was entered into this
Infernal Island (where many men lie winde-bound sometimes four or five years
together) but a fellow (whom at first sight I took to be a Gardener, because
he had somewhat a reddish beard and turned up withal) called me to a book
(no Bible or Divinity, but rather of Negromancy, for all the Prisoners called
it the Blacke-booke) coming to it, he demanded my name, I told him, and then
he set it down as horses are in Smithfield at the Tole-booth. This ceremony
being ended, he asked me whether I would go to the Masterside, the Knights
ward, or any other place of a cheaper rate; I answered the best, though it were
the dearest, for I did hope to get my liberty before a week was expired: upon
this determination there was one called to show me the way to my lodging, who
upon the first call made no delay, but instantly came wadling down stairs.
He was a The desciption of one of the vnderiaylours.
gross fellow, one that had a fat body though a lean brain, a face of a
sanguine complexion, and an heart correspondent to the same, he had a motly
beard cut round like a rubbing brush, so that if all the skin of his body had
been like that of his face, it would have served excellent well when he had
been dead to make cloakebags of: This lump of man's flesh (that like a
foreman of a Jury could speak nothing so well as guilt) conuayed me up a pair
of stairs, and so to a door, where another Fury like himself sat, telling
me, that if I meant to have entrance there, I must pay my fees, or else I could
have no farther passage that way, a shilling was his demand, which he would
have, or else I must return the same way I came; I (seeing nothing but a
silver key would open this lock) gave him his fee, wishing the weight of that
twelve pence in Aqua fortis or Mercury water in his neck, but having shot this
gulf, my corpulent conductour brought me through a little Gallery, which led
us to a spacious Room, and then into a Hall hung round about with the story of
the Prodigal child (a very edifying piece of worke-man-ship for the guests of
that place) being come into this uncouth and strange place, my guide (with a
countenance as sour as any mustard-maker in the City) bad me welcome, and
told me that there was a garnish to be paid: But I that understood the
Hebrew, the Syriake or Caldean language as well as his speech, asked him what
that was, he told me two shillings would discharge it, I mildely certified
him, I was not at that unhappy present so well furnished, besides I was ignorant
whether any such thing were due to him, or no; at this answer he roused
himself up like an angry mastiffe, and being in collar, in a currish manner
barkt out these words to me. Sir, if you mean to lie on this side, you must
and shall pay me my fees, or (though you be no Alderman) I will be so bold
as to vncloake you. I seeing him so resolute, and my self Ioath to lie without
a bed, because it was late, put mine arm into my pocket, which was so soar
with the Sargeants griping, that I had much ado to pull two shillings out of
it; that being discharged, like a base violl) he went grumbling up stairs with
me, and brought me to my lodging, richly hung with cob-weblawne. So having
showed me my bed, whereon he clapped a pair of sheets, that never came nigh
Holland by three hundred mile, left me a piece of candle scarce so long as his
nose, locked up the door, bid me goodnight, went down gingling his keys,
and left me to my repose.

CHAP. II. 1. Mine acquaintance with my fellow prisoners. 2. Mine entertainment
at dinner time the next day. 3. The character of a prison. 4. The Keepers
kindness to me while I had money. 5. Their unkindness to me when I had none.
6. Lastly their transporting me from the Masterside to the Knights ward.
But what with change of my lodging, and meditating of mine entertainment, I
slept not at all, but like a true Malcontent, made my brains the minutes to
every clock I heard, betwixt whose several sounds the watch of mine invention
beating up my panting heart hammered forth a hundred strange cogitations: thus
lay I longing for day, at whose approach, I might descerne the manner of my new
distastefull lodging, which looked so confused, rasty and ominous, that every
object presented new grief, and struck me into further consideration of this
worse then woeful purgatory, wherein I lay plunged by the froward will of Fate,
dreading the danger I was in, and doubting how long this unwelcome affliction
might continue. In the midst of my musing, my chamber-fellowes awak't, whom I
coniectured to be of the same fellowship of affliction that I my self was: I
saluted them with a Bon-iour, they perceiving me to be a stranger, gratified my
good morrow with a Bien, asking of me whether I came in upon an arrest or a
command; I answered, with a deep sigh and sad voice, faith Gentlemen I am
arrested to my grief, God help me, at which words I could scarce refrain from
tears, which caused my kind chamberfellowes to pity my present sorrows, and
apply some words of comfort to expel them. In the same chamber lay an
Attorney: who began to be more busy then the rest, who perceiving I was
apt to give ear to any new conceited hope, slipped on his black suit (which was
worn bare for want of brushing) and coming to my bed side, whispered in mine
ear, and told me if I would rise he could tell me something for my good;
these words possessed each part with more then haste to hear this unexpected
kindness, so being with speed apparrelled, down the stairs posted I and my
Attorney, who taking me by the hand, demanded of me whether I were in upon
action or execution, I answered, an action of 100* pound, to which he replied
he would have me out presently, and with an Habeas Corpus remove my cause to
the Kings Bench and so farewell. I (thinking the doors had been blown open
already by his breath) stood in a maze, considering with my self whether he
were mortal or no, yet marking that his crabbed countenance accorded with his
counsel, for which he greedily gaped for ten groates, I began to pause with my
self, and asked him what the charge would amount to, he told me for 40.
shillings he would undertake to set me free, I told him I would consider a
little of it, and then he should hear my resolve: and so we transcended to our
former lodging chamber, where we found all our associates upon their legs, some
buttoning, some trussing, others taking Tobacco, to expel noisome sauors, they
all kindly saluted me, and so from complementing and talking, we fell to
drinking (the only remedy to drive away melancholy, and bring strangers
acquainted) thus we past away the morning while seruicetime, which being spent
in devotion, the table was covered and up came our dinner, at which each man
sat down without respecting of persons, for he that first comes is first
seated like those that come to see plays; or go to dinner at an ordinary, but
I (being the youngest prisoner as their fashion is) sat at the upper end of the
table, to which preferment by much entreaty, I was advanced, short grace served
for sharp stomachs, and so to it they fell without circumstance. But I seeing
all their teeth laboring so hard, thought foul shame mine should stand idle,
began to accompany my quick shauers, but as I was about to put meat into my
mouth, one with his mouth half full, mumbled out and ill tuned speech of a
garnish, the Vintners boy that waights for such purposes, was ready with a
pottle of clarret, who filling a boule brimme-full, set it on my trencher, and
so I was entreated to drink to all the society, and compelled to pay for it
when I had done: these plagues diued deeper into my pockets then Graues-end
searchers do into ships, to find out uncustomed commodities. Thus having
finished our feast (and waiting for no banquet) we rose, every man disposing of
himself as he pleased, only my self guided by the evil Fatewalkt into the
fore-roome, where the fraternity of Keepers and other servants of the house
were feeding on the fragments that were reserved from our table, I with a
common salutation bad much good do them, but when they had emptied their cramd
jaws, told me there was a certain garnish to be paid, I now being too well
acquainted with that language, told them plainly I would pay no more, to
which they replied and said, that then I should have my liberty no more, for
all the rest of my fellow prisoners had paid it, and except I would be their
imitators and come off roundly, I should be barred of that privilege the rest
of my associates had, I, loath to be pent up like a Lion in the Tower, and have
no more liberty then to look through an iron grate, demanded the sum, they
told me sixpence, to send for a quart of clarret wine, which was the last
testor that remained in my peaceful pockets, at last, flinging it to them, I
walked up to my lodging again, and thereby chance espied a standish and a sheet
of undefiled paper, which being fit for my purpose, I made bold with, and in
the midst of melancholy, writ this character of a prison.

It is a Fabric built of the same stuff, the Keepers of it are made of,
stone and iron: It is an unwholesome full-stuffed humorous body. which has an
Hole in the posteriors of it, whence it vents many stinking, noisome and
unsavory smells, which is the only cause there is such a perpetual sickness
and disease in it: It is a book where an honest man may learn and read a
lesson of bettering himself, and where a bad man may study to be ten times
worse: it is a costiue creature, that surfets almost all the year long, yet
very seldom does purge it self; and when it does it leaves abundance of ill
humors behind; when Epimetheus opened Pandora's box, there did not more
mischiefs and maladies fly out of it into the world, then there is in this
cursed place, for it has more sicknesses predominating in it, then there are
in twenty French Hospitals, or at the Bathe, in the spring or fall of the
leaf; It is a Bankrupts banqueting house, where he sits feasting himself
with dishes borrowed from other men's tables, without any honest determination
to repay them again: It is a Prodigals purgatory, and a sickness that many
young Gentlemen, and Citizens sons and heirs are incident to be troubled
with, at the age of one and twenty or much thereabout, It is a dicing house,
where much cheating is used, for there is little square dealing to be had
there, yet a man may have what bail he will for his money.

This being finished, I veiwed it over, but as I was reading of it, I was called
down to speak with a friend that came to visit me in my new transformation,
and after some formal gossipping discourses, as I am sorry to see you beer,
How were you met with all, and what hard hap had you, and such like) lent me a
brace of Angels, the sight of which two fair creatures, made me courageous,
and a companion for the best, I then roused* my heart up to a strain of mirth,
which caused the Gentlemen to delight in my company, the keepers began to wax
diligent, I could no sooner name a bottle of Ale, but it was ready to fly into
my face, the Vintners boy was ready at mine elbow, that if I called but for a
quart of sack or clarret, would forget his errand by the way, and for his own
profit present me with a pottle. In this iouiall vain I wasted my money and
time, never desiring to deal with mine Attorney for my liberty, because I
understood by others, that it was only a trick to worm me out of my money.
Many such supplies I had to uphold my mirth, but none to dischage my debts,
which began to increase, for every day brought in a new action, till the total
sum of my debts had drawn a head, and joined their forces in the Paper-house.

But at the end of the week when they use to call for their reckoning (which
is for diet and lodging) they willingly trusted me, telling me there was no
such haste, thus I frolikt out three weeks on the Masterside, thinking my
credit stood built on the firm rock of their kindness, whereas indeed (as
the sequel shall unfold) it was suncke in the quickesands of their cruelty.
For having run my self into a months arrerages, my friends began to wax
weary of supplying my wants, and the keepers (knowing of it) unwilling to trust
me any farther, thus both my friends and hopes shook hands with me, and bad me
farewell; to be brief, the month being ended, my fat fellow (before
mentioned) like a watchman came with a bill in his hand, to make a privy
search in my purse, but finding it altogether unprovided for his purpose,
returned the bill to the book without any cross language, upon the view of
these unsatisfied figures, there arose a thunderclap of conspiracy against
me, for my present transportation over from the Masterside to the Knights
ward, but I that scorned to be frighted with the first flash of false fire,
defended my self with good words that night, and so went to bed, determining
with my self (rather then be offensive to them which might more incense them
against me) the next day to go quietly over my self, and not to discredit my
self so much, as to be forced over by compulsion; so the next morning, as
soon as I was ready, I took my leave of all my fellows on that side, and
instantly went over, writing these few verses in a little piece of paper, and
left them to the perusing of my kind Comrades.

To all my friends that hear this single story,
If you to try their kindness have occasion,
Being possessed in the Compters Territory,
Whilst money last they will please thee with persuasion:
But being spent, they change their first evasion
To their own shapes, when they your wealth have won,
With you they will deal, as they with me have done.
Thus leaving the Masterside, I kindly entreat your patience to walk over to
the Knights ward with me, and partake of the fruits of my new society, and
strange unexpected entertainment.

CHAP. III. 1. Mine entrance into the Knights ward. 2. My rough usage. 3. The
description of a commanding officer in that place. 4. My strange acquaintance
with a company of Gentlemen, being all prisoners. 5. The occasion of this
ensuing discovery. 6. And lastly, the entrance into this discovery.
I No sooner came down the Masterside stairs, but a key was turned for me, so
up went I into the Knights side, but did go as heavily (howsoever I laid a
brave and gilded out side upon my heavy and leaden discontent) as those poor
prisoners that go up Newgate stairs, after they come condemned from the
Sessions house. At first I went through a long dark gallery, that represented
the place it was most like, Hell; for it was as gloomy, as if the Rauen-like
wings of night did continually cover it, having past through this Egyptian
fogge, on a sudden I stepped into the Hall, where men were walking up and down,
as thick as Merchants do on the Exchange between twelve and one in the
afternoon, being entered, I began to play my part as well as I could, and thus
to salute them.

Gentle men, God save you all, may that you all long for happen unto you all,
Liberty; courteously they returned the like to me, and badde me welcome holding
me in discourse concerning my forsaking the Masterside, but as I was making an
Apologeticall defense for my poverty, and a true narration of their cruelty
that turned me over, I was interrupted by a fellow, whose character I thus will
describe unto you. He was a tall rawboned thing, and might very well at Mid*
summertime, have served in steed of a May Pole, had he been in a country town,
for all the hob-nail-wearers in the parish to dance about; his face was much
like a withered warden, and wrinckled all ouer-like an Apple-Iohn of a year
old, he was chapfalne, and looked like the picture of Famine, the hair that
grew upon his mussell was so black, that I thought he had a couple of black
puddings round about his chaps, besides all these exterior endowments, his
internal virtues were as many, for he was as proud as a new made Constable,
and would move his hat no more to any man that came within his jurisdiction,
then a Lawyer will to a poor client, though he stand two hours together bare
before him, this compound of ill qualities (I say) very roughly came to me,
when Heaven knows I never dreamed of such a mischief, and thus accosted me.

Sir are you a Prisoner? yea sir, said I, Fortune and the world have been my
heavy adversaries, who conspiring together, have concluded that I must lie
here while the Divine providence does break the Adamantine bond of my dull and
Saturnine mishaps. But sir, said he, have you any money? If I have none (said
I) make no doubt but my supplies will come in to morrow, and then what is fit
to be done, I will see satisfied: nay (said he) I must not be procrastinated,
prorogued or demurred withal, I must have a Garnish of you, a parcel of
eighteen pence, I will not spare you if you were my father; I believed him,
therefore gave him fair words, desiring him to be calmer, and the next money
that I was blessed withal, he should participate of, at this answer he began
to look as scuruily on me, as a whore on a constable, a beggar on a bead^^ or
whipping post, as a cheater on a Justice; and began to rent out three or four
three-pild, huge Basilisco oaths, that would have torn a Roring-boyes ears in
a thousand shatters, telling me, that the quality of my usage should be
according to the quantity of my money: which I found true, for when it drew
near bed time, he brought me to a privy lodging (of indeed a lodging
neighboring nigh the Privy) for the chamber stinkes worse all the year long,
then a lakes-farmers clothes does at twelve a clock at night. But days
rosiate finger had no sooner boared out the eyes of night, but I got up, and
began in a solitary and sad manner to mourn and pity my self, being more
amazed then those that dreamed they saw hell, and had felt the tortures
thereof, or those that drunk of Circes cups, and felt themselves turning
monsters. Being thus drencht in a boundless sea of melancholy, for the space
of a fortnight or three weeks together, Iresolued to walk into the yard, to
see if I could epsy any of my friends that were in the Master-side, purposing
to spend the day away in discourse, but I walked there an hour or more, and saw
none but such as were as melancholy as my self, so I determined to walk up
again, but by chance I turned my head aside, and saw the cellar door standing
open, gaping to swallow any prisoner that drew near, so hoping to find some
of mine old acquaintance there, I stepped down, and being no sooner descended,
but I beheld a company of Gentlemen, all prisoners, sitting at a square table,
making themselves exceeding merry with the music the cans made, being as
brimfull of beer, at mine heart was of melancholy, or theirs of mirth, some
having the pipes never out of their mouths, who puffed more smoke out of their
noses, then ever came out of Cole-harbar chimneyes, or any brew house in Saint
Katherines: some again singing as merrily, as if they had been as free as the
mountain air, I seeing them in these Bacchanaliall rages, feign would have
slipped by them, but one that sat at the upper end of the table (having a Can in
one hand and a pipe in the other) desired me to approach and be one of their
society (protesting more kindness to me, then a Dutchman will when he is
drunk) so proffered me half a can; I told him I could not pledge him so
much, but I would drink a whole one in conceit; why quoth he, not drink,
Foot, man it is the soul of good fellowship, the marrow of a Poets Minerua, it
makes a man as valiant as Hercules, though he were as cowardly as a French man
when he is sober, besides I will prove it necessary for a man to be drunk
sometimes, for suppose you should kill a man when you are drunk, you should
never be hanged for it while you are sober, therefore I think it is good for
you to be always drunk, again, it is the kindest companion and friendliest
sin of all the seven, for whereas most sins leave a man (by some accident)
before his death, this trusty Trojan Drunkenness will never forsake him while
the breath is out of his body; and lastly, a full bowl of sack or clarret, or
a Can of strong beer, will drowned all sorrows; indeed sir, said I, whether
it will drowned all sorrows or no, I am not greatly experienct in, but I am
sure it will drowned our souls, yet sir, for your kindness I will bestow the
courtesy of the cellar upon you, and so I called for half a dozen, and drank
a little to them all; another that was opposite against me, asked me if I would
drink Tobacco, so proffered me the pipe, which I denied, telling him that I
would not be conversant with that Indian whore, that not only the Lords and
Gentry of the Land had committed adultery with, but also every Tinker, Cobbler
and Dray-man of the City. Why, said he, it is an excellent purge for the head,
true, said I, but it is a vilde purge for the purse, and that for mine own
part, I had rather have a piece of pudding of an inch long for mine own
eating, then twenty yards of pudding Tobacco for my drinking, they seeing my
fixed and sollid resolution, let me alone to have mine own humor as they had
theirs; so that we sat exceeding merry without any melancholy fit, and at the
last, I began to give them a touch of my quality, but after we began to be
more familiar together, he that first entertained me, whispered me in the ear,
and told me, if he thought I would be secret, he would reveal that to me,
which should not only for ever gain me a neuer-dying memory, but also would
be an unknown profit to the Commonwealth, I promised him to be as secret as
any Surgeon, then he called me aside from the rest of our company, and told
me, if I would repair to him in the morning, he would vnbowell the hugest
bulk of villainy, that ever was burden some to the world, that he would
anatomize vice, and lay the ulcers and sores of this corrupted age, so apparent
to the sight of this Kingdom, that the most Ospray and Owle-eyed spectator
should not choose but confess, there never was a more necessary and commodious
discovery revealed. Why sir, said I, there is a book called Greenes Ghost
haunts Cony-catchers; another called Ledger demaine, and The Black Dog of
Newgate, but the most wittiest, elegantest and eloquentest Piece (Master
Dekkers, the true heir of Apollo composed) called The Bell-man of London, have
already set forth the vices of the time so viuely, that it is impossible the
Anchor of any other man's brain can sound the sea of a more deep and dreadful
mischief. These indeed, said he, have done (especially the last) most
exquisitely, both for their own reputation, and their countries good, but I
have that locked up in the closet of my breast, that when it is opened and made
apparent to you will amaze you. Therefore I admire that the Fabric of the
earth is not continually shaken with earthquakes, that the Earth it self (as
she is a mother to bear all kind of fruit) does not in gender all kind of
murdering and killing creatures, as Harpies, Cockatrices, wolves and Hyenas to
destroy those that are continually trampling on her teeming womb; that the
air is not choked with fogs, and that black pitel^y mists does not
perpetually masque the face of Heaven, and leave the world in obscurity,
putting us in mind of our sins, a thousand times blacker then that eclipse;
and lastly, that the sea is not turned all to blood to put us in mind of the
cruelty and unconscionable usage of one man toward another, for there are vices
in this sin drowned age, that are able to pull the two edged sword of
vengeance on our heads, and pluck fire from the forge of heaven, I admire that
we have not leane-faced Famine, meager mortality, pale sickness, and
grim-faced war tyrannizing in this Land, as once it did in Jerusalem, in the
time of Titus and Vespasian* when the glorious Sanctum Sanctorum was set on
fire; when the fields were filled with slaughtered carcasses, and when the
mother for want of food, was driven to kill her own child, to quench her own
hunger. He would have proceeded farther in his discourse, but that I entreated
him to contain himself while the morning, telling him I would rather fail of
my liberty, then to meet him to hear this discovery, upon this resolve we both
went to our former seats, and fell to our former familiarity, but on a sudden,
the Keepers broke off our mirth, and commanded every man to his lodging, so not
daring to displease their authority, we paid the shot, in a friendly and kind
manner took our leaves one of each other, went up stairs, and every man to
his several ward and lodging. But my brains like the wandering stars; or
clocks on Shroue-Tuesdayes were never at quiet, but all night I lay wondering
and musing what discovery this should be, therefore I longed more to see the
day, then an hungry Courtier will a table groaning underneath the weight of
well-fill'd dishes: but the Day Star no sooner began to cherish the world
with his all-reuiuing light, but I sprung from mine hard couch, made me ready,
and when the doors were open (by much entreaty) got into the yard, where having
not walked half a dozen turns, but I made my repair into the Cellar, more a
thirst to have my minds palate quenched with his discourse, then my mouth with
the best liquor in all the barrels, but having called for two Cans of beer, I
sent for a quart of sack to whet the point of his wit, that it might wound
vice the deeper, that being come, I sent for my friend who lay in the Hole, who
was forth with let out (being an old prisoner) and being come down, thus I
began to salute him.

Ingenious friend, as well come to me as this fair day is to the world, this
night has seemed long, but the burning desire I had to confer with you,
concerning the discovery (you out of your love promised to reveal) made it
more tedious, and if you will but disclose the maine body, let me alone to
vnmasque the face, and lay every member open to the worlds eye. Sir (quoth he)
you seem so complete in your quality, that I hope you will publish what I
shall relate, if you should smother it, I rather would keep it to my self
then impart it, but not doubting of your diligence in this matter, I will
venture my discourse, and good sit give a diligent attention. I (as glad to
hear as he to speak) took up a room in a private place, and loath to hold my
self in delays, first of all, swept clean the channel of mine at tention
with a cup of sack, drunk an health to him, and the liberty of all poor
distressed prisoners that lay laboring underneath the burden of misery, which
being pledged in this (or such a) manner, he began.

As the maine Ocean is nourished by the arms and rivers, that pay howerly
tribute to him with the silver streams, and especially out of our Land, by
swan-blest Thames, swift Seuerne, dangerous passing Humber, and smooth-faced
Trent, so is this turbulent sea the Compter by these four eurrents hereafter
mentioned: First, Unconscionable Citizens: Secondly, Politic Prodigals, alias
Ingeneers: Thirdly. Catch-poles: Fourthly and lastly, Constables and their
adherents, as the Beadle and his Watchmen, all whose abuses I will strip
naked, and ierke with my tongue, till I fetch blood; the first of whom have
been the only cause of my detaining in prison this four years, yet let no
man think that I speak against all Citizens. No, as I hope for eternal
happiness, I reverence that Worshipful, ancient, and fameworthy order, I
mean such as maintain themselves and their families, I touch not those that
care not who look and pry into their consciences, because their dealings have
been so square and honest: but such as enrich themselves by fraud, deceit and
sinister means, working upon the infirmity of youth, and greene-witted
Gallants, to increase their own store, caring not how much they decrease other
men's estates: such there are in the most flourishing and religious
Commonwealths in the world; In the most famous universities in Christendom
there are some dunces resident. that not only disgrace themselves, but also
their fellow-students; It is impossible, but that in the most virtuous Court
there will be some Parasites, so in the most goodly and glorious city under
Heavens Canopy there are some aspes lurking, that sting the reputation of their
brethren by their poisonous and corrupt dealings, such as these I will portray
and limme forth to you, and first of all I will discourse unto you the
extreme abuse of Gaine-greedy Citizens, and in order will touch the Politic
Prodigals, alias Ingeneers, and (I think Soule-lesse Sargeants, and Constables
and Beadles: but first of the first.

CHAP. IV. Containing 1. The Subtilty of many unconscionable Citizens An
unconscionable Citizen, the first current that paies howerly tribute to the Sea
the Compter.
that entangle young Gentlemen and lap them into bonds. 2. The craft and
cunning of their Confederates (Gentle-men-like Broakers) by whose wicked and
unchristian like dealing, many elder brothers and brave Gentlemen are undone.
I Have read that Italian Mountebanckes, before they speak in their drug-tongue
and Fustian language to the auditory of innocent and ignorant people, furnish
out the play, where they sing their own Encomians, with viols, painted boxes,
and bills of all the famous cures they pretend to have done in many foreign
parts of Christendom, which base and usual iugglings are only to enrich
themselves, and defraud the general rout that flock about them. Many
Mountebancke-Citizens have we in this most sumptuous (but most subtle and
sinful) City of London, that when they would ravish the mind, and take the
intuitiue sense of many profuse Prodigals, and melting Heirs with their
Syren-like seducings lay open their wares, as satin, veluets, gold and silver
lace, or any other braided commodities (or rather indeed discommodities) which
though they show rich, yet are out of fashion or not saleable, these are
springes to catch young Country Woodcockes, or our City Dottrels, that had
rather be out of the world then out of the fashion, who will be brave for the
present time, though their gallantry cost them all their future fortunes, who
with more feruency* and protestation woo the Citizen for his trash and
trumpery, then many decayed Knights will rich widows to inherit their
possessions; but our tradesman perceiving their forwardness and follies,
plays the rope-maker and will be extreme backward, and will not be brought
to trust them with any of his Bartholomew faire-stuffe upon any condition;
bonds he refuses, recognizances he disdaineth, judgments he will not hear
off, statutes he scorneth, and tells them in a Puritanicall fashion, that he had
rather trust a Gentleman on his word, then his bond or oath. For (says he)
they that will not have a care to keep their words, will not stick to have so
large a conscience as to break their day, and slight the payment of their
bonds, again, he tells them the danger he is in of leesing of his debt: for
(says he) when the bonds come to be due, and payday at hand, may not they
straight fly over into the Low-countreyes, or take Sanctuary in Milford lane,
Duke Humphreyes Ordinary, or get a Protection Royal from the King, and so
defraud me of my debt, and many such collops as these have been cut from the
body of mine estate since I have been a Tradesman. Therefore good Gentlemen
(says he) I cannot dare trust any longer, for my kindness has bred mine own
calamity, then set up your resolutions and trouble me no more, for I have given
you your answer.

Thus are my young nouices struck to the heart at the first venny, and dares
come no more for fear of as sharp a repulse.

Alas, alas, this is but to grind the blunt apperite of my commodity taker
into a sharper edge, and make them more greedy of their own ruins, imitating
the cunning and deceit of pretty, but petulant and close Curtezans, that are
nice when a sicke-brain'd young Gallant importunes them upon any kindness,
only to make him more fierce upon his own confusion, holding him off, like a
Fencer, at distance a moves or two, because he shall come up the roundlier to
her purpose: but to the matter.

But some or one of my young Gallants that never gives over plodding with
himself how he might get into the books of some Goldsmiths, Habberdasher,
Silkman, Woollen or Linnen-draper, has some Broker or other coming early in
a morning and certifies him, that if it pleased him, he should have a commodity
that lay ready to be carried away, if he would enter into bond for it,
nominating the same man that gave him the former repulse. My young heir (whose
heart knocks against his ribs for joy) kindly bids the Broaker welcome, sends
for a cup of wine, and drinks to him with all his heart, resolving to
entertain his proffer upon any condition, protesting rather then he will let
such a blessed opportunity slip, will set his hands to more parchment then a
whole flock of sheep are able to furnish a Scriuener with; but my Broaker
(before instructed by the commodity-letter) tells him that though he heard him
speak something doubtful of him, yet if he would be ruled by him, he would
undertake to make his credit pass as firm as any Farmers or Yeomen in Kent,
for (says he) I am a great friend of this Tradesmans, and make no doubt but
may prevail as much with him as any man in this Town, especially if you will
be ruled by me, you must not be too importunate, but as scornful as he is
disdainefull, tell him that you are your fathers heir, and that such lands he
has you must inherit, and that the entailement cannot be cut off, though he
were never so heinous an enemy of yours, besides you must tell him you are
about to marry some rich widow which you know you might win, so that you could
but have a hundred pound or two, to put your self in good clothes.

These spells charms my poor Prodigal, so at last he and the Woolfe (that
came as Legate from the Tiger) go together, and find my Citizen busy in his
shop, not taking any notice of their coming, but (as to other passingers) at
first asks them what they lack, and what they would buy, but boldly they come
into the shop and after acquaintance taken, the Broaker vnfoldes the matter,
and the occasion of their coming to him, telling him that he came with a
friend of his about a commodity, and if he were a friend, as he always took
him to be, as to condescend to the Gentle man's request, and let him have an
hundred pound: for (says he) I know his friends are of fair possessions, he
is his fathers eldest son, besides on my conscience he would not trouble you at
this present, if he were not to marry with a rich widow, whom he may lose for
want of setting forth, and then no doubt when the match is made up, but he will
have an honest care to pay in your money* with a million of thanks for your
kindness. Now all the while the Broaker is pleading, mine Innocent does second
him, and will rather then go without his trinkets, bind whatsoever the
Broaker says with half a score oaths.

The Citizen begin to hearken after this, and protests to my green gosling,
that he would be glad to do any man a pleasure, but that he has had so many
losses already, and that he would be willing to let him have an hundred
pounds worth of commodities, if so be he thought it would redound to his good,
and that he might be sure at the six months end to have his money paid in,
the young Gallant protests, the Broaker warrants it, and at last, though very
loah, the Citizen condescends, but how, thus, that if he could procure as good
a man as himself to be bound with him, he should have what ware he could
desire, for, says he, man's life is frail and brittle, and you may die a
fortnight or a week hence, for ought that I know, nay, to morrow, or soon at
night, and then where is nine hundred pound, therefore, good Sir, look out
some of your most especial and indeered friends, and get one of them to be
bound with you, and you shall have the wares at a quarter of an hours warning.
The tide now is turned, and Signior Unthrift put to his nonplus, and at last
falls to entreat Master Broaker to be the man, who for two or three days
together, will by no means or persuasions be won to enter into bond with him,
except he must share half. Is not this extreme and almost incredible
villainy? and most unconscionable dealings, thus to snare in the Gentry of the
land, and ruin his fortunes but newly in the spring, knowing that he will
rather let him have three quarters of the Commodity then go without it,
because, as many others do, he would go gallant, have money in his purse, and
keep company with satin and velvet outsides.

But suppose the commodities are delivered, after they have both sealed the
bonds (you must suppose the Heir always to be the principal) how must these
Hobby horses, Reames of brown paper, Iewes-trumps and Bables, Babies and
Rattles be sold, the Gentleman is ashamed to proffer them to sale himself,
no, he trusts the other that shares half with him, to put them off* who must
be hired to sell them, and perhaps when they are all sold out right, will have
to his own share three quarters of them, are not these dealings worthy of the
the sharpest rod Justice ever did hold in her righteous hands, they are and
have been soundly lasht, and severely punished, by that most noble, grave, wise
and provident Statesman, the Right Honorable the Lord high Chancellor of
England, yet for all this there will such false play be acted, though the Sword
of Justice continually were hanging over their heads: but I will return to our
former subject, let us now suppose my young Gallant reuelling in a Tavern or
Ordinary: you may be sure the Broaker is triumphing, that he plucked the
feathers of this young gull, and means ere long to leave him as bare of means
as he is of brains. Now my usurious Citizen dreams of nothing but his day,
which he hopes my nouice will break, which is no sooner expired, but
instantly, by some stratagem or other, gets him within the liberty, then
inuites him to supper (by giving him fair words) either to his own or some of
his neighbors houses, and when they have almost made an end, instead of a
mess of fruit, or a piece of Banbury cheese to close up their stomachs, a
Brace (or more) of Sargeants are not far from his shoulder, and except he
presently pay* he must presently to prison. Are these worthy the names of
Citizens? no, no, such may be Citizens of London, but never of Heavenly
Jerusalem. At this period I began to speak to him, saying: Sir, I protest you
have revealed a strange and monstrous abuse to the Gentry of this land, if I
did not take you to be (what I think you are) an honest man, I should stand
in a great doubt, whether your discourse did taste of truth or no: but good Sir
proceed. Sir, as I hope for salvation, said he, (an oath not for a Christian
to dally with) I relate no untruth, but what is as nigh a kin to truth as I am
to misery, for what I have spoken, I find by mine own woeful experience to be
true, and what has been practiced on my self by these City-Cormorants, these
tricks have been put on me, and for which I have suffered a long
imprisonment, and yet they will have no compassion on me, but rather see me
starve then relieve me, and either have my carcass or their coin, yet their
consciences know, what I had from them was nothing but rotten, base and
moth*eaten commodities, an hundred pounds worth, of which (according to their
rate) I never made fifty of, yet they stick not to demand an hundred of me,
beside the interest and all their charges.

Again, mark the policy they have to keep a poor prisoner in fetters of
adversity: if they suppose the prisoner goes about to sue out an Audita
querela, forthwith they either put their debt over to some Alderman, or else
agree with some Officer in the Exchequer, and so put their debt over to the
king, faining they owe him so much money, knowing that the Cauncery will not, or
cannot allow any thing, in such a case as this, to proceed against his Majesty.
This is a speeding trick, and such a one I am now trounc't with, and many
besides my self.

I have read when Jews have bought a red hair'd boy, at first they will cloth
him in silks and taffaties, ravish him with all delights that can be thought
on, never have music from his ears or banquets from his taste, and thus use
him until such time they know he is plump, fat and fit for their purpose; but
when the poor Christian least thinks of his imminent ruin, he is taken by a
brace of slaves, and tied up by the heels, so by degrees beaten to death with
cudgels, having Mummie made of his brains: Such as these are unconscionable
Citizens, that at first will cloth our young Prodigals in silks and veluets,
gold and silver lace, inuit him home to dinner, use him very courteously, but
when his bonds are due, and that he lest dreams of his misfortunes, a couple or
two of Sargeants are set upon him, and hurry him to the Compter, where perhaps
he shall lie two* three, four or five year, nay a dozen or twenty years
together before he can get himself released, or if he chance to prevail so
much with his creditors, as to enfranchize him, it must be upon some
unreasonable, unconscionable condition, as to give him five hundred pound for
an hundred at the death of his father. Vulcan fell from Heaven into the I Will of
Lemnos, and by that fall lost the use of one of his feet, let all such
unconscionable Citizens take heed they fall not from the earth to Hell, and
lose their souls.

These are the Boares that plow up whole acres, nay whole fields of Gentlemen's
lands with their snoutes, these are swine that eat up whole Orchards, and
these are they whose fiery consciences drink up whole fishpooles at a drought;
their usurious dealings make so many Cornutos in the City as there are, for
when young Gentlemen have been beggered by their extortion they have no other
means then to fall in with their wives and seek to them for supply: It is this
that makes Newmarket heath, and Royston-dounes about Christmas time so full of
highway men that poor Country people cannot pass quietly to their Cottages,
but some Gentleman will borrow all the money they have (only indeed they will
make them take their bonds) this makes Tiburne and Wapping have so many
hangers-on, and this is the cause so many such Citizens sons are plagued
after their fathers deaths as their fathers when they were living have plagued
others, for most commonly some knave or debosht fellow lurch the fools their
sons as cunningly after their fathers discease as they did others only to make
their sons Gentlemen, who at last may as miserably die in the Hole for want
of sustenance as some of his fathers debtors have done before him.

Upon this I began to interrupt him saying, sir in this short time that I have
been here I have seen some Creditors bring their Debtors both meat, drink,
and money when they have been sick, and ill at ease.

It Is true sir said he, I acknowledge it, but did you never hear that when a
Lion has got a pretty bleating lamb or kid in his paws he will play and
tumble up and down with them a little while, but you must not think it is for
any love he bears them, but only to chafe their blood and make them eat
more sweet, and tender: Such are these kind of unkind Citizens that when
they have got young Gentlemen into prison will (if the sum be any thing
weighty) relieve him with meat, drink, and money, (if they see him begin to
droope) but do you think this is in love to him? no, if you do you wander a
thousand leagues from a true construction, he does it to keep him alive that
he may have his money if any means should fall to him, and that the world may
take notice of his charity, alas, alas this is but a fained holiness, which
is a double iniquity: This kindness is but like Alchimy, or Saint Martins
rings that are fair to the eye, and have a rich outside, but if a man should
break them a sunder, and look into them, they are nothing but brass, and
copper. The Apples of Gomorrha have glorious rinds but infectious cores.

It is an extreme misery for a Prisoner to be indebted to a rich man, or a
very poor man; for the first (most commonly) will have all or none, for if his
debtour chance to die, the loss he may well spare, but if it is his fortune to
live, and pay him it adds to his estate, the other (that is) the poor man
will have no pity because it may be the debt is all he is worth.

Thus do many Gentlemen perish under the hands of cruel Creditours, nay a
father that has brought up his child with care and pain, grief and heart
breaking, and thinks to leave him such fair possessions after his decease,
that he may live in his Country like a Gentleman (as his ancestors have done
before him) either in his life time does see his son lie rotting in prison,
or is not able to show his face out of his fathers gates, or after his decease,
his brothers, sisters, friends and kinsfolks see his lands extended on, his
woods felled down before his face, those legacies and portions he should pay
to his brothers and sisters, paid away to satisfy his debts (being base
commodities) and so beggars a whole worshipful Family, who before that cursed
time had lived a hundred years or more in grace and favor in his Country.
Alas, alas, with that the tears fell from his eyes, and he could speak no
more for weeping, yet I desired him to proceed, but he craved my pardon, and
told me that he was at the farthest end of that discourse, and thus (quoth he)
have I showed you the nature, property, and quality of this maine arm that
hourly paies tribute to the Ocean the Compter, now will I go to the second
arm which is concerning Gentlemen-Cheaters.

CHAP. V. 1. The true nature and quality of many of our modern Spent-Callants
the second current.
spent-Gallants. 2. Their tricks to fetch in young Heirs to set their hands to
bonds. 3. And a true narration of their vicious, and lewd course of life.
HOw can those Tyrants flourish in their kingdoms, when the foundation of
their reign is built on the Sepulchers of the right and lawful Heir they
have murdered? And how can those men prosper whose raisings are reared upon
other men's ruins? Many such there are in these most sinful days who being
gulled themselves when they were ignorant-sots by knaves, turn knaves
themselves, and study to cheat, defeat, and cosen young Heirs. Is not this a
strange Metamorphosis? It is better to be a poor fool then a rich Knave.
Many of these unlucky, and ominous Stars wagge, and wander perpetually
reigning in the Sphere of this City, that hunt after young Heirs as greedily
as the Devil does after Usurers souls when they be upon their death beds, for
these like Pirates or Bandites live only upon the spoil.

These Soldiers having been beaten to the world (or indeed beaten by the
world) begin to summon up their senses, and call their idle brains to a
strickt reckoning how to get that up again their riot and follies have spent,
and thinking there is no way to recover themselves but by that they have ruined
themselves, cast about-them and begin to fish after this order.

They prepare their lines, provide their baits, make ready their hooks which
shall have such constant and firm batbs, that after they have struck a
gudgeon in the gills shall be sure to hold him though they suffer him to play
a little in the stream: when they have all these things in readiness they
seek into diverse floods, as the Temple, Inns of Court, Citizens-houses, as
wealthy Merchants, and gold Smiths pry into Ordinaries, and inquire if there be
any in that place worthy abaite, if these fail then they repair into
Pauls-Church, to Playhouses, Cockpits, Brothells, and Tauernes, and leave no
place unsearched, but like the Air visit all parts rather then they will go
without their prey, and if they have found any that is agreeable to their
minds, or that they think may easily be wrought upon, in this fashion they
use him.

Like his shadow they will never be from his heels, but dog him into what
place soever he goes, especially if he be a young country-Gentleman whom his
father has sent up to the City to see fashions, and rather then he shall go
out of town as raw as he came in they will season him, and give him a little
of the City poudring: They will first seek what means his father does allow
him, then of what nature he is, either merry or melancholy, mild or dogged,
and according to the garb and fashion he is of, bear themselves toward him:
He shall not go into a Tavern, Ordinary (or almost any friends house) but
they will be as nigh his body as his sins are his soul, and by some sinister
way, sement, and glue themselves into his familiarity whatsoever it cost them.
This being brought to perfection and themselves grown something familiar (as
in much company keeping a man shall join himself to much society) they never
will be from his elbow but seem to be his bosom friend, his masculine sweet
heart, and that like Hypocrates Twins they must live and die together.

The golden-leaued marigold never opens her leaves while the sun does rise, and
never closes her self while he does set; so these politic Prodigalls, never
will be stirring while my Heir is rising, and never sleep while they see him
inclining that way: because they would be sure to have him in their sight. But
having by much industry and sweat apted and fitted him to their humor and
purpose, and wrought him to such a soft and waxen temperature (that they may
cast him into what mould they list) bring him to their Rendeuous (an Ordinary)
where this decayed Knight salutes him, that poor Esquire does embrace him, the
other beggarly Gentleman kindly entertaines him, and all their servants veil
bonnet to him, none use him discurteously but all most lovingly, they will have
him to play houses, inuit him to a Tavern to supper, and as yet let him not
pay a penny, what company soever he comes in: and if he chance to borrow forty
or fifty shillings of them (nay three or four pound) they will not ask a
penny, yet all this while he runs but on that unconscionable score, which
they will make him discharge to the last farthing before they leave him.

This young innocent (scarce having sented the City air) all this while
thinks himself in a heaven upon earth, that he is in Elisium and sees more
delights then the Turks Paradise affords, thinks himself much graced (as to
be so much beholding to them) as to be entertained among Gallants, that were
wrapped up in satin suites, cloakes lined with velvet, that scorned to wear any
other then Beauer hats, and gold bands, rich swords and scarfes, silk
stockings and gold fringed garters, or russet boots and gilt spurs, and so
complete cape ape that he almost dares take his corporal oath the worst of
them is worth (at least) a thousand a year, when Heaven knows the best of
them all for a month nay sometimes a year together have their pockets worse
furnished then Chandelors boxes that have nothing but two-pences, pence,
halfepence, and leaden tokens in them, yet he still is confidently persuaded
the Country he was borne in yields not such a man as the worst he has
associated himself with.

Alas, alas, I truly pity them, and would as truly relieve them if it lay
within my poor power, but when youth is in the height and full vigor of their
desires, neither wholesome council, or lamentable examples can give them
sufficient warning of their future falls. But they hurt themselves not me. Why
sir (said I) this discourse tends not to a young Gentleman's hurt, but (as I
suppose) rather to his good.

Sir said he, you as much err from the true conceiving of this business as my
young Gentleman from a true course of life. This is but the Praeludium or
Prologue to the play that is to come after, for my Country-nouice being honnied
with these sweet and Nectar delights (that these false brethren serve him
with) thinks that all the kindness he can return them is not able to give
them a true and due satisfaction, and if at any time these practitioners
perceive my fresh-Gallant to droop or languish, with these (or the like)
speeches (which are as wholesome as a Whore in the Dog-daies) will strive to
shake off his mellancholly: Why how now my noble spirit, what is it that lies
within the reach of our abilities that we can supply you with? Speak, you
shall not want it; it may be you mourn because you are not so well accoutred
as those you keep Company with, come our Tailor shall furnish you, we will
have you strip of this Deuonshire-kersie suite, and put on satin, you shall
cast off this course cloath-cloake, and be furnished with one lined with
velvet, your foureshilings dutch felt shall be converted to a three pound
Beuer, your woosted stockings and neatsleather-shooes to russet boots and guilt
spurs: then courage man, is it not better to live in the City among a brave
society of Gallants, then in the Country with a heard of gulls? what man is so
stupid and blockish as to drink the running streams when he may quaffe
Greek-wines? who will feed on course cates when he may hourly taste of
delicates? who will wear poor serg D'bois when he may go in sattens? and who
will live in a smoakie Countrycottage, when he may lead his life in a brave
Ordinary in the City? You are your Fathers Heir, therefore lay it on while you
may, if it should be your fortune to be clapped up, do you think your friends
will see their only son and Heir (the sole hopes of their house) perish in a
prison? no, therefore play the Lion and rouse your self up, and be not so
Lamblike and still, but freely unfold your thoughts to us, and as we are
Gentlemen and your sworn friends we will endeavor with our utmost strength
and ability to redress you, or in any other fashion to pleasure you.

This draught of poison (administered to him in a golden boule) swells his heart
up with such hopes that he is ready to burst, he refuses not their proffered
kindness but takes them as willingly as they trecherously meant them, and
thinks that a rich suite will immortalise him. But yet these clothes are but
like the shirt Deianira sent to Hercules which being poisoned with a Centaures
blood wrought his death* so these rich trappings in short time after either
cost four or five years imprisonment (if his friends are not the more
affectionate to him) or pay four or five hundred pound or more to ransom him
out, for after he is thus invested it may be he reuells it up and down the
City with his familiars, drinks, domineers, and declares in every company he
comes in how much he is beholding to such Gentlemen, and having his brains
thoroughly warmed with wine vows to do them any kindness that lies in his
power, but mark the sequel. At last as a whole Congregation of these
Caterpillars (that eat up some of the chiefest fruit that grow in the Garden
of this Commonwealth) are carrousing healths to some Strumpet or other, there
must enter (having his Cue given him) a Scriuener with a bond of five or six
hundred pound ready made for one of these Gallants my prodigal does most of
all doat on, telling him if he can procure some Gentleman either of present
means or future hopes to be bound with him he might instantly upon the
sealing of the bonds have so much money he lately spoke for laid down to him;
my Politician being in a counterfeit maze, at first begins to fret, fume, and
swear, saying that his credit was never before this time so slighted as not
upon his own bond to be trusted for so small a matter, then he begins to
try his consorts about him desiring them to stand bound with him, they tell
him plainly they will not enter into bonds for their brother, but if he had
need of a hundred or six score pound they would make it up among them and lend
him Pox* of it (says he) I am to purchase such a Lordship of such a Knight and
two or three hundred pound will not serve my turn, for I have some two
thousand pound ready and if I had this full sum the Lordshippe were mine own;
which if I should miss I might leese three or four hundred pound which easily
I may get if I were furnished; besides if I could stay while next Term I
should have a thousand pound paid to me upon a bond, and then I could easily
cancel this. At this Simon Sandbox the Scriuener is about to depart, and
Signior Shift, chafes, frets, and is ready to tear his hair for grief that he
cannot be furnished: At last he comes to Corkebraine my Country-nouice
desiring him to stand his friend; and stand bound with him for that sum of
money, and that he should stand only for a Cipher, and that he rather would
leese all his Lands (you may believe him) then prejudice him in the least thing
the world might tax him with, Now my young Gallant (that never before this
time was lapped up in Lambskinne, and would rather set his hand to his own
undoing then displease him) takes it as a kindness that he would entreat him
to do him such a courtesy, so without any reading over the bond (to see how the
condition runs) seals and delivers it to Signior Security the Scriuener,
never dreaming that he is put principal, or of the after-claps that will fall
heavy on him about six months after, or that this bond he sealed to, was for
some base commodities to furnish his supposed friend, or lastly, that it is
some old debt, that now he has shifted from himself and laid on the Nouices
back, but still holds him as dear to him as his life blood is to his heart,
and still they will revel together when all this while my Cosen never looks
into the ensuing danger because he never considers of the day or what the
penalty of forfeiting a bond is; so to be short, when the time is expired
(that the money should be paid in) the Scriuener and the Cheat plot to arrest
him knowing him the best able to pay, and on a sudden, when they have him
within the City with the help of half a dozen Puttocks belonging to one of
the Compters lay their claws on him, and seldom stay (except he be able to
discharge the debt) while they have incarcerated him.

Thus is this poor Gentleman's fortunes (by his own kindness and this villains
policy) utterly overthrown, who never comes at him, sends to him, nay or so
much as once thinks on him. Many of these most detestable and dishonest
tricks have I known practiced on young Gentlemen newly come to the Temple,
Inns of Court, and other places that now my heart bleeds to think on. Sir, said
I, I have heard much of those that lie in privileged places being in debt
daring not show themselus, but I never heard they practiced such abuses.

Sir, said he, if what I speak taste of untruth may I never inherit eternal
happiness, what good would it do^ me to wrong them and do my self no good
only to hold you in a discourse? yet these are not half the vices that are
daily practiced among them, for let a Gentleman come into their company you
shall hear some cursing and damning for money they have lost either at cards or
dice, others chafing and swearing they have lost twenty pound when their
conscience knows they have won as much more, others stabbing one another
about some triuiall word passing between them, so that there will be such a
confused Babylonian language of blasphemy among them that none (but their
truchman the Devil) can interpret it, and when they have lost that in a
quarter of an hour at cards, dice, tables, or bowls they have borrowed of
some rawfreshman (that lately was admitted into their worse then lesuiticall
College) what will they do? but start out some this way and the rest another,
some betake themselves to their geldings, pistols, and a good sword, and not
stick to bid a Traveler good morrow, and for that courtesy lighten him of
his purse because he might ride the easier, and then return home again.

Others lie in their beds musing (having their Tutor the Devil not far from
them) where they may find out some easy Gull of whom they must borrow some
money for a day or two, but whatsoever they borrow for one hour is borrowed for
one age, for though they bind it with a thousand Dam-mees (that they will
repay it again within the space of a week) you may as well never bestow
lippe-labour to demand your money for you shall be sure never to have it again.

Others lie penning baudy letters to Citizens-wiues, enticing them to let them
have money or wares, but if they will not be instructed by their devilish
doctrine (as to deceive their husbands to supply their wants) what will they
do? but raise causeless scandalls and imputations against them and so
contrary to the will of God go about to part man and wife. These are they that
care for no body but themselves, nay not themselves, for if they did they would
not so often hazard their lives in the field upon the refusal of some drunken
health, or in speaking against some painted, prostituted Curtesan, and he that
kills the most men is accounted the brauest man.

These are they that like Owls dares not show their faces into the City in
the day time, but as the Dogs of Egypt when they come to drink of the
stream of Nilus lap here and there and dare not stay long in one place for
fear the Crocodiles (that lie lurking within the banks) should pull them into
the current: so these, when they chance to skulke out of their dens to some
Tavern to be merry, dare not stay long there, but straight shift to an other
for fear some Sergeants that lay watching about the stalls should fasten on
them and pull them into one of the Compters.

These are they that go brave by running in debt and never care how to pay so
they have it: I once read a pretty tale of a Popiniay that against the time he
should appear before the Eagle (who had summoned all the birds to come before
him) borrowed of every one of his acquaintance a feather, the Peacocke lent him
one of his plumes bravely shining with variety of colors, the Parrot lent him
one of his green feathers, the goldfinch one of his yellow, so that as soon as
he was dressed and had presented himself before the Royal and princely Bird,
and dismissed, he flew up and down the woods so proudly that every inferior
Bird) as the Titmouse, the Hedgsparrow, and Wren) began to adore him: At last
these birds that he had been so much beholding to, came to challenge their
feathers of him, and (though very loath) he was constrained to render them back
again, that when he was bare and naked he looked ten times worse then those
poor birds that lately did admire him. Such Popiniayes are these that borrow
of every Citizen to make them show glorious in the worlds eye, but when the
Goldsmiths, Merchants, Silkemen, and Haberdashers come to claim their own and
get it, they will seem ten times more foul then lately they did fair and
glorious. These are the isntrumental causes that many fathers disinherit their
right Meires (and put in their second sons) who at last are forced to marry
some whore for want of means, or fly into the Lowcontries and for half a
crown a week serve in some Garrison town, for if they are caught (being by
their means run into debt) they will be clapped into prison, and there lie and
rot, where in process of time (when these cheating Gallants grow old and their
tricks fail) may lie themselves and fatten a prison, and end their days in
the Hole, in poverty, famine, and extreme wretchedness. Thus have I described
to you the nature of the second arm that continually runs to the maine Ocean
the Compter, now will I have to the third which is

Villainous Sergeants.

CHAP. VI. Containing 1. The condition of Sergeants. 2. Their nature, The third
current, Macemongers.
and property. 3. A Paradox in praise of them. 4. Their abuses, their tricks
and sleights in arresting of men. 5. In what garb, and fashion they
oftentimes apparel themselves, and lastly their insufferable extorting from
his Majesty's subjects, and their cruelty toward them.
IN heaven there are many times engendered Meteors, Exhalations, and fiery
Comets: In many Countries there are many Monsters, as in Russia rugged bears,
in Germany tusked-Boares, in Clenoma tailestrong Lions, in Ireland cruel
blood-sucking backbiting sixfooted Creepers: but the most ravening and cruel
Monsters in our Land are the shoulder clapping pursebiting mace-bearers. A
necessary evil and plagusorein the body of an infected City, and a disease
that the most of the Gentry is sick of. For as in the most medicinable
physic there is most infectious poison (which else would not be forcible or
have any virtue) so in the most peaceful, and populous Commonwealth there must
be such necessary instruments or else it would not long continue: these are
they that strike with the axe of Law and lustice deeper cuts then they have
authority for, so that sometimes they murder a whole family at a blow, and
have no more mercy when they strike then a Spanish-army when they are upon the
execution or slaughter of their enemy. Yet thus much I will say for them when a
Gentleman's fortunes begin to be sick and crasie, most commonly they will apply
him with caudles and cordials which only have but this fault they taste some
thing too much of the Mace, a spice more familiar in England then in the
East Indies: for the most base sort of people in the Land are never without it
in their pockets. But now I think on it I will not be inuectiue against them
because no subject plays his part to the life so well as these do, then what
kind of vocation is more necessary in a Commonwealth? I hold them very
religious men, for they will continually watch and pray, watch a whole day
together to catch young Gentlemen, and after they have clutcht them pray upon
them: They are very valiant men for they will strike the brauest spirit that
walks in the street, I have known many Knights run away at the sight of them:
they are men of great respect and reverence, for I have seen many Gentlemen
give them the wall, and rather then they will iustle with them let them have
the whole street at their command: They are men of good consciences for they
will do nothing without warrant unless it be now and then for their advantage:
They are very loving creatures for I have seen them come running to a
Gentleman and hang about his neck and not leave him to the death: They are
very familiar and as sociable as any whore, for they will be drunk with any
man (so it be not of their own cost) And lastly, very kind and affable for
they will promise a young Gentleman more courtesy then a Courtier will a
citizen: Why then should we not think well of Sergeants? Sir (said I) I am
sure you speak this Paradox only to make your self (and me) merry, for on my
conscience what you now speak is rather in an ironicall kind of fashion then
serious or true, for if you will have my opinion of them, they are the
excrement that proceeds from the body of a Commonwealth, whose vilde doings
have been so unsavory to me that (for ever as all the world else beside do)
I shall hate them worse then a Butcher does Lent, or a Fishmonger Christmas or
Easter weeks, therefore good Sir be not partial in your proceedings but lash
them at the whipping post of Justice and Equity, while you fetch as much blood
from their ribs as they have tears from many poor men and women's eyes.

Faith Sir (said he) indeed to tell you true I am like a kind mother, that
having seen her child do some witty unhappy trick stands in doubt whether
she shall laugh at him and let him escape, or frown at him and correct him:
so I having seen the cleanely and smooth practices of these fellows know not
whether I shall smile at them, and let them escape the scourge of my tongue, or
grieve at them and correct their enormities, but howsoever I have so brave and
constant a Champion on my side as Truth I will go on though all the Sergeants
belonging both to Poultry and Woodstreet Compter were within eareshot of me,
therefore thus I will charge upon them with a volley shall wound some of their
consciences (if it is possible for them to have any.)

In ancient Rome the Lictores, or Sergeants went always with their staves of
Office in their hands, and in such apparel that the whole City knew them, and
yet to this day in this form, and fashion they continue, or carry about them
some mark of difference: So in many other Countries they are so markeable that
they are no sooner seen then known: But here in England (where they once went
in pide coats and white rods in their hands as a badge of infamy) they will
alter their fashion of habit oftener then a Whore does her lodgeing, or a
French Count his shirts in summertime: Proteus never changed shapes oftener
then these fellows, for sometime they will go accoutred like a scholar, then
like a Merchant, sometime like a Councellor, then a Butcher, Porter, or
Countrie-gentleman with their boots and spurs as durty as if they had rid
five hundred mile through the deepest slowy way that ever was traveled; but
this is (most commonly) when they go to arrest some Farmer or Yeoman of the
Country that is either but newly come into his Inn, or going out of town, and
a hundred more such stratagems have they in their heads when they are well
greased in the hand; or when the arrest is something dangerous. Therefore first
of all I will relate the manner they oftentimes arrest a man to make you a
little merry, and then proceed to the manner of their usage of a man after they
have arrested him. A Norwich man being exceedingly indebted to certain
Londoners (who often laid wait to arrest him) came to the City so private
that they knew not how to come at him, though sometime they had intelligence
where he was; and when (as it was very seldom) the Citizens came to parley
with him it was out of a window, but he could by no means be drawn nigh their
forces for he was too subtle for them, and always left word with the
servants in the house where he lay, that none should have access to him before
such time he himself had seen them, especially if they were in satin
doublets, cloakes faced with taffatie, and ruffes of a Merchants set; at last
his Creditors being incensed against him (caring not what cost they were at so
they might Encounter him) came to the Compter in Woodstreete and feed half a
score Sergeants promising them if they could take him they should have a
lacobus a piece besides, one of these senting the business, straight forged a
device which was in this manner, he was certified that this Norwich man had
weeekly some letters come to him out of Norfolk, and that the Porter that
brought them had free access to him, this Sergeant instantly provided a
frocke, a red-cappe, a rope about his shoulders (which would have become his
neck better) and with letters in his hand directed to the same party, trudges
to his lodging being just on that day the Porter was accustomed to come to him;
knocking at the door and being demanded his business told them that he had
letters out of Norfolk for such a Gentleman, upon this he was directed up
stairs to the Chamber-doore, who no sooner knocked but the Gentleman did start
up from his bed to the Chamber-doore peeping before through the keyhole, and
seeing him to be a Porter let him in, as soon as he was entered he bid his
worship good morrow, vales his bonnet, and delivers him a letter that should
come from a Gentleman of his acquaintance, but as he was opening of it, what
does my Porter do but pulls his mace out of his pocket (the Gentleman not
dreaming of such a breakfast) and laid on his shoulders, and arrested him,
telling him that he was not what he seemed to be (a Porter) but what he was a
Sergeant, and that there was no way with him but either to give satisfaction to
his Creditors, or to prison, therefore make your self ready, and along. So he
seeing how he was betraide and arrested went quietly with him to the Compter,
and died in execution. As pretty a pranke as this the same Sergeant plaide by
an other Gentleman that stood upon his guard, who having his Creditors with him
the day before seemed to grow to a composition with him upon the sealing of
certain bonds, promising to release him while a farther day, telling him that
the next day they would be with him, and bring a Councellor, and a Scriuener:
a Councellor to give them direction for the managing of the business on both
sides, and the Scriuener to make and write what they should determine. The
Creditors having taken their leave straight plotted together over night how
they might arrest the Gentleman in the morning, and having invented the
project, forthwith went to the Compter and there did see these Sergeants and
half a dozen more with them to dispatch this business: the Sergeants being well
oyled in the hand with Aurum potabile were as hot upon the exploite as an
Italian on a wench of fiueteene, and did long to put their device in practice,
the Sergeant would needs take upon him to be the Councellor, and his Yeoman
the Scriuener, who had attired themselves so quaint that they who had never
seen them before would have sworn they had been the same they counterfeited,
for the Sergeant had a Barristers gown on his back (that ever after could not
choose but infect the true Owner with knavery) a double ruff about his neck,
and his beard cut as close as a stubble field; his Yeoman (that had as
villainous a look as any Scriuener between Charing, cross and Paul's) had his
inkehorne at his girdle, his pen in his care, and his parchment and wax in his
hand, and away they go with a score more of their Comrades, whom they had
appointed not to be far from them but to come and releive them when they
heard a pistol discharged (which lay in the Gentleman's window ready charged to
guard himself with) the Citizens led the way, and my Councellor and Scriuener
trot after until they came to the house, so the folks seeing there was no
body but such as had been there the day before (except a Councellor and a
Scriuener) conducted them up into the Gentleman's chamber (where were half a
dozen of his men about him for fear of the worst (so the Gentleman and the
creditors began to lay open the matter to the Cou^cellor who desired the
Gentleman to dismiss his servants for half an hour, for it was not fit they
should hear any of their proceedings; they were so then the Counceller begins
to utter his opinion, wh^^e the Scriuener* began to sneake nigh the window, and
when he saw his time, discharged the pistol* and then instantly arrested him,
the other Sargeants hearing the watch word given, straight ran up into the
chamber with their swords drawn, and laid hold on him, telling him their
intent and what they were, so the poor Gentleman seeing himself thus caught
(rather then go to prison) paid the debt, so sent the Sargeants and Citizens
away.

Other such dog-trickes as these have they played, as upon a Merchant, that
(either upon policy or-pouerty) broke, and having made all his goods ready to
go into the Low-Countryes wanted nothing to dispatch, but to mend three or
four dry-fats, which he meant to put his goods in, and gave order to his Maid,
to provide two or three Coopers to mend them, but she (being bribed by his
Creditors) betrayed her masters purpose to them, so they provided half a dozen
Sargeants, to go like Coopers the next morning, to mend this Merchants
dry-fats, and were let in to dispatch it, and had direction from the Merchant
himself how to finish it: but as he was busy about them, instead of hooping
the barrels, they hoopt him in their arms, and arrested him, so that before
they left him, they made him pay the executions they had to charge him withal,
and was glad to give them a fee beside, that they should lay no more actions on
him.

An hundred such stratagems they have been fortunate in, and came off without
dread or danger, but now I have related to you the manner of their arresting
many men, now will I tell you how they use many (or most) men they have
arrested. If they perceive the party whom they have ceased on to be a
Country-Gentleman, they will be busy with him to know whether this were the
first time he was arrested, if it be, they have the better subject to work
on, and know (as they term it) how to milk them the better. First they will
carry him to some Tavern (but it shall be nigh one of the Compters) where
they will call for pottle after pottle, and such meat as the house affords,
holding him in delays, while their guts are full, telling him they will do him
what pleasure they can for him, and that they only keep him there, because
they would have his adversaries come to him, and dispatch him with all
expedition, swearing to him, that they were sorry to do their office upon him,
and that if his creditor had not been with them, they had rather have given a
crown to another to arrest him, then take a twenty-shilling piece to execute
their office. Upon this, one of them will makes as though he goes to fetch his
Adversary, when God knows, he goes up and down Cheap Side, and other places
of the City, enquiring among the Tradesmen, whether such a Gentleman be
indebted to him or no if he be, then he will tell them, if he will give him
a piece of money he will undertake to arrest him, for he by chance had
intelligence where he supt, and when he has his fees, what will he do but
go to the Compter, enter an action, takes his warrant out of the office, and
comes to the Tavern again, telling him, he has been with his Adversary, and
that he could not possible come to him this three or four hours yet, and that
if he would give them any money, they would stay with him, if not, they must
have him to the Compter, for they had or her businesses to dispatch, that they
might get five pound by, if he offer them an Angel or a Mark for two or three
hours waiting with them, account it nothing, and scorn to stay so long for so
small a matter, knowing the poor Gentle man will rather disburse the value of
twenty shillings, then go to prison, still expecting his Adversaries coming,
of whose approach there is no more hope, then of the Kings: little thinking of
the villainy they are practizing against him, yet still he expects his
Adversary, but when it begins to be late they call for something to supper,
and according to the lining of the poor man's purse will sauce him, if they see
he has good store of crowns, they will council him to go and lie in their
house a day or two, telling him it is a thousand to one whether his Adversary
will come or no, for though he promised he would not fail, yet he seemed very
unwilling, besides (say they) if you fear any other actions, we can keep you
so safe in our house, that none of them shall know where to find you; whereas
if you were in prison, they would all come thundering upon you, so it may be
you may be laid up for two or three winters: These speeches terrifies my poor
Gentle man, and still rather then he would go to prison, would give all the
money in his purse, at last, having discharged all the reckoning at the
Tavern, away he goes with them, and lies in some of their houses a day or two,
which is enough (for it will cost him at least twenty shillings day and night)
and yet the poor man is farther from his liberty, then when he was first
arrested, and when these purse-leeches have sucked him dry, then they bring him
to prison.

Why Sir (said I) when I was arrested I never saw any such abuses among them,
it may be so, said he, then they perceived you had no money, or that you were
too wise to be cheated, for I have seen diverse Gentle men come into prison
(after they have lain a fortnight or three weeks at some of their houses, at
an excessive rate) without either cloak, sword or hat which the Sargeants have
got from them, only bearing them in hand that they will get them bail.

Again, if he be a poor simple fellow, as some Seruing-man, or Country
Tradesman, they will carry him to some blind Alehouse, and there practice on
him, telling him, that if he go to prison, it will cost him at first entrance
a mark or fourteen shillings, and that he must have irons put on his legs, as
soon as he comes in, and put into a place where he shall neither see foot or
hand, while he has discharged the debt, and that he would give them so much
money, they ought to have for arresting him, and something to drink besides,
they would if it should be his fortune to go thither speak to the Keepers to
use him kindly. This trick I have known them serve a poor Country fellow, and
brought him to prison with never a penny in his purse: once they served a
friend of mine so, but I think I made them render the money back again, and
be glad they could be rid so quietly of him.

If I should but repeat but half their abuses, I should fill a reame of paper,
I have seen them come dragging in a poor man by the heels, that his head has
knocked against the stones for a quarter of a mile together, and so battered and
martyred, that a man could scarce know whether he were a man or no. Sometimes
when they know a man in fear of arresting, they will, without warrant from the
Creditor, give him a cast of their office, only to get some money out of him,
and so let him go again: sometime when they are feed to arrest a man, they
will send the party word to keep out of their way, hoping to have a gratitude
from him: sometime when they have arrested a man (if the creditours be not by)
will not stick to take a brace or two of Angels and let him go, telling his
adversary the next time he meets him, he cannot set eye of him, and whereas a
Sargeants fee from the Creditor is no more then one shilling for an arrest,
they scorn to step from the gate under a Crown, a Noble or an Angel, and
whereas there is a statute that none of them shall take above a groat of him
that is arrested, they will not stick to milk him out of all his money, and
turn him into prison without either hat, cloak or sword,

They have other tricks as bad as these, as for example, when they have
arrested any man, either upon an execution or action, and if any Gentleman or
Tradsman, or of what fashion so ere he be, by chance do but iustle them as they
are bringing their prisoner to the Compter, for if they call them by their
right names, Varlets, they (without warrant or any authority from some
Superior power, as Justice or Constable, but by the virtue of their own
office) will carry him to prison, and either lay my Lord Majors command on him,
or clap some heavy action on him, that except he have good friends or a fat
purse to compound with them, he may lie and rot there for all them. *I know a
poor man that did One Atkinson now dwelling at High gate.
but offer to rescue his friend, was clapped up by them, and could never get free
from them while he was worth a tester, and if the Judge, before whom he was
bailed, had not been more pitiful then they were conscionable, he had been
in prison all his life time.

If any man they arrest, in his struggling to make an escape from them, chance
to hit any of them, either on the legs, face or breast, so that they have no
hurt at all, they will gripe, beat and pinch the poor man so miserably, that
he shall not be able to lift his arm to his head, and then enter an action
of battery against him, which will more vex and disturb him then all the rest:
I my self have been eyewitness of the like, for in the beginning of August,
1616. they arrested a poor John Rogers.
Seruing-man, who had an action entered against him by them, because he
offered to make an escape from them, and when he had all his other actions
withdrawn he could by no means get free from them, they were so unreasonable
in compounding with him, that he took a strong conceit, and the nineteenth of
the same month ended his life.

Thus have I portrayed forth in my freshest colors the abuses and wrongs his
Majesty's subjects daily sustain by these Sargeants, for which they can have
little or no remedy, and as well as I could, waded through the third arm that
paies tribute to the Maine Ocean the Compter. Now will I proceed to the fourth
and last.

CHAP. VII. Containing, 1. The nature of a Constables office. 2. An objection
concerning the abnses his Majesty's subjects suffer by Beadles and Watchmen
that understand not the virtue of their office. 3. And lastly, an answer in
their defense.
REason (the Soul of Law) and Law (the life of a Commonwealth) should shine
and be tralucent in those that bear the office of a Constable, for he being
the Kings Deputy for the night, is the King of the night, therefore being so, he
should impartially with his staff which represents Justice, beat down
disorder, and defend Equity, Peace and Innocence: but there are many Constables
in these days, that through their ownenegligence (not wilfulness) do
contrary to the nature of their office, for very often the Beadle and Watchmen
in his absence, commit that which the Constable himself is much blamed for,
who under the pretense of seeing good order kept, as I have heard, are the
first that breed disorder: but for mine own part I never was eyewitness of
any of their misdemeanors, but only as I have heard it reported, therefore I
dare nor will go no further then truth does guide me. For first, I should
wrong that worthy office, in relating what I have no probability for, and
secondly my self, in making my self a dishonest man in print. Why Sir, said
I, I have often heard it reported, that the Beadles and Watchmen are in fee
with the Keepers of both the Compters, and that for every man they commit they
receine a groat, and therefore only for gain, will (upon any light or slight
fault) carry any man that comes in their way to prison, or if any man fee them,
they will (if he be never so drunk, unruly or disordered) convey him to his
lodging; or otherwise, if he be unfurnished, convey him to one of the
Compters. And to mine own knowledge I have known a Beadle committed to the
Gatehouse for committing a Noblemans servant (who went upon special business
for the Lord his Master) therefore if he had not first wronged this Gentleman,
and secondly the force, and nature of his Office, why should he being an
Officer be committed for his misdemeanour? Again I have seen many men come
into prison (since I came hither) that have been extremely hackt and maimed
with their halberds: which in (my opinion) they cannot answer, for though they
have authority to commit, they have none to kill or wound, therefore in my
judgment these abuses are insufferable, and only are vpholden by their Head
the Constable.

Sir (said he) you must understand that a Constable is but an Island brook that
paies but small tribute to the Ocean the Compter, he is but causa accidentalis,
an accidental cause, and by chance fattens the gross and vast body of it, for
after his watch is set he is bound by oath to perform his office both for the
discharge of his own conscience, and the good of his Prince, and Country, in
which duty every good subject is bound in duty to assist him. For a Constable
is the preserver of peace, the attacher of vice, and the Intelligencer of
injuries, and has as strong and forcible power to commit Offenders in the
night as any Justice of peace has in the day: nay if any Lord, Knight, or
Gentleman of what degree, or fashion soever he be, coming in the nightime
through the watch in an unruly fashion is as subject to his command and
authority as the poorest subject that walks the streets: and if he should
not sometimes nay many times clappe up such personages, they would be thought
very slack in their office and not worthy of that authority, and power the
King has given them; for many men though they have brave outsides may commit
or act as great, or more heinous mischief then those that are of a poor
rank, for if the Constable should not stand Centinell, how many men would
beerob'd in the space of one week, nay of one night, which by his industry and
care he preserues. But here it is objected that the Beadle and Watchmen have
for every man they commit a groat, whether it be true or false I never could
confidently speak of, if they have, it is fit that for so many nights as they
sit up for the good of the Commonwealth they should have something allowed, and
who is the fittest to allow it but such as have offended and they have been
troubled with the night before: Again you say they will commit such as have no
money to give them, though it be upon a slight occasion, and let such pass
though their fault be never so heinous so they will grease them in the fist.
This objection I will thus answer, if this abuse is offered it cannot enter
into my mind that the Constable has any hand in it, for there are many
occasions that may call him away after his watch is set, and he that is his
Deputy may commit the offense (knowing not what truly belongs to his office or
place) and if sometimes they let a Drunkard escape without going to prison, it
is a thousand to one but they that conduct him to his lodging will have the
Housekeeper, pass his word for his coming forth in the morning to answer
what shall be laid to his charge before the Justice: and I think a ^ester or
a shilling is well bestowed upon them for such a courtesy: again if they
chance to let any unruly Gallant pass, it is either upon his submission to the
Constable or his Deputy, or else he must allege some firm and constant reason
what the occasion is of his being so late out of his lodging. And though there
are many men hurt in the watch, the fault lies most of all in themselves and
not in the Watchmen, for when a company of Gallants come from some Tavern, or
worse place high gone in wine, and will not render an account of their walking
at such an untimely season, but draw their swords and fall to hacking them,
therefore they are bound first of all by the Kings laws to apprehend them, and
secondly by the law of nature to defend themselves, and rather offend then to
be offended. Thus have I answered your obiectious desiring to draw to an end,
for this is a subject I have no firm or sollid ground to work on, if
Constables, Beadles, and Watchmen, are conscious or guilty of these objections
I have defended, I desire they may amend and correct them and give no occasion
to have any pen busy it self in describing the abuses; thus have I set forth
in order the four arms that pay tribute to the Ocean the Compter, now will I
come to the Compter it self.

CHAP. VIII. Containing 1. Aresemblance between the Sea, and the Compter. 2.
With the true nature and conditions of such as live in it.
NOw I have crossed the arms of this maine Ocean the Compter I will sail in the
Ocean it self; and well may the Compter hold similitude with the Sea, for as
the Sea is oftentimes disturbed with storms, gusts, and tempests, so is the
Compter with continual storms of grief; gusts of sorrow, and tempests of
tribulation which are continually beating upon the head and heart of many a
poor Prisoner. The Sea as Philosophers hold is ruled by the Moon and
according to the nature of her fourequarters, she does ebb and flow, rise or
fall, so is the Compter maintained by the Law and the foure-Tearmes, and
according to their nature and property, it is full and empty. The sea has many
fearful and hideous monsters in it, so has the Compter an abundance of
Sergeants. In the Sea the great ones eat up the little ones, so in the Compter
the Iaylors and Officers feed upon the poor Prisoners. In the Sea there are
many rocks and quicksands, so in the Compter is the book where many poor men
pay their fees, and the Paper house where he has his discharge: in the Sea
there are many ships cast away by wracks and tempests, so in the Compter are
many men by extortion and cruel Creditors: And lastly, as in a storm at sea a
brave ship Royall-well manned that has store of skillful Mariners and a good
Pilot may ride out the fury and rage of the tempest when a poor rotten
weatherbeaten Pinke destitute of Anchor, sails, munition, men and Skillful
Pilots, is soon drowned: So in the Compter in the most horredst wrack of
affliction, a rich man well friended, well monyed (his chiefest Pilot) may make
way through the fearefullest storm of adversity, and come again to the Port
and Haven of Liberty, while the poor man destitute of friends and money is
soon cast away in a small brunt and shocke of adversity: but now to the
matter.

In Noah's Arc there were some of all sort of Creatures, so in the Compter some
of all kind of people, for to say the right of it, it is a Commonwealth though
very little wealth be common there. There lies your right-worshipfull poor
Knight, your worshipful beggarly Esquire, your distressed Gentleman, your
Mechanicke Tradsman, your prating Pettifogger, and iuggling (liars I would say)
Lawyers, all these like so many beasts in a Wilderness desire to prey one upon
the other, for I think there are as many sins looking through the grates of
a Prison as there are walking through the gates of a City: For though we are
all Prisoners yet the causes of our restraint are diverse, some are in for debt,
some for other more heinous and criminal actions, some there are that are in
upon constraint, and such are they that come in for debt and can no way shun
what they suffer, or have no means to give satisfaction to their Creditors:
Others there are that are voluntary and such are they that come in of purpose,
who (if it please themselves) may keep themselves out, of which I find four
kind of people that are good subjects to this Commonwealth the Compter, and
they are these, the first your subtle Citizen, the second your
riotous-Vnthrift, the third your politic High way-man, and the fourth and
last your crafty mechanicke.

The first of these is the firmest leg the body of this Commonwealth does
stand upon, for after he has been a Tradsman some five or six years or
longer, having borne up his head as high as his neighbors, has had good
credit on the Exchange among the Merchants, and continually paying them at the
day appointed, may if it please him (having kept his word so faithfully with
them) have what goods he pleases at half a year or years day of payment: at
last when he finds his best oppo^tunity, what does he, but gets fiuehundred
pounds worth of wares of one merchant, as much more of an other, and so runs
over all those he has had doings with, and when he has got the quantity of
four, or five thousand pounds worth of goods into his hands, a month or six
weeks before the day of payment, my Citizen in private sells all these
commodities by whole sale for ready money at the best rate, and having all this
cash in his purse straight flies into the Country among his friends, and lies
there perhaps a summer together for his own pleasure, and when he hears of
any writs that are out for him returns again to the City, and lies close
making none acquainted with his lodging but some man he knows will break
before the next quarter, and imploies this party to go to his Creditors to
certify them of the misery he is in, and that by trusting young Gentlemen he
has undone himself, desiring them to be good to him, protesting that they
shall have all that is left among them if they will be content to let him walk
the streets quietly to use some means to raise his fortunes once again: his
Creditors perhaps gives his friends good words telling him they will not be
rough with him hoping with this bait to catch my citizen abroad and so clappe
him up, which my Bankrupt little cares for, knowing that after he has lain in
prison a year or two they will be glad to take a quarter of their debts and
let him out, what cares he for Actions, Executions, Judgments, Statutes, or
any other Writs, he has enough to keep himself in prison and will make them
come to composition with him as he list himself, or they get none at all, so
his Creditors at last seeing his resolution so fixed and settled will (though
very loath) take one quarter of their debts rather then loose all, and it may
be not half of that in money, but young Gentlemen's bonds, and desperate debts
that God knows whether they shall ever recover one penny: thus do many
Banrupts ly in diverse prisons about this Town enriching themselves, and by
their policy are good for nothing but to defraud his Majesty's subjects, and
fatten a loathsome prison, and this is the first of these voluntary Soldiers.

The second of these are such that will compound with a brase of Sergeants to
arrest them, and such are many young Gentlemen that want money to supply some
vicious use or other (knowing they have kind friends) will voluntarily have an
action entered against them and be arrested, so perhaps will lie there a day or
two while their friends hear of it, who if it be but a matter of four or
five pound will not stick to discharge it, which being no sooner done but
straight they go to the party to whom the money was paid* and there give the
Sergeant an Angel, and share the rest among themselves, many tricks of this
kind have I seen put in practice since I came hither; but one thing I will not
forget which was this: One of these fellow* that had used this trick three or
four several times, and been fetched out by his friends for seuerali sums
of money, did once more put it in practice, which his friends (at last)
perceiving, let him lie there some two or three years together, and the most
part of his imprisonment was in the Hole, and if at last he had not got off
clear by his own industry he might have been a Prisoner there while this
time for all them. How say you sir was not this a pretty trick? yes faith sir
(said I) I would all such voluntary prisoners might be served so, but (good
sir) to the third of these voluntaries.

The thirst sort of these are such that having been in prison, and lying in
the Hole have been released by Legacies, but being freed and feeling
thesweetnesse of it, will purposely once a year (as about Christmas or Easter,
when they know Legacies come in) get some friend of theirs to arrest them for a
matter of thirty or forty shillings and then make suite to the Merchants (that
yearly come and release prisoners if their debts be not above that value)
which if they get, they have so much money clear to be merry with. These base
tricks are usual though they be not looked into, or corrected, for it is an
extreme wrong first to the party that gives it in cheating of him, and
secondly in defrauding other poor Prisoners that lie in for due debts.

The fourth and last sort of these are young Gallants that now and then will
make a step to Newmarketheath or some such place, and after they have that
they long looked for, come posting to London, and if the hews and ^^ies come too
hotly after them, instantly gets themselves arrested into one of the Compters,
and lie there while the matter cooles, for who will look into such a place for
any such Offenders? Thus have I laid down in my best method the nature of
these voluntary Prisoners that fatten this Commonwealth the Compter Sir (said
I) these reports strike me into a masement: I protest I thought there could
not have been such villainy extant in a Realm much less in a prison: But I
hope sir you are come to treat of the Keepers, I am sir, said he, and thus
began.

CHAP. IX. Containing 1. A Character of a Iaylor. 2. Their true nature and
disposition. 3. Their cruelty, and extortion, And 4. and lastly such abuses
that have been discovered, lively displaied.
DAre you write? Why not? my door is shut. They that pinch me see not how I
pinch them. But, but when your discourse comes out the Keeper will hold you in
the faster. Tush my book must help me out. I hope to see Paul's* Churchyard as
soon as it. If I do not, the worst censure that can pass, will be a Rayler
against a laylor. Bold Muse hold on thy pace. If the world is a Body, then I
cannot be persuaded but laylors and Keepers of Prisons are the nails of it,
for they scratch exceedingly, and like sick men possessed with lunacie snatch at
any thing: These kind of fellows are as nigh a kin to Sergeants as Brokers
are to Usurers, both of them are inseparable purseleaches, and are men that
having run through their trades as they have their estates, at last are
forced to take upon them this most base, and odious kind of life, which they
no sooner have obtained but are as proud of it, as a lousie prisoner of a fresh
suit, or a beggarly Rimer of tweluepenny dole when he owes ninepence for ale.
They are men that have no quality in them but one, and that is to ask money,
and like Lawyers without their fees will do nothing. They imitate Ravens,
Kites and Crows that feed upon the corruption, stinking garbige and guts of
any carrion lying in the fields, and leave that part that is most wholesome
untouched, so these feed upon the follies and vices of the age, and have
nothing to do with any thing that is good. If a Gentleman come into their
Confines that has his purse well lined with crowns they will have no more
mercy over him then a Dog killer has over a diseased Curre in the plague time.
Which makes me call to mind that Motto I have often seen and read Homo homini
Lupus man is to man a Wolf. If a man should travel into the Wilderness or
some vast desert, and be devoured by so^me Rear, or Boar, or such like
savage Creature, it were but their kind to do so being pricked and stung with
hunger; But for one man like a Canniball to feed upon the other, what more
monstrous and worse then cruelty is this which every day is seen in this
place. Yet in their cruelty they will use deliberation and feed upon a man
while he has money, and make as dainty of him as a Spaniard will of a piece of
beife or mutton, and make many sweet meals of him: Or like some cruel
Surgeons that have a rich man in cure of some dangerous disease, will not at
first send him to purge in another air, but let him by lingering, and as they
call them with their compounding plasters make him smart while they have got
more money from him, and while they have drawn his life to the last thread,
and think here is no more to be got out of him, straight post him to his
grave; so Iaylors when a man's money is spent turn him into the Hole.

Sir (said I) I have seen some of their doings since I came hither, and have
admired they should be so hardened that their hearts cannot be mollified with
the oil of compassion, no nor cut with the Diamond of compunction, or that
they have no sense or feeling of their own inhumanity and hard-heartednesse,
nor once think that God may one day make them in as wretched a plight as those
they thus tyrannize over. Sir (said he) you shall seldom see a Butchers-dogge
that continually lies in the shambles without a bloody mouth, and those
Officers that live in this place having once their finger dipped in the
blood-boule of cruelty, seldom or never can be reduced to a milder kind of
usage: Custom is a second nature with them, and because they daily do it they
think it is as natural with them as their meat and drink.

But I will leave their strickt dealing with old Prisoners while an other time,
and come to their usage and behavior to new-come Prisoners at their first
entrance.

At the first entrance of any man into this Dedalean Labyrinth, after they have
viewed him and know his name, then according to the fashion of his clothes (but
most especially the weight of his purse) they bear themselves toward him,
Flies never come to painted gallipots for their gay outsides, but their sweet
insides as suckets, sugars, and other preserues, so these rather respect the
purse, then the person; for they had rather know he has a silver inside then
see him to have a golden outside. If they know he has good friends that will
not see him want, or that he has means of his own correspondent to their
expectation, they will fawn and flatter him in every respect more then a
funeral sermon will a dead man; he shall want nothing while he wants not
money, every Officer will have a cappe and a knee for him, every time they see
him he shall command all the house be Dominus fac totum, what abuse soever he
offers shall be smothered suffering him to do any wrong, yet take none, when a
poor man for the least offense shall be clapped into irons, and cast into the
Hole, and there shall remain while such time he submits himself in all
humilitieto Master Keeper.

If they see a young Nouice come in, who liberally and freely will pay all the
large fees of the house without much asking, and sometimes grease their
perpetual dry palms with a tester or a shilling, he shall not only command
their hats, but also their hearts, a covert parasite will not be more submisse
to his best Patron then these Compter Spaniells will be before such profuse
prodigalls. But if a Gentleman of a rectified and sollid understanding chance
to be arrested, and being demanded the fees and garnish stand upon
interrogatories with them, asking them what warrant they can show for the
taking of such money (being loath to cast away his money) they will instantly
answer it is a custom. A custom! Oh heavens is custom become Law, and must
it because it is usual with them be lawful for them to grind the faces of
his Majesty's subjects, who will not for the most part stand and capitulate
with them but rather condescend to them so they may get good usage of them, and
when they are discharged never think of their abuse, but are glad they have
got from them, and will rather leave their cruelty to be punished by Gods hand
then the Laws.

I desire to know the reason, why, when a Gentleman comes to the Masterside he
must before he is suffered to come into the dining room pay twelve pence for
turning the key, which not long since was but a groat, by what authority or
warrant are they now to take two groats more then there due: nay indeed, why
should they have any at all, because I never read in any place in the statutes
of England that such fees are due, therefore having no warrant from thence, I
admire they dare venture to take that which may turn to their undoing, if any
Informer should prosecute this extortion against them.

Again, suppose a man pays the shilling is demanded of him by the porter, why
should he pay for his bed the first night two shillings (which extortion is
divided between the chief Keeper and the Chamberlain his servant) they can
yield none other reason but this, that it is a custom: and if they be hardly
put to it, they will say that is the pleasure of the Sheriffs, on my
conscience they do be lie their Worshipful Master, for though they are
Masters of the House where prisoners are, yet they are not Masters of their
purses: besides no man can be so ignorant and simple, to believe that they
will devise laws of themselves, for which they have no warrant out of the
statutes: besides the statutes of the Compter were wont five years since to
hang in the yard, that every man might see what was Prisoners used worse then
slaves, whose price appears written on their backs.
due to the house and every officer, but now they are cut down and buried in
oblivion, that they may demand what they list, which they cannot justify, for
if they could, they would when they are put to it, stand to the virtue of their
authority and office, which not long since I saw tried, which ever since made
me confidently believe, that no such large fees (they usually take) are due to
them.

For a Gentleman (they afterward clapped into the Hole, because he plainly and
boldly told them of their abuses) being arrested came into the Master side,
and being demanded his fees and garnish, which he very well had been
acquainted with, because he often, by his own confession, had been a
prisoner, told them there was none due and none he would pay, for, said he,
howsoever you may fetch over young guls for their money, I will not be so soon
caught, what I call for, I will make a shift to see discharged, otherwise I
determine to pay nothing, and so resolve your selves.

The Chamberlain (the cheifest officer on that side) began to take the
repulfe very hainously, and thought he would one way or other be even with him,
making no account that he should lose his fees by him, early the next morning
before the Gentleman was up, came into his chamber, where he found him
sleeping, and his cloak (the mark he shot at) lying on the table by him, so
took it up and went down stairs again, but when the Gentleman was awake,
and began to make himself ready, he found his cloak missing, so that he
began to enquire of his chamber-fellowes if they saw it not, but they denied
it, at last he had intelligence that the Chamberlain had got it for his fees,
upon this he first went and demanded his cloak of him, who refused to deliver
it, unless he would pay him his garnish, for, quoth he, you have met with no
fools, no faith, said the Gentle man, I rather think I am come among a crew of
cunning knaves, and unless you redeliuer me my cloak again, I will make some
of you appear so before yours and my betters. And so forthwith sent his
letter by a friend of his to the next Justice, demanding his warrant for the
apprehending of such a fellow, naming of him, that the same night had robbed
him, so laid flat felony to his charge: The Justice hearing the matter could
do none other, seeing he purposed to swear against him, and being for the
King granted him his warrant for the attaching of the same Chamberlain and to
bring him before him to be examined, he seeing how he was served with this
warrant, would have given the Gentleman his cloak again, which he refused
but at last by much perswaston he was entreated to take it again, if so be
he might hear no more of the matter, and with all his heart for gave him all
such fees he before demanded of him and was glad he escapt so well. And that
the world may know this is no fiction of mine own invention that I have
related, I will tell the name of him that did this, who was one Mr Venard (that
went by the name of Englands Joy) that afterward died here in misery, plagued
by the Keepers, being more guilty of his death then his cruel adversaries, for
after he began to tell them of that they were loath to hear of, they thrust
him into the Hole, being in winter, where lying without a bed, he caught
such an extreme cold in his legs, that it was not long before he departed
this life.

Now I would know of them, if their fees had been due, why did they not stand
to the maintaining of their due, or if the Sheriffs did appoint such fees to
be taken* why did they not appeal to him, and desire his aid in the matter,
and since that time why did they not procure of him that the Articles might be
hung up by the gate, that all prisoners as soon as they are brought in upon an
arrest or command, may read them and not stand in contention, but pay what the
Right Worshipful Sheriffs and Court of Aldermen think fit to be paid.

That the extortion of these Iaylors are extreme, 23. of his reign.
look into the statutes of Henry the sixth, where it was appointed by act of
Parliament, that a Iaylour should take of any prisoner committed to ward but a
groat, in this iniunction there is not set down any due belonging to the
dore-keeper, there is no shilling mentioned for him, no two shillings for the
Chamberlain, no sixpence for the Porter, or large fees for the Bookekeeper,
but here is only mention made of a groat for the Iaylor and no more: this is
the iniunction after which follows the penalty, which is this, (mentioned in
the same Statute) And if any Iaylor shall any ways do contrary to this
aforesaid ordinance he shall loose to the party thus endammaged or greiued his
treble damages, and forfeit forty pound at every time that any of them do
contrary in any point of the same, whereof the Queen shall have one half to
be employed only to the use of her house, and the party that will sue the
other half, only the Warden of the Fleet and of the Queenes-Pallace at
Westminster for the time being shall not be prejudiced by this Ordinance in the
duty of his office. Thus you have heard the iniunction and penalty of this
Statute which was made in King Henry's the sixts time, which were in force in
Queen Elizabeth's time, and which now is of virtue and efficacy in our
Sovereign James his time, for these Statutes never since they were first made
in the Honorable house of Parliament were repealed: Therefore I admire they
knowing the Statutes will in danger themselves so much every day as to infringe
this ordinance, by the breaking of which they reap an infinite gain yearly,
for of so many thousands that come into their jurisdictions they let none escape
but have five times more then this Statute allows them, nay sometimes ten
times, nay twenty times more then they can answer; for I have seen some men
pay ten groates for his fees at book, some ten shillings, some a mark, some
twenty shillings, nay I have noted it they have not been ashamed to ask
forty shillings for his fees, besides garnish, and other charges which will
amount to the matter of a noble or seven shillings if he lie here but one
night, let him go the nighest way to work he can. Therefore I have many times
wished a Promooter at some of their backs to see their unconscionable dealing,
that he might serve them out of the Exchequor with a sub paena for their
horrible extortion, and make some of the worst of them (if there can be one
worse then another) examples for the rest, for no Iaylor will stand to trial
if he be wise, but will rather confess it, and plead guilty, which if he do he
confesses his extortion; but if he be so valiant as to stand to a
justification, he has no warrant to exceed his limitation. Therefore whether
he pleades guilty, or stands to his justification he cannot choose but show
himself an extorter, as on Carman that Carman and Bud, secundo of the King in
Michael* mas Term* And How and Bud, quarto of the king in Trinity Term.
lay in the Compter of the Poultry two or three year had like to proved one of
his Keepers if he had stood to the trial, but he was glad to compound with
him and give him a piece of money to let his suite fall, which if many other
Prisoners would take example by this fellow, and call their good doings in
question, it would be a great ease to many poor men's purses. For what extreme
extortion is it when a Gentleman is brought in by the watch for some
misdemeanour committed, and stays but while the next morning, that must pay at
least an Angel before he be discharged, he must pay tweluepence for turning
the key at the masterside door, two shillings to the Chamberleine, tweluepence
for his garnish for wine, ten pence for his dinner, whether he stay or no, and
when he comes to be discharged at the Book it will cost at least three
shillings and sixpence more, besides sixpence for the Booke-keepers pains, and
sixpence for the Porter. But this abuse was once complained on by one that had
been wronged in this nature, and my Lord Mayor sent word and commanded that no
man coming in by the watch should be received into the master-side, yet within
six or seven weeks after they could not forget their old wont but fell to it
again, imitating the Fox that was commanded by the Lion for killing many geese
and hens to go a pilgrimage for his sins, yet he could not choose but cast
his eyes on every flock of geese he saw grasing on every green he traveled
through, and at last for all the Lions command cast off his Pilgrimmes weed
before he had gone half his journey, and fell to his old trade again. But
they have other tricks as badde as these, which are as follows: when a
Gentleman that has been long resident in the masterside, and has paid all
their demand there, and chances to be turned over to the Knights-ward for want
of means he, must be forced to pay all the fees over again, or else they will
either pull his cloak from his back, or his hat from his head, and the
Steward of that ward will stand as peremptorily upon it as if it were confirmed
to him by Act of Parliament, or had it under all the Privy Counsels hands:
And if a Gentleman stay there but one night he must pay for his garnish
sixteen pence besides a groate for his lodging, and so much for his sheets,
and still he that receives it, says, it is a custom, and that it is toward
the buying of such things he wants. why if it be so I think every Prisoner is
of understanding sufficient to buy these things himself, and not to trust his
money* in other men's hands, and stand to their kindness for such things he
shall want; but these are only tricks to get money, for I have seen them put
to their nonplus, and dared by Gentlemen that understood their dealings to pull
their cloakes from their backs, telling them that there was no such exactions
due, at which hot repulse they have been as calm as midnight; but if they
meet with some raw young fellow that will swallow and digest such wrongs they
will triumph over him, and not let him pass while they have made him open his
purse and give them their demand.

When a Gentleman is upon his discharge, and has given satisfaction for his
executions they must have fees for irons, three-halfe-pence in the pound,
besides the other fees, so that if a man were in a thousand or fifteen hundred
pound execution, they will if a man is so mad have so many three-halfe-pence,
but I think the Keeper of one of the Compters that took such unlawful fees
was forced to pay back again what he had received with a thousand thanks as
soon as he perceived he had a subpaena was served upon him out of the
Exchequor: Thus if some men would but take this order with them, and ierke them
with such rods they would learn a better and honester lesson.

To mine own knowledge I saw a Promooter that Iupus lupum n^uit, and surem sur.
was arrested used more kindly and respectively then a Gentleman of five
hundred pound a year, he had what in reason he called for in the Celler, and
might have broth and meat out of the Kitchen at any time whenever he would
call for it: but will any man think that this was in love to him, no it was in
fear for not many years since he had informed against them for extortion,
therefore this considered unless they knew themselves guilty of such faults
they did suspect he would sent out, why should they stand so much in fear of
him, and if they had took nothing but their due, they might have let him gone
like an informing Knave as he was, and scorn his worst of malice, for Truth is
a brazen tower and will retort the shot of malice into their own faces that
shoot them, Virtue is like a bed of Camomill the more it is trodden on the
more it flourishes, the more she is deprest the more she expresses her self.
What a strange thing is it when a man is arrested and puts* himself to the
knightsward must pay a groat a night for his lodging, and a groate for every
pair of sheets heelies in, what conscience have they to exact so much when
the best bed in that side is not worth a Seruing-mans yearly wages; but I
have heard their due is but twopence a night if a man lie alone, and a penny a
night if he have a bedfellow, and that in the twopenny-ward where they receive
fourteen pence a week their due is but seuenpence, then what excessive gains
is this in a year, when I have heard it credibly reported that within the
circuit of one year there is committed and discharged both upon command and
arrest at the least five thousand Prisoners, what might this amount to besides
their fees at the book and their garnishes, but no more of this, for if I hope
my book shall meet with a Printer that never married Iaylours daughter.
any keeper should easdrop us, and be witness of what I relate, I perpetually
should be locked up into the Hole, or never have a good look of the
well-fauouredst of them all. Therefore my pen shall sleep in silence, and
reveal no more of their abuses that lie hid from most me^.

Sir, said I, I perceive you are either loath to proceed in your discourse, or
else you grow weary with discoursing, therefore I will give you some expausion
and breathing time, and unfold unto you what I heard of others since I came in,
concerning them, and if in any point I err in the relation, I desire you to be
my guide and put me into the right way, for I am loath to wrong them, though
they wrong most men they have power over, but would have the body of my
discourse stand upon the feet of truth.

I have heard it reported, when any Legacies come into the house, toward the
release of the poor people of the Hole, the Keepers sometimes takes them into
their hands, promising those that deliver them, that they shall be laid forth
toward the discharge of the poor, but contrary to the will of the Benefactor
deceased, relieve not only the poor in the loathsome dungeon of the Hole, to
whom it was soly given, but help those out with them that lie in the two-penny
ward, because they owe them money for their lodging, and so not for any good
will to them, help them to a Legacy, that they might be paid themselves out
of it, or else they might lie there like the rest of their fellows. Thus they
first wrong the charitable Benefactours, that on their deathbeds bequeath
their bounty to the poor, and lastly, the poor themselves, in depriving them
of that which is due to them, in making them stay, it may be two months or a
quarter of a year before they can be released, expecting other Legacies, when
as half a score or more of them may die before they come in. Again, I have
heard some murmr at their plots, in keeping men in by policy that have store
of money, letting them not go before such time their money is almost spent,
and when their Creditors come to hear of them, will not stick to tell them
that they have money enough in their pockets, and that it was fit they should
have their due before they withdrew their actions: yet when they see his coin
begin to wast, will not stand out to persuade their adversaries to take pity of
them, and come to some reasonable composition: for what should they do with
them when they have no more cash: dealing with them as some dainty Lady will
with a Woodcocke, cares not what becomes of the body, when she has eaten up
his brains, or as Huntsmen do with foxes, fling the carcass into some ditch
or on some dunghill, after they hane stripped his skin over his ears. Besides
these tricks I have heard that when a young Gentleman is arrested, and has
competent allowance from his friends, as weekly his diet and his lodging
discharged, they continually will certify his friends or his father of the
least misdemeanour he shall commit, nay, rather then fail to relate all, will
add more to it, to make it more heinous, so that he might be incensed
against his child, and still keep him in prison, which policy is only for
this cause, that they might still have so good a guest as he is, knowing his
friends will see such things he calls for truly discharged*

These things (say they) are common with them, and when a Tradesman is arrested
upon several actions they will give (being feed well) intelligence to their
Adversaries whether they mean to put in bail or no to them, or what they
determine to get their release by, caring not what becoms of the poor man,
wife and children, so they themselves gain but twelue-pence. Some, say they,
will not stick to take fees of dead men, and scarce let the coffin go out of
their gates, before his friends has paid his fees, therefore if these reports
be true, it is first most abominable for them to act, and most lamentable to
hear. Therefore, good Sir, let me have your advise and opinion in this matter,
and truly without any fallacy or equivocation, whether these things I lately
was certified, of are true or no, after a little pausing he began to resolve me
in this manner.

Indeed Sir, some of these devises I have found practiced upon my self, but
for some others, that you have made mention of I will not boldly warrant to be
true, but you have heard no more reported then I have heard spoken: but this I
can justify to be true, as a true token and sign of their wooluish
disposition and ingluvious appetites, there cannot a dish of meat come into the
gates, but they must and will have a share of it, nay, and think that the
poor prisoners are much beholding to them, that they are so much graced, or
have so much favor as to have them partake with them: but if any man hating
their society will neither give them entertainment, or inuit them to any piece
of meat he shall be sure to be locked up all that week that Keeper waits,
and do him some villainous mischief whenever he conveniently can contriue
it. Or on the contrary, if any young nouice that has no execution against him,
be pliant to their humor, they will use him with as great a respect as any
Noble-mans heir, if they see him profuse and riotous, they will not leave
urging him to go abroad with them to take some composition with his creditors,
when Heaven knows, it is not for any good they purpose to him, but themselves.
For they use him as Anglers do the fish, give him a bait, but it is for his
bane, so these are kind, but it is for some benefit they expect from him, for
they will never go abroad with any of these under two shillings or half a
crown, if they stay but an hour with them, besides in what company soever
they come in, and stay at dinner and supper, either at an Ordinary or Tavern,
or any friends house, they pay not a penny, thus do they persuade many abroad
with them (that else would stay at home, I mean in Prison) first that they
might furnish their purses with money, and their bellies with good cheer, and
bring them home at night, as bare of money as a sheep is of wool that all day
long has been feeding among bushes and briers.

But suppose this man from whom they have received so much kindness, as good
diet, money and other favors, fall into want and distress, do you think
they will relieve him, no they will let him lie and break his heart with his
own sighs, wash his couch with his own tears, grind his teeth into powder,
and make himself bread of it to eat, before they will relieve or help him, or
if by chance they do relieve any poor man (as it is very seldom) they will
in a Pharesaicall ostentation report it to any friend that comes to visit him.

I have seen an Emblem, where the picture of Charity held in one hand loaves
of bread, distributing it to the poor standing round about her, and in the
other, a Trumpet to report to the world her benevolence. Such are these
Iaylours, that upon the least taste of friendship or kindness showed to a man,
will be sure to have all the people in the house know of it, yet these
courtesies come as seldom from them, as virgins out of Pickthatch, or sound
horses out of Smith-field.

But for one good quality they have ten badde, and what injury or wrong soever
they do a man he must not complain, a rugged behavior toward them
preuailes not. If a man rush through a quicke-set hedge in have he cannot choose
but have his face scratcht* whereas if he temperately did divide the bushes
with his hands he might go through without any hurt: when a poor man comes
nigh a churlish mastiffe he must not spurn at him if he mean to go quietly
by him, but flatter and stroke him on the back, and spit in his mouth: So
must Prisoners if they mean not to be pricked with a Iaylors thorny
disposition must use him gently, or if he will not be bitten with his currish
and dogged usage let him give fair words and sometimes if he be able flinge a
soppe or two into his gaping and all-deuouring jaws.

They do as all the world else, more for money then merit, for I have seen a
fellow come in with scarce a ragge on his back being some Cheat or Decoy that
has been preferred to the Masterside, because the Keepers knew they of his
trade would fetch him out speedily, and pay all the fees: when on the contrary,
I have known a Gentleman of good reputation whose behavior and outward
habiliments showed his desert, clapped up into a dark room without any light
among half a score men, and if there were no spare bed for him to lie on,
let him take up his lodging on the bourds which he must pay for before he and
they part. Other men's miseries makes them merry, and the more Prisoners they
have committed the more is their gain, for I have often heard them (when my
Lord Majors officers have brought in Bakers for making their bread an ounce or
two too heavy) whisper in their ears telling them they have had but a few
Prisoners that week which is an instigation to them, to bring as many as they
can possible; besides the Booke-keepers, do not much stand upon it to give
sometime a pint or a quart of wine to a Beadle that he might not forget him
the next night following, but wake the watchmen if they should chance to nodde,
^o by that means might loose a night walker.

Their cruelty is as great as their policy for I have heard since I have been
Prisoner a poor sick man, that not half an hour before he died called about
midnight for water to quench his thirst, yet none of thesehard-hearted Keepers
would rise to releive him, but were deaf to his lamentable and sad complaints:
so that the poor soul before day took his leave of the world. But what comes
all the dirt and dross to, they thus scrath and scrape together? most commonly
to nothing, for what they are getting in three or four year they may loose in
an after noone, so that it is as rare to see a rich laylor, as a drove of fat
Oxen in Spain; for sometimes when they go abroad with Prisoners for
tweluepence or eighteen pence gain, may loose them before they come in again,
and so are forced to compound with their Creditors. And that I may recreate
your spirits (too much dulled I fear with my tedious discourse) I will tell
you three or four pretty tricks, three or four several Prisoners served
those Keepers that went abroad with them.

A poor man having been two or three Winters in the Hole, and along time
frost bitten with calamity and want, desiring to free himself because neither
his friends nor his cruel adversaries would do so much for him, came to a
Keeper desiring him to go abroad with him telling him he had a firm hope to
make a final agreement with all his Creditors: for he was going to a friend
of his to receive so much money (naming the sum to him) as would release him:
and if he would take the pains to go out with him he would before he stepped
one foot out of the gates give him content: The Keeper that had as excellent a
gift in taking money as any leaking boat has in taking water, vouchsafed to
receive his fees, and (to be short) wentabroad with him: the best part of the
day they spent in walking up and down the City from friend to friend, yet they
could not get so much as one sixpenny piece from any: at last to prolong the
time, the Prisoner desired the Keeper but to go with him to one friend more,
and there he made no doubt but to speed: well, away they go together, but
they found no more money there then they did at diverse places they had been at
before, so that they were coming home again as emprie of money as they went
out: for the Keeper would not stay a minute longer when he saw there was non
Lariohn to be had, so he hastens his Charge to go a little faster that they
might be at home betimes, nay faith said the Prisoner seeing you have been so
good as to stay out with me so long, I desire you to do me that honest office
as to go into a Barbers shop and stay while I am trimmed which I have not been
this twelue-moneth, and to recompense you for your pains I will give you your
shauing; the Keeper not refusing this courtesy thinking to save a groate or
sixpence in his purse by the bargain, went with him into the next Barbers
shop they came to, where the Barber after a finnicall congratulation biddes
them welcome, and prouides his chair and his napkins, his combs, and his
Sizers, his balls and his spunges, and falls first about the Prisoners ears:
Who being dispatched gave him a tester and went to the window to put on his
band, the Keeper instantly upon his rising began to fall into his room, and
being set fell a talking with the Barber about what news he heard in the
City, but they had not discoursed long, but Cutb^rd stopped his mouth with a
washing ball, desiring him to shut hi lips for fear the suddes should come
into his mouth, and to close his eyes for he was trimming him with a stinging
ball: the Keeper did so, now in this time the Prisoner had made himself ready,
slipped out of doors, went quite away, and was never heard of again. Now the
Barber had no sooner took the basen from the Keepers chinne, and was carrying
it to the window but the Keeper admiring he could not hear his Prisoners
tongue walk all this while, opened his eyes (venturing a smarting) to see
whether the Prisoner were in the shop or no, whom he no sooner mist, but up
he starts, runs out of doors bearing the Barber over and over, that came
with his rasor in his hand to shave him, and ran into the streets with the
Barbers clothes about his shoulders, with his choppes all white with the froth
and suddes that hung about them, so that he looked like a Boar that foamed at
mouth, or a well traveling horse, and in this order runs he madding up and
down the street inquiring for his Prisoner, the Barber follows him for his
clothes, and money for his trimming, while every man, woman, and child that
met him gave him way, thinking he had newly broke out of Bedlam; but my Barber
at last ouertooke him, laid hold on him, and got his clothes, and his money of
him before he would let him go: and so my Keeper was forced to turn back to
the Compter without his Prisoner, so that when all his fellows heard the
conceit they almost laughed him out of countenance, besides the plague he was
put to in compounding with the Prisoners Adversaries.

But in my conceit the best jest was of a fellow who was committed to the
Compter (for getting a Wench with child) by a Justice, who sent this prouiso
to the Keepers, that they should not permit him to go abroad until such time
he had put in sufficient bail to discharge the Parish of the burden: Now the
wench was not yet delivered but looked every hour, in the mean time this
fellow made continual suite to go abroad to seek bail, at last one of the
Book keepers let him go to some of his friends having for his Keeper one of
the Messengers belonging to the house, now the Prisoner being abroad and seeing
his time and opportunity, most nimbly and like an Irishfootman betook himself
to his heels, and ran quite away, I cannot say clean away, for he was in such
a fright that a man might have smelt him a furlong; but to conclude, the
Messenger went home to the Compter as like an Ass as he went out, and brought
home the sad tidings which was as welcome to the Booke-keeper as a Prisoner
that had never a penny in his purse. Well to be short, the Parish complained of
the Keepers negligence, who laid the fault on the Messengers head, at last it
fortuned so, that the Wench was brought abedde, but with what in the name of
God? by my troth, with two chopping boys, which the Justice hearing of, to
ease the Parish of such a charge, sent for the Booke-keeper and the Messenger,
and made the Booke-keeper keep one of them, and the Messenger the other, and
this was their just and righteous doom.

Thus with my best Art and industry according to my promise I have compiled
in as brief a method as I could the state of the Compters Commonwealth
rehearsing Compendium, imo suspendiu^.
the best and chiefest subjects belonging to it, as subtle Citizens, politic
Prodigalls, villainous Sergeants, and officious Constables and Beadles which are
the four maine Pillars that support it: then I discoursed to you of the nature
of the place it self and the inhabitants, their extortion, and cruelty: I
could now relate to you the villainy of the Messengers, that are members of the
same body, who instead of going to men's friends with letters (which concerns
their liberty or relief) will sit drinking in some Alehouse and neglect their
business, which it may be is a perpetual undoing to the poor man. I could
display the abuses of drunken Tapsters that poison poor Prisoners with their
stinking sower beer, which they sell as dear as if it were as good as ever
died any nose in grain: for the most we have is as you see, scarce a wine
pint for a penny, and they will not suffer us to send for it out of doors
where we may have far better, and better measure, but will break such
bottles our friends send in too for our releife, and will neither trust us when
we have no money, nor suffer us to send for it where we may be trusted, but
serve us with drink that the worst Iaylor among them will scorn to taste of,
but when we are all locked up into our Wards will send for better out of
doors, and will be drunk when many a poor soul is so dry that they are
ready to choke. I was entreated to have a ^^^ke at the Paperhouse, which I
could not be won to, because I know nothing in their office worthy of
displaying, for if I should express more then I know, both the wrong and
disgrace would redound to my self, therefore if there be any coruption or
double dealing among them I will leave it to their own consciences. And thus
will I leave of this discourse, desiring you if you mean to put these
observations in print I have delivered, not to nominate me, or reveal from
whom you have had this discovery.

Sir (said I) I will be as close as an Aldermans door at dinnertime, yet good
Sir let it not seem tedious or trouble some to you, to acquaint me with one
secret more, and I shall rest your friend in the highest degree of love and
affection, which is that you (though concisely) would express to me the nature
of the Hole, what place it is, and what government they have there, for I have
heard much of the authority among themselves. At this he began to smile,
telling me he was one of the chiefest in that place, and if it should be
known that he revealed any of them secrets, he should not only have a fine
put upon his head, but also should be put out of share. I seeing his
backewardnesse drunk a cup of sack to him, and at last (though very loath)
he began to me once more as follows.

CHAP. X. Containing 1. The misery of such as live in the Hole. 2. A
resemblance between Jerusalem and it. 3. An answer to certain objections. 4.
A resemblance between the Hole, and a well governed City. 5. The authority of
the Steward and the twelve oldest Prisoners. 6. Their manner of sitting in
counsel, And lastly their Justice, Law, and Equity.
HE that would see the strange miracles of God, let him take some long voyage
to sea, and he that would see the miseries of man let him come into this place
the Hole, that stinkes many men to death, and is to all that live in it, as the
Dog days are to the world, a causer of diseases, except a few whom I have
seen so stout and tough (stinkeproofe, nay plagueproofe I think) that no
infection could pierce their hearts. Jerusalem when it was sacked had not more
calamities feeding upon her heart then this place, and I think it was the true
Idea and shadow of this loathsome Dungeon we live in, for as there as pinching
famine in Ierujalem, so in this place there are many men that for want of
sustenance utterly perish. In Jerusalem there was sickness, so in this place a
man shall not look about him but some poor soul or other lies groaning and
laboring under the burden of some dangerous disease, the child weeping over
his dying Father, the mother over her sick child, one friend over an other,
who can no sooner rise from him, but he is ready to stumble over an other in
as miserable a plight as him he but newly took his leave of, so that if a man
come thither he at first will think himself in some Churchyard that has
been fatned with some great plague, for they lie together like so many graves.
In Jerusalem the wars ruined millions of souls, so in this place the
continual war that hard hearted Creditors make against the lives of their
poor debtors destroy many wretched and most miserable Creatures: and as in
Jerusalem a mother was forced through hunger to eat her own child to save
her own life, so in this place one man is ready to prey upon the other, so
that they walk up and down like so many Ghosts for want of food to relieve
them. Lastly in Jerusalem were intestine And fighting against us in our own
clothes.
seditions, so here innumerable assaults of our homebred friends descended from
our own flesh. But (Sir said I) I have heard it reported for truth that there
are many living in that place that go Gentleman-like, have money continually in
their purses, eat good meat, live as merrily as the best of the house, if
this be true it cannot choose but hinder them from much charity that else would
be sent unto them, for what need charitable Benefactors send them means when
so many of them go so neat and hansome, for it is not given them to lay on
their backs but to put into their bellies, for in such a place the coursest
garments are the best: again (they say) there is a certain company of them
that take what they list themselves of what relief soever comes in, and the
rest as the poorest, have their leauings, so then this is objected to be one
of the chief causes that there is such continual sickness, poverty, and
famine there: And lastly, that what means or money soever comes in to them, in
the space of an hour after will either in wine, beer, or Tobacco make
themselves drunk for the present time, which is the cause they fast a week
after, therefore good sir resolve me these doubts, and I shall cease to trouble
you any more: He instantly condiscended and thus began to answer me.

Sir (said he) it is granted that there be some in this place that go decent
and hansome, but you must not be persuaded that they get it from such charities
as are sent in to them, their own endeavors and labors procures it them, and
it may be some of them as they have lived like Gentlemen abroad, so they would
be glad to show themselves still though they be in prison: Besides, their
friends sometimes furnish them with such necessaries as are fit to keep them
clean, and hansome. Again, whereas you say that there are some of them have
what they list, and leave what they dislike to the poor, is not to be
credited, for there is nothing that comes in but the youngest has as great a
share as the eldest (I as Master Steward himself) therefore whosoever informed
you of this, spoke it out of envy toward us, yet we confess at Easter', or
Christmas when any good Legacy comes in, it is fittest that those Prisoners
that have been of five or six years standing should have the profit of it
before such as have been there but two or three months, and this breeds a
mutiny many times among them, because the youngest has not that privilege the
eldest ought to have. And lastly, whereas you allege how riotous they live
there when they have money, may be very well denied: for they have no money
delivered into their hands, but into the Stewards disposing, who carefully
prouides them such necessaries as they want, only at Christmas and Easter or
such times when the liberality of the City is more ample then at any other
time of the year else, they (though unwillingly) may fall into some error
being kept from a full diet so long time as many of them are And now Sir I hope
I have cleared your doubts, therefore now I will proceed to the government of
the place.

This little Hole is as a little City in a Commonwealth, for as in a City
there are all kind of Officers trades and vocations, so there is in this
place, as we may make a pretty resemblance between them. In steed of a Lord
Mayor we have a Master Steward to ouer-see and correct all such misdemeanors
as shall arise, he is a very upright man in his dealings though he stoop in
his body, but the weight of the office he bears is the cause he bends, which
is a great sign of humility. And as the City has twelve Companies that
exceed all the rest for authority, antiquity, and riches; so has this place
twelve old Prisoners that help the Steward in his proceedings, who by the
general voice of the house rule and bear sway over all the rest; and here as
in a City is Divine service said every evening, and morning; here as in a
City is a commanding Constable, that upon any misdemeanors offered by any man
either to the Steward, or the Twelve shall be bravely mounted and have ten
pounds with a purse, that the print of their justice shall stick upon his
buttockes four and twenty hours after. And lastly as in a City there is all
kinds of Trades, so is there here, for here you shall see a Cobbler sitting
mending old shows, and singing as merrily as if he were under a stall
abroad; not far from him you shall see a Tailor sit crosse-legged (like a
Witch) on his cushion, threatening the ruin of our fellow Prisoners the
Egyptian vermin: In an other place you may behold a Sadler empannelling all
his wits together how to patch this Scotchpadde hansomely, or mend the old
Gentlewomans Crooper that was almost burst in pieces: You may have a Physician
here that for a pottle of sack will undertake to give you as good a medicine
for melancholy as any Doctor will for five pound, and make you purge upward
and downward as well as if you had taken down into your guts all the drugges
in Lothbury. Besides if you desire to be removed before a Judge you shall have
a Tinker-like Attorney not far distant from you, that in stopping up one Hole
in a broken cause will make twenty before he has made an end, and at last
will leave you in prison as bare of money as he himself is of honesty: Here is
your Choleric Cook that will dress our meat when we can get any as well
as any greasy Scullion in Fleetlane or Pyecorner. And twenty more then these
there are, which for brevity sake I will leave out, because I would discourse
unto you the majesty and state of these Officers, when every Saturday at night
they sit in counsel about their affairs, and thus it is.

About the time that Bowbell summons the toast and butter Eaters to shut up
their shoppes, the Council begin to flock together, and then the youngest
man of the Twelve prouides a broom and makes the little cockeloft as clean as
any Citizens wives chamber in the Town, then spreads a green carpet on the
board not much bigger then a Horses saddle-cloath just before the place the
Steward sits in, and then takes three or four stoopes in his hands and trudges
down to the Cellar, calling for the best liquor, telling Froath the Tapster
that it is for Master Steward and the rest of his brethren, who gives them of
the best because they are his best Customers: when he has his full load of
drink I mean his arms and not his head full, away he goes to the
Councell-chamber not forgetting to carry with him half a dozen papers of
Tobacco: Having ascended the Ladder in a most comely order he places the Canns
on the Table, and fills half a score pipes of Tobacco, thus having all things
in readiness he requests the Steward and the rest of the Twelve to comevp, who
being ascended begin to suck out the brains of the barrells to add to
their own, and light the pipes and let them go merrily round. The reason that
they drink so much before they determine of any thing, is this, that they may
the easier cast up their reckonings; and why they drink so much Tobacco, is,
that if any man be brought before them for any abuse committed, they might
smoke him soundly. When they have devoured all their drink, and Trinidado,
they sift and boult out what expenses they have been at that week, what
pepper, salt, vinegar, faggots, and candles they have spent, how many dozen of
bread, sheep gathers, and barrells of foureshillings beer they have had
brought in that week. This business of moment dispatched, the youngest of the
privy Council calls up all such as have had wrong done them any time that
week, and preferres their bills of complaint up to the whole body of the
Council, or else are permitted to relate, but with all modesty and
deliberation, the nature of the offense, and so producing their witnesses,
shall without all partiality have the Law pass upon the Offender, who must
either fine for the fault, or if he be not worth so much, will make his
posteriours pay for it. If any man be known to be a common Drunkard he shall,
if he be able, fine for it, or else his punishment shall be to go a dry while
he can get money to quench his thirst, or else must either drink water, or
choke. If any man steal any of his fellows meat* if it be known he shall
fine for it, but if he be not able, the Twelve will take such order with him
that he gets not a penny loaf three days after. Whosoever forsweares
himself if he be able, he shall fine for it, if he be not* shall go and be
damned as long as he stays in the house, and never have so much credit as
run one penny on the Tapsters score.

Again if they chance to fall together by the ears themselves about any thing
they enact, so that they beat the Canns about each others ears, they will not
long bear envy in their hearts, but at the approach of the other half dosen
quench that fire of debate, drink a health to some of their best Benefactours,
shake hands, be sworn friends, break up Council for that night, and go to
their beds (if they have any.)

Thus have I beguiled the time, and I fear my self, in relating to you the
true nature of the Hole, the misery of it; my defense to the slanderous
objections, and the authority and justice of the Steward and the Twelve,
therefore I will touch one point more and draw to a conclusion. But as he was
going forward in his discourse the Bell of the Master-side range to dinner, and
by this means we were both called up; so I promised him secrecy as he
entreated me, made an end of our sack, put a small token of my love into his
hand, so he went to his Hole, and I to my Ward, but I no sooner was entered
into my chamber, but with all expedition I took pen, ink, and paper,
writing what I could remember of his discourse, which I have made bold to
publish to the world, hoping that those that read it will not think a miss of
me for setting it forth, for I doubt not but if it be seriously perused, it
will give true content to them. So remembering my best love and service to all
those that affect me, and my willing labors, I rest theirs to be commanded,
