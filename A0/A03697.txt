To the CHRISTIAN Reader, the saving knowledge of that truth which is according
Titus 1. 1
to godliness.
CHRISTIAN Reader: this short Catechism, thus gathered and set down for the
help of the ignorant, cannot be called new, but renewed for their sakes. For, I
may say in this case as Solomon in his Ecclesiastes, said Eccles. 1. 9
(...) a like case: What is that that has been? that that shall be. And what is
that that has been done? that that shall be done: and there is ^o new thing
under the Sun. The portion of meat which is here offered to the taste of
the simple, is no other then that which he has already tasted of, if hec have
tasted any thing of the things of God: and it is but the substance of other
Cat^chisms set before him in another kind of service, that is, with some
difference of Cookery and dressing: which (considering our too great distaste
with one kind of meat, though never so wholesome, if we be continually fed
with it without diversity) may not be without some good use, at least for some
short time. For, the affections of men stand no less diversely affected toward
the variety of Gods gifts, in delivering one and the same matter, then does the
stomach toward the dressing of one and the same kind of meat in a diverse
manner, by some-alteration of form and manner of doing it. And yet it is (...)
part of my meaning to hold up the market of no^lty by (...) such eyeseruice, as
te^deth rather (...) tickle the care, then to satisfy the s^der judgment: or
to say any thing for those who make books like to the apparel which they
wear, (...) fashio^s that they are weary of* when a ^wer comes. Only, having
taught these Principles (most of them) (...) a few pri^tely; and finding it
more easy to print them* then to write them, ^or the surer keeping of them in
their memories, who had leared them, and the good of (...) abroad that desired
them; I was not unwilling thus to give them content by the benefit of the
^resse and of p^ting. Neither have I done this for any w^nt: for there is store
of Catechisms abroad, to which this worm of mine is no way comparable: and God
has (...) mercif^ll with our age for the means of knowledge; but we famish
spirit^lly at the full measure of these (...), either by (...) using them (...)
all, or (...) sh^ld.

This (...) of (...) I could have made (...) larger, but that I c^sidered (...)
my Cruse of st^, the Vessels that I had to fill, which could ^. King. 4. 4. 6
(...) well recei^ more, and so left pouring, as I per^ed their filling. Accept
therefore (Reader) what is here offered to thy gentleness, and take it in
(...) good part, as it is meant unto thee. And so, I (...) thee, and thy gro^th
in (...) to the grace (...) assist^ce of Almighty God: and rest,

(...) in all Christian good will: ROBERT HORN.

to know my self.

Can you know God?

Not so plainly and Exodus 33. 20 7. Cor. 13. 12
fully here as we shall hereafter, by face; but as he has revealed himself
unto us.

How is that?

By his works without us, and Romans 1. 20. and 1. 19.

of Gods savor in his Word, wrought in my heart by the h^ly Ghost, whereby I

reading of the Word, and the reverent use of Prayer and ^ments.

The occasion and matter of the Commandment.

What was the occasion?

Our foolish desire to have our fancies Deuteronomy. 7. 25, 26 Psalm. 106. 35, 36. etc.
fed in G^ds worship.

What do you consider in the matter?

First, that which is forbidden* and secondly, that which is commanded.

What is that which is forbidden?

To worship other persons or things with the true, God, or the true God in a
false manner.

Wherein, and how do we worship the true God in a false manner?

First, in base esteeming of him: and secondly, in forging of his worship and
serui^e.

How do we basely esteem of God?

When we imagine him to be Deuteronomy. 4. 12 Esa. 40. 18 Habac. 2 18 Ier. 4. 2. and
5. 7 Zeph. 1. 5

In a slight regard of the titles of God, and abuse of holy things.

How do we slightly regard Gods titles?

When we swear vainly, (...), or falsely by them: or when we Ma^h. 5. 34
(...) 5. 1^ Zec^ar. 5. 4 A^ts 23. 11 M^ 6. (...)
once name, or think of God in a lawful oath, or otherways without his due
reverence: and here is forbidden all usual swearing, passionate swearing, and
forswearing.

So Much for the abuse of Gods titles: how do we abuse holy things?

When we abuse Gods word, or other his ordinances.

How do we abuse his word?

2. Pet. 3. 4 ^ay 22. 12, 13 M^t. 4. 6. (...). 20. 6. Mar. 14. 58. Act. 24. 5.

When we abuse prayer, Sacraments, and true discipline.

So much for the abuse of religion: what is that of the creatures?

When we mock or deface them, b^ clothing natural fools in some strange and
dis^uised manner: also, when we abuse to excess and wantonness, our meats,
drinks or apparel; and nothing regard Gods fearful works.

So much for that which is forbidden: what is here commanded?

To use holy things and Gods creatures Deuteronomy. 6. 7. Eccles. 4. 17 Psalm. 15. 4.

six days labor, the other of the Sabbath.

8. Man* 6* 3 Ephesians. 4. 28
labor six days in our severed calling, save where and when the Church does,
in the wisdom of the Spirit, set apart some for holy assemblies; or when some
day or part of day is necessary, and to be used for honest recreation.

But some hold that these words, six days thou shall labor, are words of
permission only, and no commandment?

If the precept of the six days labor be not here established, there is no
commandment, by which it can can be proved that the not laboring in a
vocation lawful, six days, is an immediate sin against God.

What does this teach?

That not to labor the six days, in some particular profitable calling does
break the fourth precept, as well as the not keeping of the seventh day holy.

So Much for the precept of the six days labor: what is that of the Sabbath?

That we keep the day holy to God.

What do you observe therein?

The thing forbidden, and that which is commanded.

What is forbidden?

The occassion, and matter of the Commandment.

What was the occasion?

men: to all these we must submit in y^ Lord with all reverence, love and
humility; likewise to every ordinance that God has set up for government.

So much for the precept belonging to Superiors: What Commandments belong to
others?

Sam. 19 1. 2. Esth. 4. 13. 14. Psalm. 82. 4. Job 29. 17.

other cruel affections, which (within) draw much blood.

How by our words?

By mocks, taunts, reproaches; by Leuit. 19. 14. Ier. 20. 8. 10. Genesis 21. 9.
Pro. 12. 18. 1. Cor. 6. 10. 1. Sam. 25 17. Mat. 5. 22. Genesis 31. 5.

or openly with some weapon.

So much for that which is forbidden: what is commanded?

Iam. 3 13. Ephesians. 4. 32. Col. 3. (...). Job. 29. 15. Romans 12 15. M^. 5. 9. 1.

The next precept commands it, which forbids Adultery, the contrary
thereunto.

What are the words?

Thou shall not commit Adultery. Seventh Commandment.
What do you observe in them?

What say you of this further opening of the Commandment?

^usts and desires within consent. Or, the corruption of the soul in unclean
thoughts and fancies contrary to the Commandment.

What is outward uncleanness?

It is in word, or deed.

What is that in word?

Unclean talk and readings to Ephesians. 4. 29. and 5, 3.
the corrupting of our selves, and our neighbors; which is the fruit of a
whorish tongue.

What is that indeed?

It is in the adulteries themselves, or prouocations thereunto.

What say you of the adulteries themselves?

They are of married persons, or Heb. 13. 4. Leu. 19. 29. Deuteronomy. 23 17. 1. Cor.
6. 9.
when one of the parties is married or contracted, properly called adultery:
and of persons before marriage, called fornication.

What is adultery in Marriage?

An uncleanness against it in their entrance, or afterward.

How may they be said to be unclean in their entrance? Leuit. 20. 11. 12 Eze.
22. 10. 11. Leuit. 18. 6. 7. etc. Ex. 22. 16. 17. Genesis 24. 50 51. Ruth* 3. 2.

How afterward?

When they (...) with ^rang ^lesh, or abuse their own mari^ge.

So much for the adulteries themselves: what say you of the prouocations
thereunto?

They belong to the body, or are in the body it self.

What are they that belong to the body?

Deuteronomy. 22. 12. Esa. 3. 18. 19. etc. and 4. 4. Zep. 1. 8. Pro. 7. 10. Deu. 22.
5. Eze. 16. 49. Ephesians. 5. 18. Ier. 5. 8. Pro. 23. 29. 30, 33. Ezekiel. 23. 14. 1.

and drinks: want^n pictures and (...), with lewd and wanton pastimes: unclean
songs and d^tties: houses of open whoredom: exce^iue sleep and idleness, with
the like.

What are they which be in the body it self?

Al wanton lookings, whisperings, Pro. 6. 13. 2. Pe. 2. 14. Genesis 39. 12. Pro.
7. 10. 11 12, 13, etc. Mat. 14 6. Job. 21. 11. Romans 14. 13.
touchings, and other impure behavior stirring up lust: specially mixed d^cing,
of men and women, where all doors are set open for whoredom to come in. For,
in these, all parts are abused to ^eshly dalliance, the eye the hand, the
mouth, the mincin^ foot.

So much for that which is forbidden: what is commanded as the sum of all?

To keep our own bodies and 1. These. 4. 4. 7. 1. Cor. 1. 2. 1. Pet. 1. 15.

souls Chaste and pure, as Temples of the Holy Ghost, (...) all helps
thereto, and all means in our power for the like to our neighbor: and, if
(...) be not given us without marriage, in marriage to use the lawful remedy of
(...) and burning.

So much for the duties that concern o^r Neighbors person: what are they that
are in things belonging to their persons?

They are in the two next Commandments; which, teach us the care that we owe
to them for the preserving of their goods and good name.

Where are we charged with the preservation of their goods?

In the next Eight Commandment, Eight Commandment.
which is: Thou shall not steal?

What do you observe therein?

The occasion of the Commandment, and the matter.

What was the occasion? Esa. 5. 8. Ier. 22 14. 15. Col. 3. 5 Mic. 2. 2. Act 20
33.


Our conetous and (...) nature, not contented with our (...).

What do you consider in the matter of the Commandment?

The things forbidden and commanded.

What is the thing forbidden?

Theft, which is a violent and open, or secret and crafty taking away, or
diminishing of our neighbors goods, and lavish spending of our own.

Of what sorts is it?

Inward, and outward.

What is the inward Theft?

The theft of the heart, or that covetousness 2. Pet. 2. 14. Ios. 7. 21. 1.
Kin. 21 4. Ephesians. 5. 5.
which is Idolatry.

What is the outward?

It is the abuse of our own, or unjust pursuit of our Neighbors goods.

How may a man be said to abuse his own?

By lavish spending, or covetous holding in.

How by lavish spending? 1. Tim. 5. 3. Luk 15. 13. and 14, 29, 30, Pro. 21, 17,
and 23, 13, and 6, 1, 2, and 17, 18, and 11, 15, and 21, 26, 27, Mat. 25. 18.
27.


When he lays forth more in apparel, diet, at play, and in building then his
estate will bear: and, when he becomes surety, he cares not for whom, nor how
far. No, he that increases not nor bettereth his estate by diligence in his
calling, and providence in his spendings, (...).

How by covetous holding in?

When by a miserable mind, he robs (...). 4 8. and 6. 1, 2. and 2, 26.
himself of the use of that which he has in his own keeping, being (...)
thief to himself.

So much for the abuse of our own goods: how do we unjustly pursue another?

Craftily, or without color of Law.

How craftily? 1. These 4. 6 (...). 5. 4 Exo. 22. 21 22 Deuteronomy. 10. 18 etc. and
24. 14. Pr. 22. 22. Am. 5. 11. and 8. 5. Pr. 20. 14. and 22. 18 Deuteronomy. 25. 13.
Ioh. 12. 6.

How without color of Law? 1. (...) 16. Pr. 1. 11, 12. 13, 14 Leuit. 19. 11.

When by a theeuish and strong hand we take that which belongs not to us;
either openly as (...), or more closely as Pilferers: or (...) in our hand that
which is (...), whether found by (...), or lent to (...) or due to (...), as
their (...) hire.

So much for that which is forbidden! what is commanded? Heb. 13. 5. 1. Tim.
16. 6. Phil. 4. 11. Pr. 27. 27. Genesis 3. 19. 2. These. 3. 10. Pr. 21. 20. Ephe.

To be (...) with (...), and to rest in the (...) that (...) has given us;
laboring by ^gence in our lawful callings, so to increase or maintain it in
Gods fear, that we may not be chargeable, where we should be helpful and ease

restitution.

So much for the preservation of our neighbors goods: where are we charged
with the care of his good name?

In the next ninth Commandment, Ninth Commandment.
which is: Thou shall not bear false witness, etc.

What do you observe therein?

The occasion of the Commandment, and matter thereof.

What was the occasion?

Our (...) and lying nature. Ps. 62 9. Esa. 57 4. Romans 3. 4, 13.


What do you observe in the matter of the Commandment?

first, what is forbidden, and secondly, what is commanded.

What is forbidden? Esa. 5. 20. Phil. 4. 8. Mat. 1. 19.


Under the name of false witness, which is an uncharitable report, true or
false, we are forbidden to wrong our neighbor, or our (...) in good name.

How many ways may such false witness be borne?

Inwardly, and outwardly.

How inwardly? Mat. 71. Romans 14. 4. Acts 28. 4 1. Sam. 1. 14. Mat. 9. 3. 1.
Sa^. 18. 9. 15, 29, ^ames 3. 17. 1. Cor. 13. 5. 2. Sam. 16. 4.


When we suspect without cause, and condemn without hearing.

How outwardly?

Without speech, saying nothing: or, by speaking.

How without speech?

When we bear false witness in Ps. 22. 7. Matt. 27. 39. lob. 16. 9. 1. King.
19. 21. Esa. 53. 3. Psa. 82. 4. Pr 4. 24. Deuteronomy. 33. 9.
some mocking or disgraceful gesture against our neighbor with the hand,
head, tongue, or other member; and refuse to (...) the truth for him, being
called thereunto.

How by speaking?

When we give forth, or receive in some uncharitable report.

When bear we false witness in giving forth a report?

First, when we speak truly, and yet not either charitably, or with 1. Sam.
22, 8, 9. etc. Ps. 52. 3, 4. 1. Sam. 23. 19. Dan. 6. 4, 5, 11, 12, Pro. 29. 11.
Pro. 20. 19. 1. Cor. 13. 7. Ps. 31. 22. Ps. 12 2. 3.
discretion of our neighbor: and, secondly, and chiefly, when we speak that
which is false of him, or of our selves, and dissemble with our tongues.

How many ways may we speak that which is false of our Neighbor?

In a lie, or untruth. Col. 3. 9. Apo. 22. 15 Ephesians. 4. 25. (...). 5. 1.


What call you a lie?

Whatsoever a man speaks against his mind, or knowledge. And 1. Sam. 15. 20.
Psalm. 15. 3. Ps. 12. 2. lob. 6. 28.
this, behind a man's back is slander, and before his face, detraction by a lie.

What call you an untruth?

When a man rashly utters an untrue speech thinking he speaks Pro. 19. 20.
true. And here we are forbidden to move false tales against our neighbor in
presence, or behind his back.

How many ways may we speak that which is false of our selves?

Either when we boast our selves Romans 1. 30. Pr. 27. 2. 1. Sam 15 13. 1. Sam.
15. 21. 24. Genesis 3. 12. 13. 2. King. 5. 25. Ter. 2. 35 Col. 2. 18.
vainly, or lessen our faults falsely, or excuse our selves by a lie: or when,
by proud humility, we fall in our (...) speech that others may (...) us.

So much for false witness in giving forth: what is it by receiving in?

It is such as concerns our neighbor, or our (...).

What say you of those who receive a false report against their neighbor?

That as they, who make it, have the devil in their tongue, so they, who
greedily receive it, have him in Ps. 15. 3. Pr. 17. 14. Act. 6. 13. and 7. 1.
Pr. 14. 15. and 25. 23.
their (...). And here we are forbidden, as not to raise a false report with
our tongues, so not to hold it up (being raised by others) with an easy ear:
that is, we are forbidden both to tell false tales, and believe them.

How may we receive a false report concerning our selves? Act. 12. 22. 23.
etc. and *. 2, 3. Pr. 31. 31. (...). 27. 5.


When we suffer our selves to be ^attered in that which is false: or to be set
down unjustly by envious tongues, thinking the worse of our selves for their
detracting from us.

So much for the thing forbidden: what is commanded?

To have a charitable opinion of 1. Cor. 4. 5. (...). 3. 17. Esa. 53. 9. Ps.
15. 2. Col. 4. 17. Leuit. 19. 17 3. loh. 12. 2. 2. Cor. 12. 11. 1. Cor. 15. 10.
our neighbor, to speak the truth with a good affection, and to a (...) end,
abhorring to lie, as we would to be or be accounted the Devils children. Also,
to speak lovingly of others, and modestly of our selves.

So much for the Commandments that concern all acts and purpose of unright
cousnesse: where are we forbidden all motions thereunto?

In the next last Commandment, Tenth Commandment.
which is: Thou shall not covet thy neighbors house, etc.

What do you observe therein?

The occasion, and matter.

What was the occasion? Genesis 6. 5. and 8. 21. Mat. 12. 34. and 15, 19. Job.
14. 4.


The frailty or ill disposition of our nature, declining from the rule of
Charity to our neighbor, and of Sobriety to our selves.

What do you observe in the Commandment it self?

The things forbidden and commanded.

What is forbidden?

The least and shortest thought or Romans 7. 7. Iam. 1. 14. (...). 4 14.
desire of the heart against our neighbor, tickling it to sin, though we
yield not to it. And, here all lus^s are forbidden, contrary to charity on our
neighbors behalf, and temperance on our own.

Of what sorts are these?

They are either original corruption, as it were the firebrand it self, or
the effects, as it were sparks that fly from it. And, these are our fond
wishings and wouldings, with other foolish thoughts of the mind, desires of the
heart, and deep (...) of the head about matters, tending to the impeachment of
our neighbors welfare, or of that virtue of contentedness which we should
affect, and labor for in that estate and place, wherein God has set us.

So much for that which is forbidden; what is commanded?

Being contented with our portion, 1. Tim. 6. 8. Psalm. 16. 6. 1. Cor. 16. 14.
3. John 2. Gal. 5. 16. 17.
we must dispose of all our thoughts and wishings according to charity; wishing
and delighting in our neighbors welfare, as in our own, and (...) against all
evil desires to the contrary, though of never so short continuance.

So much for the Commandments of duties to our neighbor in righteoufnesse:
what say you of Sobriety commanded to our selves?

This passes through every Commandment of the second Table, commanding
Humility in the (...), meekness in the (...), cleanenesse in the seventh,
contentation in the eight, charitable truth in the ninth, and pure desires in
the tenth Commandment.

So much for the Law: what is due to those that break it?

Punishments, more or less in this Gal. 3. 10. Deuteronomy. 37. 26.
life, and the wrath and curse of God to damnation, in the life to come: That
is, pains temporal by ^ments, and death, and pains eternal Mat. 25. 41.
of soul and body in hell.

What call you Hell?

That everlasting fire, or treasury Mar. 9. 45. 46.
of secret fire, prepared and kept in a Luke 16. 26.
place of the greatest distance from heaven, for the punishment of all ungodly
sinners.

Where is the place of hell?

God has not revealed. And, let us, that have the hope of ye Saints, rather
endeavor never to feel it then to know it. When a house is on fire, (...)
stand not to inquire how it came, but do our best to quench it.

Wherein consist the torments of this place of hell?

Generally, in these two punishments, of loss and sense.

What call you the punishment of loss?

An everlasting separation from God and Christ, which is a plague Luke 13. 28.
1. Sam. 4. 18, 21. 22. and 2 Samuel 14. 32.
of plagues, and the very bottom of the (...) of Gods wrath in full and per^
torments of soul and body, after Christ shall say to the wicked on his left
hand: Depart ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his
Angels: Math. 25. 41.

Why call you this separation from God, so great a plague and torment?

If the absence of the Sun cause darkness; what joy must needs be lacking,
and sorrow abound where the Sun and God of salvation shall never in the
beautiful beams of his presence be seen any more? where shall be no more
glimpses of favor, but dark tempests and snares upon all the ^nhabitants of
that land of (...)? and where they (...) so depart from God, (...), never to
(...) which made (...) to say, that the tears of hell were not (...) to (...)
of (...).

So Much for the punishment of loss: what is that of sense?

That when every member of the body, and (...) of the soul shall be Apoc. 9.
5. and 14, 10, 11. and 16. 8, 10. and 19. 20.
tormented together, (...) not for some thousands of years, and so an end; but
for thousands upon thousands, Mar. 9. 48. Math. 3. 12. Apoc. 10. 10
and thousands that (...) no end. For, as the righteous say of Gods mercy, that
his mercy endures for ever: so, of his justice the danmed may say, Psalm. 136.
1, 2, 3, 4. etc.
that his justice endures for ever.

What is this called in Scripture?

It has many names given to it, to Mark 9. 44, 47 Mat. 22. 13 and 25. 30.
show how terrible it is; and therefore it is called hell fire: the wo^me that
Apoc. 19. 20. and 20, 10, 14.
never dies: utter darkness: the burning lake, and second death.

What do you gather of this?

If a man would not, to gain the world, lie on a (...) of (...) wood for a
very short time; how much and (...) must the (...) needs suffer, who shall be
tormented in a lake of burning fire for ever? and, if a little disease in one
part, so trouble us upon a soft bed; how shall the wicked endure that worm of
unquiet conscience, that will, day and night (and not as a disease of some
short time) gnaw upon al parts of their (...), and powers of their tender mind;
and, not upon their pallats of ease, but beds of glowing fire?

How does the Scripture further, and for more terror speak of this place, and
the torments of hell?

By calling it a place prepared for Math. 25. 41
the devil and his angels.

What gather you of this?

That as it would be a grievous thing to a man to live a banished man's life in
some dark prison, covered with deadly obscurity, but more grievous to live there
among the most spiteful enemies of his father and fathers house: so to be cast
into a prison of eternal banishment from God, and pit of utter darkness, is a
most woeful thing; but it is much more woeful, not only to be so, but to be
bound in chains of perpetual fellowship with 1. Pet. 5. 8.
those, who (from the beginning have been enemies to man, and God, the father
of mankind, I mean the Devil, and all his unclean angels.

Show this (yet) a little further.

If Lots righteous soul was vered 2. Pet. 2. 7. 8.
so much, with the unclean conversation of the Sodomites, with whom he dwelt
but for a time: how shall they be vered in soul and body, that are thrust into
hell, that ever burning Sodom, where they must ever dwell with unclean spirits
and (...) devils; not to be brought out at last by the Angels, as Lot out of
Sodo^, but there to live (world without end) forcing out desperate voices and
cursings against their former filthy lives, and present unclean society?

Now where hell (thus described) is due to the breakers of the law, what do you
gather?

That, without repentance, all Idolaters, 2. Cor. 6. 9. 10. Ephesians. 5. 5 Iam. 5.
12. Exo. (...) 7. Number. 16. 33 Psalm. 106. 17 1. Cor. 6. 9. 10. Apoc. 21. and 22.
15.
customary and raging swearers, rebels to government, murderers by poison or
with weapons, fornicators, th^ues, liars, and (...) of lies must go thither.

And must Idolaters go to hol without repentance, what (then) must Idolaters do
to be saved?

They must (...) out of their (...) Deuteronomy. 6. 2.
(as an abommable thing) the ^ty of (...), and serve the true God by his Word.

What must customary and raging swearers do?

They that take up for a (...), the (...) of the Holy One, (...) that (if they
be (...) never so little in their (...)) they will provoke him in his glory;
and (if any thing go against hun) their tongues shall go as (...) against him,
either in their games or more earnest (...), must (for hereafter) (...) that
great and fearful name, the Lord their God. Deuteronomy. 28. 58.


How, further, do you persuade this duty?

Whatsoever is more then yea, yea, or nay, nay, to wit, by (...) Mat. 5. 37
Iam. 5. 12
or negation in common talk, is of e^, that is, of the (...): and as the root
of it is (...) (it being a plant of the Devils setting) so the (...) of it is
no better: for (...) is (...) or fruit of such raging mouths.

What must rebels to government do?

If they be children, they must not Genesis 9. 24, 25 Deuteronomy. 21. 18, 19, 20, 21.

they must do service (as to God) in lawful things, that is, cheerfully and
with faithfulness: and if they be subjects, they must fear the King, and
honor the Go^ that are sent by him.

What must Murderers do?

Gallants do) in blood.

What must Adulterers do?

What must thieves do?

How do you persuade this duty?

They that do not so, or do otherways, Habac. 2. 9.
covet an evil covetousness to their house. And a man were as good put a coal
of fire into the thatch of his house, or in his barnes, as bring stolen goods
to his other goods and stuff, better gotten. For, so many things as we get, by
stealth from our neighbor, so many curses we get to our selves, and lay up for
our posterity.

What must liars do?

Not only abhor to lie in (...) or Psalm. 15. 2. Ioh. 8. 44.
earnest; but, speak the truth from their heart; that is, with love, except
they would go to hell with the father of liars, the devil of hell.

But lying is become their trade?

But they that use the trade, shall not be (...) in it. For, they are of that
fellowship that shall be cast into the Lake of fire. And, they that love and
Apoc. 21. 8. and 22. 15.
make lies, are without; that is, out of heaven and far from salvation: having
no worthier persons for their Mates then dogs, ^chanters, (...) whoremongers,
idolaters, idolaters, and the like rabble of wicked sinners.

But what say you of merry lying?

There is no (...) found in Gods Tabernacle. And, if we must answer Matt. 12.
36.
for every idle word: how much more for every lying word?

What say you of the officious, which some call the good and necessary lie?

Necessity can no more privilege a man to lie, then it can warrant him to
steal. And, if we may not lie, to bring Romans 3. 7.
glory to God, shall we think we may lie to bring profit to man? Therefore the
distinction of lies into a malicious, officious, and merry lie, (as if any were
lawful) is not of Gods making. The Mat. 22. 20. 21.
superscription is Caesar's, and, it is not from heaven, but from Men.

What do you conclude of al together?

That, to do the good, and hate the evil, Amo. 5. 14, 15,
is the way to live, for, they that seek good and not evil, shall live, and
they that do these things, that is, which God has commanded to be done, shall
never Ps. 15. 5.
sall; or for ever, and into condemnation.

But who is sufficient for these things? And who (then) can be saved?

Indeed, it is not in man, nor in the best Elav (...) 6 (...). (...). 10. Iam.
3, 1 Gal. 3. 10. 24.
of men to continue in them: and (therefore) is the Law our Schoolmasters to
bring us to Christ. that is, so to humble us, that Christ may receive us.

What do you gather of this?

That by the often sight of our selves in the Law, we must be wained from al
opinion of our own doings, which are so Psa. 4. 1. Phil. 39. Romans (...). 3. 4.
1. Cor 1 30 (...) 23. 6.
short of perfection: and, (doing the best we can) depend only upon God in
Christ for perfect and meritorious obedience, placed wholly out of our selves in
him.

To what end (then) serves the Law?

To be the glass wherein to view our estate in every Commandment, that we may
see how poor and unable we are to do any thing worthy recompense or pardon:
and not to rest there, Mat. 3. 15. Ioh. 19. 30. Col. 2. 14. Romans 8 33. 34.
but to betake us by Faith to him, who has fulfilled all righteousness for
us, discharged with the pay of his Passion and obedience his Fathers
debt-(...), and brought us our full acquittance in his death, and rising from
death; that we might not dye but line.

Then, it is necessary that we do our best to keep the Law, though we
cannot be justified by it?

Yea verily, and that we often go James 1. 25.
to that counting-booke of God, the Law. For, when in the several sums and
parcels we shall find it impossible for us to pay such a debt; it will make us
to fall into a right ^koning of our own want and his worthiness, that has
released us from so great both debt and danger. And, this is Christ, Romans 7.
24. 25.
and only He: to whom be praise for ener,

Amen.
The like short exposition of the Lords Prayer, in Questions and Answers.
WHat is Prayer?

A religious calling upon Psalm 50. 15. ^remie 33. 3.
the name of GOD by Petition, or with praise.

What parts has Prayer?

Two, as Petition, and giving of 1. Tim. 2. 1. 1. These. 5. 17. 18 ^
Thanks.

What call you petition?

A faithful calling upon the name of Psa. 25. 1. and 4. 1 Pro. 30. 8. (...).
24 27. Ps. 25. 2. 3. Genesis 32. 11.
God by request, or with suite, to procure some good, or to prevent some evil.

What do you gather of this?

That God (only) is to be prayed unto, Psa 65. 2. and 44, 20. 21, Ier. 31. 18.
Romans 10. 14. Iam. 5. 15. Mat. 7. 7. Iam. 1. 17. (...) 43. 11. (...). (...). 4.
and in faith: also, that with him are the (...), both of opening all good to
us, and of shutting all evil from us.

So much for petition: what call you giving of thanks?

A (...) return of all our receipts Luke. 10. 21. 1. (...). 29 (...), 11, 12,
13, etc.
to God, with confession of his power in all, and praise for all.

What difference do you put between prayer and praise?

Prayer (...) what we want, and Luke 17. 13. 15 16. (...). 66. 19. 20
praise confesses what we have, and from whom.

What do you observe here?

When God opens his treasury, Psalm. 66. 19, 20.
we must open our mouths, that is, when he gives his blessings, we must both
acknowledge them, and be thankful for them; but so, as when he showreth
blessings to us, we do not drop thanks to him, that is, praise him flew^, when
he gives to us plenteously.

What is true thankfulness?

(...) the saying, but the giving of Matt. 21. 30. Luke 18. 11. Genesis 27. 22.
Psalm. 50. 23. Psa 116. 12 Ps. 146. 2. (...). 29 14. Ps. 81. 1, 10, and 103, 1.
hanks: and not thanks in word, but thankfulness in true obedience to the
Word: and, not cold thanks, but zealous from the heart, and faithful with a
single heart: and thanks in chee^ull manner, and with continuance, not
niggardly, and which has soon done.

Where have we the best pattern of prayer and praise?

In that absolute, most holy form of Mat. 6. 9. 10, etc. Luke 11. 2, 3, 4, etc.
prayer, which we (commonly) call the Lords prayer.

What do you observe therein?

The preface, and prayer itself.

What are the words of the preface! Mat 3 17. Col. 1. 13. Gal. 4. 4. Ioh. 1.
12. Gal. 4, 5, 6. Ps. 115. 3 and 11. 4. (...). 57. 15.


Our Father which art in Heaven: that is, thou that art ready to help us,
being the Father of Christ by Nature, and, in Christ, our (...) by Grace; and
art (not only ready) but able so to be, having thy dwelling in heaven, hear us.

What do these words teach?

To come to God only, and to come Ps. 103. 13. Ec. 4. 17 (...). 3. 5. (...).
28. (...) 17 Ec. 5. 1. (...). 23. 24. 1. (...). 8. 27
to him, as to a Father with boldness, and yet with reverence; because he is
in heaven, and his (...) the heaven.

What say you of the prayer it self?

It is in the several petitions, or confirmation of them.

What say you of the petitions?

They are such as belong to Gods glory, or our own necessities.

What are they that belong to Gods glory?

They are such as concern the advancement of his glory, or the means.

What petition concerns the advancement of his glory?

An Examination before our coming to the Lords Table.
WHat do you call the Sacrament of the Lords Supper?

Our growing up with Ephesians. 4. 15, 16 1. (...). 10. 16, Math. 26. 27.
Christ by faith, resembled in visible signe^, and effectual seals of bread
and wine.

In coming to this Sacrament, what is to be considered by every well prepared
Communicant?

The doctrine thereof, and our ends of coming to it.

What say you of the Doctrine?

It is seens in the nature of the signs which are made Sacraments, or in their
uses.

What say you of the nature of the signs?

Their nature is to be seals of the Mat. 26. 26, 28

faith.

Where have you the seal of Christ's body?

In the bread. Matthew. 26. 26


Where, of his blood?

In the Wine. Matthew. 26. 27


So much for the nature of the signs: what say you of their uses?

What is that concerns the bread?

It is that which is seen in the breaking and giving, or in the receiving and

for our spiritual nourishment.

What does the receiving of the bread signify?

hand of faith in our hearts, as we receive the bread with our bodily hands.

Who are reproved here?

The Papists, who say and believe Bellarm. Tom. 2. (...). (...). genesis de sacr.
Euch. (...) lib. (...). cap. 18. etc.
that the substance of the bread is turned into the natural body of Christ,
and that the people, carnally, receive and eat their Maker.

What say you against this gross opinion?

That a true natural body, such as Christ's is, cannot be in two places at
Math. 28. 6. and 26. 11. Heb. 10. 13 Acts 3. 21 1. These. 4. 16.
one and the same time, to wit, in heaven, and bodily in the Sacrament.

So much for receiving; what does the eating of the bread signify?

That as bread does nourish our temporal ^ohn 6. 54
and corporal life; so this is a Sacrament of our eternal nourishment in the
life to come, and of our spiritual, in this life of grace which we have here.

So much for the uses of the bread; what be they of the wine?

They be seen in the pouring out, and giving, or in the receiving and
drinking of it.

What does the pouring out of the wine signify?

The pouring of the ^oud out of his Mat. 26. 28 1. Cor. 11. 25
holy body for our sins.

What does the giving of the wine signify?

Our full nourishment in Christ offered, John 6. 55 Psalm. 104. 15
not in his body only, but in his saving blood.

What does this teach?

That the Papists did, and still do, 1. Cor. 11 25
with injurious sacrilege, detract from (...). (...). 2. tert. con. genesis lib.
4. cap. 22. de (...). etc.
our assurance and Gods goodness, one great help of our faith, by taking from
the common people the use of the Cup.

So much for giving: what does the receiving of the Wine signify?

That possession is taken of whole 1. Cor. 10. 16 Ioh. 6. 56.
Christ, while, after the receiving of the bread, we, by faith, open our
hearts, as 1. Cor. 10. 3. 4
vessels, to receive the trickling drops of his blood, that nothing be lost.

What does the drinking of, the wine signify?

The applying of the comforts of Galat. 6. 14 Phil. 3. 8, 9
Christ's passion to our drooping souls, as wine reioiceth the heart of man.

So much of the doctrine of the Sacrament: what say you of our ends of coming
to it?

They be before, or in our coming.

What is that which is before our coming?

Our end before our coming is, to Acts 8. 36 John, 7. 37, 38
satisfy the earnest destre that we have, or should have of receiving the
promises of God under seal.

What be the ends in our coming?

Such as testify gifts, or receipts.

What be our gifts?

Such as we give to Christ the (...), or to the Church his members.

What give you to Christ the Head?

A heart well examined concerning 1. Cor. 11. 28 (...) c 15 21 Mat. 8. 8
our estate before we come, and seriously meditating on Gods goodness in
Christ, and our own great unworthiness when we are come.

VV^at else?

An ^mble oblation of our selves, Romans 12. 1
souls and bodies to him, with thanksg^ at our departure.

(...) in stands the hearts exa^? 1 (...). 11. (...) 2. (...). (...). 5 (...)
22. 12 (...). (...). 2 (...). 1. 21 Heb. 13. (...)


In the ^xamining of our knowledge, (...), love, repentance, thankfulness, and
works of our particular callings.

What call you the examination of your knowledge?

Whether I have a competent measure 1. Cor. 11. 29
thereof to discern the Lords body, and truly to put difference between the
signs, and things signified.

What of your faith?

Whether I be in the faith; believing 2. Cor. 13 5 Math. 8. 13
that the death of Christ, as it is auail^ for all the (...), so it is
(particularly available for me.

What of your love?

Whether I be in charity with all Mat. 5. 44 Romans 12. 18
men, even with my very enemies, loving them unto, and for their true welfare;
and not my friends only.

What of your repentance? Psalm. 32. 5, 6. and 51. 3, 4, 5 Math. 3. 8


Whether I acknowledge my sins with a sorrowful and melting heart, and
unfeignedly purpose to depart from all practice of them (hereafter) by
amendment of life.

What of your thankfulness? Psalm. 116. 12 Luke 1. 74, 75 1. Pet. 2. 9


Whether I be ready to express it in my Christian conversation, and new life
for my redemption by Christ.

What of the works of your particular calling?

Whether with some greater measure Luke 3. 13, 14 (...). 4. 1, 2, 3 1. Cor. 7.
20 (...) 2. 10.
of obedience, and better of better conscience, in all patience and good
faithfulness, I walk, or do truly purpose to walk therein, to mine own
great peace, and the benefit of those to whom God has joined me.

So much for that which you give to Christ the Head, what give you to the
Church his members?

A fellow* stone in the spiritual building; 1. Cor. 10. 17 and 12. 13, 14 Ephesians.
2. 21, 22 (...). 4. 12, 16.
that is, a member to help to make perfect the body of Christ.

What does this teach?

That they that are negligent or profane comers to the Lords Table, do
detract from the per^ion of Christ's body, and sever themselves from the society
of his Church.

So much for our gifts: what do we receive at the Lords Table?

That, which we receive there, concerns our selves alone, or our selves with
others.

What is that, that concerns our selves alone?

The strengthening of our faith and 1. Cor. 11. 24. and 10. 16. 17.
memory by the reverent and right use of that holy action.

How is our faith strengthened, and (...) ^olpen by it?

(...) ^ing that in the Sacrament, 1. Cor. 11. 26 (...). 3. 1. and 1. Ioh. 1. 1.
which (...) but hear of in the Word, namely, the par^cular offering and
receiving of Christ in his body and saving blood, by all bele^ing Communicants.

So much (...) that which concerns our selue^ alone: what is that that
concerns our selves with others.

It concerns our growing up with Christ, and our communion with our breth^en.

How do we receive our growing up (...) Christ?

We receive it with Christ by spiritual 1. Cor. 10. 3, 4
eating and drinking, and by a more full partaking with him and his graces,
through faith increased, and that use (...) his ^dinance blessed unto us.

How do we receive our communion with our brethren?

By (...) our mutual agreement, 1. Cor. 10. 17
in as much as we eat (all) of one bread, and drink (all) of one Cup.

How else?

By feeding all of the same food 1. Cor. 10. 4. and 12, 13.
bodily and spiritually, and by drawing all life from the same fountain; as
the (...). 4. 15.
life of grace which here we receive, and the l^fe of glory, which, in heaven
we shall be partakers of.

Amen.
So much for our examination before the Sacrament.

(...). 23. 1. (...) with a Ruler* (...) thee.
A short Direction for spending of time well.
HOw do you divide the days of man's life?

Into the days of labor, and daves of holiness.

What say you of the days of labor?

These concern the works of our calling, or works of help unto them.

What be the works of our calling?

The works of that trade of life, in 1. (...). (...). (...). 4. 1
which God has placed us.

What must a man do in these?

By offering them to God, he must ^
walk in them neither slackly nor deceitfully, but with Christian diligence
and good conscience; following his own business with quietness, and walking
with God.

Then, every one must have some special call^g and trade of life to live in?

(...), or he is no sound member ^
of the Christian common wealth, (...) a rotten member in the body of the same,
that deserves a cutting off.

So much for the works of our callings: what say you of the works of help
unto them?

They concern duties to be done before the work, or that day after.

What must we do in the morning before our work?

Praise God for his mercy the night Psalm. 59. 16. and 88. 13.
past, and pray unto him for his further mercy and blessing the day present.
Genesis 24. 12.


How shall we praise God? (...). 5. 20 Colos. 1. 10.


By giving him thanks, and by showing our thankfulness.

How is our thankfulness showed?

Inwardly, or outwardly.

How inwardly?

By pleasing God in our understanding, Pro. 23. 26 Col. 1. 10.
thoughts, desire, affections, and ^ill.

How outwardly?

By pleasing him in our words and deeds.

How in our words? Col. 4. 6. (...). 4. 29.


When they be gracious always.

What things hurt this grace of speech?

Lying, swearing, brawling, ^lthie speaking, foolish talking, (...) that Ephesians.
4. 25 Iam. 5. 12 (...). 4. (...). and (...). Col. 38 Pro. 26. 21
is not comely, and contention that causes stri^.

How in our deeds?

These are in the duties of our general Romans 12. 4
callings, as we are Christians: or our particular trades of life; wherein,
some are Magistrates, some Masters and servants, some Merchants, Artificers,
Husbandmen, and the like.

What are our duties as we be Christians? Acts 24. (...)


These concern God or man.

What are they that concern God?

They are in the four Commandments Tit. 2. 12
of the first Table, called godliness.

What are they that concern man?

They concern our selves, or our Tit. 2. 12
neighbor.

What is that that concerns our selves?

Sobriety, which is inward; and Romans 12. 13.
teaches us not to presume above that which is meet: and outward in our
apparel, diet, outward members and senses.

What must our apparel be?

Such as becomes those that profess 1. Tim. 2. (...)
the fear of God.

What call you sobriety in diet?

That grace of temperance that consi^eth Luke (...). 34 Romans 13. 13 1. These. 5.
16.
in the moderate use of meats, drinks, sleep, and such outward things.

What sobriety is that, which you call sobriety of sense, and the outward
members?

Sobriety of sense is a watchfulnes 1. Tim. 4. 16. Ioh. 31. 1 1. Cor. 6. 15.
in it; and sobriety of the members, a chastity in them.

So much for the general d^ety that concerns our selves, called sobriety:
what is that that concerns our neighbor?

It is contained in the six last Commandments, Romans 13, 7, 9 Mat. 19. 18, 19
Titus 2. 12.
being Commandments of the second Table, called Righteousness.

So much for our general duties, as we be Christians; what say you of our
particular duties, or duties of trade of life?

These reach unto all callings in the Church and Commonwealth: but to our
purpose, in a family, they concern the Husband or Wife, Parents or their
Children, the Master and his Servants.

What is the Husbands duty?

To dwell with his wife, as a man of knowledge, by instructing her, and by 1.
Pot. 3. 7 Ephesians. 5. 28, 29
observing (for her better encouragement) the good parts that are in her, and
to love her as his own ^esh.

What is the wives duty? Genesis 2. 18 1. Pet. 3. 2 Ephesians. 5. 22, 24


To help her husband in the duties of the family: also, to fear, and to be
subject to him.

What be the Parents duties?

They concern the father and niether jointly, or by themselves.

What be their joint duties to their children?

In their tender years they must instruct Pro. 22. 6 Ephesians. 6. 4 Prou. 23. 13
Genesis 4. 2 1. Col. 7. (...). 37 2. Col. 12. 14 1 Col. 7. 39.
them plainly, and season them with good things, young, giving them due
correction; and at more years fit them for some honest calling; and when time
serves, laying up something for them, give them in marriage only in the Lord.

So much for the Parents joint duties: what is the Fathers more special duty?

To provide for his children; and specially 1. Tim. 5. 8
to have a special eye to the sons of his house, as the Mother must to her
daughters.

What is the Mothers special duty?

To nurse up her children, if God Genesis 21. 7. 1. Tim. 5. 10.
have given her ability thereunto.

What be the childrens duties?

They be such as they owe to their Parents, or one to another.

What duties do they owe to their Parents?

They owe them reverence in their ^euit. 19. 3. ^phes. 6 1. 1. Tim. 5 4 Genesis
47. 12.
hearts, obedience in their deeds; and, when their parents shall be in years
and ^de, it is their duty (if they have wherewith) to nourish them.

What duties do they owe one to another? Psalm 133. 1 Genesis 45. 24.


To love as brethren, and not to fall out.

What duties do Masters owe?

They concern Religion; and so they must help them to God by their
instruction, Genes. 18. 19. Coloss. 4. 1. 1. Tim. 5. 8. Prou. 31. 15.
and the care of their souls: or they respect their life here; and so paying
them their wages justly, they must make honest provision for them.

What duties do servants owe?

In singleness of heart, and all good Ephesians. 6. 6. Tit. 2. 9, 14, 1. Pet. 2.
18.
faithfulness, they must do their masters work, be true unto him, and seek to
please him, though he be froward.

So much for our thankfulness to God, expressed in our words and deeds, and for
our duties the morning before our work in prayer and praises: what duties do
we owe that day after?

They be duties, such as are between or after our work at night.

What must we do between our work?

It concerns our refreshings, or recreation.

What must we do at our refreshings?

Pray before meat for Gods blessing, give thanks, after, for Gods blessings, 1.
Tim. 4, 4, 5. Colos. 3. 17. Cor. (...). 31. Mat. 26. (...). (...) 10. (...).
(...) 21. (...). 32. 6.
using the same for strength or honest delight, and, no way for excess, or
drunkenness.

What must we observe in our recreation?

That our company be good, and ^phes. 5 7. 11. (...) 4. 8 These. 5. 22. phesi.
5. 16.
sports of good report, remembering that (...) must be redeemed.

When be our sports of good report?

When they be lawful for the nature ^om. 14. 16. Co^. 6. 12. (...), 3, 2 These.
5. 16,
of them, and necessary for the use, not hindering better duties.

So much for the duties as are between our work: what must we do after it?

Examine our selves, as upon an account, what we have done the day past;
Jeremy 8. 6. Psalm. 4. 4. 8.
and prepare our sleep, that it may be comfortable.

How shall we by such preparation make our sleep comfortable?

By committing our selves to God, 1. Pet. 4 19. Ps. 4, 8, and 55, 16, 17, and
121, 4, 5, 7, 2. These. 3. 3.
souls and bodies, praying him to inspire the soul with good thoughts, and to
watch the body till the morning, that no hurtful thing break in upon it.

But some go to bed without prayer?

Such sleep in Satan's lap, and have him for their keeper: who (therefore)
makes a thorow-fare in the thoughts of their heart, sowing the tares of many
unclean c^cupiscenses and lusts therein, Mat. 13. 25. 26.
which sown in the night, grow in ye day

What reason can you give to prove the necessity of prayer, before we go to
rest?

That night (for ought we know) may be our long night, and that sleep our
last sleep. Which if it be, (and the Lord has sealed no warrant to any that
it shall not be) must needs bring small hope to our vnpraying soul, that it
shall be glorified, and as little comfort to our body, (laid down in so brutish
forgetfulness) that it shall go to God at our next rising.

What do you conclude of this?

That those Masters are cruel to their servants, who suffer them to go to their
beds, as wild beasts to their dens, without Psalm. 19. 5.
prayer, and do not better arm them against the fear of the night.

So much for the days of labor: what say you of the days of holiness?

On Gods Sabbaths, we must (first) Mark 1. 35. Exodus 20. 8.
pray God to bless the duties of them, and so keep them holy.

How must we keep them holy?

By doing as little worldly work as sa. 58. 13. (...) 48. (...). ^eut. 5. 12.
may be, and by doing Gods work religiously, and with all our might.

In doing of Gods work, what is to be considered?

That we do the works that sanctiu^e the Sabbath, and avoid the unfruitful
works that defile it.

What works are required to the ^ifying of the Sabbath?

To prevent or defer, and by rising early (...) 16. 23. Psa. (...). 1, 2, and
92, (...). 1. 5. (...). 1 Ephe. 6. 19. (...). 4, 17. (...). 84. (...), Acts 10
33 (...), 15, and 20. 7. and 16, 14 Deuteronomy. 11. 18.
to dispatch all businesses that would profane it; and, by praying God, to
bless his own ordinances, to come with a spiritual and forward mind to
public prayer, preaching and Sacraments.

What other works are required?

It is required further, before we come to the assembly, that we pray, read,
or hear some what read at home that may edify; between the times of Luke. 24.
14. Deuteronomy. 6. 7.
public exercise, that we meditate on that which has been delivered; and
after and between that we talk with others, and examine our selves about it.

What is (lastly) required? Ps. 92. 5. Romans 19, 20. Ps. 9, 1. Acts 17. 11.
Ios. 1. 8. Cant. 8. 13 Ps. 14. 4. Apo. 1 3. 10. Deu. 17. 19. Ps. 92. in the
title, Col. 3. 16 Ephesi. 5. 19. 1. Cor. 16. 2. Eccles. 7. 15 Ps. 92. 2. Ex. 32
6. 1. Cor. 11. 21 Isa. 58. 13. Exo. 20. 10. Isay 29. 13.


That we take a view of God in his works and word, pray, and read, an^ sing
Psalms privately; do works of mercy; and consider Gods special works, of
mercy, justice, goodness and truth.

So much for the works to be done: what are the unfruitful works to be
avoided?

The spending of the day in sleep, play, drinking, worldly talk or business,
^oolish communication, and things that separate from God by a carnal heart.

Glory be to God.
