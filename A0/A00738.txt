TO THE QVEENE.
MADAME,
OVt of a Civil regard and special care not to wrong Strangers, I have
attempted to furnish these Foreign Compositions with afortune equal to what
they had at Home. Courtiers they were borne, (as being begot of purpose to
serve in those Chambers where your Majesty had your high Beginning) and, in
that Quality, have bee'n committed, by their first Publishers, to the Tutelarie
Shadow of the most Crowned Branches of your thrice-Christian Stem. My wishes
are that they may not suffer in their Condition by means of my good Opinion of
them, which has made me Study to make them Denisons of mine own Country.
And therefore, to preserve them in their first Degree and Safety, I have
thought meet to Arm them with the Maiesticke Patronage of a Queen of their
former Acquaintance, and of a fortune somewhat resembling their own; who
having nobly Favored them in the time of their greatest Security amongst
their Natural and Potent friends at home, will, as is humbly hoped, resolutely
undertake to Protect them now, in the time of Need, from the Affronts and
Dangers incident to the life of Aliens, and vouchsafe them (being now as it we
Naturalized for her own Subjects, and taught the Language wherein by her
nearest People she is prayed for) a more Princely measure of Countenance and
Affection, then formerly, when she could not call them hers by so Sovereign an
interest. Herein, Sacred Lady, if it may please you, in their behalf, to
Seal with an indulgent Eye the Grant of this my first Court-sute, they shall
be so far from needing to envy the Domesticke Estate of their more
incommunicable Kindred left behind them, that rather it may be presaged that
the fame of their new happiness here abroad, will awake and stir up some of
the great Remnant of their Courtly Race to crave the Conduct of some second and
more able Guide to put them in the way for the like Outlandish Adventure. This,
and greater Miracles, your Grace may easily effect with the least Musical
Honor daigned at any time by your incomparable Voice unto these your
first-Deuoted. The most harmonious Rectour of the immortal Quire instruct and
perfect your Highness for the bearing of a Celestial Part in the everlasting
Hallelu- IAH. So prays,

Madame, YOUR MAJESTY'S Thrice-humble, and thrice-obedient Subject EDWARD
FILMER.

THE PREFACE.
THough, in the highest times of the most Imperial City of the World,
Literature and Music were counted the two Mental Touchstones of a Gentleman
(for Wrestling was held but a Corporal one, and therefore, by the Comicke
reciting the parts fit for a Gentleman, put in the last place: Fac periculum in
Literis, in Musicis, in Palaestra) yet sole Scholar or Musician, unless
elevated by Academicall Degrees, are held now but Low and Illiberall
Conditions. So that a Nihilegregie, or a Nequid nimis is that which preserues
such, as are hereunto addicted, in a freedom requisite to Gentilitie, which
ought to be Slave neither to Book nor Fiddle. Far therefore from a desire
of testifying that my endeavors in these kinds have soared above the pitch of
mediocritie, I here expose to the users of my Natural Tongue this small
Labor, as whereby may only be discovered a Gentle tincture of my mind in
either, but a Deep die in neither of the forenamed Qualities. For, touching
the Musical part of this Book, I have only exercised my Iudicatiue strength
in the Choice and Collection of the Aires, which is not sufficient to raise on
a man the surname of Musician: and, for the Literature or Poetry of the
Ditties, I have no more then new-colour'd their Form, by changing their
Language, I have not invented the subject, or Made the matter; wherein consists
the maine Essence of a Poet, as being the Work from whence he receives more
properly his Denomination (...) t Poien, then from the Making of a Verse. In so
much that he that traceth a Chronicle sincerely, without any fabulous mixture,
may rather be called a Versifying Historian, then a Poet; as not sufficiently
shaping himself to the fashion of the great and ancient Masters of the Art,
that first set-vp the name of Poet. -- Pictoribus atque Poetis Quidlibet
audendi semper fuit aequa potestas; neither of them being tied to the Pattern
of Truth, but left free to the Reach of Invention. Nor do I here labor to
shift-of, as ignominious, the graceful Titles of Poet or Musician, which
Persons far higher then my self have accepted-of as Ornaments to their other
Merits; my purpose being only to acknowledge, that my sparing diligences and
few retired hours employed these Ways have in no wise effected, that I may,
without vanity, either sue for, or admit-of these Names, that I unfeignedly
gratulate to such as have purchased them with Surpassing Desert. -- mediocribus
esse Poetis Non homines, non Dij, non concessere columnae.

Now, for the Work its self, whereunto the Muses have bee'n assistant with
their double Skill (which the two-topp'd Mountain they inhabit may be thought
to point-at) I mean Music and Poetry, as I confess that I have bee'n,
generally, more taken with the Musical part then the Poetical; so I
acknowledge to have tied my self more strictly to the presentation thereof
(without swaruing from the first published Copy either in flourish or
substance) then of the Other; wherein I have, sometime, suffered as well my
Fant'sie as Reason to thrust me a little from a punctual insisting in the
Steps of the Original: upon what Motives (or peradventure Necessity) I leave
to the likely conjectures of the judicious Comparer to find-out; having held it
more workemanlike, upon well-taken occasions, by a justifiable varying from the
Phrase, without loss of the Plot and Scope of the Author, so to translate,
that the Translater may be said to have some little share in the Apparel and
Dress, though not in the Body, of the work, then (with a Schoole-boyes
resolution) to dare to aim no further then at such an interpretation, as may
render the most exact account, that may be, of the Syntax of the Original.
Indeed, where Poems are chosen to be translated for no other respect then for
their own eminent and known worth, it can savor of no less then presuming
self-conceit to strain, with new Flashes, to outshine the primitive Beams
of the Original; or to intimate a waterish vnsauorinesse in the translated
Matter, by sprinkling the Translation with frequent Grains of the Translaters
peculiar Salt. But, where Lines are not so much turned into another Language
for their own, as for the Musickes sake that they belong-to and (in a manner)
serve, I cannot absolutely conclude, but that the Translat^^ may, without the
blot of insolence, carry himself with a Looser regard to those Pieces of his
Pattern that he shall judge himself least Obliged unto. -- and, quae
Desperate tractata nitescere posse, relinquit.

Now, because translated Ditties and Originals differ chiefly in this
Preposterous Point, that, whereas the Musical Notes are fitted to the
Originals, the Translations are, contrarily, to be fitted to the Musical
Notes, I have bee'n forced, by this new Task, for the more even Accord with
the Music, in diverse Aires, to alter the Natural first Cast of the Verse,
and to ordain, in the proper place of an Iambicke Foot, a dissonant
Trochaicke, as more suitable to the nature of the Note. For this cause, when the
most busy Examiners shall, in some of the Ditties, find here and there
Iambicke Meeters that seem to faulter in their Pace, through the unlawful
frequencie of Trochaicke Motions, let them forbear Censure, till they have
tried them with the Stream of the Air or Note; which, though it were
blamelesly enough by the Composer adapted to the French Verse, yet, now and
then, falls out to make a Current English Verse of the same Numbers to run, as
it were, against the Biasse. The reason is, because the French syllables, as
well in Verse as Prose, are pronounced with a more Continued Equality of
sound, then ours. For that Tongue admits seldom of any Tones or Intentions of
the Voice (by Grammatians called Accents) unless at the End of the Clause, or
in the penultims of words ending in their c foeminine. And this their
Mother-pronunciation they often apply even to the Latin, and other acquired
Tongues. From whence it is not unlikely, that some of them, having bee'n
admonished by Strangers of this their Unruliness, have not stuck to maintain
their dysprosodia (that I may so call it) or immodulation of the severely
governed Syllables of the Latin: as may appear by that grauely-accented or
rather vnaccented and indistinguish'd Piece fathered upon them
Nos-Galli-non-curamus-quantitatem-syllabarum; erroneously thinking that way of
Pronunciation to be Common to Other Tongues, which seems Proper to their Own;
the Nerves of whose Syllables (in Singing)-neither Crampe of unnatural
correption, nor Rack of unusual production can much Torture. Hence therefore
it proceeds, that the French, when they Compose to a Dittie in their own
Language, being led rather by their free Fant'sie of Air (wherein many of them
do naturally excel) then by any Strict and Artificial scanning of the Line,
by which they Build, do often, by disproportioned Musical Quantities, inuert
the natural Stroke of a Verse, applying to the place of an Iambicke Foot, such
Modulation as Iumps rather with a Trochay. And this without much violence to
their Poems, since the Disorder and Confusion of metricall Feet in their Verse
is as Inoffensiue as Indiscernible, by reason, as is aforesaid, of the Even
Pronunciation of Their Tongue: whereas Ours, more frequent and lively in
Accenting all polysyllables, bewrayes presently to the Ear, by Our best
Measure, the Accent, the Contrariety between the Trochay and the Iambicke.
Now therefore, when the Note, fitted for a Trochay in French, lights upon an
Iambicke in English, it strangely Wrests the relucting Syllables from their
genuine Pronunciation, and changes the Friendly and Equal Conspiring, that
ought to be between Word and Tune, into Injurious Contradiction; which
unseemly Variance often breaks forth into so loud a Cacophonie, that,
thereby, the one seems to do no less then Revile the other. In respect
whereof, the intent of this Book being more to please the Judicious Hearer of
the Tunes, then the Critical Reader of the Lines, I have chosen rather,
wittingly, to tolerate a little roughness in the Fluencie of some of the
Verses, thereby the less to disrellish the Music, then, by an ouercurious
straining to please in that Part of the work that concerns my self, neglect
the better Part, the praise whereof I am far from color of pretending the
least Right unto. Yet herein also I dare not avouch to have bee'n so anxious an
Obseruer of the Laws of the Note in all places, as to distemper the Verse upon
every slight Beck thereof, but, where I have thought the Lightness of the
dissonancie might the most easily be Digested by Good Ears, I have sometimes
permitted the Meeters to March forward with their most decent Steps, without
Respect or Obcisance to the Musical Measure discovered in the Face of the
Note, to the end that the Poetical Reader might find the less whereat to Trip
or be Offended; having endeavored, in this Doubtful and Distracting Case, to
make the Work as little Scandalous as I could, either to the Grammatical or
Musical Pervser.

In conclusion; that I may not too much Disproportion this small Building, by
making the Porch of Preface too Big to correspond with the Little Rooms
within, my moderate desires are, that my Home hearted vnaffectating
Countrie-men, Favorers and Practizers of Music, would courteously entertain
this Recopilation as a Work naturalized chiefly for their sakes; and, whereas
our Tailors Shops and Dancing-schooles have bee'n so employed in French
Imitations, that our more deserving Masters of Music might sometimes, for
pleasing Novelties sake, daigne to repair hither for Life of Air worthy of
their more noble Arts Emulation. And, as for some Rouing Spirits, whose
Transitory View of France may have magnified them with the Scumme only and
Froathie top of the French Tongue, without diuing into the substantial Depth
by a more piercing diligence therein, I am patiently provided to hear them
Counterblast these my Endeauours with this Airie Position: That it is
impossible that any Words but French should ever Become the Loouer Aires
(though they themselves, besides understanding them but to halues, pronounce
them to a natural French Ear as Misbecomingly as ever Crude Forrainer was
heard to sing an English Ballet) such is the aptness of halfe-digested
Novelty to breed in the Stomachs of our young Countrie-men a Queasie despising
of the, almost-matchlesse, Abilities of their own Language. But, because I
have learned among People of sound Tastes, that, Contra Gustos no ay que
disputar, There is no disputing against Tastes, I will abstain to play the
ignorant Logician by attempting to raise Arguments on a Theme held Improbable;
but rather, somewhat to gratify their depraved Palates, have annexed the
French Ditties in the end of the Book; by the same means testifying, to the
skillful in both Tongues, my integrity (as far as is formerly professed) in
their Translations. Having hazarded to break the ice to abler pens, whose
happier faculty in this kind may hereafter incite them, with some more rich
English lining of other French pieces of this Musical stuff, to venture-for
and win the applause of my indegenerating Countriemen. Whose present
acceptance of the homely thread here prepared to measure these first withal,
shall fortify me against the future assaults of repentance.

E. F.

To the Musical Vser of this Book.
NOte that the usual English measure of Songs (which is commonly by Sembriefs
or Minoms) cannot be applied to diverse of the French Aires. Where therefore
you shall find an odd Crotchet in the Air, measure the whole Air by
Crotchets; and, where an odd Minom, by Minoms. Note also that the Tablature to
each Air has not bee'n set by the Author of the Air, but some of them by
Gabriel Bataille, a Frenchman likewise. I have therefore put his name to those
Lute-parts that were not Composed by the Authors themsealues of the Aires, to
the intent that each man may be duly reputed-of according to his Deserving.
The single Letter before the beginning of the Lute-part gives the Tune that the
singing Part, which is over it, begins-in. In those Aires, whose strains are
to be sung twice over, you shall find the ending Note to be twice set down.
Observe therefore that if, in this case, the first strain be to be repeated,
you sing, the first time, the first of these Notes only; and, the second, the
second only; but, in the repetition of the last strain, you must, contrarily,
sing the last Note (that stands without the bar) first, and that, which
stands within the bar with the mark of Conclusion over the head, last. Other
things (as namely the change of Time shown by Arithmeticall figures, or
whatsoever else may seem new) I suppose that such, as have attained but to a
mediocritie of Skill in Music, will, of themsealues, quickly conceive.

To my worthy Friend, Master Edward Filmer, on his Work published.
WHat charming Peales are these,
That, while they bind the senses, do so please?
They are the Mariage-rites
Of two, the choicest Pair of Man's delights,
Music and Poesy:
French Air and English Verse here Wedded lie.
Who did this Knot compose,
Again has brought the Lilly to the Rose;
And, with their Chained dance,
Recelebrates the joyful Match with France.
They are a School to win
The fair French Daughter to learn English in;
And, graced with her song,
To make the Language sweet upon her tongue.

COMPLAINTE.

Las! pourquoy ne suisje nee.
^WHy, alas! cri'd-out my Mother, To break my peaceful sleep of Innocence?
And drew the cortin, that did smother Mine Eyes from Lights of -- fence?

Since 'twas Light begat the Burning
Whereof mine Eyes, now great, in labor are:
But Fire, in the birth, to Water turning,
Is prodigy of war.
Thus, whilst tears not cure but threaten,
Loves painful growth, now at the fatal hight,
From Hopes bar, after long plea, beaten,
Appeals to Death for right.
For suspicious Enuies canker
So poisons the red fountain of my veins,
That all my blood is turned ranker,
Then that which Ulcer stains.
You! rich marks of Natures favor,
(Which for my Youths grace, she from Heaven steals)
Shall all your sweets but serve to savor
Time and Diseases meals?
What avail my banks of Roses,
Whose blushes make my Wooers red with fire,
If, forced to wound with sharp opposes,
I prove to them all-Bry'r?
Though my Thoughts delight to houer,
With sindged wings, about Philanders flame,
Yet Fear constrains me to cover
Loves fire with Vesta's name.
If my Triumphs be forbidden,
Why fought my Beauties to subdue his Heart?
What praise get Eyes for valor, hidden,
Whilst Tongue plays cowards part?
Thus, though walled from Sea of pleasure,
Yet this small Current through the sluice does crowd;
That MY AFFECTIONS TONGVED MEASVRE
IN SILENCE SPEAKS ALOWD.
Hence it is, that he delights,
With equal warm'th, to keep life in my heat:
And, in gold-weight of love, requiteth
Much faith with troth as great.
Yet, thus tempted with Loves plenty,
We, hungry, dare not feed, but with our eyes;
Eyes watched with eyes of more then twenty
Sworn centuries of spies.
Friend! whose Ears this plaint shall swallow
Down to thy Heart (that way to cause a tear)
If thou look pale to see me sallow,
Vpbraid not Love but Fear.

See! where young Morn begins to enter:
What early wings have late bee'n lent her!
Some sleeplesse rival may have sent her,
Us to betray:
Hastily kiss then, to prevent her,
And get-vp quickly; for it is day.
My fear would feign from hence expel thee,
Before this traytresse Light do sell thee
To Shame: then think not much I tell thee
Of thy delay;
With a kiss since I must compel thee
To get-vp quickly; for it is day.
My scruple ought not to be blamed:
Love, by this blow, is no whit lamed:
Stopped flame does rather, more untamed,
Rage then decay:
With a kiss fairly then be framed
To get-vp quickly; for it is day.
Syluia! what news is this does daunt me?
(Quoth Shepherd) Can thou so much scant me
Of joy, because the Sun does haunt me
With jealous ray?
But a kiss only will thou grant me
To get-vp quickly now it is day?
His flash, the Worlds beloved wunder,
(To us like messenger of thunder)
Does blast Loves arm, and part asunder
His sweetest fray;
With thy kiss (though but entered yunder)
Tempting grow'n Flame to fly young Day.
Since then to part I find concerning
Now thy advice has taught me learning,
I will, to show my sealfe discerning,
Rather then stay,
Take a kiss in pay of loves earning,
And so, farewell; because it is day.

ADorable Princess,
Il est temps que je cesse,
De courir da^s les Cieux
Et que ma flame cede
Le rang qu'elle y possede,
Aux flames de tes yeux.
O Beauty sans exemple,
Ou nature contemple
Son pouuoir nom pareil:
De puis l'heure premiere
Que je vis ta lumiere,
Ie ne suis plus Soleil.
Ton oeil qui me surmonte,
Me done tant de honte
Lors que je fais mon course,
Que pleust a la fortune
Que les flots de Neptune
Me conurissent toujours.
Ma course vagabonde
En quel que part du monde
Qu'elle eclaire aux humains,
Ne void rien qui n'admire,
En l'heur de ton Empire,
L'adresse de tes mains.
Tes conseils, and tes veilles
Ont par tant de merueilles
Ses malheurs abatus,
Que les chansons des Anges
N'auront pas des louanges
Dignes de tes vertus.
Ta prudence a des charms
Quifont tomber les arms
Des mains des plus grands Roys,
Et mettent dans les bouches
Des gens les plus farouches
La gloire de tes loix.
Tu fais voir a cetage
De la Seine and du Tage
Les discors termines,
Et montres a la Guerre
Au center de la Terre
Ses Demons enchaines.
L'art de la flattery
Aux graces de Marie
Ne put rien adjouster:
Sa gloire s'est haussee
Ou l'humaine pensee
Tasche en vain de monter.
O Dieux! en qui la France
A loge l'esperance
De sa felicite,
Iamais vostre largess
Ne mit tant de sagesse
Auec tant de beauty.
Facent vos destinees
Que le course des annees
Quine pardonne a rien,
Ace parfait visage
N'oste point l'auantage
Qu'il a dessus le mien.
II.
EN fin la voyci, nous voyons ces beaux yeux,
L'amour de la Terre and des Cieux:
Don't nostre Mars, en son choix bien-heureux,
Est si fort amoureux.
Le Ciel n'a jamais joint a tant de beauty
Vne si douce Majeste,
Qui dans les coeurs inspire tour a tour
Le respect and l'amour.
En fin les voyci, nos voeux sont accomplis,
Nos esprits d'aises remplis.
Puisse en tous deux par un heureux destin
Viure un amor sans fin,
III.
QVe n'estes vous lassees
Mes tristes pensees
De troubler ma raison?
Et fair auecque blame
Rebeller mon ame
Contre sa guarison.
Que ne cessent mes larmes
Inutiles arms,
Et que n'oste des Cieux
La fatalle ordonnance
A ma souuenance,
Ce qu'elle oste a mes yeux?
O beauty nompareille!
Ma chere merueille,
Que le rigoureux sort
Don't vous m'estes rauie
Aymeroit ma vie
S'il m'enuoyoit la mort.
Quelle point de rage
Ne sent mon courage
De voir que le danger
En vos ans les plus tendres
Menasse vos cendres
D'vn cercueil estranger.
Ie m'impose silence
En la violence
Que me fait ce malheur:
Mais j'acrois mon martire,
Et n'oserrien dire
M'est douleur sur douleur.
Aussi suis-je un squellette,
Et la violettte,
Qu' un froid horse de saison
Et le sec a flestrie,
Ama peau meurtrie
Est la comparaison.
Dieux! queles destinees
Les plus obstinees
Tournent de malen bien!
Apres tant de tempests,
Mes justes requests
N'obtiendront else rien?
Aues-vous eu les tiltres
D'absolus arbitres
De l'estat des mortels,
Pour estre inexorables
Quand les miserables
Implorent vos authels?
Mon soin n'est point de fair
En l'autre Emisphere
Voir mes acts guerriers,
Et jusqu'au board de l'onde
Ou finit le monde,
Aquerir des lauriers.
Deux beaux yeux (...)
Pour qui je soupire,
Sans eux rien ne m'est doux:
Donnes moy certejoye
Que jeles reuoye,
Ie suis dieu comme vous.
IIII.
O! Grands dieux que de charms,
Amoureuses arms,
De feux and de dards.
Que d'astres propices,
Que de delices,
Et doux regards.
Donc pour nous mieux conduire
Le Ciel fait reluire
Des feux nompareils:
Et nos pas timides
Ont pour leurs guides
Deux grands soleils.
Quittons la pourmenade,
Cette serenade,
Et nos Luths charmants:
La nuit solitaire
Se rend trop claire,
Pour des amants.
Puis la rare merueille,
Cause nompareille
De tous nos souhaits,
Commence a paroistre
A la fenestre
De son Palais.
Beautes, par qui les ames
Ont de viues flames,
Bruslant nuit and jour:
Fauorises belle
L'offre nouuelle
De nostre amor.
V
QVel espoir de guarir
Puis-je auoir sans mourir,
D'vn amoureux martire,
Que je puis bien souffrir, mais que je n'ose dire?
Quel moyen de celer,
Et mourir sans parler
D'vn amoureux martire,
Que je puis bien souffrir, mais que je n'ose dire?
Si la mort seulement
Peut guarir mon tourment,
Et l'amoureux martire
Que je puis bien souffrir, mais que je n'ose dire.
Toute-fois il le faut,
Le subjet est trophaut
De mon cruel martire
Qui m'apprend a souffrir, mais non pas a le dire.
VI.
OV luis-tu Soleil de mon ame?
Ou luis-tu flambeau de mes yeux?
Oubliras tu toujours les cieux?
Et au sein de Thetis ta flame?
Or que mon beau Soleil ne luit,
Le jour ne m'est plus qu'une nuit.
Sortez donc mon Phoebus de l'onde,
Et me redonnez un beau jour:
Sans vous ma vie and mon amor
Ne peut voir, ni viure en ce monde.
Or que mon.
Qui est celuy la qui n'espere
De voir quand le Soleil nous luit,
Que moy qui demeure en la nuit,
Absent du beau jour qui m'esclaire?
Or que mon.
C'est donc vous, agreeable veue^,
Qui me faict semblable au soucy:
Quand je vous voy je veis aussi,
Absent vostre absence me tue.
Or que mon.
Reuenez donc lumiere saint,
Vostre oeil me promet un este:
Sans vous je me sens tourmente
D un yuer d'ennuis, and de crainte.
Or que mon.

QV' Aminte fut heureux,
Don't la mort feinte
Sceut d'un trait amoureux
Donner attteinte
Au coeur ou la pity sembloit esteinte!
Alors qu'il soupiroit
Presque sans vie,
Et que son coeur mouroit
Pour sa Siluie,
Son amor de malheur estoit suiuie.
Son amor, ses douleurs,
Ses cris, ses peines:
Ses soupirs and ses pleurs,
Sa foy certain,
Ne sceurent one flechir ceste inhumaine.
Mais sa mort feinte un jour,
Mort salutaire:
Faisant ce que l'Amour
N'auoit peu fair,
Blessa d'vn trait d'Amour son aduersaire.
Que n'est helas mon sort
Au sien semblable?
Pourquoy rend il ma mort
Plus veritable,
Et vous, belle toujours, moins pitoyable?
VIII.
LAs! pourquoy ne suis-je nee,
Que pour souffrir mile and mile tourments,
Et pour me voir abandonnee
De tous contentements?
Mes yeux vont versant des larmes,
Cruel remede aux moyennes douleurs:
Mais a quoy sont bonnes ces arms
Qu'a de communs malheurs?
Ma peine est si desplorable
Que je ne puis esperer null secours
Si non par la fin miserable
De mes malheureux jours.
Vne soupconneuse envy
De mon sang mesme incitant la rigueur,
Le rend ennemi de ma vie,
Et de mes maux l'autheur.
Vous riches dons de nature,
Don't mes beaux ans du Ciel sont honores,
Seres vous du mal que j'endure
Et du temps deuores?
Que me sert-il d'estre belle,
Que mile amans me viennent rechercher:
S'il faut que moy-mesme, cruelle,
Ie feign estre un rocher?
Bien qu'Amour dedans mon ame
De mon Philandre ayt grande la virtue:
Mon coeur en recelle la flame
Par la crainte abbatu.
Que me sert donc la victoire
Que mes beautes obtiennent sur son coeur,
Si la crainte en oste la gloire
A mon oeil son vainqueur?
Ce seul bien me reconforte,
C'est qu'il ne peut, ny ne doit ignorer,
L'affection que je luy port,
Qu'on ne peut mesurer.
Ie scay qu'vn amor extresme
Pour moy le rend ardamment allume^,
Et que fidellement il m'ayme,
Comme il est bien aim.
Mais de nos ames blessees
Les seuls regards sont les doux aliments:
Regards messagers des pensees
Des fidelles amans.
Vous qui lires cette plainte
Que la douleur de mon coeur va tirant:
Plaignes, non l'amour, mais la crainte
Qui me va martirant.
IX.
UN jour l'amoureuse Siluie
Disoit, baise moy je te pry,
An berger qui seul est sa vie
Et son amor,
Baise moy Pasteur je te pry,
Et te leave, car il est jour.
Regard la naissante Aurore,
Baise moy Pasteur que j'adore,
Qui veut que je te pry encore
Par nostre amor:
Baise moy Pasteur que j'adore,
Et te leave, car il est jour.
Ma crainte horse d'ici t'appelle,
Baise moy Pasteur ce dit-elle,
O dieux! dit-il, quelle nouuelle
Pour tant d'amour:
Baise moy Pasteur ce dit-elle,
Et te leave, car il est jour.
De cela Pasteur ne me blame,
Baise moy plustofi ma chere ame,
Le secret entretient la flame
D'vn bell amor:
Baise moy doncques ma chere ame,
Et te leave, car il est jour.
Ha! que dis-tu, chere Siluie?
Baise moy Pasteur je te pry,
Le Soleil port donc envy
A nostre Amor?
Baise moy Pasteur je te pry,
Et te leave, car il est jour.
Sa clairte qu'on trouue si belle,
Baise moy Pasteur ce dit-elle,
Se rend importune and cruelle
A nostre Amor:
Baise moy Pasteur ce dit-elle,
Et te leave, car il est jour.
Mais puis qu'il faut que je te laisse
Baise moy ma chere de esse,
Soulage l'ennuy qui m'oppresse
Par trop d'amour:
Baise moy ma chere deesse,
Et puis adieu, car il est jour,
X.
LAs! fuiras-eu toujours de peur d'ouir mes plaintes,
Et de voir ma langueur?
Crains-tu que la pity de ces douces attaintes
Neblesse ta rigueur?
Arreste, arreste, Amaranthe, tu fuis,
Tu fuis, and me laisse en fuiant mile ennuis.
Comme de voir tes yeux sans adorer leurs charms
Est vne impiete:
Craindre comme tu fais de la pity les arms
Est vne cruaute,
Arreste.
Non, ce n'est point l'espoir que tu sois moins cruelle
En voyant mon tourment,
Qui fait qu'en soupirant Amaranthe j'appelle,
Criant incessamment,
Arreste.
Te dire seulement que mon ame to adore
Est ce que je requiers,
Tu peux me l'accorder, and conseruer encore
Tes desdains tous entiers.
Arreste.
XI.
SI le parler and le silence
Nuit a nostre heur egalement,
Parlons donc ma chere esperance
Du coeur and des yeux selement:
Amor ce petit dieu volage
Nous aprend ce muet langage.
Que le regard vole and reuole
Messager de nos passions,
Et serve au lieu de la parole
Pour dire nos intentions.
Amor.
Mais si quelque ame est offencee
De nous voir discourir des yeux,
Nous parlerons de la pensee
Comme les Anges dans les cieux.
Amor.
Ainsi par un doux artifice
Nous tromperons les courtisans,
Et nous rirons de la malice
De mile facheux mesdisans,
Qui n'en scauront pas d'aduantage,
Ignorant ce muet langage.
XII.
C'Est trop courir les eaux,
Sortons de ces roseaux,
Et cherchons desormais Pallas en ces beaux lieux
Puis qu'entre les vertus on doit chercher les Dieux.
Voyci les bois sacres
Tant de fois desires
Et ces Astres diuins brillans sur cette Cour,
Tesmoignent que nostre heur doit estre en ce sejour.
Allons donc, approchons
Les yeux que nous cherchons:
Tant plus nous differons d'aborder leurs beautes,
Tant plus nous tesmoignons d'ignorer leurs bontes.
Grands soleils des Francois,
Don't les prudentes Loix
Font respirer les coeurs sous vnregne si doux,
Dittes-nous si Minerue est point aupres de vous?
Vous aues le pounoir
De nous la fair voir,
Et trouuans la Valeur and la Prudence icy,
Auec grande raison nous l'y cherchons aussi.
XIII.
CE petit Monarque des ceurs,
Glorieux de voir arrestees
Sous le joug de ses traits vainqueurs,
Les puissances plus redoutees.
Voulut essayer si la mort
Flechiroit point sous son effort.
En vain son pouuoir irrite
Descochoit mile and mile flesches
Sur ce coeur don't la durete
N'estoit pas capable de bresches,
Non plus que les flots d'entamer
Un roc au milieu de la mer.
En fin honteux que tous les Dieux
Fussent tesmoins de sa deffaite,
Il se cacha dedans tes yeux,
Mon Damon, funeste retraite.
Qu'il est dangereux de loger
Un Amor qui se veut vanger.
XIV.
Arm toy, ma raison,
Pour combattre la flame,
Qui veut horse de saison
Tiranniser mon ame,
Si ton pouuoir divine ne me vient secourir,
Un bell oeil me fer a mourir.
Mes yeux que mon tourment
A changes en fontaines,
Tesmoignent clairement
La grandeur de mes peines.
Et que, si ton pouuoir ne me vient secourir,
Un bell oeil me fer a mourir.
Ie souffre tant de maux.
En l'amoureux seruage,
Que si les animaux
Parloyent nostre langage,
Ils viendroyent a mes cris de pity requerir
Le bell oeil qui me fait mourir.
Vous, de ma triste voix
Le rendes-vous aymable,
Dites rochers and bois
S'il est pas veritable
Qu'a fault que le Ciel me vienne secourir
Un bell oeil me fera mourir?
XV.
VOus, que le bon heur r'appelle
A un seruage antien,
Mourrez aux pieds de la belle
Qui vous daigne fair sien.
Glorieux en vostre perte
Honorex vostre vainqueur,
Qui vous a la port ouverte
De la prison de son coeur.
Heureux venez vous donc render
A celle qui vous a pris,
C'est honneur de se veoir prendre
A qui tient tout a mepris.
Ainsi vostre ame reprise
Finit toute liberte:
Glorieuse est l'entreprise
Qui guide a l'eternite.
Cet oeil r'abaissant sa gloire
Vous a bless de ses traits,
Affin que de sa victoire
Vous vous honoriez apres.
(...) ^^^cuse ser^^tude
Do^^ le genereux effort,
P^^^^ ain^re l'ingratitude
De l'oubli and de la mort.
L'honnour d'un brane aduersaire
Honor vostre trespass,
Heureux qu'en mourant peut fair
Que son nom ne meure pas,
XVI.
PVis que les ans n'ont qu' un printemps,
Passez amans doucement vostre temps:
Vos jours s'en vont and n'ont point de retour;
Employez les aux delices d' Amor.
XVII.
HE! bien ma rebelle,
Marebelle he bien,
Mon amor fidelle
N'obtiendra-il rien?
Languiray-je toujours pour l'amour de toy belle?
Languiray-je toujours
Sans espoir de secours?
Tu scays que mon ame
N'adore que toy,
Que nulle autre dame
N'a pouuoir sur moy.
Languiray-je toujours beauty que je reclame?
Langui.
Quoy? donc la souffrance
De tant de douleurs
Pour saerecompence
N'aura que des pleurs?
Languiray-je toujours sans aucunc esperance?
Langui.
Tant de sacrifices
De mon coeur rendus,
Et tant de services
Seront-ils perdus?
Languiray-je toujours parmy tant de supplices?
Langui.
Ton oeil qui m'enflame
Causant ma langueur,
Crains-tu point qu'on blame
De longuorigueur?
Languiray-je toujours pour t'aymer ma chere ame?
Langui.
Tant plus je t'appelle
Et moins tu m'entends,
C'est estre cruelle
Trop and trop long temps.
Languiray-je toujours pour l'amour de toy belle?
Languiray-je toujours
Sans espoir de secours?
XVIII.
IE voudrois bien, o Cloris, que j'adore,
Enter vos bras fair plus long sejour:
Mais las! voyci cette jalouse Aurore
A mon malheur qui rameine le jour.
Adieu Cloris, il est temps que je meure,
La nuit s'en va and l'ennui me demeure.
Pourquoy si tossed importune courriere
Viens tu troubler l'aise do nos espris?
Arreste toy, retarde ta lumiere,
Suffit-il pas des beaux yeux qui m'ont pri^?
Adieu Cloris.
O douce nuit de qui les voiles sombres
Sont desployes en faueur des amants,
Ou t'en fuis-tu, scays-tu pas que tes ombres
Donnent la vie a mes contentements?
Adieu Cloris.
Iusques a quand o Dieux! que j'importune,
Le jour naissant mes plaisirs destruira,
Et les effets de ma bonne fortune
S'enfuiront-ils quand la nuit s'enfuira?
Adieu Cloris, il est temps que je meure,
La nuit s'en va and l'ennui me demeure.
XIX.
AVx plaisirs, aux delices Bergeres,
Il faut estre du temps menageres:
Car il s'escoule and se perd d'heure en heure,
Et le regret seulement en demeure.
A l'amour, au plaisir, au boccage,
Employes les beaux jours de vostre age.
Maintenant la saison vous conuie
De passer en aymant vostre vie:
Des-ja la Terre a pris sa robe verte,
D'herbe and de fleurs la campaign est couuerte.
A l'amour.
Le cristal fugitif des fontaines
Va bordant les chemins and les plains:
L' Aurore espend au Ciel autant de roses
Qu'elle en descouure en la terre d'escloses.
A l'amour.
Du Printemps les plus belles journees
Semblent estre aux amors destinees:
Le Soleil vient, and r'apporte de l'onde
Le feu d'Amour, auec celuy du monde.
A l'amour.
Les ruisseaux vont aux plains fleuries
Cajolant and baisant les prairies:
Le doux Zephir parle d'amour a Flore,
Et les Oiseaux en parlent a l'Aurore.
A l'amour.
On ne void que des feux and des dances,
On n'entend que chansons and cadances,
Et le vent mesme escoutant ces merueilles,
Ferme la bouche, and non pas les oreilles.
A l'amour.
Ce qui vit, qui se meurt, qui respire,
D'amour parle, ou murmr, ou soupire:
Aussi le coeur quin'en sent la pointure
S'il est viuant, il est contre nature.
A l'amour, au plaisir, auboccage,
Employes les beaux jours de vostre age.
FINIS.
