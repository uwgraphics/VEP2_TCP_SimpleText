The battle fought in Anno Domini. 1495. at Tarro in Italy, not far from
Parma, betvveene Charles the French King, the eight of that name, and the
Venetians and Milanese, under the conduct of the Marquis of Mantoa.
MAximilian the Emperor, Ferdinande the King of Spain, the state of Venice,
Jews Duke of Milan, and A^exander the Bishop of Rome, being streken into
fear with the rare felicity of Charles the French King, who had without wound
conquered the rich Realm of Naples: about the first of April in Anno. 1495.
made a solemn league between them, with these conditions, that with one
consent, and common charge, they should set forth so greatea power both by
Sea and land, as should be thought sufficient to defend their common safety.
And for the furnishing of this exploite, the Spanyard had sent a strong Fleet
into Sicile with five thousand footmen, and six hundred Horsemen: the
Venetians had rigged forth a Fleet of forty Galleys, and also for a
supplement of their power by land, had hired a great number of light Horsemen
in Epyrus, Macedonia, and Peloponesus: the Milanese leuyed soldiers in
Germany, the Emperor promised to descend himself into Italy with an
invincible army of Almaynes. But the French K. being much moved with this
unlooked for conspiracy of those Princes, ye which although it was said to be
concluded only to defend themselves, yet he knowing it was stricken against him,
thought it best being then in Naples, speedely to return unto Rome, and from
thence into Lombardie, meaning by his suddayne coming, to discourage the
unprovided Pope from his intended purpose: wherefore leaving the rest of his
power bestowed in garrisons in most opportune places of the Kingdom of Naples,
marched toward Rome with four thousand Horsemen, as well men of arms, as
light Horsemen, besides the ordinary retinue that the men of arms do
accustomably draw with them, and about eight thousand footmen of Switzers,
Almaines, and Gascoignes, besides a sufficient furniture of great ordinance,
and namely of field pieces. With this power he entered Rome without resistance,
(the Bishop and his Cardinals being fearfully fled.) But when he was come
unto Pisa, he had intelligence that Jews the Duke of Orleans (whom in his
expedition unto Naples, he had willed to remain at Asti, in the frontiers of
Piemont, with a strong band of Horsemen, and also having heard of this league
of the Princes, had commanded to levy Souldyers in all places near
aboutes,) had taken Nouara, a City belonging unto the Duchy of Milan. The
taking whereof, made Jews the Duke of Milan very earnestly to desire the
Venetians speedely to set forth a power, seeing he could not in that
iniquity of time obtain present aid of any other of the confederates to
stay up his staggering state. The which the Venetians did both gladly
grant, and speedely accomplish: their army being within few days in the
field, at the bank of the River of Oglio, the General whereof they created
Frauncis Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantoa, a lusty young Gentleman, desirous to serve
in the wars, and win renown: with whom they joined according to their
manner, two Venetians Lieutenantes, or Prouiditori, Mel^^nor Creuisano, and
Luke Pisano.

In the mean time the King hasted with great iourneys to pass the Appenine
Mountains, and to join with the Duke of Orleans before the power of his
enemies (which he had intelligence were leuyed in all quarters, and passed
the Po) were come unto the streightes of the Appenine. Troublesome and
paynefull was the carriage of his ordinance down unto Burgo from the stiepe
Mountains, where the wonted Horses could not draw them, for the sheluing and
winding of the ways, but the Souldyers were forced to transport them with
their hands and shoulders, and every Horseman to carry a pellet of fifty
pound weight before him on the pomell of his Saddle. From Burgo they began
at the length to come down into a broader way, which leads to Foronouo, and
sent before the Marshall Gien leader of the vantgarde, with a strong band of
Horsemen and footmen, and with him Antony Bassey, the Collonell of the
Switzers, and James Trivulzi a Milanese, to take up a place at Foronouo for the
army to encampe in.

The King used Trivulzi as it were for his guide, and reposed great trust in
his counsel, both for his singular knowledge in martial affairs, and in the
Country, and also for the old enimitie between him and the Duke of Milan,
whom he continually sought to annoy unto his uttermost, whereby he grew
afterward to wonderful riches, and great martial glory, to the destruction
of all Italy.

Now was the Marquis of Mantoa (with whom had joined the Earl of Giazza with
the power of Milan) at Glareola, a Village on the farther bank of the River of
Tarro, in a place very commodious, not only to bridle the Parmesanes, if they
should attempt to reuolte, but also to be a sure guarde to the fortresses
near aboutes, and finally if the King would march on forward that way, to
set upon with all the Venetian power in a place of great advantage, his
vantgarde as it came down the hill.

In this mean time whylest the Frenchmen approached unto Foronouo, Gonzaga
having intelligence by spies of their coming, sent the light Horsemenne
before, the chiefest conduct of them being assigned unto Nicholas Annonio, a
Sclauon, a very valiaunte manne, to stay the Frenchemenne by skirmishing with
them, until he were come with the strength of the men of arms, and the
light bands of the footmen.

They valiauntly do his commandment, and suddaynelye gyuyng a charge upon
their enimyes, disordred them on all sides, and many being slain and taken,
and also one Ensign gotten, forced them very fearfully to turn back,
before that the men of arms, and the aid of the footemenne could come,
which foil happened unto the Frenchmen, because they were not acquaynted with
their manner of fight: for when the Frenchmen with a certain fervor of
fight, did more egrely pursue the Greeks, at once both courageously charging,
and also with great art fleeing back, and thereby did break their array: the
Greeks did suddaynely again return into the fight, and then many of them and
light, did set on the Frenchmen, being dispersed one from another, and laden
with armor, and also vnwarelye floung forward, and so easily beat them down
with their hooked and very heavy Turkish swords or mawles of iron. Gonzaga
seeing the Horsemen weeried with a long and paynefull journey, revoked them
from pursuing of the enemies unto their Camp: and contented with this good
success, returned unto the army, all his men being very joyful, and many
bearing the heads of the Frenchmen upon their Lances.

Among the Prisoners was there taken one Ante, a Captain of a band of
Switzers, a man well known before time to ye Earl of Giazza. He politikely
lying, did augment the number of the french Horsemen and footmen that were in
the auantgarde, for to fear the Italians from oppressing them, who had
ouerboldly marched before their fellows, and also falsely affirmed that the
King with the middle battle, and Seigneur de Tremouille with the rerewarde,
were not far off, the which lie doubtless saved Marshall Gien, who
distrusting the small number of his Soldiers, and they also disordred with the
skirmishe, had got him into an high place, that there in his camp defensed by
all means he could, he might stay for the King, yea though he followed after
slowly. But when this occasion of destroying the vaantgard did seem unto some
to be offered as a mean to obtain afterward an absolute victory of the
King, the Marquis of Mantoa was of the mind, that nothing ought to be then
attempted, but in any case the rest of the Kings power was to be stayed for,
that when the King their enemy were in sight, they might more safely and
nobly fight with his whole power in a pitched field: for the Italian army did
exceed them in number, and it seemed that they would also have ouermatched
them in the battle, if that fortune had not failed them, who shamefully swarued
from the discipline of their ancestors.

Thus the King having gotten the space of the whole next day, and tymely
ouertaking the vauntgard, encamped at Foronouo. Between the two Camps ran
the river of Tarro, which falling down violently from the stiepe Appenine
Mountains into ye enclosed valleys beneath, with a rocky and unequal
Channel, at length having gotten the open fields, runs into the Po. The
Venetians encamped on the left side on the broader bank of the River, not
far from the Village Appiano, in the lower ground: but the Frenchmen on the
right, having on their left hand the Town Medesano, and being on the higher
hills, they might easily see the Camp of their enemies, which by reason of
the great number of tents pitched round about, gave a show unto the eyes of
the wondering Frenchmen of a very great army.

When the King saw himself and his army brought into such a place, as out
whereof there was no hope left to escape, unless victory* became his guide:
to assay the intents and minds of the Prouiditori, he sent an Herald to
request of them truce for certain days. For Hercules the Duke of Ferrara,
favoring the engrafted lingering of the Prouiditori, had a little before
written for a most certaynetie, (thereby to stay the stomachs of the King, and
the French Captains all dismayde with that unlooked for martial provision and
furniture of their enemies) that neither the Prouiditori, nor his son in law
the Marquis, had any authority or commission from the Senate to fight a
general battle. The Herald being brought unto the Prouiditori and Captains,
said, that his master did greatly wonder, that the Venetians, whom he had
not provoked by any injury, were come with such a power of warlike men to
impeache his return into France, that his Majesty did request, according unto
the just law of nations, that with truce they would help his army, as it
trauayled, with victuals for money, and suffer them with quiet journey to pass
into France: if they would thus do, then his majesty was to give great
thanks unto the Seigniorie of Venice and their Captains, but if they would
not, then the French Soldiers would not only open a way for themselves by
true prowess, but also make a causey for their King with the slain carcasses
of the withstanders. To whom answer was made in few words, if that King
Charles would abandon his counsels and purposes of conquering Italy, and
withdraw his garrisons out of Ostia (the Haven of Rome) and Nouara, and march
without doing of any hurt, he should have free passage to go his way, but if
he neglected so to do, then also the Venetians would not neglect the injuries
done unto their alies, and as they were bound by the league, pursue with sword
the public enemy of all Italy. The Heralde who had curiously viewed almost
all things in the Italian Camp, being returned unto the King, told many things
woefully and fearfully of the situation and munition of their Camp, of the
number, the furniture, and cheerfulness of the Italian Souldyers: in so much
that the King himself, and many of the Captains, as men attached with a
supreme care, seemed to doubt of the safety of themselves, and of all the
army, for in discoursing and consulting, some were of the mind, that it were
best to return back unto Pisa, and being joined with the Florentines, chose
the seat for the wars in Toscan: Other having no regard of dishonor,
counseled speedely to cross the vales of the Appenine, and have to Asti,
leaving behind them both cariages and ordinance: the rest willed no
consideration to be had of the Duke of Orleans, but the King to compounde
with the enemy, who did ouermatche them in all things, so that they might
thereby assuredly provide for the safety of the King and his whole army.
Finally there were few, who thought that the life and liberty of the King was
rashly to be put into the danger of unequal fight, when there was no man
found that being more woeful for the Kings safety, than for his own, was
not of the opinion, that the event of the battle would be far worse than
all other things: in so much that they seemed unable either to find end to
their aduices, or assured mean to save the army in that danger. But then
they report that Trivulzi, on whom specially all men's eyes were cast, did
with the great expectation of all men speak in this manner. They that do
consulte of the doubtful chances of warfare at such time as peril is
present, ought to fetch that one way and mean, both of safety and also of
victory, which is only lest from stoutness of courage, and fearelesse
heart, for when force does most urge in a matter, and there is most need both
of stout advice and courageous adventure, there a man to abate his stomach,
and dismiss his mind, and to be attainted with fear, is both shameful, and
also most times pernicious: but yet the same seems to be much more
dishonorable and untimely, when that by over woefully weighing and pondering the
perils, we do make and imagine them to be greater and worse tha^ they are
indeed. Diverse that have spoken before me, grave men, and (which byndeth
greater credit unto their words) very courageous and valiant warriors, have
doubted, and that too very vehemently, of the safety of you, most invincible
Sovereign, and of your whole army: that is to wit, by rehearsing what
penury of things and famine do hang over both men and Horses, what asperities
of places, what streightes do hinder our journey, and pull from valiant me^
the use of prowess: and finally what kind, and how great an army of our
enemies do foreshutte and stop the ways against us, being few in number,
and weeryed with the toil of so great a journey, that we may not by any means
escape, so that it is better to try all other ways, than with despayred
victory by contending with force, to hazard the whole, as though (as it likes
some,) that to the end we may escape unto the safe Alps, the most noble and
always victorious King should take a most dishonorable and lamentable journey
over the Mountains of Liguria, (all the baggage of the army, and the great
ordinance being by secret and shameful flighte lest behind for our
enemies:) or else that we turn our backs toward the^, and return again
unto Pisa, that anon after our enemies enuironing us both by sea and land, we
being tamed by famine and yielded, may be a laughing stock unto yt whole
world. Neither also do I like of the advice yt your Majesty should by a
shameful co^positio^ obtain of your armed enemies a safe return into France.
For by what other faith shall we assure ourselves all things to be peaceable,
tha^ by ye selfsame whereby even now they so impude^tly brake ye late leagues?
But in this let us credit the perfidious, for they also do sometime use to
keep their faith given, yt they may afterward deceive more timely, and with
greater gain. By this unhappy couenanting are not so many valiant men that
do nobly defend the kingdom of Naples, being destitute of all hope of help,
forsaken, and also betrayed unto their most cruel enemies? and if the garrison
be withdrawn out of Nouara, shall not the course that is begun to a more ample
victory be utterly interrupted and cut off? Doubtless I see, that the same
one only counsel is both safe and honorable, which does seem unto other
most hard and dangerous, namely, that abandoning all thought of peace or
flighte, we make us a way with our swords: Neither because that I do promise
that in the success all things will be easy for you, nor do despair of the
victory, would I seem to foresee in mind more than the rest, and more
arrogantly to forefeele the whole event of this instante matter, for this may
be granted not unto my wit, but unto my practice in warfare, and experience
of Italian affairs, since that for the space of these many years, I have bin
present in all the wars of Italy, whereby it was not hard for me abundantly
to learn the counsels, minds, arts, and the very discipline, both of the
Princes, and also the Captains and souldyers thereof: all which things have at
the length with my often not obscure perils, so taught and instructed me, that
they have made me neither, foolishe-hardie, nor altogether fearful. First of
all will not I believe that which does so vehemently fear their hearts, that
are moved with the greatenesse of the danger, that is, that the Venetians will
of their own accord bid us battle, for besides that ye understand by the
letters of certain, that the Lieutenantes and Captains have no commission
from the Senate to fight, who will believe that a people of nature given long
to linger and draw forth wars, will for an other man's cause; without any
their necessity, hazard all their power in a pitched field: for it is too too
foolish for a common wealth that does flourish in everlasting wise
Counselors, and riches that cannot be consumed, to covet gay triumphs by a
doubtful and bloody battle, when they may, and not rashly look for the
mature and certain victory of the universal wars, that are not feared with
the great charges of them. Neither indeed do I think that Jews Sforza, a man
of nature fearful, suspicious, and very wary, does earnestly labor by his
secret counsel, to have the french power quite destroyed by the Venetians. For
what other end will there come of that victory (which God forfende) than yt
the Duchy of Milan become a booty unto the Venetian victor, which they by
inuading and tearing with impotent arms, have always with singular
covetousness desired? But admit that Jews will do nothing to day as a wise
and wary man, and that the Venetians by a new and suddayne counsel will
commit the Empire of Italy to the arbitrament of doubtful Mars: is there any
doubt therefore (courageous Sovereign Charles) to be made of the victory? let
vain fears depart from valiant hearts, seeing that all things that every
good Chiefetaine does wish to have when he shall fight, do promise unto us
undoubted hope of good success. First of all, a cause passing good, faithful
and old Souldyers, great store of ordinance, a very indifferents place, and
finally regard of none other thing, but common safety and glory. The prowess
of the Italian Souldyers here to day neither do I debase nor extol, for I
should do foudly or impudently, if I should utter my judgment thereof, so that
keeping still my shamefastness unviolated, I doubt not to confess and affirm
this one thing, that we shall deal with an army of fresh water Soldiers, and
of Omnigatherum: for the greatest part of those Horsemen whom we see glistering
in their crestes and armoure, have never put on armor before, but at a pomp,
when that arms were mustered, and in sporting fightes and shows: nor ever
heard sound of Trumpet: for indeed, there have bin no wars in Italy these
many years, nor no just and bloody battle foughten: but the footmen will not
only not sustain the force of the Almayne Esquadron, but being inferior both
in armor, weapons, and courage, will not abide so much as the sight of them,
coming upon them with so great order and array. Then there remains that we
do greatly fear the arts and subtle policies of some old beaten
Chiefetaine. Alas what ambushe will he lay, or with what array will he bring
forth his army through the incommondious fordes of the rough river, to invade
us marching in array of battle? a springall Chiefetayne that never saw Camp
of Souldyers besides this of his own, whereunto he is preferred rather for the
title of his name, than for merit of tried prowess? Therefore mine opinion is
(invincible King) that we march on still forward as we have begun, and your
majesty shall do well, if that you do adhort the Souldyers not to doubt of
the event of the battle, and to contemn their enemies. The baggage of the
army being sent away a little distance from the armed ranks on the left hand
toward the hills, would I purposely object to be ryfled by the enemy, who
is more greedy of pillage than of fight. On the right hand toward the
river, let the great ordinance be placed against the enemies. I with my
college Gien will lead the fore ward; and the way, and being nearest to
danger, will valiantly endeavor, that it nothing repent your highness to
have followed this counsel: the rest of the martial charges let the
Captains (and specially the ancient) part amongst them, and let them
march forward unto victory with the army prepared for both chances of
battle and travail: for neither their wonted virtue, nor your fortune shall
fail them, who being made noble by perpetual victories, have learned to fight
valiantly, yea, and if it were but for only glory.

After that Trivulzi had pronounced this Oration, with a countenance full of
confidence, no man almost seemed (although in some of their hearts fear were
fettled) which did not cheerfully assent to his sentence, and swore that they
would not depart the field but victors. Then Charles disposing his Horsemen,
to repress from all parts the Greeks, who almost every hour with great
cries, stirred up sundry tumultes in his Camp, and watching almost the whole
night, the next morrow as soon as it was fair day, brake his fast, and
commanded the Souldyers to do the same, and to prepare both their bodies and
hearts as well to fight, as to march forward: and not long after he being
cladde rather in strong, than fair armoure, mounted on Horseback, environed
with seven young Gentlemen of approved fidelity and prowes, armed, appointed,
and trimmed in all points like unto him self. As he set forward, the
Souldyers saluted him with so cheerful voices and gesture, that they
interrupted him when he began to encourage the^: besieching him to have no
doubt of the victory, which they had now in their hands. For when he was on
Horseback, he seemed to be taller and more lively tha^ he was indeed: for of
nature he was a very little man, and by reason of his old disease, weak, and
not strong legged to go on foot, but then he looked like unto a valiant and
fearelesse Souldioure, for his face, eyes, and specially his hawks beked nose.
There guarded him on both sides two companies of noble Horsemenne, with whom
were intermingled the guard of Scotts. Moreover, Matthew ye bastard of Burbon,
in whom the King reposed very great trust, and Robinet Framesell, the valiant
conductor of the Duke of Orleans his men of arms, environed him with their
companyes of Horsemen, one on the right side, and the other on the left. There
followed about a two furlongs behind them, the third and the last battle,
the conduct whereof had Foix, a noble man of Guien, and Seignieur de
Trimouille, who afterward for his great acts, became a renowned Chiefetayne.
With them was a great power of excellent Horsemen. But in ye vantgarde were
seen the Esquadrons of the Switzers and Almaynes, their chiefest hope and
strength, and the great ordinance. The Marshall Gien and Trivulzi marched
before with a company of light Horsemen, to show the way unto them that
followed. An arrow shot behind them followed the Switzers and Almaynes, to
whom their Colonels Gilbert of Cleue, and Antony Bassey, men skillful of their
tungs, had promised in the Kings name treble pay, if that they saved the King
by their faithful and valiant hands.

With them on the left hand were joined the Gascoignes, Archibalistes, and
almost three hundred archers of the guarde, who thorough unlucky counsel, had
sent away their Horses, and marched on foot, that they might shoot the more
strongly. But the great ordinance being drawn with equal pace close to the
batallion of the footmen, were placed against the river, and the battles of
their enemies. The drudges of the army, and all the rascal rabble marched with
the ^uggage toward the hills on the left hand: but the Marquis who had
determined if the Frenchmen had bent^ on the ^este hand toward Medesano,
which was the way unto Dertono, to pursue them on the back with all his power:
when he saw them come down from Foronouo in array of battle, thinking it not
good any longer to stay, using the counsel of old Souldyers, araunged his
battles in this order.

All his whole host was divided into nine battles, the number of his me^ were
above two thousand four hundred men of arms, a few less than two thousand
light Horsemen, and about twelve thousand footmen.

In the first battle was Peter Dodo a Venetian with six hundred Greek
Horsemen, and Alesso Beicacuto with almost so many Archers on Horseback, who
did not use howes of wood as did the Frenchmen, but crossebowes of iron. To
them it was enjoined to compass the hills on the back of their enemies, and
to charge the left side of the vantgard, and by skirmishing, to stay the
marching Frenchmen from their intended journey.

In the second battle was the Earl of Giazza with the power of Milan for
this consideration, that as soon as Trivulzi and Gien were encountering with
the light Horsemen, he upon the right side should set upon them, being then
occupied and troubled. That battle consisted of six hundred men of arms, and
three thousand Almaine and Italian footmen. The General himself calling to
him his Uncle Radulph, and Ranuccio Farnesi, with about five hundredth men of
arms, and so many archers, and four thousand footmen, took upon him ye
charge to encounter the middle battle, wherein was the King. But the fourth
battle to charge the rerewarde, was assigned unto Fortebraccio de Montoni.
Also three battles of succoure were appointed with very good order indeed, but
with a very shameful event, so that Antonie de Feltri the bastard of Vrbine,
should timely aid the General, when the signal should be given: Aniball
Bentiuogli, and Galeazzo Palla^icini when need required, should follow the
Earl of Giazza, and finally Jews Aduocato, and Fraunces Gambara, Bress^ns,
and Soneino Beazono a Gremenese, should attend upon Montoni. The reason why
these battles of succor were ordained was this: that when every battle of the
Frenchmen being entangled with their own peril, could not succor the next
being in distress, they should all of them be at one time beaten down almost
from all parts.

The eight and ninth battle were placed a little father off, for as aid
against all uncertain chances. But Taliano Pio, and Charles Meliteo were left
with the rest of the army to guard the Camp. Moreover, the masters of the
great ordinance were commanded to plant their ordinance in a long rank on the
bank of the River of Tarro, in as commodious places as could be provided by
martial art.

When the battles were thus set in array, the Marquis returned unto the
Prouiditori, who albeit they being suspended with very weighty care, judged it
contrary unto the reason and trade of their common wealth, to dareyne battle,
yet such was the cheerfulness of the host, singularly well arraunged, and
appointed to fight, that now it repented them of their ouerwary counsel, and
were thoroughly filled both with joy, and assured hope of victory. Neither was
there any man honorable, either for his age, or martial dignity, that then
durst consult with cunctation and suspense, whether the battle were to be
adventured, or openly to make any doubt of obteyning the victory: for most of
the fresh water Soldiers being lifted up by a certain hot desire to fight,
and a trust reposed in their strength, were so lusty, that if they heard any
men speak somewhat warely, or considerately in that danger of the whole
state, they openly rayled upon him with many reprochful words, and called
them draw backs, and fearful dastardes. And it happened, that when Radulph
Gonzago said, that he thought the place would be incommodious for them to
fight in, and therefore would have had it first made even and level, he was
straight ways malapertly scoffed at by Mario Caluisano a goodlye lusty youth,
and one in great favor with the Marquis: for he told him with irreverent
speech, that they which were so greatly afraid of their skin, might do well
immediately to get them thence, and shrowde themselves warely within the walls
of Parma. I pray God (quoth Radulph then) that these foolish hardy kil^owe
princoxes, do valiantly follow me, piercing into the mids of the enemies, for
they shall receive the strokes not of painted and trilling vain stanes, as they
do at games, but feel of the strong and sturdy steel. God grant we may
embrue these brave cas^^^kes and coats, rather with our enemies, than with
our own blood. Radulph indeed was the true and the best Judge and valor of
foreign warfare: for from his childhoode he had bin one of the Henchmen of
Charles the Duke of Burgoigne, and was present at those three last battles, in
which he being at length vanquished, lost his martial power, which before
was feared of all men, and his Duchy, together with his life.

In the mean time, when the Frenchmen now drew near, and the Souldyers were
excited unto the battle by ye often thunder of the great ordinance, the
Marquis turning himself unto the Lieutenantes, said: If you think it for the
behoof of the common weal, that we do valiantly bridle the foolish
hardiness of the Frenchmenne, which with barbarous vanity do promise
themselves the Empire of all Italy: we must not long consulte, but now when
the Fyffe and Trumpettes of our enemies do call us, we must out of hand bend
our hearts to fight: for if by lingering we shall let our enemies escape
out of our hands, we shall not find hereafter so good an occasion to
oppress him, and shall in vain pursue him being light and vncumbred, and
with wasting all the Country hasting through the paineful and blind paths to
succoure his people at Nouara: I for my part if ye shall command it, will
let the Seigniorie of Venice to understand my service, and will stretche all
my strength of body and mind, to show that the ancient honor is not taken
from the Italian Soldier by foreign nations, and that thorough our
valiaunce, a most renowned victory may be gotten of the proud enemy for you
Venetians, the true and assured setters at liberty of the dignity of Italy.
Thereunto, (his college also assentyng) thus answered Triuisano: Go to (most
valiant General) seeing that you do testifye with surpassing courage, so
singular a good will toward the Venetian name, and that the honor of saving
Italy does instantie you to win the fruit of everlasting praise, command
the battle to be sounded (the which I pray God may be good and fortunate
unto the Seigniorie of Venice, and their confederated fellows) turn the
araunged battles against the enemies, and endeavor by vanquishing valiauntly,
that your house renowned for the perpetual glistering of auntiente glory,
may be made to shine (...) brighte through the honorable title of a new
victory. And without any more tarriance at one time, the Drums, Trumpettes
and great ordinance began to sound, and the battles arraunged in such
order as we have declared, made toward the enemy thorough the River in three
places, but they ran forth so rashly and unluckily, that they, who were
carried with so great couragiousnesse, were troubled and half overcome by the
great iniquity of the places, before they could come unto their enemies: for
the Channel of Tarro was very ill to pass over, full of turnings and windings,
and very much cumbered with Willowes growyng therein, and also the brimmes of
both the banks were very hard both to go up and down. And moreover, many
quagge myres, and blind gulfes were made by the great rain that fell the
day before. And finally, the Fordes of the River were every where stony and
uncertain, through which difficultyes (as it must needs happen) the course
and force of the passenge^s was greatly hyndered. And albeit they were sore
annoyed with, these incommodityes, and the greatest part of them could hardly
get out themselves, nor overtake them which marched before, yet they
valiantly charged their enimyes, and ran together with Spears and Swords,
and in three places attached a hot and variable fight, now fortunate to one,
and now to the other:

The Frenchmenne had stood still in a place very safe, the which on that
side which the Italians came, was very uneven, and cumbered with many trees,
so that when the Italians clambered up the hill, they fought (dispersed with
the thick battles of their enemies) with greater force, than art, and in the
end with adverse fortune. On the contrary side, the Frenchemenne making their
battelles thick and close together, and not unadvisedly stirring out of their
place, received them that charged them, and that done, environed them round
about, and with their short Swords assaying where the blade might best
enter into the body, did thrust them in, and beat them down. In the mean
time, the Greek Horsemenne that had invaded the fore ward, being repelled on
all parts by the men of arms, and their hot spur Captains Annonio and
Busichio departed out of the battle wounded, suddenly turning their Horses,
flewe together to rifle the baggage, which by the counsel of Trivulzi had bin
objected unto the enemies, that they being occupied about the spoil, a more
ready and easy passage might be made for the King. There the Lackeys,
drudges, Women, straglers, and moyletters were fowly tossed among the beasts,
and falling packes, and when they repugned, or sought to save the goods, being
slain among them, almost all the baggage was taken and rifled. This tumult
caused all the field to ring of ye dissonant outcryes of so many nations, by
reason whereof, thither ran all the bands of footmen that were near, who
being also greedy of pillage, without shame brake their array. But then arose
there a very bloody and miserable fight among the ri^^ers themselves, every man
pulling one from another the Kings baggage, and the weaker still oppressed by
the stronger, were slain with the pillage in their a^mes.

This thing by the consent of all men, brought safety unto the frenchmen, for
their fore ward when ye Greeks once inclined unto ye spoil, valiantly
received the charge that the Earl of Gi^zza gave overthwart them, and
succored the second battle that was in distress, and also the second being
augmented with strength and courage, repelled the Marquis of Mantoa with great
slaughter, and aided the third, which Montoni had disordred. At the last, when
the two battles of the Marshall and the King vehemently pressed the Italians on
both sides at one time, Radulph and Ranuccio being circumuented in the mids
of their enemies were slain, and also almost all the whole band of the
familiars of the Marquis, among whom were many noble men. There fell also
before the Generals eyes Caluisiano, and the band of an C. singular good
Souldyers footmen, that had bin chosen to guard the Marquis, were slain, and
trodden down. The Marquis himself (who with wonderful prowes had pierced
through the mids of the Horsemen, even unto the ordinance, and the masters
of them, and the Horses by whom they were drawn, being slain, had
overwhelmed with a tempest of Horsemen a band of Gascoignes appointed to
guarde the ordinance, and also the archers of the Kings guard) with much ado
got himself out of the mids of his enemies, his Horse being grievously
wounded. For all men did auye, strike at, and pursue him fleeyng throughout the
whole battle with a spire of silk in the crest of his helmet.

The same fortune also felt the Italian footmen that were in the Earl of
Giazza his battle, for when the foremost ranks of them did (as the manner was
then) shake from the ground their long forkes, stayed up with their left arm,
but the next ranks of Souldyers defensed with Targets, hurled Iauelins with
broad heads, and the rest after them shot quarrels out of crossebowes: they
were received of the Switzers, not only without any fear, but also with
slaughter: for they being very skilfully cast into a close Esquadron, did
lightly contemn that fond kind of weapons, and manner of fight, for as soon
as ever they approached, almost three hundred extraordinary young men, who for
commendation gotten by extreme peril, are called the Desperates, the Forlorn
hopen, leaped for the from both sides of the Esquadron, and with mighty two
hand swords, began to cut off those unruly pykes, with whose hardiness
almost all the Italians being feared, before they expected the impression of
the Esquadron, turned their backs. In that place one band of Almaynes, which
had with great hardiness invaded the French Ordinance, and had stoutely
resisted, was slain by the furious charge of the Switzers. And withal, a very
suddayne shower of rain, mixed with Hayle, thunder, and lightning, did in so
apt a time afflicte them being foiled, and now ready to flee, that God
himself seemed to fight for the Frenchmen: for the River of Tarro (which a
little before ran as though it had bin dried up) was now grown so great
through falls of waters from the Mountains and dytches, that neither they
which reposed hope of safety in flyghte, could safely escape, neither durst
the untouched battles that longed to go succoure their discomfited fellows,
once pass the River, which with swift and violent stream carried away men,
Horses, armor, weapons and all. Neither in the mean time did the ordinance
cease on either side, although with doubtful, but vain peril, they were
often shot off even amongst the blended battles. In all this so hard state of
things, the Marquis forsakes not himself, although he were attached with
incredible sorrow, seeing so many valiant Gentlemen that had come thither
only for good will toward him, yea and his uncle, environed by their
enemies, and no succoure to be hoped for. There was on the left hand a deep
ditch of water that ran down to certayue corn Milles, into this ditch were
both footmen and Horsemen carried by hedlong flight, fowly struggling and
striving together. The which when the Marquis saw, he changing his Horse, came
thither, and rebuking the flight, and staying the ensigns of diverse troops,
he gathered together one strong band, who although they were sore weeryed by
the sundry incommodities of fight, flight, and finally of rain, yet valiantly
renewed the fight, and with slaughter repelled ye Frenchmen that pursued them
amain. There Seigneur de Mioll, and the Bastard of Burbon, being wounded by
Alesso Beicacuto in the neck, were taken not far from the King, and diverse
renowned Horsemen of the french side slain: But the coming of the Earl of
Pen^a was a great stay, that they which had first attached the fight, were not
quite destroyed, for he being brought prisoner out of Naples, now when his
keepers were busied in that danger of the battle, had escaped in the mids
of the tumulte unto ye Venetians, and what by telling that the Frenchmen were
vanquished and put to flight, and also by cohorting them not to let go assured
victory out of their hands, he restored unto the fearful and fleeyng such
courage, that with the authority of his name, he caused all that he met with,
to return into the battle. But the Frenchmen pursuing the Italians being
discomfited and broken by the first and second battles, were empeached by the
swollen river from winning of an entier victory, even as a little before, the
rising of the river had bin a let unto the rerewardes of the Venetia^s, for
following and succoring their disordred foremost battles. But this is well
known, that the Marshall Guien, although Trivulzi and Frances Sicco, the
Captain of the Florentines, vehemently obtesting him not to suffer an occasion
of destroying their enemy to be lost, would not pursue them when they fled,
or go one foot forth, for that he thought he ought not rashly to depart out
of the sight of the Kings battle, the event of the fight being as yet
uncertain, and the K. being circumue^ted from all parts by diverse, although
utterly scattered troops of the enemies. Not long after, many of the Captains
gathering together about the King, caused the retreat to be sounded, that with
joined bands and battles again araunged, they might expecte what their
enemies would do: for they not only saw fresh and whole battles of them on the
farther bank of the river ready to receive the encounter, but might perceive
both their own Horses and me^ wholly weeried, and therefore thought it best
rather to rest, than pursue their scattered enemies, as they which were
contented with that victory, the which considering the peril appeared greater
tha^ it self, because they had by arms and prowess made themselves a way,
not only in spite of their enemies, but also with their foil and discomfiture.
The Marquis also after he had in vain looked for aid (because the rest of
the battles feared with the discomfiture of their fellows, and the hardness
of passing over ye risen river, had detracted to fight) wound himself out from
the hindermost tail of the departing Frenchmen, and passing over the river in
a better forde, returned into the Camp unto ye Prouiditori* There perished in
that battle of ye Venetia^s and Milanese above four M. among whom were besides
Radalph and Ranuccio, John Picinnino, nephew unto the famous Captain Nicholas,
Galeazo Correggi, Robert Strozza, and Alexander Beraldo, Captains of Cornets
of Horsemen, and Vincent Sorso, who led a regiment of footmen, and Malfacto
and Gabanello, who being of the guard, had whereas at other times, the^
specially in ye battle, gotten the praise of singular prowess, when with their
weapons they made a way through the mids of the enemies for the Marquis to
escape. But on ye french part beside the multitude of ye rask all rabble, which
made the slaughter greater and fouler, there were lost about a thousand
Souldioures: and also Julian and Dason Lieutenauntes of companyes of
Horsemenne, and Vardey the Captain of the Archers on Horseback, and the
Captain of the troop that guarded the King, and also noble men called by
the names of their Towns Torsy, Semple, and Ambrun. But the King self in
deed a notable loss with great grief, when he understood that almost all
the Archers of his guard were slain (who as is said before) sending away their
Horses, fought on foot. And the report is, that himself was in no small
danger of life, when the Marquis breaking thorough his battle, and
disordering the whole wards, he being almost left alone, made hedde, and drew
his Sword, and confessed that he was doubtless saved by the invincible
strength of his fierce fightyng Horse, which was a clean cole black, with one
eye. The Frenchmen lodged that night upon the next hill beside Tarro, having
lost all their baggage and tents, and brought to extreme lack of victuals,
who although they had undoubtedly gotten the victory, and were very joyful,
yet did they greatly fear their small company, and had a special care for
the saving and carrying away of the number of the wounded, which was thought
would be a very hard thing, by reason of the ill and troublesome journey that
they had to go: for they saw that their enemies had a great number of light
Horsemen, thorough whose vnweeried diligence and swiftness, they might cut
off victuals, stop the ways, and by pursuing and hagling on the hindermost,
much endamage them, and specially the heavy armed Switzers. But the Captains
being busied with this fear and care, and very weerie: the Almaynes and
Switzers, when the King had with liberal hand divided among them a thousand
Crowns for a reward, took upon them with great noyses of Drums, the
charge of keeping the Camp that night. On the other side in the Venetian Camp
were they diversely affected, for almost in every cabine were some attached with
sorrow, and other with joy, as every man's hap had bin either to have lost
his fellow and friend, or to have gotten rich pillage: for all the Kings
furniture, plate of silver and gold, rich apparel, hangings of all sorts,
and sacred furniture set with precious stones. Finally the riches of the
Kings of Naples, which were now in carrying into France to garnish the triumph,
was taken by the basest of the Souldyers and the Greeks. But when all the
Captains with the Lieutenantes were assembled together, every man spoke
according to his humor: for some (and they far the greatest number) who
seemed to be oppressed with fear, thoughts it good to dislodge, and to save
their army, in whose safety consisted the safety of Jtaly. Other that had
but in the battle; and had thereby taken to them greater courage tha^ they
had before, would have the enemy invaded again, and being weakened with
wounds, and amazed with fear utterly destroyed, saying, that they had not bin
overcome by the prowess of the Frenchmen, but by the iniquity of the place.
But then the Marquis of Manto^ spoke in this manner: If that with equal
consent we had bin all to day either hardy or fearful, we had not bin now
to consulte whyther we should forsake our lodging, or invade our enemies: for
either we should have supped more merry with the epptyue King in our enemies
Camp, or certes have bin held in thi^ most safe trench, with strength and
courage not lessened: but whereas extreme counsels in dissenting heads do
always hurt, but the mean generally do good, neither will I suffer the
fearful to flee back, neither permit that the valiant again hazard the
fortune of fight: for as though our rashness were not yet sufficiently
chastised, to set upon our enemies in an unhappy place, and of great
disadvantage, what else is it, than to teese wild beasts, and to provoke them,
being made mad with the extreme danger of death? for extreme necessity
turns into rage, and most times makes them that do utterly despair of life,
of cowards most valiant men. But whereas some do counsel that we remove our
Camp farther from the enemy, God forbid that men should be of the mind,
that the shame which we have received to day through the cowardice and flight
of a few, we should heap up higher by fondly dislodging, as it were with
utter dishonor. For what will this suddayne dislodging signify unto our
near enemies, tha^ a grievous wound gotten, extreme fear, and finally a most
shameful flight? therefore we must tarry in this lodging, and valiantly
endeavor, that the incomm^ditie that has bin taken, may be repaired thorough
my more wary counsel, and your more happy prowess. First of all we will
command the hurt men to be carried to Par^^^, and there cause them to be
cured, and the bands that have not fought, shall have the charge of the Camp,
that the weeried may take some rest. I will go about the watch my self, and
will stre^gthen with sure garrisons all ways and entrances, and this will I to
the uttermost, endeavor that we may lie in safety from the violence of our
enemies. Tomorrow will more manifestly show us the motion and minds of our
enemies, and will open a safer way to our counsels. The Prouiditori lightly
assented to this opinion: for although the Marquis seemed to have performed
rather the duty of a valiant Horseman, than of a prudente General, yet they
were so far from reprehending him of rashness, for that unlucky event of
the battle, that they had him in admiration, as made more renowned through
this new glory of approved prowess and invincible courage: for although the
aged men were of themselves men of great honor, and such as had borne great
dignities at home, yet did they rejoice for that augmentation of martial
praise as most honorable, and did think that the most glorious triumph of
almost taking so great a King prisoner, and of the victory well near gotten,
thorough the hardy attempt of the Marquis, was taken from them thorough the
unskillfulness or cowardice of a few.

The next day the King sent unto the Venetian camp for truce for three days,
the which was denied, and only that day granted for to bury the slain men on
both sides. The next night the King about one of the clock after midnighte,
causing many fires to be neade in the Camp to deceive his enemies, dislodged
without Trumpet sounded, or Drum stricken, in somuche, that he had 07
marched certain miles before his departure was known to the Venetians. But as
soon as it was light, and the Marquis had intelligence that the enemies were
dislodged, he sent the Greek Horsemen, and also the Earl of Giazza, and his
brother Fracassio with the light Horsemenne, to pursue them, who although they
might much have e^^amaged the Frenchmen mar^^ing almost in ^^e^yng man^^, yet
they did the^^ no ha^^e, whyther for ^^^ate good will, or by the commandment
of the Duke of Milan, who feared as much the Venetians obteyning an entier
victory, as the Frenchmen with their vnappayred power, I leave unto other to
judge. But after this, the Duke of Milan for^^^ the Duke of ^^^ans to surrender
Nouara.

Of the Battle of Seminara, fought in the kingdom of Naples in Anno. 1495.
betvveene Verdinande King of Naples, and the great Gonsalues Captain of the
Spanyardes on the one side, and the Lords Obegnie and Persiue for Charles the
French King on the other.
Anon after the departure of Charles the french K. out of the kingdom of
Naples. Ferdinande the king of Naples wafted out of Sicile with about seven C.
horssemen, and five M. Spaniardes and Sicilians, sent by the K. of Spain,
under ye conduct of Go^salues de Cordoua, unto Rezo in Calabria. The which
Town and castle they took as also they did Saint Agatha, and then all the
Towns there aboutes, partly for desire they had of their king, and partly for
the weariness of the Frenchmen, opened their gates unto Ferdinande: so that
now he was come so far into the country, as SEMINARA. When the K. Obegny,
gouornour of Calabria for the french king, had intelligence hereof, he sent for
Seigneur Persiue out of Basilicata, to bring with him all the garrysons that
were in that country, with whom he with his power meeting at Terranoua,
before that his enemies had knowledge of Persiues coming, marched to Seminara
to fight with Ferdinande out of hand, or if he would hold himself within the
walls of Seminara, nor durst not commit himself to the open field and fight,
that then he would return as victor, making manifest unto the world the
cowardice of ye enemies. The which thing he thought would be of great moment
to keep the people in their duty, specially seeing he did think that within
few days aid would come unto him out of Campagna, Puglia, and Abruzzo. But
Ferdinande who had not yet intelligence of the coming of Persiue, and had bin
advertised by espyes of the power of Obegny, which was very small, nothing
doubted to issue out of the Town, and encounter his enemies, thinking that all the estimation and favor that he had gotten a little before, by bold
attempting and valiantly trying of Fortune, would now be lost by one, infamy
of being shamefully enclosed by siege, and the dishonor of conceived fear, if
that he should hyde himself without the Town, But Gonsalues in whose head was
that power of exact prudence, whereby he afterward passed almost all the rest
of the Captains of our age, began to admonish the young Prince, greedy both
of recovering the Kingdom, and of winning glory, earnestly desiring him not to
go out of the Town before the purpose and power of their enemies were more
certaynely known, that those counsels are honorable enough, which promise
^^^uritie to doubtful matters, but those are most shameful and miserable,
which through rashness when that we vauntingly show a vain vigor of heart,
are wont to destroy all means to obtain the absolute Conquest and conceived
victory. And must we then (said Ferdinande) recover the Kingdom with as
grease cowardice, as we lost it, and not rather in these so prosperous
beginnings prove that fortune by doing and attempting, which we found adverse
by setting still and absteyning from sight in That was, when Charles wan the
kingdom.
Romagna and Campagna, as though the beginnings of wars have not the gretest
moment for the successes that follow, and those exployts yt are courageously
begun, unless they be valiantly prosecuted, have they not a soul and unhappy
end? Fortune will be with us Gonsalues, which has hitherto stood with the
Frenchmen, seeing that she now smileth on our first enterprises, neither will
she ever forsake them, whom of her own accord she calls unto victory,
unless that we do shamefully forsake her by our dishonorable lingering. Let us
once see the faces of the Frenchmen, which only Fame (and that to very vain)
has made terrible, and let us courageously, setting foot to foot, try both
ours and their strengthes. We are superior in footmen, Horsemen, the good
will of men, and finally in the favor of Fortune, neither must we doubt of
the prowess of you and your regument. For who is there of you, that if we
should fight man to man, would not gladly desire his Frenchman or Almayne to
encounter withal, and also would valiantly slay him? I doubtless for my part
will first before you all boldly charge the first brave Gentleman that I shall
see in their battle, and by happy hardiness give you an example, that ye
running upon them with like heat, may through equal courage bring back a
speedy victory from this drunken enemy.

There were many noble men present at this Counsel, who afterward came to the
estimation of great Captains, Andrew de Altauilla of the noble house of Capua,
Hugh of Cardonna, Theodore de Trivulzi, and of the Spanyardes Emanuell
Benauides, Peter P^ces, Alberade, and Pennalosa, who being very desirous to
fight, prayed Gonsalues that he would not distrust the prowess of the
Souldyers, and promising to behave themselves valiauntly, adhorted Ferdinande
to command the army to issue out of the Town. Seminara stands high, and
from the Town run there hills along unto a little valley, the which
sends forth a river out of a low botome: at this vale begin the Champeine
fields, whither the Frenchmen were now come from Terranoua. Ferdinande
marching three miles along the hills, came to the river, and lodging his
footmen on the hither bank upon the lest hand, and all his Horsemen being
stretched out along like unto a wing on ye right hand, looked when his enemies
would pass the river.

Over right against the footmen of their enemies, did Obegny and Persiue set
their Switzers, being cast into one battaylion, they placed the foot men of the
Calabrians behind them, as it were to succoure them, and divided between them
the Horsemen, who were little lack of four hundred men of arms, and after
the order of the Frenchmen twice as many light Horsemen, and passing over the
river in a square battle, made toward their enemies. The Spanishe Horsemen
seeing that, set spurs to their Horses, and cheerfully ran forth, and
when they being ouermatched both in armor, weapons, and strength, could not
make the thick battle of the men of arms to give ground, giving a shoute
began to turn their Horses, and after a Spanishe kind of sight, to retire unto
their fellows, with fetching a round compass, that both discouraged the
hearts of the Arragonian footmen, thinking their horsemen had bin discomfited
by the enemy, and so fled back, and also encouraged the Frenchmenne
courageously to press on them, so that Obegny on the right hand, and Persiue
on the left, hotely charging the battle of the footmen with their Horsemen,
disordred them before that the Switzars could bend their pykes toward them,
and many of them being overthrown, quite cat-stered the whole ^attell.
Fer^^^^^sse (...) a^^^^ting his Souldyers to return into the battle, like a
valiant Horseman ran upon his enemies, accompanied with certain men of
arms of his servants, and brake his Lance on the breast of a Frencheman of
Ma^^^, and ano^e after being overwhelmed with the multitude of his enemies,
was forced to ^^ee, being pursued of many, by reason of his crossed and guilt
annour, but overtaken by none, when (see the such) his Horse foundering, threw
him down headlong into a very narrow place, in a hollow way, neither were the
frenchmen far off from him, being encombred with his Horse lying upright
upon him, and his foot ^^taug^^ in the stirrops: when John; brother unto
^adr^w ^tia^^^^ came to his help, and of entie^^mis, worthy of eternal
memory, offered him his own swifte Horse to save his life, upon whom
Ferdinander (as he vau^ted excellently well) speedely leaped, although he were
in heavy ^^f^plete armoure, and so escaped the enemy. But A^^^uilla being on
foot, was an^ne after stayn^ by the Frenchmen. ^^egry having stayne a great
part of the footmen, lodged not far from the place of en^o^^tes, so ^^at^^
was said, that he little knew how to use the victory, because he neither
pursued so many noble men (among whom was the Cardinal of Arragon) nor
incontinently brought his victorious army before Semi^^^^, through the which
leisure both the noble men and the King came by diverse ways in safety
vntoothe Ships and Go^salues also, who by valiauntly fightyng, and by
repayring the array in many places, had doubtless saved many, entered the
Town, and carried away the baggage, and all the better part of the furniture
of the Camp, and then got him to Rezo, the Frenchmen afterward pursuing him in
^^yne.

The Battle of Eboli, fought in the Kingdom of Naples, betvveene Persiue,
Chiefetayne for Charles the French King, and Thomas Carafa Rarie of Matalone,
General for Ferdinande the King of Naples, in Anno. 1495.
KIng Ferdinande and the great Gonsalues being escaped (as ye have heard)
out of the battle of Seminara: the king embarking his power that was left,
sailed (...) the City of Naples, where he was received in by the well willing
Townemen, and many noble men Arragonites repayring unto him, he straightely
besieged Monipensier the French Viceroy, and other in the Castle, the which he
had entrenched round. And also the great Gonsalues had repaired his power at
Hezo out of Sicile, and warred on the Calabrian^? Monpensier signified unto
Obegny and Persiue, that he was not able to hold out long, unless that aid
were speedyly sent unto him, either by sea or land. Upon this they sent for the
noble men that were of the Aniou or French faction* to repair unto the^ with
their hands, and also gathered together their dispersed people, and then
dividing the army, Obegay went against Gonsalues and Persiue with Bernardiue
Sanseuerino Prince of Besignino, who had brought a cornet of Horsemen, and four
hands of footmen, hasted to Naples, and came to EBOLI, a town not far from
the river of Cochile, standing upon a very high her, and enclosed round about
with a deep valley. Ferdinand having intelligence of the french men's coming,
had sent his Captains and power thither before, to let the passage of the,
whose way lay by Salerne, himself remained at Naples, to the end he might be
present at the parle of ye Frenchmen, who seemed willing to entreat of taking
truce, and yielding up ye Castle. The General of ye kings, army was Thomas
Carasa, Prince of Matalone, a man vtterli ignorant of foreign warfare: but
there is were with him many good warrioures and among the^ Venazi D. of Camerino,
and Lucas Sabello, who knowing which way the Frenchmen minded to travail, and
having diligently viewed their power, gave advice with small iourneys to
follow at their enemies heels, who marched directly to Salerno to cut off
their victuals, and not to join in battle with them, before that a place of
disadvantage had taken and offered them to be oppressed, or else (which
seemed to be best) incontinently with all speed to take the Town, called the
little Lake, and the inhabitants thereof, being commanded to abandon the
Town, and to set it on fire, that the enemy might not use the victuals and
bouses thereof, and then to march speedely to Salerne before the Frenchmen.
But the rest of the Captains and Souldyers contemning the small number of
their enemies, did burn with so great desire of fight, that being incited by
a foolish courage, they cried out that it was not for the dignity of the
King, and of so great an army, that the victory which they almost held
assuredly, should be sought, not by the right way and open prowess, but by
going about the bushe, and dastardly suttletyes. Moreover, this rashness of
many, did the government of the hasty Chiefetayne augme^t, who had brought
nothing into the field besides approved fidelity, and the name of his renowned
house, for he reproouing those that were set to follow wary counsels, and not
all upon lustiness and honor, said: What my masters, neither are the
Frenchmen now adays those auntiente Heroes, whom France for their miraculous
strength of body has celebrated in their sabulous Poemes, neither are we
altogether women armed and garnished after this manlike guise, so that we must
doubt to set upon, and overcome these Barbarians walking with drunken train,
as soon as ever we see them. And immediately after he had thus said, he
commanded Proclamation to be made, that every man should make himself ready,
and bridle his Horse, and after the third watch, all the army issued out of
Eboli. Persiue and the Prince of Besignano had passed over the river of
Cochile by a bridge, anon after the break of the day, and marched toward
Salerno, but when they saw their enemies, they retired back above three
furlongs, that they might raunge their battles in a more indifferent place,
and there laid their left side close unto a mighty wo^^^, that ad^^yneth with
the open fields, that their small army might not be enclosed round about by
the multitude of their enemies, for they were scarce one thousand Switzers, who
being backed with eight hundred Calabrian footmen, made a square batallion,
and close to the side of the footmen stood the Horsemen, being of Frenchmen
and Italians of all sorts a thousand. But the Earl of Matalone following the
old order which has oftentimes destroyed the Italians, divided his army into
five battles, the which were stretched forth in length from the middle battle
with equal front like unto direct wings. In the middle battle was he
himself, and Lucas Stabello flanked on the left hand with a thousand
Spaniards, and on the right with three thousand Italian footmen. But in the
uttermost wings were on the one side Venanzi the Duke of Camerino, and on the
other Hierome de Tutauilla the Earl of Sarno, with either of them their
companyes of Horsemen for this purpose, that as soon as ever the Earl of
Matalone should charge the Switzers on the front with his footmen, and the
French Horsemen with his Horsemen, Venanzi should even then get between the
Frenchmen and the wodde with his Horsemen, and the Spanyardes, and on that side
valiantly invade them, and at the very same time the left wing should be led
by Tutauilla, upon the side and back of the enemy: the reason of this devise
was not absurd, if that the hearts of the Soldiers, and the mouings and
goings of the battles, whom fortune makes subject unto a thousand chances,
did fully answer unto the counsels and commandments of the Captains, as
it then happened. For besides that the Arragoman battles were unwisely placed
full against the beams of the Sun rising, which did very much dazell their
sight: yet they seemed also to be unadvisedly raunged, for that the raunges
standing a small distance one from an other, had neither strength enough to
abide the shocke, neither yet had every rank space enough lest to turn about
their front, if need should be, but that one should be encounbered and
disordred by an other: but that which was a great detriment, and i^ warfare
utterly to be detested, the S^^^l^yers being ouerlustie and cranke (as fresh
water Souldio^^s commonly are) and having neither learned to be obedyent, (...)
to fight well, discharged neither duty of discipline. For as soon as ever
the great ordinance was shot off far from them, certain of the Horsemen,
lusty and brave Gentlemen, that they might intercept from the rest of their
fellows the honor of approved prowess, without commandment, charging their
staves, did out of array one after another, run their Horses upon their
enemies, whose charge when the French Horsemen had received with the strong
front of their unshaken battle, and many of them being broched upon their
enemies lances, and cast off from their Horses, were slain: all the rest
incontinently ran their Horses back again amain, and lighting upon the
Spanish footmen, disordred their battle, and drove them upon Venanzi his wing
of Horsemen, in such sort, that they not only brake the ranks of the
Horsemen, but also threw them down to the ground. Besides at that very instant,
the Arragonian footmen running apace, gave with like rashness the onset on
the Switzers: for when some of them bearing Targets, had hurled their
iauelins, they drew their swords, and other bare either boarespeares with
ears or rhompheyes, with an hooked head of iron, that would cut on both sides,
they could not come unto the body of the Switzers squadron, for their long
pykes, and therewithal followed such a change of courage, that they which
even now ran forth with singular fierceness, and surpassing cheerfulness,
inco^tinently turned fearfully back, and namely, when that their Horsemen
ran in among them. Persiue being astonished at the miracle of so great a
chance, that he might not fail unto Fortune, who vehemently favored him
contrary to hope, did valia^tly set forward, and courageously running over the
heaps of men and Horses falling down, did within the space of half an hour
(which is almost incredible) quite overthrow the power of his enemies, and
that almost, without any wound of his own Souldyers, welneere all the
Italian footmen were slain by the Switzers, and with them also a band, which
had bin levied at Naples, of the Ruffians and cutters of passing hardiness:
there also perished valiauntly fyghtyng, when the rest turned their backs,
these stout petito Capthynes, Henry a Gentleman of Consie^, Jews Sq^arcia,
and Vincent Cape^^. The thick woddes through the which the armed could (...)
easily go^, defended the Spaniards, and light and nimble fellows without
armoure. But the Earl of Matalone, and the rest of the Captains having lost
many of the Horsemen, shamefully fled unto Eboli. But when they were hardly
received in at the gate, and the french Horsemen pressed at their backs,
Venanzi a man of a constant conrage, stoutely susteyning the invasions of the
enemy in the hindermost tail, and fighting valiantly, was there slain.
Furthermore, the rest of the Horsemen, being in number almost three hundredth,
fetching a compass thorough very ill ways, came flynging unto the foregate of
the town, but the townesme^ were so amazed with fear, that no man would
suffer ye gate to be opened, nor was moved with the danger of their friends,
holding up their suppliant hands unto the walls to save their lives. But as
the French had become victors through the unskillfulness and cowardice of
their enemies, so through their fatal sloth knew they not how fully to use
the victory. For Persiue lost the occasion offered to destroy the Horsemen,
perhaps because not surueyng round about the utter ^i^ch^s, the situation of
the town, he brought his power only unto ye broad green that lay before ye
town, wondering and looking yt they which had so shamefully fled, should open
the gates unto the victors. But not long after, when he lacked ordinance to
win the town, and the Prince of Besignano had fallen down ahnost dead,
through the stroke of a pellet of a Serpentine, shot off from the bulwark of
the town, which pellet had stricke^ off the handle of his sword, and
battered his breast plate, they retired back to spoil them that were slain:
after whose departure the Horsemen were delivered of extreme fear and danger,
and retired into ye town. And within few hours after came ye Spaniards,
straggling in dy^^rs companies, being saved through ye benefit of ye wood. But
if ^ersiue had encamped before Eboli, most men do hold, yt the townsmen
(because they were of ye faction of Aniou,) would have opened ye gate unto the^
ye next day, and delivered ye Arragonia^ army into their hands. The hoped
fruit of this battle was not received, for before yt hasting Persiue could
come unto sight, Mo^pensier had given hostages for ye delivering up of ye
castle wtin a certain day, unless there came so great a power of fre^chme^ ye
Ferdina^ds army would aba^do^ ye field, and hide themselves in Towns, and also
that he might be vi^tualled, had couenanted, that he and his power would not
stir until that time. Now Persiue not daring to break thorough ye
inexpugnable munitions which the K. had cast up at Caia, a place not far from
the West gate of Naples (which way the Frenchmen must needs go, to come unto
the Castle) retired back again into Basilicata, leaving the castle to be
surrendered.

Of the Battle of Terranoua, fought in the kingdom of Naples, betvveene the
Lord Obegny, Chiefetayne for Jews the French King, and Hugo of Cardonna,
Captain for Ferdinande the King of Spain, in Anno. 1506.
WHen that Jews the French King, and Ferdinande the King of Spain, could
not agre^e about the division of the Kingdom of Naples, whereof they had
spoiled King Fredenke, Dom Hugh de Cardonna having levied in Sicile three
thousand footemenne, and three hundred Horsemen, arrived at Rezo in Calabria,
and in a great skirmish distressed James Sanseuerino Prince of Mileto, who
stirred the Calabrians to revolt, and succored Didaco de Ramires, that was
besieged in Terranoua, and burnte and sacked the Town, and after this put to
flight Martiano the Prince of Rossana. When the two Sanseuerini Princes of
Salerne and Besignano had intelligence of these exploites, they leuying up
power in all parts, and arming their tenauntes, joined with the Lord Obegny,
who hasted from Cossenza to repress Hugh. There were with Obegny Monsieur de
Griguines, and Monsieur de Malherbe, the one Captain of the Gascoigne Archers,
and three thousand Switzers, the other (Griguines) of all the light Horsemen,
but his chiefest strength was in his men of arms, among whom, an old band of
Scotts did excel, which consisted of the familiars and faithful friends of
Obegny, Hugh lodged at that time in a plain, on the South side of Terranoua,
and being broken with the coming of his enimes, calls the Captains into
Counsel: and although he was increased with a new supplye, yet he thinks it
best to shun the open fields, and minds to retire back unto Saint Georges
Castle, which stands on the Appenine Mountains. But the new Captains that
had lately come out of ^payne, impeached the performance of this determination.
Among this new supply, were Emanuell Benauides, and Antony de Leua, who became
afterward a renowned Captain, and two Aluerades, the father and the son,
they had brought with them four hundred men of arms, and light Horsemen,
and four bands of footmen. They said, it was dishonorable, yea and flat
shameful to remove their Camp back, and to retire before the enemy came into
sight, and before they certaynely knew, what and how great their enemies
power was: and this reasoned they the rather, because a Calabrian epsy, a man
of a doubtful fidelity, did affirm, that the French could not be there
within two days. But this opinion of the Frenchemen, did Obegny, an old
Captain egregiously deceive, for he using french speediness, and marching all
night through an unused way, taught him by the Calabrians, showed unto the
Spanyardes his battles raunged, and commanded the battle to be sounded. The
right wing did the two Sanseuerine Princes stretche forth in form of a
croysant. In the left wing was Griguines Captayn (as I have said of all the
light Horsemen) but in the middle battle stood Obegny almost close unto the
Princes, with the men of arms, cast into a thick troop. Malherb set his
Switzers, standing thick together, and his Gascoignes in looser ranks (that
they might shoot the more commodiously) close to the side of the light
Horsemen.

On the other side the Spanyardes, although they were fewer in number, and
deceived of their purpose, yet without fear they arange their battles, and
encourage one another to fight, and withal constantly receive the charge of
the Frenchmen: there was to be seen a cruel fight, neither side having
ability to shoot off their ordinance. But in the heat of the fight, whylest
Cardonna does perform (and that with marvelous constancy) the office both
of a Chiefetayne and a Souldyer. Griguines fetching a compass about with his
extended wing, gave a charge overthwart the footmen, and disordred and
defeated them, and immediately the Switzers and Gascoignes were also upon the
iackes of them with such violence, that the Spanish footmen being broched
with the pykes, and shot in with the arrows of their enemies, fearfully
fled. But in another quarter, all Cardonna his Horsemen, being by his
commandment cast together into one round troop, sustained the Calabrian
Horsemen with euened slaughter. But when. Obegny came forth with his battle,
neither the Spanish nor Sicilian Souldyoures did abide the violent charge of
the Scottishe men of arms, but hastily turning their backs, ran away amayne
unto the Mountains, Cardonna rating, and in vain bidding them turn head, and
retire fair and softly. The Horsemen being thus put to flighte, the
footemenne were slain and trodden down from all parts, but the greatest part
of the Horsemen escaped unto the streightes of the Mountains. At this conflict
Griguines pursuing his fleeing enemies, was slain, being run into the eye
with a lance, when he had pulled up his beuer. Neither was Obegny in small
peril of death, when the Spanish Horsemen, (as we afterward learned of
Antonino de Leua) having enclosed and almost taken him prisoner, went about to
pull off his helmet, and doubtless had slain him, if he had not bin saved by
the coming of the Prince of Salernes Horsemen, who casting themselves into a
wedge, scattered those that were clustered round about him. Furthermore, when
that the rest of the noble mon had escaped by the Mountains, Hugo last of all
forsaking his Horse whom he had huckened, because the enemy should not enjoy
him, creeped by the snowy Rocks unto Bubalina Motta, and then gathering
together, and a little refreshing his Souldyers that had escaped out of the
battle, he went down unto the City of Hierazzi. The baggage and carriages
of the Spanyardes, fell unto the pillage of the French Souldyers, and
Pesauntes, the ensigns with many goodly Genets of Spain, were brought unto
Obegny, and the number of them that were taken prisoners, was greater than of
them that were slain. Neither could that victory seem joyful unto Obegny,
seeing it cost him the death of that most valiant Gentleman his dear friend
Griguines.

After this battle, when Obegny had without wound taken Bubalina Motta
whyther his enemies had fled, there was no man almost in Calabria that did
not incontinently turn his devotion toward the Frenchmen victors, the
Spanyardes fleing into the strong Castles, which they thought the Frenchmenne
would hardly win in the Winter season.

The Battle of Gioia, fought in the Kingdom of Naples, betvveene the Lord
Obegny, General for the French King, and Andrado, for Ferdinande the King of
Spain, in Anno. 1506.
FERDINANDE King of Spain hearing of this overthrow in Calabria, and how that
his Lieutena^t General in the Kingdom of Naples Gonsalues, was besieged in
Puglia, sent Portecareri with a strong fleet and army into Naples, under
who^e served Alfonse Caruaiall with. 600. Horsemen, and Ferdinande Andrada, who
had brought out of Galicia and Biskay about. 5000. footmen, but Portecarery
dyed as soon as he came unto Rezo, and so the supreme government fell unto
Andrada, who co^sulting with Hugo de Cardonna, marched with his army into the
territory of Terranoua. And the very same day also came Obegny from Bubalina
Motta, to take Terranoua, which when Alrerade a Spanyard had taken before he
came, he after a light skirmish, to try the force of his enemies, turned to
Castle San Gi^n, not far from Seminara, in the which place, seven years
before he had vanquished in battle King Ferdinande and Gonsalues. Neither
were the fields famous for the late overthrow of Hugo de Cardonna far off,
in somuche, that Obegny being fierce through his former victories, although he
were inferi^ure in number, yet beholding with his eyes the fields fatal unto
his foes, but fortunate unto himself, was led with a joyful abodement to
adventure the third battle: and for that intent, sent his Harraulde
Ferracute unto the Spanyardes, who with proud mouth offered the field unto
them, as men of no val^o, and accustomed to be vanquished. Hugh being of
himself i^rensed, through the heat of his disceyuing ^earte, was of the
opinion, that the offer of battle should be accepted, and that for the
bringyng of the message, Ferracute should have a basen and a cup of silver,
and presently sent for his brother (who was not far from thence) to come
with his footmen: but his Souldyers refused to go forth, except their wages
behind, that had bin so often promised them, were now paid. But this
contumacie of the Souldyers, he easily dissolved, by giving unto them all the
gold and silver he had, and gaging his friends credit for the rest, and so
the footmen were brought into the Camp. But Obegny after certain skirmishes
marched to Gioia, whom the Spanyardes incontinently followed, and the next day
came Obegny down from Gioia, in array of battle, which as soon as the
Spanyardes espied, they also incontinently arra^nged their battles. In the
wings were Emanuell de Benauides, and Caruaiall. But in the middle battle were
Hugh Antonino de Leua, and Aluerade the father, with the old footmen and
Horsemenne. A little behind this battle stood Andrada with the Horsemenne
that came lately out of Spain, and the Galician and Biskay footmen, who after
the ancient manner of the Roman warfare, used pauices somewhat long and
inflected, and iauelins to be hurled. But Obegny himself was in the vann^gard.
Alphonse Sa^seuerino was in the second, and Honorato Sanseuerino in the
third, and did lead the bands of their friends and tenauntes. But Malherbe
was Captain of the square batallion of the footmen, with whom was the great
ordinance, which being shot off on both sides, the Horsemen came forth.
But when Obegny went about to avoid the Sun that shyned in his face, he
missed of his purpose, for a troop of Spanishe light Horsemen took ye place
before him, so that he turned about, and gave a vehement charge on Emanuels
wing. But when the sight was most hot, and Emanuels wing did very hardlye
sustain the forte of the Scotts, Hugh, Antony, and Aluerade succored them,
and then they sought on both sides so fiercely, that both Frenchemen and
Spaniards fighting with their swords, were intermedled together, neither did
the one or the other doubt of the victory, when loc with speedy counsel
Caruaial brought about the left wing, and gyuing a charge upon the backs of
the fore ward of the enemies, brought such terror unto them, being busied with
the doubtful fight, before that Obegny having his battle distressed, fled.
And the horsemen of Andrada defeated Alpho^so Sanseuerino, that brought aid
with the second battle: and with like lotte was Honoratus put to flight, and
the third battle overthrown: and within half an hour (which is scarce
credible) there was a notable victory gotten, almost all the French footmen
being slain: both ye Sanseuerines, Honoratus, and Alfonse were taken
prisoners. But a troop of Scotts took away Obegny out of the hands of his
enemies: and then Malberbe and he met, and fled on the spur to Gioia. But
there they stayed not long, because, news was brought, that the Spanish
horsemen were at hand pursuing them: but Obegny in the dark night came to the
castle of Angitula, often complaining of Fortune, that had now illuded and
deceived him, having bin invincible until that day, and victour in twelve
Britayne and French battayles. The Spaniards pursuyng him, besieged the
Castle, which Obegny yielded up himself within few days after, when he
understood how the Duke of Nemours the Viceroye of Naples, was discomfyted and
stayne in battle.

The Battle of Cerignola, fought in the Kingdom of Naples by the Duke of
Nemoures, Viceroy and General for Jews the French King, and the great
Gonsalues, Viceroy and Lieutenant General for Ferdinande the King of Spain,
in Anno. 1506.
THe same day that the Lord Obegny was overthrown at Gioia, the great
Gonsalues de Cardonna Lieutenant General for the Spanyardes in Naples, having
received a supplye of Alwaynes, issued out of the Town of Barletia, wherein he
had bin after a sort besieged seven months, by the Duke of Nemoures, Viceroy
for the French King, and marched to CERIGNOLA, with intent to besiege the
Town, or to give battle unto the Frenchmen, if they would attempt to
succoure it. The Duke of Nemours forsaking Canossa, was encamped not far from
Cerignola, where he called together the Captains, consulting with them whether
it were best to fight or no. But thorough untimely alteration, the greatest
part of the day was spent in consultation, when he himself, Monsieur de
Formantes, and Monsieur Darsey for weighty considerations, thought it best to
defer the fight until the next day, but Monsieur Cyandey the Captain of the
Switzers, and Signeur de Alegre, stoutely contended, that victory which had
always luckely happened unto the Frenchmen, when they were hardy, was not to
be sought by flouthfull and dishonorable lingering, but by speedy and manly
encounter. By which sentence Nemoures understood, that his honor and fame was
greatly touched: for he had heard a little before, how Alegre had spread very
evil words of him, as though he being no great skillful nor valiaunte
Chiefetayne, was afraid to join in battle with the enemy, and had suffered
with the foul blot of the French honor, and the great empayring of their
strength, his army to be fleesed, and pulled by the subtle enemy. Whereupon he
not enduring this reproach, without stay said these words: Go to then, seeing
it seems so to some, that we must this day by battle make one end or other
of ye wars, such as Fortune will alotte, certesse I will satisfye by honorable
death, if not the public desire of the French King, yet at the least mine own
honor: and this said, he incontinently gave the signal of battle, although
the Sun were scarce an hour and an half high, and made toward the enemy
with three araunged battles, not with equal front, but one a little behind
another, so that when the right wing wherein he and Arsye were, ran forth,
Ciandey should shoot off the great ordinance from the middle battle, wherein
stood all the footmen, and should follow a certain space behind the fore
ward: and in like manner Alegre should admoue the third battle unto the left
side of the Switzers when he should think good, so that the French battles
by reason of their unequal length, much resembled in the setting forth the
three hindermost fingers of a man's hand. But on the other side Gonsalues set
against them six battles with direct front, two of Horsemen were in the wings,
and one backed the Almaine footeme^, so near unto whom stood the Spanish
footmen, that a far off, they seemed to be both one battle, but yet so that
there was space enough left for the Horsemen that stood in the mids, to
issue out if it were needful. But all the light Horsemen he sent forth under
the conduct of Fabricio de Colonna, and Didaco de Mendozza, to stay the enemy
by skirmishing, whereby such a thick cloud of dust was raised, that the
French vauntcurrers could not one whit see before them, and this was augmented
by the smoke of the great ordinance, which fleeing over both armies, did hurt
neither of them. But when Go^salues commanded the great ordinance to be shot
off again, Leonard Aleccio told him with great fear and sorrow, that all the
barrels of Gunpowder were there by chance or falsehood, set on fire, with
which news, Gonsalues being nothing dismaide, said: I do gladly receive this
good abodeme^t, for what greater joy can happen unto us, than to have seen the
lights of victory coming forth? neither was his prognostication false: for
Nemours charging ye Almaines, and the Horsemen of ye left wing, untimely
sticked fast in the ditch, ye Gonsalues had cast up before his Camp, in so much
yt when he being repulsed, turned his troop to seek some other way to come
unto the enemy, he was slain with an Hargubusse shot, almost before Cyandey
had given the onset on the Almaines. And the like luck received Cyandey of
the same ditche: for the Almaynes with their Pykes, and the Spanyardes with
their harquebuziers, disordered and slew the Switzers being very ill troubled
with the ditche, and also Cyandey himself, who turned the hands and eyes of
all his enemies upon him, because he fought on foot with a great plume of
white feathers on his headpeece, and stoutly striued to get out of the
troublesome place to come to the enemy. But when Nemours was slain, Arsy and
Alegre fled, whom the Spanishe horssemen pursued, slaying and taking many:
among whom was Formantes, and then returned unto the Camp, when the Sun
going down had not given so much as half an hour of perfect light to end
the battle, which doubtless saved Alegre and Arsye. There were slain of
Frenchemen four thousand, and that with so great celeritie and felicity,
that when the battle was begone and ended within half an hour, there
peryshed not an hundred of the Spanyardes. I heard Fabricio de Colonna say,
when he told the success of this battle, that the victory was not gotten
so much either by valiauncie of the Souldyers, or prudence of the General, as
by the small rampyre, and shallowe ditche cast up before the Camp, which
caused the Captains that ran after him, to reuine the auntiente martial
discipline in fortifying their Camp. Gonsalues following the victory,
expelled the Frenchmenne quite out of the Kingdom of Naples, the which he
conquered for his Sovereign the King of Spain. This battle was fought the
nine and twentieth of April, seven days after the battle of Gioia.

The Battle of Vaila or Giaradda, fought in Lumbardie, betvveene Jews
the.xij. King of France, and the Venetians, in An. Domini. 1509.
MAximilian the emperor, Lewis the French King, Ferdinande king of Spain,
Julius bishop of Rome, and Alfonse the Duke of Ferrara, being entered in to
league against the Venetians, because they had eueroched upon them all,
Jews, the French king marched from Milan with a great army against the
Venetians, who had also a great power in the field beyond the river of Adda,
under the conducte of the earl of Petilia General, and Barthlomew de Aluian,
the Camp master, and George Cornarie, and Andrewe Grittie, Legates or
Prouiditori. But when the French king being desirous to fight, could get the
Venetians by no provocation out of their fortified camp, he dislodged, with
intent the next night to lodge either at Vaila or Pandino, where by cutting
off their victuals that were brought from Cremona and Crema; he might force
them to dislodge, as in very deed it did. Now there were two ways to come
unto those places, one the lower and next to the river of Adda, which was the
longer, because it was ^rooked: the other further from the river, which was the
righter and the shorter. The lower way took the French army, wherein were
above two thousand men of arms, six thousand Switzers, and twelve thousand
Gascoignes and Italians footmen, with great furniture of ordinance and
Pioners. On the upper way on the right hand marched the Venetian army wherein
were two thousand men of arms, above twenty thousand footmen, and a great
number of light horsemen, part Italians, part Grecians. The Greek horsemen
were the auau^tcurrers, but by reason of the bushes and shrubbes, that occupied
all the space between the two armies, they straggled not so wide, as
otherwise they commonly used to do, and this also was a cause, that one army
could not descrye another. And as they thus marched (but the Venetians with
swif^er pace) it ^^^^ed, that the foreward of the Frenchmen, wherein were. v.
C. men of arms, and the regiments of the Switzers under the co^ducte of
Charles de Amboise and John James de Triulzi, were upon a sudden gotten very
near unto the rerewarde of the Venetians led by Barthlomew de Aluia^,
wherein were eight hundred men of arms, and almost all the best footmen of
the whole army, but in no very good array, because Aluia^ did not think that
day to fight. But when he saw his ennimies so near unto him, whether incited
by his wonted heat, or for that he was brought into that state that he must
needs fight, incontinently signified unto the Earl of Petilia, who marched
before with the vauntgarde, either his necessity or purpose, requesting him to
come to his aid, to whom the earl answered, that he should march on and
shun the conflicte, for so both the reason of the war required, and so the
Senate of Venice also willed. But in the mean time Aluian placing his footmen
with fix great pieces on a little bay, made to let the course of a certain
brook then dry, which ran between the two armies, gave a chardge at his
enemies with such violence and valor, that he disordered them, being helped
herein, because the fight was begun among certain Vineyardes, where the
Frenchmen could not for the vines redily use their horse: but this peril
caused the king to come forward with the strength of the army, and thereupon the
auauntgarde, and the middle battle charged on the soldiers, of Aluian, who
having conceived great hope of victory through the happy beginning, flewe
about hither and thither, in kindling and inciting his soldiers with most
vehement words, and very fiersly fought they on both sides, the Frenchmen
taking again heart of grass through the succor of their fellows, and also
the battle being brought into an open place, where they might freely use
their horses, wherein they did far ouermatche: besides they were not a little
inflamed by the presence of the King, who taking no more care of himself, than
if he had bin a private soldier, lay open to the danger of the ordinance,
and cessed not (where need was) to command, encourage, and threaten his
soldiers. On the other side, the Italians being made hardy by the first
success fought with incredible valiancie, neither failed Aluian in doing in
any ^^nction of a very excellent soldier and chieftaine. At length when they
had fought about. iij. hours with singular valia^cy, the Venetian power having
received in the plain and champaine field a great flaughter and discomfiture
by the horsemen, and also the ground being made so slippery by a great shoure
of rain which fell whilst they fought, yt the footmen could ^et no fast
footing, and especially being destitute of the succor of their felows, began to
fight with great inco^moditie, and yet nevertheless when they fought with
passing prowes (although now hope of victory was lost, rather for glory, tha^
for safety made the victory bloody, and for a time doubtful: but at the last
their strength being rather lost than their courage auailed, they never
turning their backs, were slain where they stood, among whom Peter one of the
house of the Marquesses of Monte Sanmaria in Tofcan, a captain of a regiment of
footmen, was much commended. This so stout valor of but one only part of the
army, bred a constant opinion in many men's minds that if the whole army of the
Venetians had entered the battle, they had horn away the victory. But the
earl, whether because as he stayed himself when he turned about to fight, he
was impeched by the fleing battle of Aluian, or as the report went, for that
he had no hope of victory, and was very angry that Aluian durst fight contrary
to his commandment, and had thought it better to have that part of the army
to be conserved, than the whole lost through another rashness, he kept the
greatest part of the army from fighting. In this battle were few horsemen
lost, the greatest flaughter lighted on the footmen of the Venetians, whereof
some say there were. viij. M. slain, other but only. vj. M. on both sides.
Bartholmewe Daluian was broughts prisoner unto the kings Tente with one of his
eyes, and his face sore bruised and made black and blewe, twenty pieces of
great ordinance were taken, the rest of the army escaped, no man pursuing
them. In the place where this battle was fought, the French king built a
Chapel which he called Sancta Maria victoria. After this overthrow the
Venetians were easily spoiled of almost all the Cities that they possessed in
the maine land of Italy.

The Battle of Rauenna, fought in Italy, between Gascon of Foix Duke of
Nemours, general for the French king, Jews the twelfth, and Reymund de
Cardonna, viceroy of Naples, and general for the king of Spayn, and Julius the
Pope. Anno. 1512.
GAscon of Foix, General of the army in Italy, of Jews the French King
against the Pope, having intelligence that the power of the Spaniardes, and the
Pope were coming according unto their promise to succor Mark Anthony de
Colon^a besieged by him in Rauenna, fearyng the irruption of Mark Anthony,
brake up the siege, and withdrewe three miles from the town toward ye army of
the league: and that night making a bridge over the river of Ronco, and digging
down level the banks of the River, that the soldiers might in all places
pass over more easily, the eleventh day of April (being Ester day) the
Almaine footmen passed over the River by the bridge, but all the soldiers of
the forewarde, and middle battle thorough the Forde: the rerewarde led by
the Lord Iuo de Alegres, in the which were four hundredth men of arms,
remained on the bank of the River toward Rauenna: that if needs should be
they might aid the army, or else bridle the garrison and townsmen of Rauenna,
if they happened to sally out: but to keep the bridge, which had before ben built
upon Montone, he left Paris Scot with one thousand footmen, which being done,
thus he aranged his battles: the vauntguarde, (before whom went the great
ordinance) consisting of seven hundred men of arms, and Almaine footmen,
under the leading of the Duke of Ferrara, and the Seneschall of Normandy, was
placed on the bank of the river, which was on their right hand: so that the
footmen did flank the lefts wing of the horsemen. Nere to the footmen of the
auauntgard, were set the footmen of the mind^le ^^^t^ll all being right
thousand, part Gascoignes, and part of other Countries of France: the
captain of this battle was Alegres. Then further from the banks of the river
stood the rerewarde, who were Italian footmen, in number v. thousand,
conducted by Federicke de Bozzolo. This battle was flanked by all the Archers
on horseback, and the light horsemen being in number three thousand. Behind
all these battles, which stood not directly one before another, but embowed
like unto a Croisaunt or new Moon) were six hundred men of arms placed,
led by Seigneur de la Palice, and Cardinal Sanseuerino, Legate of the
council of Pisa, assembled against the Pope, a man of a mighty body, huge
heart, cladde from top to ^oe in very bright armor, accomplishyng rather
the function of a Captain, than a Cardinal or Legate. Foix left no peculiar
place or charge for himself, but picking out of all the whole army thirty of
the valiauntest Gentlemen, chose to be free, to the end he might have an eye
to every place, and to help all men.

And among all the rest was he most of mark, for the brightness and beauty
of his armor and cote of arms, with his countenance very merry, and his eyes
full of fierceness, and almost sprintkling out fire for joy. When he saw
all his host ranged to fight, mounting the baye of the river, that he might
inflame his soldiers hearts, he spoke with eloquence (as the report went more
than warriorlike, in this manner:

That which ye have so much wished (my fellow Soldiers) namely that ye might
once come to encounter your ennimtes in the champaine fields, see now fortune
which has been unto us in so many victories a benign mother has given us
this day, offering us an occasion of winning with immortal glory such a
victory, as never chanced within the memory of man any more magnificent,
for not only Rauenna and the cities of Romagna shall be wholly left unto your
power, but shall be the least part of the rewards of your prowess, for no man
more being left in Italy, that can set himself against us, we shall run
even to Rome without any impediment: where the inuncasurable riches of that
wicked Court, pulled so many ages out of the bowels of the Christians, shall
be your booty and pillage: and ye shall gain so many most proud
ornaments, so much silver so much gold, so many precious stones, so many
most rich prisoners, that the whole orb of the world shall envy your
fortune, from Rome with the same facility shall ye run forward to Naples, and
there revenge so many received injuries: When I do way your prowess, your
fortune and your glorious victories, gotten within the space of a few days:
when I do behold your countenaunces and deeds: when I do call to memory,
that there are very few of you that have not even before mine eyes, given
some notable prouf of your prowess, by doing of some egregions act, nothing
does come into my mind that may intercept from us the felicity of this
victory. Our enemies are the same Spaniardes that at our coming shame ully
fled out of Bolongue by night, they are the same men, that but few days ago,
gotie themselves out of our hands, by no other means than running away, and
taking the walls of Jmola and Fauentza, or the mountains. This nation never
fought with our armies in the Kingdom of Naples in any open or indifferent
place, but always with the advantage and help either of munitions, rivers or
ditches, not trustyng to their valor, but to deceit and ambushes. And yet these
Spaniards are not those old beaten fellows in the Neapolitane wars, but
fresh water soldiers, altogether unskillful, who never fought against any
other weapons, than the bows, arrows, and blunt lances of the Moors, yea
and yet by them a people weak of hodye, fearful of heart, unarmed and
ignoraunte of all Martial acts, were they overthrown the last year with
great shame in the Isle of Gerbe: Where this same Peter of Nauarro a Captain
of so great a name among them, Nau^rro was General of the Spanish footmen, a
man of great skill in undermining.
gave a notorious example by his runnng away, what difference there is
between shaking of walls by the furye of gunnepowder, and fyghtyng with true
hardynesse and fortitude. Now they being shut within a ditche, which they
made this night for tremblyng fear, and the footmen covered with a Rampire,
and trusting to their hooked Wagons, stand still, as though they should try
the battle with these childishe instruments, and not with valor of heart,
and strength of breaste and muscles: Believe me, our great ordinance shall
soon force them out of their holes and boroughes, and drive them into the
open and plain fields. Where it shall appear how far the force of the
Frenchemenne, the fierceness of the Almaines, the noble prowess of the
Jtalians, does excel the craftiness, and deceites of the Spaniardes. Nothing
can diminishe our glory, but that we do so much ouermatche them in number,
that is to wit, almost double: and yet to use this commoditye given unto us
by fortune, shall not be ascribed unto our dastardye, but unto their
imprudence and rashenesse, whom not courage nor valiantness, but the
authority of Fabricio de Colonna, for his promises rashelye made unto Mark
Anthony, or rather the Justice of God does draw thereunto, that the pride,
and unspeakable heinous factes of Julius the false counterfaite Pope, and so
many deceytes and treacheries of the King of Arragon, against the goodness
of our King, may be most iustlye punyshed. But why do I use many words?
why do I so long defer the victory by adhortations, altogether vnneedefull
unto Soldiers of so great valor, as I do fondlye spend time in speaking
unto you: March on (valiaunte hearts) in your appointed arraye, with full
assurance that I shall this day give the Empire of all Jtaly unto my Prince,
and the riches thereof unto you. I your Chieftaine will be with you at all
places, and as I usually have done, so now also will I lay open my life unto
all perilles: accompting my self the most fortunate Captain of all that ever
have been, since that through this days victory I shall make my Souldyours
the most glorious and the richest of all the soldiers and armies that have
been these three hundredth years.

This Oration being ended, and the air ringing with the noise of the trumpets,
drums and the most joyful acclamations of the whole army, they began to march
toward the Camp of their enemies, not two miles distant from the place where
they had passed over the river: which camp of the co^fede rats was pitched
along the bank of the river: on their left side was the river: and a ^^^che
(as deep as the shortenesse of the time had permitted so be m^^de) defenced
all the whole Camp on the right side. In the fore front they had left open
the space of twentye yardes, that they might make excursions with their horses:
As soon as they perceived that the Frenchemen were passed the river, they thus
ranged their battles: The vaunt guard of eyghte bundreth men of arms, led
by Fabricio de Colonua high Constable of Naples, was placed along the bank of
the River, unto whom were adjoined on the right hand six thousand footmen,
also along the river stood the middle battle of six hundredth men of arms,
flanked with four thousand footmen, the leader whereof was the Viceroy
himself, and with him were the Marquess of Palude, and the Popes Legate John
de Medici. Moreover along the same bank of the river stood the rerewarde
conducted by Caruaiall a Spaniarde: in that battle were four hundredth men of
arms, and four thousand footmen, all the light horsemen (whose General was
Daualos Marquess of Pescara, a very young Gentleman, but of passing great
hope) guarded the right side of the footmen behind, that they might succor
that part that fainted: the great ordinance was placed in the front of the men
of arms, and Peter de Nauarro, the General of the Spanishe footmen
accompanied with five hundredth horsemen, had tied himself tone certain place,
but had set at the ditche in the front of the footmen, thirtye Wagons like
unto the hooked Chariotes, used in ancient time: Whereupon he had placed
field pieces, and very long boar spears to sustain the more easily the
furious fease and chardge of the Frenchemen: in which order they expected the
impression and chardge of their ennemies strong army within the munition of
the ditche, the which counsel, as in the end it profited nothing, so did it
appear at the beginning to be pernicious, for it was the mind of Fabricio de
Coloma to invade the enemies as soon as they began to pass over the river,
thinking it more commodious to encounter with one only part of the ennimies,
than to abide in the camp defenced with a single ditch: but when Peter de
Nauarro (whose counsel the Viceroy did follow, as oracles) repugned, it was
decreed (though nothing prudently) that they should be suffered to pass over
the river. Now the Frenchmen beingcome within (...) hundredth pa^en of the
ditche, stayed when they saw their enemies kept themselves within their Camp,
not stirring one foot, least that otherwise they should give their enemy that
advantage which themselves desired to have: so both armies stood stone still
above two hours, but innumerable pellets were in the mean time shot out of
the great ordinance on either side, by whom, the French footmen suffered not
a little detriment: for Nauarro had planted his ordinance in such a place, as
he might much hurt them: but the Duke of Ferrara with great celeritie brought
a part of the great ordinance behind the army unto another wing of the
Frenchmen, where the archers on Horseback stood, which wing because the army
was of the form of a croysant, was almost on the back of the enemies, from
whence he began cruelly to flank their sides with very great detriment, and
namely of the Horsemen, for the Spanish footmen being brought by Nauarro into
a low place along the rampyre of the river, and by his commandment laid
flat on the ground, could not be hit. Fabricio called out with a loud voice,
and urged the Viceroy, with chicke sending of messengers, to begin the battle,
before they were absumed by the fury of the great ordinance: but Nauarro being
led by perverse ambition, would not assent, for since he had promised himself
victory, thorough the valor of the Spanish footmen, yea, though all the rest
of the army were slain, he thought that his glory would be the more
augmented, the more the detrimentes of the rest of the army were heaped. But
now the men of arms and light Horsemen, had sustained so great slaughter,
that it could be no longer borne, and with a miserable spectacle mingled with
horrible cries, now Horsemen, now Horses, fell down dead, now heads and
arms torn off from the rest of the body, were seen fleeyng in the air,
whereat Fabricio exelayming, And must we all (quoth he) shamfully dye through
the wilfulness and perverseness of one Maran, and must this army be utterly
all lost, not one enemy slain by us? Where be our so many tropheys of the
Frenchmen? must the honor of Spain and Jtaly perish for the pleasure of only
Nauarro? and when he had spoken these words, no longer staying either for the
signal, or commandment of the Viceroy, he drove his Horsemen over the
ditche, whom when the rest of the Horsemen followed, Nauarro was forced
presently to give the signal unto his Regiment, who rising up with great
ferocitie, encountered the Almaines which had now approached them, so all the
battles on both sides being mixed, a marvelous mighty battle was begun, and
the greatest without doubt, that Jtaly had seen in many years, for that at
Tarro was scarce any thing else, but a strong encounter of Horsemen, and the
battles in the Kingdom of Naples were rather disorderings of array, or rash
attemptes tha^ battles, and at Giaradaedda, the smallest part of the Venetian
power had fought: but here all of both sides, being mixed together in a
plain, without impedimente of waters or munitions, two mighty armies fought
with hearts firmly fastened, either to vanquish or dye, being inflamed not only
by peril, glory, and hope, but also with the mutual hatred that the nations
bare every one to other.

In the encounter of the Almayne footemenne with the Spanyardes, two Colonels
of great fame, named Jacob Emser an Almayne, and Zamude a Spanyard, fought as
it were by challenge before the frontes of the battles, in which fight, the
Spanyarde slaying his enemy, became victor. The Horsemen of the confederates
were not comparable unto the French Horsemen: besides, they had bin that day so
endamaged, and torn by the ordinance, that they were made far inferioure,
so that after they had awhyle sustained the force of their enemies, rather by
stoutness of heart, than strength of body, and Alegies sending for Palice with
the rereward, and also the thousand footmen, which had bin left at Montone,
had charged them on the side, and Fabricio de Colonnae fyghting very
valiauntly, had bin taken by the Souldyers of the Duke of Ferrara, they seeing
themselves no longer able to bear the force of their enemies, and also taught
by the examples of their chiefetaynes, turned their backs. For the Viceroy and
Caruaiall never tarrying the uttermost trial of the valor of the Souldyers,
fled, leading away with them the rerewarde almost whole and untouched, with
whom also fled Antony de Le^a, a man then of low state, but one that
afterward being exercised by the space of many years, in all degrees of
martial service, became a very famou^ ^enerall.

Now all the light Horsemenne were overthrown, and Pescara their Captain
wette with blood and wounds, was taken with him, and also the Marquess of
Palude, who had brought into the fight the second battle, through a
field full of ditches, bushes, and briars, which much disordred the array:
and besides that, the ground was now covered over with the carcasses of
Horses, and men slain, which was no small hynderaunce unto them. But yet the
Spanishe footmen, being forsaken of the Horsemenne, fought with incredible
fierceness, who although they had bin a little driven back at the first
encounter with the Almaynes, by reason of the strong ranks of their pykes, yet
after they came within the length of their Swords, and many of the Spanyardes
being covered with Targettes, had got between the legs of the Almaynes,
thrusting them in, in those unarmed places with their daggers, and commyttyng a
great slaughter, they were now come almost unto the mids of ye battle,
among whom, the Gascoigne footmen having gotten the way between the River,
and the Rampyre, had charged the Italian footemenne, who although they had
received great loss by the great ordinance, yet had repelled them to
their singular commendation, if Alegres had not given a violente charge on
them with his Horsemen, with greater force, than good fortune: for when he
saw his son Viuerroes slain in his sight almost at the very first
encounter, he unwilling to live after so great grief, flang in with his
Horse into the thyckest of his enemies, and fyghtyng as became a most valiaunte
Captain, after he had slain many, was slain himself.

The Italian footemenne, when they could no longer sustain so great a
multitude, began to shrink, but part of the Spanyardes coming to their
succoure, they kept still in the battle, and the Almayne footemenne being
oppressed by the other part of the Spanyardes, could scarce stand up any
longer. But now all the Horsemenne being put to flight, Foix with a great
multitude of Horsemen, set on the Spaniards, who rather retiring, tha^ driven
out of the field, did with their array in no part broken, take the way that
lies between the river and the high bank, marching with equal pace with
their front very thick of men, and so repelling the Frenchmen with the
strength thereof, began to retire and depart out of the field, which Nauarro
beholding, was more desirous of death than of life, and therefore not
departing out of the battle, was taken prisoner: but when Foix could not
abide to see the Spanishe footemenne thus go away safely, and victor-like,
with their whole ranks unbroken, and perceived that the victory was
imperfect, unless they were broken as well as the rest, in great fury charged
on the tail of them with a troop of Horsemen: but he incontinently being
enclosed by them, and thrown off from his Horse, or as diverse say, oppressed
with the foundering of his Horse, was slain with a pyke thrust into his side:
and certesse, if they ought to wish for death, as the common opinion is, that
are come unto the highest degree of felicity, then doubtless this noble
Gentleman's death was most fortunate, having gotten so glorious a victory. He
dyed a very young man, having now won among all men immortal fame, for that
within the space of three months, being a General almost before he was a
Souldyer, he had with incredible celeritie and ferocitie gotten so many
victories. The Lord Lautrech (his Cousin german) being hurt with twentye
wounds, lay besides him almost dead, but being carried to Ferrara, was saved
by the diligent cure of the Chirurgians. Thorough the death of Foix, the
Spanishe footmen were suffered to go their ways without impeachment. The rest
of the army was now scattered and put to flight, all the bag and baggage
taken, together with the ensigns and ordinance: and ye Popes Legate, John de
Medici, Fabricio de Colonna, Nauarro, and ye Marquesses of Palude, Bitonto, and
Pescara, and many other Princes, the chief of the nobility, and men of name
of the Spaniards, and Neapolitanes. The number of them that were slain in this
battle, is altogyther uncertain, yet among the variety of many reports, most
do affirm, that on both sides, there were at the least ten thousand slain,
of whom the third part were Frenchmen, and the rest of their enemies: but
without all doubt, according unto the common mannet of Mars, the valiauntest
and the stoutest men, among whom of the Papists or the Popes bands was
Raphaell de Pazi, a Captain of famous renown, and innumerable were hurt. But
without controversy, the loss on the victors side was far the greater, by
reason of the death of Foix, Alegres, and many of the French nobility, and of
Jacob, and other of the valiauntest Captains of the Almaine footmen, unto
whose prowess this victory bought with no little effusion of blood, was
chiefly attributed. Moreover, many of the Captains of the Gascoignes and
Picardes (the which nations that day lost al their glory among the Frenchmen)
were slain with Monsieur de Molard, but the death of Foix surpassed all other
losses, with whom the courage, strength, life, and fierceness of that army
was utterly extinguished. The greatest part of the vanquished that escaped out
of the battle, fled unto Cesena, and from thence unto farther places,
neither did the Viceroy stay any where, before he came to Ancona, whither he
brought but very few Souldyers, many being spoiled and slain in their flight,
for the Duke of Vrbine not only stirred up the Countrymen against the^, but
also sent Souldyers to do the like in Pesaro, they only escaped safely that
passed through the dominions of the Florentines. But although that after this
battle the victor army took and sacked Rauenna, yet within very short time,
when the covetous Treasoucer of Normandy to save charges, had dismissed the
Italian Souldyers, and part of the men of arms had returned into France, and
the Emperor had revoked the Almaynes, they were by a new army of Switzers,
that came down to the Popes aid, with whom also joined the Venetians, quite
dispossessed of the whole Duchy of Milane, and all that ever the French King
had in Jtaly besides.

The Battle of Riotta or Nouara, fought in the Duchy of Milan, betvveene John
Trivulzi, and the Lord Tremouille, Generalles for the French King Jews the
twelfth on the one side, and Maximilian Sforza, the Duke of Milan, and the
Switzers on the other, in Anno. 1513. out of Iouius his history.
THe French King Jews the twelfth, not brooking his loss of Milan, chose two
Captains of great authority and skill to pass the Alps: they were Trivulzi
and Tremouille: and also sent for Robert de la March out of the land of Luke,
with the black regiment of Almaynes, and Jews Lord Beamont out of the
frontiers of Navarre, with those bands of Gascoignes that served Signeur de la
Palice a little before at Pampelona against the Spaniards.

Among them he also mingled certain ensigns of footmen, consisting of very
chosen men: for then every Gentleman which was not appointed unto an Horse,
did with singular cheerfulness think it for his worship to serve on foot.

All this power being very well appointed, with a great furniture of great
ordinance, he commanded to hasten into Jtaly. Maximilian Sforza the Duke of
Milane, having intelligence of this provision in France against him,
solliciteth the Switzers to come into Lumbardy in his defense, the which he
easily obteyneth. And first of all, the Hamans or Majors of the Cantons of
Vry, Switz, and Vnderwald, as next unto Jtaly, passed the Alps, whom the
bands of Glaron, Zuch, Lacerne, Sciphausen, Zuriche, and Berne followed in
another company. And in the third and last company were five thousand
footmen, under the conduct of Altosaxe an expert Captain. But Sforza being
dismayde with the unlooked for reuolting of Sacranoro Visconti, who kept
about him at Milane a great number of desperate unthrifts, as well of the
nobility, as other, joined with the first company of the Switzers, and went
to Nouara, there to exspect (far from privy awaytes and Treason) the
conunyng of the rest of the Switzers.

The French power came before the Town of Nouara, but when they had
intelligence that the second company of the Switzers were at hand, and also
that Altosaxe was at Galarita, they withdrewe to a place called RIOTTA, twentye
furlongs from Nouara, near to the River of Mora. But as soon as ever the
second company of the Switzers had entered the Town, and broken their fast,
the Captains assembled together to consulte what was best to be done, where
Craffe the Haman of Zurich rising up, said, I besieche you invincible
breethren, suffer not the exployte that ye have with valiaunte hearts
determined, to be corrupted through the untimely staying for Altosaxe and his
company, for the safest and happiest way to good success will doubtless fall
out, to be only by celeritie. Neither need we (that are rightly and valiauntly
resolved) ought else than speedy execution, least we may nothing courageously
fail unto so great occasion which is offered unto us, to put us in hope of a
fair day, which yet may be prevented by a light momente of time, for ye a
few bands of invincible valor will be enough to oppress the enemies, whylest
they think we will attempt nothing before Altosaxe be joined with us, let us
therefore use their error, and by an unlooked for onset, bring suddayne terror
not without assured slaughter and flight, into the hearts of the enemy, puffed
up with unadvised pride, and erroneous opinion: doubtless we have already
vanguished, if the victory conceived and assured by this honorable devise and
counsel, be presently pursued by fearelesse hearts, and valiant arms.
Craffe had no sooner ended his speech, but all the Captains and ensign
bearers without stay, assented unto him, and gravely consulted upon the manner
how to attache the battle, whereupon the Souldyers were commanded to refresh
their bodies with meat and rest, and to repair unto the ensigns after ye
second watch, and then ye Captayns should tell the^ before ye dawning, what they
would have done. Now whilst all men's minds were musing on ye event of the
future fight, and the Sun was now going down, behold, a wonderful chance
hapened: al ye fre^chme^s dogs forsaking their Camp, entered Nouara in one
great troop, and began to lick the hands and legs of the Switzers that
warded, and wagging their tails, and laying down their ears, fawned now upon
one, and the^ upon another of them, as though they were now become their
Masters, or shortly after should. But the Switzers (to the end they might make
a show, that they meant some other thing than that they intended indeed,)
commanded ye Drums to be sounded all the whole night, now in this part of
the City, and now in that, to make the espyes, if there were any in the
City, to believe that they would issue out of the Town, and thereby keep
their enemies, who they knew had bin in armor all the whole day on
Horseback, armed also all the night long. But they commanded all their own
men to strengthen their bodies with fleepe, and to stay for day, that every man
might in the clear light show his valor, with a noble contention for honor.
For these are the most severe laws of the Switzers, that whosoever shall in
the sight of the army do things for fear, which are shameful and unmeet
for valiant men, shall be incontinently slain by their next fellows, so
that the greater fear does overcome the less, and for doubt of a shameful
death, an honorable death is not feared. Now a little before it was light, the
Captains chose out of all their army (which was about nine thousand
footmen) one thousand men of approved prowess, who should have the charge of
eyghte falkons, and accompany Maximilian and his Horsemen, who were very few,
but of the chief of the nobility. The rest did cast themselves into two
battles, and marched all whyst without sound of Drum toward their enemies
two diverse ways. But Triuulzi, who although he were accounted a Captain of
approved and beaten wisdom, yet thought nothing less than that a few, and
those weary footmen, would before Altosaxe were come, issue out against a
very strong power, or attempt any thing touching the fortune of the battle.
When he understood that the enemies power was in sight, reyseth up Tremouille,
and the rest of the Captains, commands the signals to be sounded, and the
ordinance to be placed against the enemy, and all things that he had learned
by experience and discipline, to be administered according to the necessity of
the peril. The shortenesse of the time was such, and the hearts or the
enemies so ready to fight, that the French horsemen had scarce time to bridle
their horses, and put on their head pieces: as they which had stood a great
part of the day and night in armor, attending what should be commanded
them: and at length though very late, when news was brought that all was
quiet at Nouara, had got them into their cabines to take their rest. But the
light horsemen, as men sooner ready, in good time enoughe ran forth with a
very long wing stretched toward the left hand, and met with the thousand
Switzers as they were coming, who, that they might avoid the great
ordinance, that now tempested upon them, marched toward the river of Mora,
fetching a little compass about, and then minded to pass over the river by a
bridge, and set upon the backs and tents of the enemies. Thus the Switzers
marching on toward the bridge in a broad way, began to be torn in pieces
with the ordinance which flanked them on the side, and to be vehemently
pressed by the horsemen. But then Mottine with unappalled heart altered his
counsel, and willed Maximilian (who was in great danger, the Epirotes
insulting round about him) to depart out of the fight, and incontinently to
return unto the City, that so he might keep the head of the wars, which
then lay open unto the acerbitie of fortune, for to enjoy the noble hoped
victory. But when he nobly refused so to do, and with constant heart desired
that he might be suffered to take the chance of common fortune, two pety
Captains, and so many ensign bearers, took his horse by the bridle, and
pulling off the crest from his helmet, and casting about him an old cloak to
bide his coat armoure, led him out of the field, forcing him to return unto
the city with a troop of horsemen, that he being a daungerlesse beholder of
their prowess, might there exspecte the news of speedy victory. Mottine
being thus delivered of that woefulness, relieth his swaying battle, which had
now lest three of their Falkons, wythdraweth the wounded into the mids of
the battle, and with great force beats back the insulting Epirotes, and
slaying Alexio Bosigno a noble Geeke their captain ^^ite defeateth them. And
with the same fease is also carried into the ennimyes Camp, and there the
drudges and stragglers being slain, and the Soldiers of the station
disordered, took the carriages and baggage: But a little before these things
were done by Mottine, an other company taking a longer iourneye thoroughe the
Corn fields then grown up, and thereby receiving small hurt by the
ordinance, had charged the side of the enimye.

The French power was divided into three battles: Tremouille and De la
March having the leadyng of the wyngs, and Trivulzi of the middle battle:
and the Batallion of the Lancequenetz had gotten them within a ditche
between the battles of the horsemenne, because their Trenche being of a
new and wounderfull workemanshippe invented by Roberte de la March, for to
enclose them against the chance of battle, could not be pitched and set
up in that suddayne coming of the ennimie.

Upon this Esquadron of the Almaynes, the Switzers brynging about their
battle toward the right hand, courageously turned them selves, for that
they understood the victory would be easily obtained, after they had once
defeated the chiefest force of their enemies army.

The French Captains seeing this, incontinentely commanded the great
ordinance to be shot off upon them: the ranks to be broken thoroughe
with great slaughter, and anon after the men of arms also vehemently
charged them on the left side. In this tumulte the Amans of Berne and Zuche
were slain: yet the Soldiers nothing appalled with their Captains deaths,
neither with their own peril, nor the horrible slaughter of their fellows,
gathering their strength together, do cast them selves into a ring, and with
great valor do propell the horsemen: and straightway, as they had before
determined, passing over the ditche, set upon the Almaines. Whervppon
incontinently began a bloudye and cruel fight, yea and that without either
words or noise on either side, saving only an horrible clashyng of armor and
weapons, and the soft sighs of them that fell down dead.

The Almaines that they might revenge the slaughter of their countrymen the
last year at Pauia, and now by new renown redeem the glory of warfare, lost
fourteen years before at Bruderholtz in the confines of Basil, fought very
fiercely. But the Switzers, that they might yet one day quite destroy their
old and peculiar enemies, fellows that had run out of Germany, and served
the French King in reproach of the Emperor, were no whitte behind either in
strength or feruencie of courage.

But whilst the Switzers and Almaines thus fought at push of pike, news was
brought unto Trivulzi and Tremouille, that the baggage was taken, those that
were appointed to keep the Camp slain, and all places filled full of tumulte
and slaughter. The fame whereof, so troubled the Frenchemens minds, that a
great part of the horsemen (every man being careful for his bag and
baggage,) ran thither without commandment, to recover the pray.

Also in another quarter almost at the same instant, the third company or
battle of the Switzers, showed themselves at the front of the Frenchemen,
which battle (whilst the Frenchmen had in vain shot off their ordinance
into the woodde that stood before them, by reason the Switzers to deceive the
ennimies had politikely left among the trees certain unprofitable drudges, to
make a show of armed men) had crepte along by a side way, by little and
little stoupyng and traylyng their pykes after them.

And now so great was their contempt of the flying bullets and so terrible
their chardge, that the French and Nauarrine footmen (their Captain Beamont
being slain) and two bands of Genouese and Salucians, were quickly defeated,
and also their ordinance taken and turned on the backs of them that fled.
When the rest of the horsemen saw the great ordinance gotten by the enemy,
in whom the Frenchemen had in all wars reposed more trust, than in their
arms and prowess, that the Almaines were now almost quite destroyed, their
tents taken, the enemy overthrowing all, and now large lords of the field,
between shame and fear they turned their backs. When all men were thus
dismayed, the Captains themselves were fearlesse enough (considering the
fearfulness of the state) and went about to rallye the ranks that were
disordered, and turned them selves toward the dissonant cries of their own
fellows, made them to abide and fight, encouraged the petye Capitaines and
ensign bearers to put away fear, and so long to sustain a few pesants of
weary, unarmed and now weakened with wounds, until the light armed had
enclosed them. The Lansquenetz bear the brunt of the battle, and the fight is
repaired in all places. But the horsemen being nothing moved with the words of
the encouraging and commanding captains, shamefullye fly: For the Switzers
although their Captain Mottine were slain by a piece of ordinance, yet
having gotten the Camp, did al bloody fiercely invade the left side of the
horsemen, and on the right side, and on the back a greater power with terrible
pikes, did very sharply urge the affrighted and disordered horsemen. There
perished in repairing the field, Monfalcon Captain of the Duke of Albanies
company of horsemen, and Coriolano Trivulzi, a young Gentleman of singular hope.
But the Almaines, who leesing half their men and two ensigns and their
General Floranges grievously hurt, had fought very constantly a long time:
Now when they saw themselves to be forsaken by the horsemen, and the rest
of the footmen in all quarters to be defeated, and the great ordinance taken:
thinking that flight was shameful, and yet nothing safe, did set the points of
their weapons upright according unto their manner and yielded themselves,
seeking mercy of the victor enimys. In this grievous vproare Robert de la
March Lord of Cedan, attached with impotent sorrow to see his two sons the
lords Floranges and Gemese enclosed by the enimye, and almost in desperate
danger of life, burst in even into the midst of his enemies battle with a
troop of horsemen, and took them up lying among the dead bodies miserably
berayed and embrued with the blood of their wounds, and being half dead,
laid them ouerthwarte the neekes of two horses, like unto two cloak bags:
and thus with singular praise both of fatherly pity and warlike prowess, he
carried them away, preserving their lives to purchase renown in future and more
fortunate fields. Thus the Switzers fighting in three companyes or battles,
within an hour and an half dyspatched and finished a famous battle, and a
most weyghtye war. Neither yet although the Switzers saw so many of their
enemies lie slain before their face can they once to the spoil,
notwithstanding that precious furniture of household, and all the baggage of the
rich army did allure their minds: for they remembering their country
discipline, which does not permit them to take any armed man prisoner in the
battle, nor to pursue any that flies: stood still a great part of the day,
fearing lest the French horsemen incited either through the policy of their
Captains, or their own shame, would come back again, and appresse them
while they were busied in spoilyng the dead. But their enemies ran away
with such fear and pertinacie: that Trivulzi galloping to and fro all dustie
and hoarse with crying unto them, was not able either by fair or foul
speech, or the authority of General, to stay the ensigns or to retain the
horsemen that casting away their lances, gallopped away foremost. It is well
known, that Grittie the Venetian Prouiditor, who being a companion of this
unlucky journey ran away with them, oftentimes said among this company of
hasting horsemen: Ye old horsemen that flyng away so fast upon the spur
to day, be not the men of arms of the Venetians, but those noble Gentlemen of
France, that used to call them women runaways. Certes it never happened before,
that Captains, (at all other times invincible and fortunate,) being furnished
with so great an army, were defeated by a few footmen, fortune now listing
to sport a little. It is reported that the French horsemen might have bin all
wholly destroyed in their flighte, if Maximilian Sforza had had but two hundredth
men of arms, for not one of the French horsemen carried lance beyond
Sesithes: (so great was their heat to escape) yet a while after Siluio
Sabello, and Corradino Cribelly, with certain light horsemen, pursued them even
to the town of Trecato. But the Contadmes or Pesantes running out of the
fields and ^ainlets unto the spoil, cruelly slew where they saw any booty,
the dispersed and fearful Frenchemenne wearyed, and quite spente, at ditches,
hedges and all other places that did let their course. The same day the
Switzers gathering together the slain bodies of their countrymen, carried them
on their shoulders into the City, that the last honors might justly be done
unto them that had singularly well deserved of the common wealth.

There were slain of them in this victory about a thousand three hundredth,
of whom they brought into the Town above seven hundredth torn into pieces
with the great ordinance, and almost as many were wounded. But on the French
part were slain to the number of eight thousand of all sorts. Among the
Captains of the Switzers, the almost monstrous valor of Jordin of Vnderwalde
was specially noted, who (by the credible report of many,) slew twenty of his
ennimies with his halberde, carrying away the just rewards of assured praise.
But Maximilian being very joyful for so happy success, called the Soldiers
together, and the tears trickling down his cheeks, and scarf able to speak
for joy, he gave them all hearty thanks, and that which might be a gift of
present pleasure, he gave them in reward of their prowess all the victualles
that was taken, to be divided among them, besides the ordinance and all the
spoil and pray that was gotten. But the trenche that was taken from the
enemy, he set up in a public place, as a monumente of the victory: And
forasmuch as we have seen the manner of the making thereof, we do think it
good to describe the same, that it may be both a pattern and also profitable
unto the posterity.

A square plotte of fifty paces every way, like unto a small Camp being
measured out, four strong posts sharped at the end, were driven into the
ground at every angle one, standing above the ground navel high: the sides
were defenced with lesser posts or stakes, a certain space being left
between post and post: between the posts went rayles, which they might take
off and on, they being fastened together with iron books or claspes. The
Almaines stood within this munition, which was defenced round about with
almost an hundredth Harquebuzers a crocke. Through the defense thereof, Sedan
had thought verily that the force of his assayling enemies would not only have
been sustained, but clean dashed broken and defeated, for he was of the
belefe, that the Switzers before they could come to use their pikes and to
hand strokes, should be paid for their inconsiderate invasion: It being
likely that the esquadron terrible, for their pikes, and safe and invincible
for their strength, would defend the trench, and at length opening the munition,
break out upon the disordered enemies, and so obtain an undoubted victory.

But this engine invented by a warlike wit, and brought over the Alps with
so great labor and charges, as it did greatly delight the eyes of the
beholders both for the novelty of the fashion and the hope of victory: so
Fortune after her wonted guise scorning such subtle inventions, took success
quite away from reason, and the work, when it should have taken most
effect. But this deceived the Almaines, that they thought it not needful that
day to set up their trenche, which lay in the Wagons, seeing the camp did
then go back from the enemy. When we conferred with Tremouille at Bolongne
about these matters, he did not fondly lay the fault in Trivulzi, as though
that he would not encampe (as Tremouille had persuaded him) on his own
lands, for destroying of the grass that then was ready to be mowen. But
Trivulzi as he that had never been vanquyshed before, when he declared much
of the euente of this battle, did refer it wholly unto the injury that was
fatal unto his renown: for he said, that the skilfullest Captain in the
world could not by any me anes redress rash men and Soldiers, made stark
staring mad by degenerate fear.

The Battle of Ginghat, fought in Picardie betvveene Henry the eight King of
England, and Monsieur de Piennes, general for Jews the French king, in Anno
Domin. 1513.
WHen that HENRY the eight king of England, besieged the City of Tyrwin with
three camps, of whom himself co^ducted one, the Earl of Shrewsbury an other,
and the Lord Herbert the third: he had intelligence yt Jews the French king
had levied an army under the conduct of the Lord Piennes, for to victual the
City, which was sore oppressed with penury. Whereupon king HENRY passed over
the river with all the retinue of his own camp, and his ordinance, for to
impeach the French passage in that part. In the mean season a French man
being taken in skirmishe, in hope of pardon of his ransom, declared that the
French army with their full power and strength, were coming from Blangie, to
the number of fifteen thousand horsemen to aid Terwyn, on that side of the
water. And to the intent that the army of the Earl of Shrewsbury and she Lord
Herbert should not aid the King: there were appointed five thousand of the
fifteen thousand, on the other side of the water, to invade them on the other
side of the water.

The King had no sooner pitched his field, and set in order his ordinance,
but that he was advertised by the Northern prickers, that the Frenchemen to the
number of twelve thousand were coming forward in arraye of battle. Whereupon
some counseled the King to take down his tents, but the King said, I will
this day that my field be made and set in as royal wise as may be, and all
my rich tents set up: which was done. Then the King called the Lord
Darcie, and commanded him to keep his field, treasure, ordinance, and other
stuff: who was loath to go from his master, but by straight commandment.
Then every man prepared himself to battle, resorting unto the standard, the
horsemen marched before the footmen by the space of a mile: still came
Curriours bearing tidings that the French army approached. The King bad set
forward in the name of God and S. George. The Almaines (that served the King)
seeing this, to what purpose it was not known, suddaynely embattayled
themselves on the left hand of the King, and left the front or breast of the
Kings battle bare.

As the King was thus marching forward toward the battle, to him came the
Emperor Maximilian with thirty me of arms, he and all his company armed in
one suit, with read Crosses: then by the counsel of the Emperor, the King
caused certain field pieces to be laid on the top of a long hill or bank,
for the out-scourers. Thus the Kings Horsemen, and a few archers on Horseback
marched forward. The King would feign have bin before with the Horsemen, but
his Counsel persuaded him the contrary, and so he tarried with the
footemenne, accompanied with the Emperor.

The Frenchmen came on in three ranks, six and thirty men's thickness, and
well they perceived the Kings battle of footmen marching forward: the Earl
of Essex, Captain of the Horsemen, and Sir John Peche with the Kings Horsemen,
and the Burgonions to the number of eleven hundredth, stood with banners
displayde in a valley. The Lord Wallon, and the Lord Ligny with bastard Emery
(Burgonions) and their bands, to the number of four hundred Horsemen, severed
themselves, and stood aside from the Englishmen: so then the Englishmen were
but seven hundredth, yet they with banner displaied, removed up to the top of
the hill, and there they met with Sir Henrye Guilforde, with an hundredth tall
Archers on Horseback, which had askryed the Frenchmen. Now on the top of
the hill was a fair plain of good ground: on the left hand a low wodde, and
on the right hand a fallow field. The Lord Wallon and the Burgonions kept them
aloof, then appeared in sight, the Frenchmen with banners and standerdes
displayed. Then came to the Captains of the Englishmen of arms, an English
officer of arms, called Clarenseux, and said, in Gods name set forward, for
the victory is youres, for I see by them that they will not abide, and I will
go with you in my coat of arms. Then the Horsemen did set forward, and the
archers alighted, and were et in order by an hedge all along a village called
Bomy: the Frenchmen came on with three and thirty standerdes displayed, and
the Archers shot apace, and galled their Horses, and the English Spears set
on freshly, crying Saint George, and fought valiantly with the Frenchmen, and
threw down their Standerdes, the dust was great, and the cry more, but
suddaynely the Frenchmen shocked to their Standerdes, and fled, and threw
away their Spears, Swords, and Maces, and cut off the bardes of their Horses
to run the lighter. When the hinder part saw the former part fly, they
fled also, but the sooner for one cause, which was this. As the Englishmen
mounted up the hill, the Horsemenne of Albany (commonly called Stradiotes) were
coming downewardes on the side of the hill before the French host, which
suddaynely saw the banners of the English Horsemen, and the kings battle
following upward, thinking to them that all had bin Horsemen, then they cast
themselves about and fled: the Frenchmen were so fast in array, that the
Stradiotes could have no entry, and so they ran still by the ends of the
raunges of the french army: and when they behind saw the fall of the
Standerdes and their Stradiotes in whom they had great confidence, return,
they which were farthest off, fled first, then up praunced the
Burgonions, and follows the chase, which was pursued three miles. This
battle was of Horsemen to Horsemen, but not in equal number, for the
Frenchmen were ten to one, which had not bin seen before t^me, that the
English Horsemen got the victory of the men of arms of France. The
Frenchmen call this battle, The Battle of Spurs, because they ran away so
fast on Horseback.

This Battle was fought the sixtenth of August, in the which was taken the
Duke of Longuile, the Lord Cleremonde, and many other noble men, to the number
of twelve score, and also all the standerdes and banners, which with the
prisoners were brought to the Kings presence. The Burgonions kept their
prisoners, and brought them not to sight. The same went, that Monsieur de la
Palice was by them taken, and let go. But the other syue thousand Horsemen,
that had bin appointed to invade the Earl of Sherewsbury, came not down, but
only skirmished with Sir Rice ap Thomas. But the Citizens sallied, and were
valiauntly beaten back by the Lord Herbert. After this victory the City
yielded, as also not long after did the famous City of Tournay.

Flodden field fought between James the fourth King of the Scotts, and
Thomas Earl of Surrey, General for Henry the eyghte King of England in Anno.
1513. out of Paulus Iouius.
Whilst Henrye the eyghte King of England thus molested the French King in
France, James the Scottish King incited by the French King, and also egged on
by his own natural hate toward England, which he well hoped now in the
absence of the King greatly to annoy, proclaimed wars against the King of
England, and withal entered his land with a great army, besieged Norrham
Castle, took it, and made it level with the ground, and from thence marched
(wasting with fire and sword) to besiege the strong town of Berwike. In the
mean time the Earl of Surrey whom King Henry for his approved fidelity and
prowess had left behind him in England his Lieutenaunt, with a power to
keep the borders toward Scotland, leuying an army, went against the Scotte,
who miserably wasted all the Country. There were with him the Lord Dacres,
warden of the West marches, a renowned man for all martial praise, Edward
Stanley, and Bastard Heron, which Heron brought with him a strong troop of
Horsemen, which he being of late banished both from England and Scotland, had
cunningly trained in robberies, and other with aides, which were leuyed in all
parts by the Queen, for at ye brute of the new wars, not only ye
countries near unto the Scots, as lying open to the danger, but also the
shires far off of their own free wills, rather for hatred than fear,
hasted to the Earl, all men taking very impatiently the injury of violating
the league lately concluded between the two Kings.

James had then lodged his army on the top of an hill, which the
inhabitants do call Floddon, in a place very strong both by art and nature,
for on the left hand a great marishe and slimie gulfes, ouergrowen with tuffes
of Willowes, did possess all the plain underneath the hill. On the right
hand ran the river of Till at the foot of the hill with deeper Channel, and
swifter stream, than could be passed over by foorde. Their backs were
defensed with stiepe hills and very thick woddes. But at the front where
nature had only left a gentle coming up, and only way unto it, king James had
cast up a ditche, and placed all his ordinance on the inner bank thereof, and
so strongly defensed himself, that to be entrenched round, or assaulted from
the lower ground, he could not without pernicious encounter. When Surrey was
come thither, he wo^dering at the iniquity of the place, thought it not good
to assault the Kings Camp, but sent an Harauld unto the Scottishe King with a
message, the sum whereof was this, That king James in breaking the solemn oath
of peace, and in polluting the rightes of most holy inviolable kindred and
affinity, by inferring wars unto Henry, when he was now absent, by burning
his Towns, wasting his Countries, and murdering his Subjects, when they
feared no such thing, had done most wickedly and cruelly, therefore he was come
with an army to revenge the said injuries. King James himself should choose
an indifferent place, and certain day to darreine battle, for he would
without any staying or doubting, give him battle as soon as ever he would
permit any equality. Then James (as he was a Prince of a stately stomach,
and tried hardiness,) courteously speaking unto the Harrolde, thanked Surrey,
and openly commended him, that of his own accord he desired the field,
whereas he had long feared with woeful and troubled mind, that he would by all
sleightes rather have avoided the same: and therefore according unto that
courage, he should make ready his weapons, and the third day after expect
the araunged battles of the Scotts in the open fields, that there he would
severely set in judgment upon those injuries which he had untimely and
reprochfully mentioned, and at the day prefixed, make an end by annes both of
all old and new controversies. Surrey was encamped in a plain, three miles
from the enemy, and there raunged his army: but James although he were ready
to fight, yet kept himself within his camp and munitions, because all the
most expect of his nobility, much misliked to join in battle: but above all
other, the Earl of Huntley (than whom there was none in that army accounted
either more valiant or more politic) spoke in the counsel Chamber so loud,
that the guard also might hear him: that there was nothing more foolish or
vain, than to fight at the appoyntmente of the enemy, and at his will and
pleasure to adventure the fortune of a pitched field, that the King should
keep himself in that commodious place, and by lingering, ^lude his fierce
foes, considering there was in the eminies camp great penury of bread,
neither could victuals be easily brought out of the inward parts of England,
the way being very foul, by reason of continual rain that had fallen, that
ye King within short time by sitting still, and doing nothing rashly, should
not miss to fight very fortunately, and give the enemies (being tamed by the
iniquity of the place, and lack of victuals) a safe slaughter unto his
Souldyers. Besides these words of Hu^tley, many things accounted for
foretokens, although they were thought to be vain, and proceeding of chance,
had stryken Religion and new terror into the Kings heart, for as he was
sytting in counsel with the Captains, deliberating about the manner of the
battle, an Hare lept out of his tent, and being stryken at with a thousand
weapons, escaped untouched through the mids of the station. Moreover, the
Myce had grawen asunder the string and buckle of his headpeece: and the report
went, that the vayles of his inner tent were in the morning besprinckled with a
bloody dew. When the King for these causes came not forth into the field,
Surrey who for sundry inco^modities could no longer stay in those morish foul
and filthy places, neither did think that the King would fight unless he were
compelled by extreme necessity, dislodged, and leaving the enemy on the left
hand, and passing over the river of Till, marched unto a better place at the
end of Barme wodde, that he might there in a more fertile and safe place
refreshe his Souldyers, whom with great iourneys and thin diet, all those
three days he had sore wearyed, and in the mean time expect new power, and
according to the mouings of the enemies, who had with their multitude filled
the next hills, he likewise should follow a new trade, in administering the
wars. Nothing divided the two Camps, but only the River of Till, neither did
either party absteyne from tempesting with great ordinance, and other shot.
But a hill at the hither side of the river, rising up gently a mile high,
served Surrey to great use, for it defended the front of his Camp from all
injury of the enemies ordinance. From that hill Thomas Lord Howard Surreys
son, a young Gentleman of passing prowess, surueying the hills ye lay about
it, upon whom the enemy was encamped, and the plain beneath, shows his
father that the Scotte might easily be excluded from Scotland, or else being
gotten out of his strong lodging, be brought to fight, if he would again
transport his army over Till, in that place where before he had come over, and
fetching no great compass about, would show himself on the back of the
enemy, as far within as the streightes of the hill would suffer. Surrey who
had whollye bente his mind to fight, sent certain men very skillful in
the Country, and also in martial discipline, to view the place, who upon
their return, when they reported unto him the very same, and his sons
counsel was confirmed by all men's opinions, he incontinently commanded the
army to dislodge, and three miles from thence passed over the River by two
bridges in two companyes at one time. But James coniecturing Surreys intent,
least by remaining still on those hills, and being intercluded from Scotland
much against his dignity, he should leese free liberty to forage, and
therewithal too, (which he thought much apperteyned to reteyne his
authority) least by detracting the fight, and being like unto one besieged,
he should seem to repose more trust in the place, and the munitions, than in
the prowess and valor of his Souldyers, straight way dislodged, and marched
directly to take the next hill, whereof he greatly feared his enemy would
have prevented him, but it was brought to pass thorough his own celeritie,
and the industry of the drudges of the army, who had at the Kings departure
(as was commanded them) filled all the Country with one smoke and black
myste, by setting on fire the Souldyers Cabins, the straw and all the rest of
the forage, that King James was come to his purposed place, before Surrey, who
was but one mile from him, either perceived his departure, or could see the
long train of his marchyng army. King James thus possessing the top of the
hill, Surrey came with all his power unto the foot thereof, and staying there
a little while, determined with himself, seeing the hill was neither very
high nor hard to ascend to climb it, and to fight before the enemy had
fortifyed his camp, and then calling together the Souldyers, he declared unto
them into what place and case they were come, that on the one side the high
banks of the river, and on the other the stiepe hills, that ran along many
miles, took quite away from them al ways of flight, yea and all hope of life,
unless they fought lustyly, and vanquished valiauntly, and therefore they
should couragiouslye encounter their forsworn enimyes, who breaking the
league, thought thorough the occasion of the Kings absence, to win the
Empire of the whole Islande: neither should their hearts be troubled with
their great multitude, for it had but sufficiently tried by the often
victories of their ancestors, how small strength and constancy there is in
Scotts, that God himself would be with them in the field, as he has
always heretofore bin justly against the breakers of their faith, and the
contemners of his and man's laws and Religion, only the Souldyers should
rete^ne still the memory of their old prowess, for by the consent of all
men, the most just cause of wars is to propell injuries, and defend by
arms their Houses, Children Wives, and that which seems to be much more
renowned, the dignity of the Papal liberty, the which with noble heart,
and holy counsel, had taken upon him to defend, and so accordinglye by
Gods assistaunce, had driven the ungodly oppugners of the inviolable
Majesty, being discomfyted in battle, their Captains taken prisoners, and
their strong City won into the inner parts of France, and therefore they
should under the conduct of the same God, fight against men defy^ed with the
same contagion of polluted Religion: and if they made account of the honor of
their Country, the Kings estimation, and finally their own glory and safety,
that they should follow him their Captain, ready either to vanquish
gloriously, or else to dye honorably. The Souldyers cried out incontinently,
that he should give the signal of fight, and nothing doubt to darreyne
battle, yea though in a place of great disadvantage: for they stoutely said,
that they would with their wounding weapons climb the top of the hill, and
never return into the Camp but victors. Then Surrey in this hope and
couragiousnesse of the Souldyers, divided all his power into three battles. The
fore ward he assigned unto the Lord Howarde, wherein he also placed Edmunde
another of his sons to govern a part thereof ( Hall makes it a wing.) He
himself led the middle battle, and ordained Sir Edward Stanley to be
Captain of the rereward. He placed the Lord Dacres with the Horsemen for a
battle of succoure, and dysposed the great ordinance in certain distaunces
among the ranks, and in the front, and so with a round march makes toward
the enemy. In the mean time, when the King saw the glistering of the armoure,
and the several battles of the enemy (as he might very well from the hill)
thinking that occasion of victory was that day given him, if he being then
superioure both by the sight, the ground, and also the number of men, did out
of hand fight with the enemy, he gave the signal of battle, and turning unto
the nobility of his Realm, who stood near unto him, used such a like
speech: Seeing most valiant compeeres in arms, that we shall this day fight
with better condition and more advantage, than ever any of our auncestoures
has heretofore done with this enemy, remember that now is the time of
supreme occasion to revenge your injuries, which ye feared would never have
come, and have hitherto in vain wished for, when ye suffered all villainies and
reproaches of these most proud enemies: but we that have borne these things so
long at home with sighing for vain anger, often crying unto God for revenge,
and at length in this most goodly occasion, have taken so just and so needful
arms, should doubtless show our selves very vile and abiecte persons, and of
all men the vainest: if now when deeds and true prowess are needful, and
that we must set foot ts foot, and by wounds and death seek for glorious
victory: we should fear the face of our enemies, and with timorous heart
measure the perils of battles, I for my part being contented with ye old
limits of my kingdom enjoyed with good peace, could have passed my time in
rest and quietness, and have been without the perils and labors, that
wars do daily bring: If without care of dishonor I had preferred mine own
private felicity before both the dignity of my country, and your safety.
But by your general consent in that passing great opportunity of revenging of
your wrongs, and of all other things, when you were al of one opinion, that
wars were openly to be made, because that those things which we and our
Progenitors had suffered at the hands of our most bitter and spiteful
enemies were shameful, grievous, and intolerable: I forthwith proclaimed
wars with great courage, and that which does make me hope of victory, ye
with greater endeavor and desire, singular feruencie, and incredible alacrity,
have followed the ensigns, that one day by doing some notable act, and as it
were the vttermoste work of valiauncie, ye might show the egregious fortitude
of your hearts, and end those immortal controversies by a notable victory?
For what may there any doubt be had of the prosperous success of the victory,
seeing the army of the enemies is in nothing to be compared with ours, theirs
consists wholly of a kind of fresh water Soldiers, that will quickly run
away amain, being take up in haste without regard of prowess, and ^uenished
with weapons and armor only for a show of Soldiers, for all the old men of
war, or such as are meet for the field indeed, either for strength of youth
or good personage are ca^^ed away by King Henry into France. And will not you
then from the higher ground with the multitude of your weapons (...) ^he^^^^ a
sort of wretches, (...) we in number, and spent with wea^^nesse and fam^^ie
as soon ^s they shall (...) da^e (...) approach you. They clamber up the
hill, ^o^ because they be so hardy, but for that they are needy, and must
needs do it: that they may at once more honestly and speedely by death
escape the pinching pains of unwonted labor and hunger: after the manner of
wild beasts, who^ when fretting fury has once vexed their hearts, and famine
their bellies, extreme anger dryueth into raging madness. Draw your swords
therefore with me, and cut the throats of these fresh water Soldiers: and
be ashamed not to go thither for fear of death, whither ye shall see me your
Captain lead you the way for renown and glory. The soldiers succlamed unto
the Oration of the king yet speaking, with the clashing of their weapons and
dissonant cries, without any longer delay, the king first sending out of sight
his own horse and then al other doing the like, to the end that all men's peril
being made equal, all hope of flight quitetaken away (as it is the manner of
that nation) he might show both his strength of body, and valiauncie of
mind, divided all his power into five battles, for this reason: that the middle
battle, wherein was his chief standerde, should be guarded on both sides with
two battles: as it were with wings. In the right were the Earls of Huntley,
Craforde, and Montrosse, in the left the Lord Hume, and the earl of Lennox,
and Arguile, reported to be expert men of war. He had ordained a knight
to be captain of every band, and with them certain French captains, whom
King Jews had sent into Scotland a little before, to teach them the
discipline of war: and all the ordinance (which could serve to no great use
down the hill) being bestowed in a fit place, he himself stood in the
middle battle, against Surrey.

Now had Edmunde advanced the foremoste bands up the hill, when the
ordinance on both sides being shot off, and the first ranks, disordered,
Hume brought down his spears on foot, who lay with so furious force upon
the Englishemenue coming up the hill, that the valiauntest of the ring
leaders being slain and Edmunde stricken down, they had turned almost all that
battle into flight. And now was there^^ hope to abide, the hands being both
affrighted, and also defeated, unless that in so great danger, on one side
Bastard Heron a renowned man for his wonderful strength of body and noble
courage, and embrued with his own and his enemies blood had, lifted up Edmund:
and from another part Dacres being intentive to all sudden chances of the
battle, had sent an hurlewinde of horsemen ouerthwarte the side of the
enemies. And therewithal the Lord Howarde also coming after with the most
chosen men, the battle was without doubt restored, and courage was rendered
unto the vanquished. So the fortune of the battle being made equal, and then
mo Englishemen coming still up band after band, the afflicted being
intermedled with the fresh, began with emulation of prowess to advance the
front of the battle up the hill.

Now when they were come unto the strength of the Sedttes, and both sides
fought almost with greater hatred than strength, Montrosse and Craforde
coming into the foremost ranks to encourage the Soldiers, were there slain
valiantly fighting, and the esquadron of the spears on foot was broken
through, scattred, slain, and utterly defeated by the horsemen and footmen. But
in the lef wyng almost at the same time, Stanley being joined in battle,
had won the hill of the Scotts, and with the multitude of his arrows,
lighting thick upon them, had brought them into that case, that now they
fought not close together, but their ranks being loosed and thynne, and as
men that sought to avoid the shot, their ensigns began to sweye and
shrink hither and thither. Which when Stanley perceived, he fetching about
three bands of succor upon the open side of the enemies, brought so great
terror, that they were not able to sustain their violent charge, and stand
to it, but incontinentely fled, and running headlong down the hill, hid
them selves in the Woddes. There Arguile and Lennox reteyning with voice and
hands, the inclined battle, were slain.

In the mean time King James, who had a little before joined in battle with
Surrey, as soon as he saw that the arraye of his men was disordered in the
wings, and his enemies were spreadde abroad round about his skyrtes,
adhortyng the band that was appointed for his guarde, and the old soldiers,
and the noble men that were about him, that they would do nothing unworthy
of themselves, nor their ancestors: brought his battle into the mids of
his enimyes. So that a new battle arose again afreshe, and sharper than the
first: because all this Scottishe battle being well armed, had very well
sustained the arrows of the Englishemen, and certain Captain of the foremost
ranks being slain had perced almost to the English ensigns. There were on
both parts very tall men, chosen by both Captains for the supreme and last
chances of the battle: and the fight (as it must needs be in such a case)
was diverse and doubtefull, one while to the one, and another while to the other
prosperous and deadly. The King himself fighting on foot before the ensigns,
mayntayned the fight with great pertinacie, inflaming some with praise, and
other with shame, finally crying out to them all with diverse encouragements,
that since now they had gotten their enemies, they should be revenged on them
with sword and wounds, the which thing they had so greatly desired, and so
greedely thyrsted after. On the other side, Surrey when the best of his
Soldiers were either slain or wounded, contended with great valor, still
wythdrawyng the wounded into the hindermoste ranks, very earnestly encouraged
his men to bring the battle to the dint of sword, and where the enemies most
urged, there also fought he most stoutly. But whilst this hot conflicte
lasted at the ensigns with uncertain event, the lord Howard and Stanley, who
having defeated their enemies at both wings, came victors unto the middle
battle, turned their powers upon the enemies, charging him in two quarters:
and therwithall in very good time Dacres ran upon the backs of them, with a
very thick troop of horsemen, so that when the Scotts were slain on the
from, the sides and the back, and being wearied with labor and wounds,
could not break through for the heaps of slain carcasses, weapons, and
armours, they being on each side enclosed, were forced to fight in a ring.

But when the King saw his chief standerd thrown down, and Adam Forman that
bare it slain before his face: then doubting nothing, but that he must
immediately dye, that he might deliver his heart from imminent reproaches, ran
forth unto the thickest of his enemies, and there was slain fighting very
valiauntly. Nor far from him certain great men of the Church contending
with equal pertinacie, and prowess, were likewise slain: One Archebishoppe,
two Bishops, and four Abbots: and of noble men, and men of mark for
dignity of knighthoode, and honors of warfare, thirty six. Hume and Huntley
getting horses in this tumult through the benefit of the night approaching,
escaped into Scotland with the hindermoste bands and battles, which
consisting of a very cowardly kind of Soldiers, had not stroke one stroke:
There were slain that day about eight thousand Scotts, and almost so many
taken: but all the ensigns were gotten, and two and twentye pieces, of
ordinance, among whom were seven culuerings of great hugeness, whom the king
for their likeness one unto another, had named the seven sisters. The
Scottishe Camp was with the same fease won and spoiled: the kings body was
found the next day by Dacres, and brought to Berwicke, and there a long time
lay unburied for the Englishemen thought him unworthy of the holy honor of
burial and grave among Christians, after death for that he had in life time
favored and mayntained the Frenchmen and Schifmatickes.

The Battle of Vlmo fought in Venegia, between Raimonde of Cardona General
of the army of the league made by Maximilian the Emperor, Ferdinande the King
of Spain: and Bartholmewe de la Aluiano or Liuiano, General for the Venetians
in Anno. 1513. Out of Iouius.
ANno Domini. 1513. Raimond de Cardonna captain of the army of the league
against the French King invaded Venegia with fifteen bands of Spanishe
footmen, under the conducte of Ferdinande Marquess of Pescara, every band
containing three hundredth Soldiers, and seven bands of Lansquenetz led by
James Landawe, every band consysting of five hundredth Soldiers: (both the
Spaniardes, and the Almaines were old Soldiers, and had fought very
valiauntlye of late at Rauenna) with seven hundredth men of arms of King
Ferdinandes old companies, and also one hundredth and fifty Almaine men of
arms under the conducte of Rician and Celemberg, the Emperors Captains: and
also a company of light horsemen, whose Captain was Succaro Heduo: and
besides two companies of men of arms of the Popes power led by Troilo
Sabelli, and Mutio Colonna, and a company of light horse under the government
of Vrsino Mognani: finallye with six hundredth Spanishe horsemen serving under
Peter de Castro, among whom many were archers.

With this power and.xij. falcons he invaded Venecia, because the Venetians
had that same Summer joined with the French power in Milan against the
Duke, when that Trivulzi, was discomfited by the Switzers.

But when he saw that he could not get out the Venetian power to fight with
him, neither could he win either Padoa, or Treuiso, where they kept
themselves: he passed over the river of Brenta: where after they had with fire
and sword, wasted all that country being of singular fertility, he encamped
at a village on the Sea coaste called Maestre: from whence as the nearest place
of the main land unto Venice, he holdyng the stately seat of the enemy,
commanded the ordinance to be laid upon the nearest part of the shore,
and to be shot off in reproach and spite of the proud City, as though he
had laid his battery against the^ City, as in deed some pellettes
lighted in it.

The which spiteful part bredde such indignation in the hearts of the
angered Seignorye, who not without tears beheld their princely Manor houses
burning in all parts of the Country, that they wrote unto Liuiano their
General who was at Padoa with a power to repress the insultyng insolency of
their enimyes with arms, and whenever he should get opportunity of time and
place; to give them battle.

Liuiano gathered together almost seven hundredth men of arms, and few less
than two thousand light horsemen, seven thousand footmen, and great store of
field pieces, with him also joined Sacramoro Visconti, being excluded out of
Milan, with about seven hundredth horsemen, very well appointed. Moreover this
barbarous burning had excited a great number of Contadines or pesants, unto
whom Liuiano had before sent Paulo Manfrony an expert Captain, to rule and
guide with reason and counsel the rude multitude, commanding him to permit no
occasion of inuading the enemies on the back, whenever he should see them
either troubled with the woddes, or rivers, or busied with battle. The news
of the approach of Liuiano made the army of the league to cease their wasting,
and to seek to pass over the river of Brenta: the which they politikly did in
the night time, deceiving Liuiano: who being driven from his first council,
marched to a place called Vlmo three miles from Vicenza, to take the streightes
of the next hills, which way the Leagers must needs pass to go unto Verona:
which the Emperor then possessed.

But Liuiano stopped the passage of the streights, with castyng by of ditches,
trenches and rampires, wherein he had placed his great ordinance, so that it
was not possible for the enemy to pass that way without assured destruction,
and again to take an other way about by the mighty Mountains, and the
thicks Woods of Basiano seemed to be worse than an adverse battle: the
Pesantes cruelly pursuing them that had lost their baggage, as men utterly
vanquished and turned out of their ancient honor, Now was the army of the
League come within sight of the enemy, and were encamped so near unto the
Venetians, that they heard the neighing of their horses, and the noise of
their camp, and were wonderfully annoyed by Liuiano from the higher ground with
the great ordinance, so that the horsemen were forced to seek low places,
and great trees to defend them selves, and the footmen to lie flat upon the
ground. But when night was come, proclamation was made, yt all the fires
throughout the camp should be put out, that the enemies might have no mark to
direct their shot more certainlye: and also thoroughe the persuasion of
Prospero de Colonna (who ruled all the army, although Raimonde was General)
all the Wagons and booty that they had gotten, was burnt, that they might more
speedyly march the next day before it was light toward Basiano: hoping
assuredly of victory, if they could get the enemy out of the strong place
of advantage for to follow them. It was somewhat late ere Liuiano understood
of the departure of the enemies, by reason of a thick miste that arose (as it
commonly does in such moorish countries) but as soon as he perceived that
they were gone, he sent Bernardine Antiniola his sisters son, a valiant young
Gentleman, with the light horsemen, and three Falkons to endamage the tail of
them, and to view whether they went: for his mind was not to join with them
in battle without great advantage, knowing his footmen not able to match
the old Spaniardes and Lancequenetz: but determined only to vex, annoy, and
stay them with often skirmishes, as they marched thorough troublesome and ill
ways: that he might deliver them (being wearied with travel, watching and
famine) into the hands of the Pesantes swarming about them, so to be
destroyed. But Antiniola very hotly urging on the tail of the ennimies,
attached a very sharp encounter with the Almaine horsemen: in the which he
being repulsed, had forsaken his ordinance: but after that other troops of
horsemen succored him, the fight was again so furiously renewed, that not only
the three pieces of ordinance were recovered, but also the Almains put to
flight, in such sort, that Prospero commanded all the horsemen to open their
troops and to make way through the mids of them for the fleing Almaines: and
least they should else have disordered the whole battle, he also commanded
Pescara to turn head with his Spanishe footmen toward the Venetians. There
was with Liuiano, Andrew Lauridame the Venetian Legate or Prouiditori, a
vehement man, neither less greedy of revenge, than of glory, but one
altogyther unskillful of the wars. He hearing good news from all parts of the
auaunt^urrer^, hasted unto the General (as he was vehemently stirred up with
the sharp affectes of hope and grief) and said unto him: Why linger you
General? the enemies escape: an assured and notable victory will slip out
of our hands: it will rather be accounted falsehoode, than cowardice, if that
you linger any longer: neither can this opinion be taken away, unless you do
incontinentlye command the signal to be given, and pursue with all your
power the fleing and disordered ennimie. Then Liuiano turning toward Hugo de
Pepoli, and Guido de Rangoni, said: let us adventure though rashly yet nobly
the footmen of battle, seeing that over great power of superiority, does
overcome reason: least if I be to day wary and considerate, I shall anon
after being accused before the seignory of cowardice or treason, and oppressed
with wrongful hatred, be put to death by the adverse and malicious voices of
the unskillful, as was unlucky Carmagnola. That be uttered these speches, we
learned of those that were present at thou. Then causing the signal to be
sounded, he pursued the enemies with three battles: the leading of the right
and left wings which were both of light horsemen, had Antonio Pio, and
Bagleone, but the middle battle, wherein were the men of arms, and Sacramoro
Visconti, Guido de ^^^^goni, and Hermes Bentiuogli, he himself conducted. The
battles of the footmen marching also with equal p^^e (...) the one and the
other side of his battles, the horsemen on both sides encounter very fiercely:
and now Liuiano fleing hither and thither, and trying out that this day would
be the end of their labors, and the begynuyng of their dewardes, had
enkindeled his Souldioures with so great dessce to vanquishe, that many of
them pierced thoroughe the thickest of their enimyes, even unto their Ensigns,
and stryuyng to bring them away, and bring strongly resisted, tore thou into
peetes, and slew Ebrardde Cornia the enfigne bearet of M^^tiaks company, a
valyant old Gentleman, and his courageous sontie.

But whylest the horssemen thus encounter together in the scoute with equal
hope and fear on both sides: Prospere rode unto every rank, encouragyng
them, and commanded. Pescara to aduauntee forward on the one side with his
Spaniardes, and Landaw on the other with his Launsqueneti, and to charge the
footemenne of the ennimie, the which they did with such fury, that the
bands of Babo Brescehelli, whom Liuiano had for the opinion of then notuble
prowess placed in the foremoste cankes, scarce once attemptyng the encounter,
turned their backs almost before they had scene their en^^^; although their
Captains, men of singular dalor endeavored by encouraging, threatening and
beating to make them abide, and sought themselves very valiantly in the
forfront, where they were slain also: among whom were John Bernardino, Alezzo
Seraphino, Alfonso M^to, Phillippe Carsoleio, Aniball de Simoni, and Baptista
Docto, who had placed about him a crewe of very valiant Soldiers, choser
out of diverse hands, which were all stain by Pescara, who there valiauntly
coughte on foot before his Spaniardes with apike in his hand.

Then the middle battle of the Venelian horsemen being bared on one side of
their footmen, began first to be driven bark, and being urged more sharply,
anon after with slaughter to be put to flight: neither could the disordeted
battle be repaired or made to stay, when the foremost ranks were slain,
although that all the valiauntest horsemen eudeuoured to their vttermoste to
su^eine the impression of their ^minses. So that when al such as resisted were
slain the ensigns were thrown do^^, and namely the ensign of (...), the
which Authony Mon^o^ had long time valiauntly kept, but at the last lost it,
together with his life, and at the same bru^e, Sacramoro and Hermes being
unhorse ^^were slain by the Lance quenetz. But Pescara Gentlmanlike saved Otho
Visconis, brother unto Sacramoro, although there had been before a private
quarrel between them.

Now when the horsemen of the right wing saw the middle battle, wherein they
reposed all their hope of victory, and that which they thought should bear
the brunte of the battle, slain and put to flight, they shamefullye burling
away their armor and weapons, ran away amain, and Antonius their
Captain appressed with the wayghte of his armor was drowned in the River of
Becchilio. The right wyng also with like cowardice did the like: for when
Paul Baglione had not brought about speedily: enoughe the right wing by
reason of the moorishe and slimy ground where upon he had lighted by going
about to enclose the enemy: and Liniano also had more hastily attached the
battle than he had thought he would: it came to pass, that his soldiers
seeing the slaughter and flight of other of their fellows, and also
distrusting their own strength, fled away whole and untouched. Yet in the
front, although that fear and flight had taken the bartes of all the
soldiers, many valiant Captains, whilst for the dignity of their martial
scruice passed, they endeavored to retain the soldiers, to keep the array
and ground, were at length fighting courageously slain, being for saken by
their soldiers, and enclosed by the multitude of their enemies.

But Paul Baglione having lost his two base brothers, Troiano and Hierome,
and all his horsement seattered, in utter dyspayre fled away, and lightyng
on a marrishe, was taken by the Spanishe horsemen.

In the mean time, Liuiano, although he were forsaken of Fortune, and left
alone by his Souldioures, still ratyng them for fleeing, yet went busily about
to renew the fight: but at length being broken in heart, and spente in
strength, he fled, and came to Padoa. The rest of the Capitaynes were
almost all taken in the chase, or slain by the Almaines, who spared no man:
and many also were drowned in the river of Bachillie, for when they came wearye
unto the River, either they were or owned in the stream, or were overtaken and
oppressed by the enemy as they stood deliberating whether it were best to
pass it or no. And thus they perished by diverse chances. The Lansquenetz
also, and the Spanishe footmen, breaking their arraye, pursued the flight,
slaying those that the horsemen running before, had overthrown, or whom the
throng of them that fled, and the heaps of armours and weapons. With whom they
every where met, had hindered or stopped. Andrewe Lauredame Prouidirou, a ^^ant
unworthy of that calamity, (if he had not been the unlucky author of that
unfortunate battle) was taken: and albeit after he was withdrawn, he promised
a mighty mass of gold for his ransom: yet was he most cruelly stayne by a
rascal droudge. But Andrewe Gritti got him to Vicenza, and was there very
hardly saved, for as soon as the Venetians began to fly, the perculleis of
the gate was let down, which was the cause of many a man's death, for they
missing their hope of entering Vicenza, in going back again met with the
ennimies, by whom were slain Captains of companies of horsemenne, Charles
Monrons, (...) Saxatello; Constantius Pio son to Anthony, and Meleagri^ of
Fonli, but there were slain of Captains footmen, and pety captains, above
six and twenty. Many were saved by the Italians and Sp^^mardes, but those
whom fortune cast on the Almaines (having before sworn to spare no man) were
al slain There dyed of the Venetian army that day being the.vij. day of
October, about vij. M. whereof.iiij. C. were men of arms: a thing that had
never happened before in any battle. There were also taken.xxiij. pieces of
ordinance with all the ensigns, yea and this almost at^^icued without wound
of their enemies, for there were lost but only two men of mark, and they were
of Mittius de Colonnd is company: Eberard de Cornia his ensign bearor, and
Camillo Maximo, and knight of Rome, a young Gentleman of rare towardness.
There was never army in our age that had fought either with more shameful
end, or was vanquished with less damage of the enemy: in so much that the
Marquess of Pescara even in the mids of his joy for the victory, detesting the
dast arolynesse of the Venetian Soldiers, openly protested, that he was very
heartily sorry, that it was his luck to have been inserted by dys auncessours
into the land of Italy, Pescara his ancestors came out of Spain.
that brought forth so feeble and faint hearted soldiers. But after this great
overthrow given, the army of the League, by reason of the approach of winter,
were forced to forsake the field, and to return unto their wintering places.

A Battle fought in anno. 1514. at the river of Boristhenes between. Basilius
the great Duke of Moscouie, and Constantine General of Sigismunde King of
Polande. Out of Iouius.
WHen Basil the g^^ are Duke of Mosconie had by treason taken the strong town
of Smoleincho, he sent three companies of horsemen to waste Littaw. Against whom
Sigismunde King of Polon sent his approved Captain Constantine with an army of
(...) thousand Foloman m^^ of auntes, twelve thousand Lithuam^^^ (...) ^b^o^^e
a^ archers on horseback, and three thousand footmen, part harquebusierz and
part pikemen, in whose puissance if they once joined in battle the reposed
assured hope of victory. Basil, who had above fourtse thousand horsemen
doubting nothing of the event of the (...) battle, suffered the P^^lonian power
quietly to pass over the river of Boristhenes or Nept^^ that he might have the
more full and noble victory: and when be understood by his espites, that all
the Polonians were passed over, turning himself toward his Captain, her
spoke as follows. Our eniu^^ ^ane pass the River, to late to return
again, if ye (...) play the men. Wherefore (most valiant fellow
Soldiers) a^^^one as ever ye shall receive the signal, break forth as
thick together as ye can clustes, and after ye have once powered down and
short of shaftes upon your enemies battles, then every two of you encountes
one enemy: and persuade, your selves that by this days victory ye shall sack
the rich Cities of vil^ and (...) the Chief^ Cities of Li^^^^ and Pol^^.

When he had th^^ said, ^eech^se out of all the whole host about seven
thousand horse^^^, whom he commanded to enclose the enimye behind at the
back: and when they perceived the battle waxed hot at the front; then they
should with all their power set upon the ennimyes at the back, fearing no
such think: for on the left hand was there a little valley, hedged in as it
were with little hills, running along, and covertly clothed with very thick
bu^yes and briers, fitly serving to hyde such an ambushe. But of the rest of
his power he made three battles.

The forewarde, wherein were twelve thousand horsemenne, he placed an the
right wing, and made Michaell Golijza a valiant man. Captain thereof: the
second he appointed for the left wing near unto the hills, to the end it
should be as it were a battle of succor: but at the wagons, cariages and
bagg^^^^ of the army* be himself st^^de with the middle battle, wherein
were placed the strength of the army.

On the c^^trary ^^e Constanti^^ not being ignorant that the vn^^aned enemy
would in no respect be equal unto him, if he could at the first brunt sustain
the multitude of their arrows, and bring the matter to hand strokes, and that
the battle might not altog^^^e be foughtes by thick tro^^es of horsemen, he
placed, all the men of ^^mes in the ^ro^^, to receive the first force of the
^^^^wes, but strengthened both wings, with Lithuanians, and their backs with
the footmen.

And riding from rank to rank, he said unto them: we must this day fight
not for glory, nor by arms to recover Smole^cho lately lost by ^r^uds, but to
impeache that the perfidious and most shameful Mosco^ites, may not reign
over the Polonians, and Lithuanians. Neither (fellow Soldiers) will I
enkindl^ you unto prowess and vyctorie, more by any adhortation, than by
putting you in m^nd that the river Boristhenes is at your back, which if ye
(being discomfited by the armed enimye,) cowardly think ye may again pass
over, by giving place, or shamefulye fleing, ye shall make it famous, for a
perpetual ignominy of your Country, and your notble discomfiture and ^aughter.
But that ye do not suffer so great dishono^ and soul fact to be committed
under my conducte, I do beseech and obtest thee (O God most bounteous, and
almighty and ye holy Ladist and Caffimire, the defenders and pastrons of the
Polontas Empire, and I do bow an altar and Church unto both of you if it may
stand with your pleasures, that the Poldnian vanquish and I discomfiring and
putting to flight the annimye, may, bring home a speedy and entire victory.
While Consta^^ine was yet speaking, the Moscouils founded the battle, and the
rewithall Michaell commanded his horsemen to run forth f^ourth e^^^^ng, and to
shote their arrows. Neither did Constantine (as head instructed the Captains
when he arranged the battles) keep in the men of arms, but they were
commanded incontinently to charge their stames, but running upon the en^^^ys,
spee dyly to bring the rouflices unto the sword. And suc^^e in deebe was the
(...) that being come beyond the fall of their eui^^ (...), they escaped the
greatest part of that shoure, and a^^ represting in with the be easts of their
horses and their weapons, took from the arhers on hor^^ back the use of their
bows, and their second arrows, in whom they had reposed great conside^^.

On the other shoe the Lu^^^nians stre^^ving out their widge as long as they
could possible, charge the sides all the iu^^^ sh^ting innumerable arrows
upon their thick battles: where with all the Moscouites being opprossed, when
they could ueyther: beack through in the front, being drged by the men of
arms, nor not give bark, their fellowed behind thrusting them forward, the^
brake their arraye and flew out side long upon both the wings of the
Lithuanians, and there as one time attached two encounters in diverse places:
yea and the same time also the horsemen, who as we told you were se^e by
Basil at the back of the Polonians through the hidden valley, with ^^deous
cry, and great sound of trumpets, that they might seem the greater number,
i^uaded the Polonians on ye (...), which being once perceived, tertaine
captains valiant men, amongst whom was the Palatine Polosky, notwithstanding
Constantine had straightly commanded them not to stir out of their places,
nor to sight without his commandment: Yet thinking that in sudden and
dangerous chances of sight all things are not to be done according to
straight prescript, but the present occasion of things must be encountered,
since they could not then run to ask the Generals counsel, because he
fought busily a^me other quarter nor in any case in that shortness of time,
certifye him thereof, turned the esquadron of the footmen on the enemies. The
esquadron being by their array immovable and strong, although they had
received some detriment by the arrows, yet notwithstanding discharging all
their harquebusters together at once, by that tempest of pellets staying the
for^o^branks of the enemy, came to their pikes and halbards, and by their
impulse and valo^ repulsed the enemy. When the horsemen being empeached with
their multitude, could not get out to spread abroad themselves, and
trauerse their ground: they ^usteyned the sight in that straight and throng
with greats slaughter. There when the sight wared h^t, y^e might have seen man
and horse th^u^t thorough with a stroke, other overthrown, and great heaps of
slain men lying every where, and all places silled with the blood, and
grouings of dying m^n. But in another quarter Constantine having disordered the
ranks of the enemy, and almost quite destroyed Michaels horsemen, was now
come unto the middle battle, and at^aching a sharp encounter, had disordered
the fo^^ndste ranks with his violente charge and slaughter. When Basil
distrusting of the middle battle, and his own strength, gave back, but yet
turned not his face, as one that expected the supreme eu^nt, thinking verily
that the horsemen which he had sent before to inu^de the Pul^uiam o^r the
back, would strike a soddaine and therefore the greater fear into the
hearts of the Polonians, neither foreseeing nor distrusting any such unlooked
for invasion. But the footmen that deseated them, tourning their ranks, and
coming with speedy pace upon the battle of succor, brake all the rest of
his hope and heart, So that Basil departing out of the battle with a troop
of noble horsemen, fled amain upon the spur: whom that battle
incontinently followed, which (we showed you) was placed at the hill for a
succor, being not once able to abide, no not the look of the bloudye and
victorious footmen. Then followed a foul flight all the field over: but yet
the middle battle with great constancy received the enemy, that egrely
urged. For Basil had placed all the armed and valiantest Soldiers of the whole
host about the ensigns, and in the front of that battle. So that they fought
long with variable fortune, and most egre and fierce contention on either
side, and diverse Polonian horsemen of mark, and two young noble men were there
slain, as they over hotly ran their horses into the thick battle of the
enimye. At the length the Lithuanians and footmen, after they had defeated
them with whom they had encountered, came also upon them from diverse parts
with furious force: the Moscouits before they should be constrained to sight
also behind: thought best to provide for themselves by speedy flight. The
Polonians victors winning the enemies camp, got a great and rich pray by the
kings furniture, and five thousand horses. They slew above seven thousand men.
Michaell also and certain other famous captains were taken, whom with the
ensigns that were taken, King Sigismunde afterward in triumphant manner brought
bound into Vilne. After this fortunate sight Constantine besieged Smolencho,
but not with the like fortune: for Basil had in his flight sent thither
certain companies of horsemen, and strengthened the Town with a new garrison:
thinkyng that if they could sustain the first assauites of the enemy, that
then the Polonians being excluded by the time of the year, would never once
mind to besiege it: for this battle was fought the eight day of September.
When Constantine perceived that the winnyng of it was harder than he had hoped,
neither would the nature of the very cold country, suffer the Soldiers to lie
abroad in the field, he despayring to atchieue this enterprise, reduced his
army home again over the river of Boristhenes.

The Battle of Chois, in Armenia the great, fought the fifte of August in
anno. 1514. between Selym the great Turk, and Ismaell the Sophy of Persiae.
WHen Selym the great Turk in revenge of the wrong done him by Jsmaell the
Sophy, in marying his daughter unto Amurathes his enemy, and the banished son
of his brother Achomates, and also in aiding him with a power to invade
Cappadocia, had entered Armenia, the Sophy, although he nothing at all
suspecting any inuasio^ of the Turk that year, had sent the greatest part of
his power against the Coraxenes* yet to save the beautiful and pleasant town
of Chois from sacking, encamped within sight of the Turk, and reposing great
trust both in the hardynesse of his soldiers, and also in his own good
fortune, thought it best to the end he might strike the greater terror into
his enemies hearts, not to defer the time, but roundly to join in battle with
them: and incontinently sent an Heralde unto Selym, and with him certain men
of war, who should diligently view what kind and how great the army of
the enemies was, how many pieces of ordinance he had, and what the form of
their Camp was. But they should do this message unto Selym: that Armenia was
assuredly the Persians, neither had there ever been any contention between the
Turks and them for it, and therefore he marvelled why he was come into yt
province with an enimious army. But if perhaps be emulating the antie^t
prowess of Alexander the Macedon, thought that so much land of right was his,
as victory and fortune by encroching arms should get him, that then he should
make himself ready, and even the next day try what his own and other men's
power was able to do: Selym answered thereunto, that apparent injuries were in
fresh memory. Wherefore the Othomannes might justly take arms against the
Persians, both his grandfather Mahomet, and Cassen his uncle in time paste, and
now of late his father Bajazet, and hym^^^ also whilst he was oppugned with
the arms of his brother Achomates, had received of the Persians both very
great detrimentes, and notable reproaches. But although these were great and
very weighty matters, yet did he not think them to be causes worthy of wars:
but his only request was, to have Amurathes his brothers son yet his enemy,
and the waster of Cappadocia, delivered into his hands, whom if he would
according to equity friendly yield up unto him, that then as the mutual
rightes between Kings for the defending and strengthening of their Empires
required, he would withdraw his army and return into his own dominions: But
if the Sophy neglected thus to do, that then he would wast Armenia and Persia
with fire and sword. The Herald being dismissed, both princes kept themselves
within their camps. But the next day Selym by the encouragement of all his
Soldiers, brought forth his power into the open field, and marched in array
of battle toward the enemy, who lodged two miles off, thinking that Jsmaell,
a chieftaine of so great name, would make no stay, but according to his word
incontinently join in battle with him.

But as for the number of Persians, what kind of horsemen they were, what
armor and weapons they bare, he could not lightly learn: for besides the
natures and wits of that nation, fraught with subtle policies and wisdom,
so great was the love of the soldiers, and so great their reverence toward
Jsmaell their king, that there was not one man found that fled unto the
Turkishe Camp, whereas on the other side (as it was afterward learned by the
Persian prisoners diverse daily fled from Selym unto Jsmaell. Selym who is
reported to have had that day in the field four score thousand horsemen,
placed in the right wing Cassembassa the Captain of the Europian horsemen, and
in the left Sinambassa an Eunuch, with the horsemen of Asia, the Acanzi going
before or auauntcurryng: which Acanzi are horsemen of diverse nations, that
voluntarily follow the wars, being thereto excited in hope of booty and
spoil.

The middle battle was assigned unto the Asappes, a multitude of r^^^l and
half unarmed footmen, who for that they are accounted no loss at all, are
always objected unto the first encounter and brunt, thereby to blunt their
enemies blades. Behind the Asappes was the great ordinance, disposed in
direct front, guarded with four thousand horsemen. He himself with the
chosen horsemen of the guarde, and all the Janizars stood for an aid and
succor in a place somewhat higher than the rest, and being entrenched with a
double circle or trench of ordinance and carriages round about him, had
placed the sumpter Camelles according to their custom, so linkyng them one to
an other with long chains going cross their breasts, that they seemed to be
a strong munition: wherewith he being enclosed, might aid those that he saw
in distress, and (if any harder chance should happen) from thence as from a
Castle with the flower of the whole army sustain all the force of the enemy.
Moreover he willed the Asappes, that as soon as the ennimies horsemen began to
approach, that then they should immediatlye sever themselves a side into two
parts, thereby to leave an open gappe to shoot off the great artillery full on
the ennimye. On the other side Jsmaell, who had certainly learned by fugitives
all the counsels of the enemy, calling unto him his Captains, told them that
it would be nothing to win the victory, if they could but escape the
tempest of the ordinance: which thing he affyrmed might easily be brought
to pass, if the horsemen as soon as they once saw the battle of the Asappes
divided, would also be intentive and ready incontinently to break their array,
and likewise to sever themselves into two wings. Wherefore he caused two
chief standards to be borne, the one was the Imperial standarde, the which
he disposed in a certain place where he stood himself, with the force and
flower of the horsemen: the other he assigned unto his approved Captain
Vstaogle with the rest of the army. Jsmaell had about him thirty thousand
horsemen without any aid of footmen, and of them were there above ten
thousand men of arms, very valiant Soldiers, well practiced in the wars,
and famous for their nobility. They had very excellent horses barded with
strong steel, and their helmets were all crested both for a brauerne and also
to terrify the ennimye: moreover they bare Semiters, and after our manner,
malles of iron, and also very strong Lances. The rest of the horsemen being
armed with open and somewhat long head pieces and curasses, used either great
bows, or else lances of Ash after the Sparishe manner: and as for guns they
had none, in which one only thing they were ouermatched by the Turks. But, so
great courage and valiauncye was in the hearts of the Persians, that they
despysing the multitude of their enemies, and contemning the peril of the
ordinance, doubted nothing to give them battle. The signal being given,
Jsmael set forward with all his army, adhorting all his Soldiers, that
they would retain in memory their old martial praise, and that they would
follow him their chieftaine, (whom they had thoroughe many most prosperous
battles, made the most mighty King of all the Orient) now marching against
the enemy: that they were to encounter with a sort of unarmed Turks, using
only a light staff and a Target, whose horses are of stature low, weak, and
carreine lean, and almost starued with hunger, that they would never abide, no
not the first shock of the men of arms. On the other side Selym seeing the
duste of the enemies army coming, commanded it to be proclaimed unto all the
army by the Colonelles and capitains, that the battle was at hand: wherein if
they fought valiauntly, and vanquished the Persians the conquerours of nations,
they should enlarge the Othomanicall Empire from the Persian Ocean unto the
mount Caucasus. But if they remitted any thing of their wonted prowess, that
then being in that huge wilderness of the strange Country, and vnmmeasurable
deserts, there were no hope of escape to be looked for, for either they should
shamefully dye, or else with everlasting reproach be slaves unto the Persian
women: since that behind them so far from their Country, both the mighty
river Euphrates and the monstrous mountains of Taurus, and also beside that,
the unfaithful Aladule possessing the streights, had taken away from the
vanquished all hope of return into Cappa^ocia. Now when Jsmaell approcked,
and the Asappes at the signal given opened their ranks, and in the space
between them the Fashons were short off, he incontinently deducting his
horsemen gave a charge upon the right wing of the Turks, with such seruencye,
that there was a very sharp encounter between the half armed Turks, and the
complete armed Persians: so that Cassembassa and the foremost ranks being
slain, and so shootly the other one after another discomfited and defeated,
they propelled all that wing even unto the aides and succors where Selym
himself stood. In another quarter Vstaogle receiving no small detriment by
the ordinance, because he had not so speedily got himself and his company
out from that danger, charged the Asians, of whom he slew a great number,
but not with the same felicity, that Jsmaell had, for whilst he sought very
egerly among the foremost, he was slain with an harquebusse shot, through
which chance the Turks recovered again their daunted spirits: so that they,
who even now driven from their ground had lost above the third part of
their fellows, now very lustily renewing the fight, sustained the men of
arms, and setting against them the Harquebusierz, by whom the horses of the
Persians were most affrighted, drove them hedlong in one troup upon the
Asappes. The Persians either compelled by necessitye, for that having received
great detriment, they had also lost their Captain, and could not rule
their horses affrighted with the noise and thundering of the ordinance, or
else seeing the side of the Asappes lie open, whereby they thought a better
hand might there be had, with thick troops gave a charge ouerthwarte the
footmen, whom they overthrowing with great slaughter came unto the ordinance:
and there enclosing the masters and gunners, slew them all, who unadvisedly
shooting off their great pieces in that great hurl of things, had foully
slain a great number indifferently as well of their own fellows, as of their
ennimies, and with continued course came thorough, as it were victors unto the
right wyng, where Jsmaell fought with the Europian horsemen: who having lost
their captain, and being repulsed and wearied with wounds, had before time
withdrawn themselves unto the aides and battelles of succor. But now when
they were urged on the side with another company of the enemies, feeling
themselves unable to sustain their impression: began to cry out (as in their
extreme peril) for succor unto the battle of aid. In this hard state of the
battle, Selym loosing the chain of the wagons, opened the Trench in two places
and incontinently sent forth a part of the horsemen of his guarde.

And then tourning himself toward the Janizars, he said: The victory of
this day is reserved for your valor and service: wherefore pluck up good
hearts, lusty laddes, and behave your selves valiauntly, break forth
courageously, and being now fresh and lusty, set upon your weary and wounded
enemies. The bodies of their horses even melt with sweaie, and the horsemen
themselves do now faint under so great a waighte of armor. The Janizars
(notwithstanding these speches) did neither speedily nor readily obey Selym,
but in so great desperation of things, willingly kept themselves within the
munitions. So that whilst they made courtesy to set forward, the Persians in
this heat of the victory, being spread round about the Europians, slew them
all, Selym beholding it, and in vain hastyng to succor them. Fabricio
Carrecto the great Master of the Rhodes, unto whom all these matters were
very diligently reported, wrote unto Leo the Pope, that the Janizars were not
obedient unto Selym, neither could they be adduced either by his adhortation
or prayers to succor the distressed Europians, as they that (doubting the
utter loss of the battle,) lyked better to expecte the event, than with
apparaunte peril to obiecte them selves unto the storm of the horsemen, who
had destroyed the rest of the footmen.

Now had the Persians from all parts invaded Selym, who made his abode in
the battle of succoure: When Senambassa drawing after him his wyng al to torn
and greatly diminished, came all in time, the enimye following through the mids
of the heaps of the Asappes, and then sending for and bringing certain fresh
troops that had escaped whole from the violent charge of Vstaogle, the fight is
restored, and namely through the surpassing prowess of the two brothers
Turabey and Mahomet Malcocks, who being equal among the Turks in nobleness
of stock, unto the house of the Othomans resembled and showed the noble
prowess and courage of Malcocke their father, the renounted captain in that
lamentable road made by the Turks into Venetia, and Carnia. And also not
despayring but erected into hope, and very cherefull, Selym commanded all his
ordinance to be shot off upon the enemy: which thing he had reserved for the
supreme danger: wherewith so many horses and men, both Turks and Persians
being blended together, were slain, yt when the men had lost the use both of
eyes and ears through the dust, the smoke and noise of the ordinance, and the
horses also being affrighted with the unwonted terrible roaryng, contemnyng the
bridles, carried their ryders an other way, the battle was broken off, the
victory being as yet uncertain. Jsmaell being carried out of the danger of
this storm, perceived him self wounded with a Harquebus shot in the
shoulder, when by the advice of his friends he went out of the battle* to
look upon his wound: which only thing did doubtless bring safety unto
Selym and all his. For the Persians incontinently following Ismaell, and his
standarde, lost and forsook the undoubted victory, (and by the opinion of
all men,) for a great part already gotten. But when he found that his
wound was but light, for that the pellet could not pierce deep, by reason of
the syngular temper of his Armor, he purposed to return again into the
battle. But bearyng that Vstaogle was slain, in whom he reposed great
trust, for his passing skill in martial matters, and his friends also still
counsellyng him not to neglect his wound that was yet hot, but to have
special regard of his life, he began to retire in a square troop, with a
slow pace, that his departure might not seem to have any show of flight: and
going unto Taruis the chief City of Armenia, yea and of the Persian Empire,
after he had willed the chief of the city, to open their gates unto the
Turk, and receive his garrison, least through vain constancy they might
receive some great detesment, he departed into Media.

But the Turks being sore shaken with so many losses, having neither courage
for fear, nor force through faintness, to pursue took without resista^ce.
There were found, besides tents wrought with the needle, and enterwouen with
silk and gold, and other precious furniture of household, many women of great
nobility, who had followed their husbands, al of whom Selym released without any
ransom. They that were present at this battle had reported, that among the
heaps of the men that were slain, diverse women were also found, who puttyng
on helmet and harness, and following their husbands, had died with them
valiauntlye fighting. Selim lost in this battle above thirty thousand men,
among whom besides Cassembassa the Belerbech of Greece, seven Sanzaces and the
two Malcockes, who were slain, as the one brother endeavored to succor the
other, being enclosed, and besides the despised multitude of Asappes objected
to slaughter, the horsemen of Sclauony, Macedony, of the Tribals, Epyrus,
Thessaly and Thracia, no doubt the flower and strength of his army, who were in
the right wing, were for a great part either slain or sore wounded. Now unto
Selym being victor by the confession of the enemies, came there Ambassadors
from Chois, and the Cities thereaboutes, and also from Taruis, yelding
themselves unto him, who marched to Toruis, mynding to winter there: but he
had not made his aboade there above ten days, but intelligence was given,
that Jsmaell, having sent for a strong power of Jberian and Albania^ horsemen,
was coming toward Taruis with the Parthian horsemen, and those that had
been at the battle of Chois.

Then Selym calling to mind how hardly in the flelde he had sustained thirty
thousand Persians, with an hundredth and fiftye thousand Turks, and had
vanquished them rather by chance, and his ordinance, than by true prowess,
and estimating with all the great power of the Citizens of Taruis, whose
fidelity and multitude he suspected: departed thence and hasted to pass over
Euphrates, marching a longer way about for fear least he should meet the
approaching Iberians, who although they passed withal possible speed, as soon
as they once understood of the Turks departure, yet could they not overtake
them, being posted over Euphrates before the Iberians could come: yet when the
auauntcurrers of the Iberians had gotten the sight of them, they caused such a
tumult among the Turks, before their hyndermoste tail could pass the river,
that about two thousand of them were drowned, and part of the baggage and
certain falcons, were left in the River sticking fast in the mudde, whom the
Sophy afterward weighed up, and carried away.

The Battle of Marignano, fought not far from the City of Milan, between
Francis the French King, the first of that name, and the Switzers under the
conduct of Matthew the Cardinal of Sion, and Rosti, but in the quarrel of
Maximilian the Duke of Milan, in anno. 15 15. Out of Iouius
FRancis the French King at the beginning of his reign, seeking to recover the
Duchye of Milan, leuyed a puissannte army of four thousand men of arms,
every one drawing with him three or four horses, and eight thousand light
horsemen, the Captain General of all which horsemen was Charles Duke of
Burbon, and high Constable, of forty bands and mo of Lansquenetz, under the
conduct of the Lord Floranges, and Charles Duke of Ghelders (who among other
brought an approved regiment of old Soldiers, called of their black
ensigns, the black regiment) and of twenty bands of Gascoignes, Nauarrines,
and other borderers on the mountains Pyrences, under the conducte of Peter of
Navarre. They for the greatest part were Arcubalisters, and Archers, but a
kind of soldiers that would toil like horses, very venterous, light and
nimble, excellent to keep or assault a town, and also to skirmishe.

Then had he so great store of great and small artillerye, as would well
suffice two great armies, and the wagons and carts that carried boullets,
gunpowder, pikeaxes, crows of iron, and all kind of tools, and other things
to make easy the troublesome ways thorouge the rocky Alps, were almost
innumerable: All this provision was drawn by the perpetual labor of five
thousand mighty strong horses.

There also followed for desire of pillage a strong regiment of voluntary
footmen, under certain ensigns and Captains, and with them three thousand
Pioners. With this army, which for number and furniture, passed all that any
man had seen in our days: Francis passed the Alps, and encamped between the
town of Marignano, and the city of Milan, both as well to interclude the armies
of the Pope, and the king of Spain from the Switzers, who were come to Milan
to defend the Duke, and to make Liuiano the General of the Venetians his
confederate, more strong by the propinquitie and nearenesse of his Camp, as
also to defend him from the Spaniardes, that were very near him.

But whilst the king was encamped at Marignano, Maximilian the Duke of Milan,
and Matthew the Cardinal of Sion (the bringer of the Switzers into Italy)
called the Captains and Lieftenauntes into the Castle, to sit in counsel
how these perilous wars should be administered.

There many were of the opinion, that the way to obtain the victory, was in
no wise to join in battle with the Frenchmen before they had united their
power with the Popes and Spanishe armies, (the one whereof) consisted of
fourteen bands of Italian footmen, and three thousand horsemen: the other
of eight hundredth men of arms, and a thousand light horsemen, besides a
regiment of old Spanishe footmen: whereof every soldier being as famous for
his valiant acts, as rich by reason of great spoils, did match both
petye Capitaines, yea and Capitaines in chief, not only in approved
stoutness, but also in bravery of armoure: or at the least before they had
brought the French King, who trusted much in his munitions, thoroughe some
necessitye into a more indifferent place. And it was apparent, that the
Switzers should easly obtain either the one or the other, if they would march
unto a place called Binasco, standing in the way unto Pauia: for if the French
King would for all this journey of the Switzers, persiste still in his sure
defenced lodging, that then they might easily go from Binasco by the town of
Sanangelo, and through a country abounding in all kind of victuals, unto the
river of Po, whereby the bridges which were ready built, the armies of the
confederats might join with them: but if the French King fearing least he
should be stopped both from the City of Paura, and also from the stone
bridge over the river of Tesino, (where he had left a small garrison) would
march unto Pauia: that then either they might fight with him with more equal
condition, or else incontinently turn on the left hand unto Lody: and there
sending for, and receiving into their Camp, the powers of the Spanishe King,
and the Pope, they should straight way turn Liuiano from his purposed forney,
and dashe the passing great hope of victory, that the Frenchemen had conceived
by their former fortunate successes. But when these things were declared, and
also plotfes and chartes were showed, wherein were described the ways and site
of the regions, that the rude witted men might more certainly understand and
know those things which were counseled, then diverse Captains (who induced
either by their old judgment, or else by French gold, lately given by
Francis had accepted conditions of peace with him, at a village called
Galarato) by their dissentyng and enterlasing of vain difficulties, and
affyrming that those things were to be surueyed with great consideration and
maturity, clean ouerturned all this mean and way of wholesome and good
counsel. Wherefore least the hearts of those that were faithful might
languish by tariance, and the good wills of the uncertain multitude be
turned into perfidiousnesse: the Cardinal thought it best to bring them by
all sleightes to fight with the Frenchmen out of hand, thinking thereby either
to win a notable victory, or if the Switzers received the overthrow by
unfortunate fight, to some vnappesible enimitie and immortal hatred between
the French nation, and the Switzers. Having therefore communicated his
counsel and purpose with the ensign bearers, and the most faithful chief men
of the Cantons: he secretly admonished Mutio Colonna (a Captain of the
Popes horsemen) that of a set match, when he had received the signal, he
should cause an alarm to be cried, and as though the Frenchemen approached
unto the suburbs with a great power, should issue out with the horsemen, and
with counterfaiting as great fear and peril as he could possibly, should crave
aid of the Switzers. He also commanded the foremost bands of the Switzers to do
the same: who being of great renoume of valor, and hatred toward the
Frenchemen, had still requested at the beginning of all wars, to have the
places next unto the enemies. And so accordingly the Soldiers had no sooner
dined, and were gone to take their noone nappe, but the trumpets and drums
suddenly sounded at the gates of Rome, and anon the rumor of the coming of
the Frenchemen waxing hot, all the bands one after another, when the
foremoste told them, that followed, the cause of the alarm, made themselves
ready, and with incredible feruency of fight, issued out at the gate: whom
also the mistrusted regiment following with advanced ensigns, hasted on heaps
unto the gate, least they should seem in that tumult, which apperteyned unto
the public safety and estimation, either to have forsaken those that were
before, or to be of another opinion touching the cause of the wars.

The Cardinal being notorious for his hatte and scarlet robe, road upon a
great horse before the marching ranks, with his cross borne before him, and
still as he came unto the ensign bearers, the pety Captains or any Soldiers
of mark, for notable factes, he would encourage and inkindle them to make
speed, saying that God and the holy Saints, did promise them the victory of
that day, in the which they should not only by valiant fight destroy all
the whole nobility of France, brought under the conducte of a Princoxe King
between two armies of his enemies, but also breaking the power of the Venetians
and Genouese by their fortitude and felicity, give laws and conditions unto
all Italy: nor that the hired Almaines, in whom consisted the Kings chief
strength (who^ yet they had often foiled in fight) were so estranged from the
Emperor or were of so prodigal prowes, that a man might think they would for
the Frenchmens sakes, who indeed were their utter enemies, fight against the
honor of al Germany: neither yet they should think that the Gascoignes, very
runaways, or those horsemen that braued it in their silks and chains of
gold, who had used to repose a little more safety in their horses and
spurs, than in their swords, strength, and stomachs, would fight either
more stoutly or constantly, than they had done before. But that labor and
peril which was left, was to be undertaken with a noble heart in winning
the ordinance of the enemies. Where if any of them were slain, they might most
constantly believe, that their souls being cleansed from all spots of sin by
him, with the Popes authority, would forthwith fly into heaven, leaving
behind on the earth a notable memory of their singular valiancy. As the
Cardinal rid to the foremoste ranks, every where still pronouncing these
speches: there followed him Galeaze Visconti, John Gonzaga, Cambero and Aquila
the Popes Legates, and diverse horsemen of those families, that of ancient good
will favored the name of Sforza, and had joined themselves with the Switzers,
when they issued out. And also certain armed bands of the commons, and
cutters, intermedled themselves of their own accord with the company passing
by.

They had scarcely marched three miles from Milan, neither was the French Camp
above thirty furlongs from them, when they began to shoot off their great
ordinance, which was ten falkons: which thing brought great hofulnesse and
admiration unto the Italian horsemen: for Mutius riding with changed cheer
unto the Capitaines of the first company, began to ask them what madness had
moved men skillful in martial matters, and the masters of that discipline, to
strive with the unseasonable thundering of their ordinance, to rouse the
enimye whom they had thought best to invade being unprepared and looking for
nothing less than battle. Unto whom it was courageously answered by the
foremoste ranks, that they should fight well enough according to the
discipline of war, even with the armed and provided enemy, if their
mistrusted fellows, and the ensigns of all the Cantons with one counsel and
intent descended into the field with them: which thing they hoped might be
brought to pass, if that through that faining of more certain signs, that
the battle was begun, had come unto the ears of their following fellows, whose
valor vanquished by infamous hire and money, if that there were no shame at all
in them of the public dignity, yet at the least the groans of their
kinsfolk falling down dead before their eyes, the religion of a soldiers
oath, and the fear of judgment, which would anon after be given at home
against the forsakers of their fellows, they thought would be able to stir
up and inflame them: for so great trust of valor was in their proud hearts,
that they despised with very great contempt the most mighty and strong power
of the enemies, neither did they think that any store and multitude of great
ordinance, or any munitions of place would stay their force from breaking into
their Camp, by bearing them down and vanquishing. Above al other, there were
three valiant fellows, but men of barbarous prowess, called Pelegrine
Landaberg, Centy Amerer, and Rafe Long, that led the three voluntary bands of
most valiant Soldiers that were placed in the front.

As soon as ever these men were come within the syghte of their ennimyes,
they incontinentely burned out with so great heat of fight, that they could
not be held back by the rest of the Captains, who with better counsel had
commanded the ensigns to stay, and to take a place to lodge in, and to
refresh the Soldiers, who were weary of their journey, but that they would
needs haste toward the ennimyes with speedye pace.

Burben and Trivulzi were encamped at Saint Iulians Church in a small
village, and wisely lodged at the left side of the high way, which was
defenced on all parts with stiepe and deep ditches, and after the manner of
the Countries, with high banks, next unto them the King him self, and
behind him the Duke of Alaunson, (unto whom by right of blood the kingdom
of France did appertain, if that Francis dyed without heir male,) had
placed the middle battle and rerewarde, one being severed from the other. by a
small distance. They being thus lodged in three parts, that the three great
armies, might the more commodiously and speedily be an aid one unto another,
when chance did require, were enclosed within a large and very well defenced
place: for round about were many ditches made by the husbandmen, to water
their lands, and Nauarro had also added new munitions in commodious places,
where it was thought good and needful, and also had set up against the
enemy, mighty targets fastened in the ground, and closed together with great
ropes, that the Gascoignes being defended and covered by them, might shoot at
the enemy more safely and ceratinly. This form of the Camp, and the nature of
the place had Mutius and certain of the Capitaynes of the Switzers riding unto
the higher part of the bank, for to survey the camp, incontinently marked, and
then had also noted, that on the right hand there was a commodious place left
for them to lodge in, where was a pretty low plain, enclosed almost on two
sides with a small river that ran down unto corn milles. They began to
counsel the Switzers to encampe in that place, and their bodies being
refreshed with rest and meat, to think nothing rashly of fight: they also
told them, that as victory proceeds from counsel and good advise, so vain
and sorrowful attemptes from unadvised hardiness: and that those men do oftener
feel the adverse euentes of fight, that trust to overcome their enimyes by
desperateness and fease, than those that seek victory by profitable tariance
and reason. Moreover they said, that the enemy was provoked against all
aboadement, because by an old observation of that nation, that day of the
week was all the year after unfortunate, upon the which Childermasse day had
fallen.

This was the thirteenth of September. But when that fury and fatal madness
(the which had never happened before unto the Switzers in the wars) had taken
away obedience from ye soldiers, and authority from the captains: the busier
sort ran forth and attached a very cruel fight with the Gascoignes and
Almaines.

Trivulzi and Burben, having intelligence long before, of the coming of the
enemies, had set their men in array of battle, and placed their ordinance in
a fit place, but now being doubtless pressed, did set on fire all the
houses of the village, both to stay the fease of the enemies by the fire, and
also to bereave them of the use and munition of the houses, and then reduced
their men into a larger place. Before the French ordinance, was there a
mighty ditche, which must be passed over with extreme peril of desperateness,
the which ditche was kept by Nauarro his bands, and the Launsquenetz men of
passing valor, with their thick ranks. This ditche a band or ring of very
desperate yongmen, doubted not to pass with more assured death than victory.

They were very chosen felows taken out of all the Cantons, men in the prime of
youth, and of singular forwardenesse: who by a very ancient order of that
Country, that by dooyng some deed of passing prowess, they may obtain rare
honor of warrefare before they be grown in years, do of themselves request
all perilous and hard pieces of service, and often use with deadlye praise to
run unto proposed death. These men do they call of their immoderate
fortitude, and stoutnesse, the desperats, forlorn hopen, and the frenchmen
Enfans perdus: and it is lawful for them by the prerogative of their prowess,
to bear an ensign, to have conducte, and double wages all their life long.
Neither are the forlorn known from the rest by any other mark and
cognizance, than the plumes of white feathers, the which after the manner of
Captains, they do turn behind, waueryng over their shoulder with a brave
kind of riot. They with noble courage ran full upon the ordinance, and
after that they had valiauntly and long fought with great loss in the place
of great disaduauntage, at length, when that they would for no incommoditie
give over, they driving the Almaines out of the place, and beating back
Nauarro his bands, came over the heaps of the dying unto their ordinance. The
which (in number seven pieces) being taken, they relying themselves again,
urged their shrinking enimyes, and disordered all the whole foreward.

In this great danger Trivulzi and Burbon flue hither and thither to repair
the distressed battle, to the uttermost that they could do by strength, or
provide by counsel, sending in the horsemen in diverse places.

Neither failed Nauarro unto his Soldiers, by chydyng some, and asking other,
whether that they had come from the farthest part of the Ocean, and the
Mountains Pyrenees, only for to turn their backs, and most shamefully to
fly out of the field almost before they had seen their enemies, that they
should pluck up their hearts, and make ready their harquebusses, and bows,
and abide so long, until that their sides were guarded with fresh succor of
horsemen, and think that they ought to wipe out, by fighting that day
valiantly, the note of cowardice, or of ill luck, that they had gotten at
Rauenna by fighting ill. So at one time, a mighty troop of horsemen breaking
upon them, and the Gascoignes being stayed by adhortation and shamefastenesse,
and the Lansquenetz keeping their place for anger and shame, a cruel and
variable fight is renewed: both sides are invaded with the horrible noise of
the ordinance and weapons, and the ensigns are torn into pieces: Anon Cenry
and Pelegrine are slain fighting courageously, and Pure the Captain of the
Pretorian or guarde band, and with him four ensign bearers are slain by a
great culuering shot from the side. Neither did the Switzers, (who fetching
a longer compass about had come unto the enemies) fail unto the their
distressed fellows, for they gathering three bands together into one, came in
two companyes with fresh strength and courage, and encountering with the
footmen on the left hand, slew Sciatalarde, a Captain of the Gascoignes of
renoumed name: and Jews and George Earls of Hellempurg, noble men of Germanye.

But in another part, they loosing a little their ranckes, did receive in
among them the charging horsemenne, where they fought long with variable and
doubtful fortune: for although the men of arms cruelly treading to death the
dispersed and the overthrown, did with the force and fease of their horses
break through with slaughter the flight and thin small bands, yet when
they met with the thick ranks, they were either broched with their long
pikes, or else their horses being slain under them, perished thorough the
waighte of their armor. There were slain in that place very valiantly
fighting these Capitaines of companies of horsemen, the Earl of Sancerre, the
Lord Imbercourt, a renoumed man for his singular prowess and long service in
the wars, the Lord Bussy de Ambois, and Francis brother to the Duke of
Burbon: and Burbon himself was in the like danger of life, as he himself said,
being among the thickest of that bloudye broyle. But afterward I heard the
contrary of the king himself, who affyrmed, naming witnesses, that Burbon
durst not succor his enclosed brother, and retired untouched out of the sight
of the enemies unto the middle battle. Also whilst that Trivulzi endeavored
in vain to succor his enclosed and dying ensignebearer he being tossed among
the pikes and halberdes of his enemies, and his horse wounded, and the creste
stricken off from his helmet, got himself out of this danger by the rescous
of his company of horsemen.

And now was the battle hardely sustained in most places, and the Switzers,
for that they had passed over the very ill ditche, had with great valor won
the ordinance, and defeating the footmen, and disordering the horsemen, had
won the place where their enemies had stood, seemed to have the better of
the battle: when the King aduauncing forward with him the middle battle, and
commanding Alencon to follow him with the rereward with equal pace, and many
pieces of ordinance being bestowed by the Captains in certain places by whom
the Esquadrons of the Switzers might be annoyed on the sides, came in very
good time with the black regiment, and a mighty number of horsemen, he
courageously professing both to his own Soldiers, and also unto his
enimyes, by his coat armor of Sky color, poudered with Lillies of gold,
that he was the King, was conuersaunt in the fore front, valiauntly laid on
the enimye, and perillouslye galloppyng his horse hither and thither,
encountered the hotest of the enemies, and finally inflamed his soldiers not
only with words and adhortations, but also with singular example of true
prowes: for the Switzers did press on so fervently, and stood to it so
sternely and stoutly, yea and so great was the valor and courage, yea of them
that were wounded and were dying, that the King in that iniquity of fight
must needs forget his majesty, contemn his life, and repair his inclined
state rather by valiant hand and strength, than by sleight, counsel or advice.
The horsemen also who had by running away at Nouarra and Turwin, lost the old
opinion of their prowess, did now least that if they should again give place,
be marked for ever after with everlasting ignomy: contend to satisfy the King
(who fought valiauntly in the sight of them all) either by honorable death, or
else with noble victory. There were slain in this encounter the Prince of
Talemonde, son unto Seigneur Tremouiile, and Seigneur de Roy, a man of great
nobility in Picardie, and Seigneur Vantell, who bare the extraordinary
standerde of the Kings troop, and many more of the valiantest horsemen, and
Mounsieur de Moy that bare the ensign of a very noble company of horsemen,
because they being empeached and entangled with the ditches and vines, could
not get out and orderly range their bands. But of the Switzers there was slain
Rafe Long, that great stirrer up of the multitude, and also Flech, a man more
renoumed for his valiauncye, than his stock, and VVolter Offy, who for his
singular prudence, and mighty strength (which are not lightly blended together
in men of that nation) had gotten great opinion of prowess in all wars, and
especially at the battle of Nouara. They fought continually seven hours
without ceassing* for when the sun had failed them in the mids of the heat
of the battle, the Moon that then shined bright, kept both armies in arms.
And the fight was horrible and very bloody, as long as there was any light at
all. But anon when the Moon was hidden with the clouds, although they being
wearied with toil and wounds, and their weapons blunted, sought place for
rest, yet in the mean time through mutual error both friends and foes were
slain by blind and frantike blows. For when the Almaines not being much
unlike unto the Switzers, neither in tongue nor habit, were blended together
with the Switzers in diverse places, at length the watcheworde bewrayed them,
and then foul slaughter was committed in the dark. Neither ceased the
ordinance all night: but as they were shot off without any certain marks,
so did they cause more terror than flaughter. The Cardinal, who had not this
day failed unto his Countrymen in hope, care and toil, did by mistaking the
place, light among the Almaines, but got himself out of the danger by
counterfaiting their tongue by a rougher voice, and passying the ditche
returned unto the burning houses of the village, whether Rosty and Anglarde,
being invited with the shining of the fire, and many other of the Captains
resorting, as it were unto the Generals tent, had caused the mighty horn of a
wild Vri, (the which being delivered by hand from their ancesters, is kept
with great care and religion at Vri, the authors of the liberty of the
Switzers) to be sounded, that the dispersed and wandering Soldiers might be
called unto the ensigns. This no doubt saved many, that were intermedled in
diverse places among their enemies, because they could have no certain
recourse unto their fellows, the likeness of the sounds of the drums
confounding their ears. Both armies by reason of mutual fear passed the
whole night without sleep, yet were more ready in heart, than in strength
for to fight again: for although the valiant, and also the cowardes were both
tired with the long toil of fight, yet with diverse habites of heart they were
excited either with desire of fight, victory, or fear of death. The Cardinal,
and the rest of the Captains, although that the first opinion seemed
greatly to have deceived them, for that they had not (as they had hoped)
vanquished at the first charge their enemies, yea being disordered with great
slaughter, and lost with almostle vain attempt the stoutest of their men: yet
forsake not themselves and call many into counsel, and when that it pleases
them all to expecte the light, and to fight again, they do decree that
certain be sent to Milan, to request all kind of help, for that they had
come forth unprovided of all things. John Gonzaga is sent to fill with new
hope Maximilian, and the Citizens of Milan, who were hofull of the event of the
battle, and to send from the City out of hand bread and meat ready dressed,
and many vessels of wine for the soldiers that fainted for weariness and
thirste, and to convey unto the Camp great ordinance, shot and powder with
all possible speed. But when the Counsel was broken up, the Capitaines and
ensign bearers spoke dyuersly among the Soldiers, according as every man
thought of the Cardinal and of the event of the battle. Some being desirous
of honor and victory, made light of the great loss that they had in deed,
and did extol and augment with false tales, the valiant acts of their
fellows, and the slaughter of the Frenchmen.

Contrariwise, those of the adverse faction, that they might speedilye provide
for their own safety, and also augment the danger of dignity, and life in
the Cardinal, who was environed with extreme difficulties, disbended, and
returned to Milan. Also the Popes horsemen, who for their small number had
served to no great use, did for a great part of them, either for fear or
despair forsake their captains, and return into the City. But although the
king were delivered and rid of the greatest fear, and mightiest danger, and
seemed to have nobly sustained men of so great valor, yet being hofull for the
fear that remained, and as it were the last care, exspected the end of the
troublesome night, and uncertain fortune. Neither did he give greater rest
unto his body, which was wearyed with the weight of his armor, and was
scortched for thirste and continual toil, than pulling up his beauer to
take breath, lean a little while upon a great piece of ordinance, whilst
that his horse was changed. And then incontinently tourning to the charges of
a chieftaine, sent unto Liuiano to come unto him with his army, and anon
drew in and made his Camp less. After that the devise had been liked of
the Captains, to whom he had imparted it, and because that the enemy
professed the place where his fore ward had stood, he placed within a better
defenced plot above six thousand Almaines at the bank of the ditche, and
commanded them to guard the ordinance, which he had commodiously planted there
in great abundaunce. And in another quarter he joined a great number of
horsemen with himself, and willed Burbon, and Alencen, to admoue the first
and third battles unto his side with equal order and front: so that he
standing full butte against the enemy, did, as the place required, stand in
steed of the fore ward, and used the two other battles placed on his left
and right sides as it were for wings. Neither far from that place had
Nauarro, and a great multitude of Almaines encamped, pitching down their
ensigns in the ground, because when the battle was broken off by the going
down of the Moon, they could learn neither the form of the Camp, nor the
kings counsel and purpose.

The King, that he might view with his own eyes how the ditches stood, and
how broad the field that lay between them, and the high way was, road
forth with a few horsemen within the sight of the enemy, and anon the dark
vanishing by little and little into the dawning, the King went to encourage the
Almaines, whom being erected by great promises, he adhorted to finish the
battle by fighting a little while, and to take the rewards of victory already
gotten. He also full of assured hope, and couragiousnesse, vehementely
enkindeled them by rehearsing the injuries and discomfitures, that the Switzers
had don and given the Almaines, rather through the benefit of fortune, and the
great advantages of times and places, than by true prowess. Wherefore they
should persuade themselves that this was the proper and ready occasion to
revenge the Massacre of their kinsfolks, and fellow Soldiers, and also the
mean for to show by valiant acts, that as the Almaines did excel them in
nobility, and faithfulness: so neither would they grant unto these clownes
the martial glory for valor and skill in arms. And also using the like speech
he adhorted the French horsemen, not to degenerate from their forefathers, who
had in former ages excelled all nations for service on horsbacke. Neither were
the batells ranged among the Switzers with less hope and courage, although ye
greatest part of ye soldiers, as they had with diverse chances lodged in
sundry places, ye and within the munitio^s of ye enemy, being refreshed with no
succor of meat did hardly with fierce hearts sustain their fainting limbs.
For the victuals that by the procureme^t of Gonzaga should be brought from Milan
in so short time, and namely in ye night season; which does commonly hinder
have in all doings, could not be brought unto them timely enough, and made
ready. And also most of them when their breakefaste was offered unto them anon
after the break of the day, being called to the battle by the noise of the
drums, and the roaring of the ordinance, left their meat desired before, and
also needful to repair their strength.

At the beginning diverse Capitaynes assembled together, among whom was Haisler
and Focte a famous man, for the honor of his age, and the cognisaunces of his
office, and Chezze Amman, who had served in the fields above forty years
pety. Captain, ensign bearer, and Captain in chief, and had won singular
praise in the forefront, at that famous battle at Nancey, in the which the
Switzers slew and destroyed Charles the Duke of Burgongne, and al his power.
These men whether adduced by consideration of the great loss that they had
received, or having intelligence of the departure of diverse of their fellows,
and also now seeing through the benefit of the light, the great disaduauntage
of the places, judged it to be best to abstain from battle, thinking that
they had gotten estimation enough by yesterdayes encounter for to break the
hauty hearts of the Frenchemen. But after they had gone about in vain to
stay, by dissuading prayers the ensigns, which were now advanced foreward, and
to retein them by standing against them in the way they should go: they also
yielded unto the fate and wilfulness of the soldiers. So Rafe Segne,
Visembach of Vnderwalden, Vlderick Iock, and Zambron, desperate captains of
singular valor, ordering among them selves how they would attache the battle,
made toward the enemy in two companies or battles. The foremost and greatest
battallion, wherein was placed the ensign of the Canton of Zurich (the which
is of highest dignity among the Switzers) hasted directly against the Kings
battle, the which we told you stood in the mids. The other company which had
stood upon the right hand a little beneath the houses of the village that was
burnt, fetching a greater circuit about, began to bend toward Alencon the
Captain of the rereward, for this intent, that when the auaunt guarde had
turned the king and the strength of the French army upon them, they might with
furious charge set upon the side of Alencon, who was entrenched with weaker
munitions, and defenced with less guard, and his battle being broken through,
they might perce into the side of the left wing and the back of the kings
battle. But unto an other multitude of their fellows, who were encamped in a
field on the left hand, on this side the high way, they appointed no
certain charge of attaching fight, because they were thought to consist of
Cantons being of small fidelity, but did set them three hundredth paces from
the rest, over right against the right wing, wherein Trivulzi and Burbon
governed. When the Switzers had gone forward an arrows shoot, the Frenchemen
in continently at one instant time shooting off all the kings ordinance upon
them, slew so many of them with singular celeritie, that they which had
taken counsel of foolish hardiness, were punished for their rashenesse
before that they could come to hand strokes, yea or approach unto their
enemies. Now since this chance had caused an horrible wastenesse and slaughter
in the mids of the Switzers, so that there was no longer one body of their
battallion, their ranks being torn: part of them that feared the second
volee, began to turn their backs and to retire, but part despising the
ordinance, again gave a chardge upon the enemies, and with more constant
valor and desperateness, than ever they they had used before, giving and
taking many wounds, passed the ditch, and encountering with the Lansquenetz
and the kings horsemen, did many acts of sauadge prowess: for when Trivulzi
and Burbon stretching out in length their wing, and fetching a compass about
with their horsemen, had charged their left side, they were forced, to fight
with double front. But the Launsquenetz, who had in this most sharp encounter
lost their stoutest Capitaines, James Condey, Henry Ricurt, and Saxey, beying
mad^^ for anger and grief, did valiauntly set forward, and repressed their
violence, and with the shot of their harquesses, tumbled from his horse
Pontin^r (one of great renown among the Capitaines of the Switzers, for the
tallenesse of his stature, and the valiantness of his heart) as he road unto
the ranks, and encouraged his soldiers with a loud voice, and used
reproachful words against the Almaines: who in the fight of the Switzers
anointed their bloody pikes in the tallow and grease of his mighty and fat
body, that ran out at his wide wounds, which thing is accounted among the
Barbarians, in deadly hatreds for a very grave ceremony of reuengefully
acquitted. There also Zambron, and Anty Eucher, men of strong courage and
terrible stature, while that they guided with singular skill mighty two
hand-swordes, in the mids of the Almaine batallion, cutting off a great
number of these pikes, and slaying many of their enemies, were at the last
oppressed, when all the whole battle turned upon them. Then also was Chezze
Amman slain, his horse being first killed, and h^^^ himself also shot in
with three arrows: a man who being of that years, had by encouraging and
fighting many hours, committed the duty neither of a very good capitayn, nor a
most valiant soldier, where as the rest of the Captains (that I spoke of)
had died before that they came to fight with the enemy, being for he into
pieces with the ordinance: And when John Berre the ensign bearer of the
Ba^^lians, being wearied with many wounds was not able any longer to keep the
ensign, he pulled it off from the ^^a^^e, and tore it into very small pieces,
that his enemies might not gain it, and then dyed: Moreover in the mean ^^^e,
the second battle, which we told you de^^ected unto Alencon, inferred so
great ^^rror unto the rerewarde, that the horsemen for a great part (
Monsieur Beaument their ensign bearer being slain) at the first meeting
to^rned their backs, and fled a maine on the spur toward Ledy, which
caused the Pesants and many espies that were in the fields, seeing the French
horsemen fleing among the cariages, to write unto all parts of Italy, that the
French King was discomfited, and the Switzers had gotten the victory.

And doubtless the Frenchmen in ye quarter had ^en brought into very great
danger, if that Emar Prieus, and the Lord Obegney capitaines of singular
experience, who were with Alencon raryng them that fled, rolying the
ensigns, and casting the Soldiers into a ring, had not borne the ^runt of
the fight with surpassing pain and toil. And also Liuiano was a great
succoure unto the disordered: who with a company of noble men of arms came
before the rest of his power which followed after. And as he was a man gready
of fight, and to do some fear, encoraging his horsemen to follow him without
doubting or staying, so he gave a charge overthwart the side of his enimyes:
whom two bands of Switzers (turning their ensigns) received very
courageously, and wounding many, and slaying Capino the son of the Earl of
Petilia, a young Gentleman of passing towardliness, did repel far from them
the hotely urging horsemen. Yet that company of Switzers bring more terrified
by his coming, than his power, for that they thought all the whole power of
the Venetians, (who were indeed near) were already come, began to provide
for their safety; for some of them being quite spent with werinesse, wounds,
thirste, and sweat, got them into the Gardens that near adjoined: where a
great part of them were slain, when that the horsemen were sent ofter them,
yea from the kings battle: other retiring into the next village, after they
had long time defended themselves at the gate, and walls, under the conduct of
Tuler Cefuse, a very valiant captain, at the last being won and vanquished with
the ordinance and fire, most cruelly perished: but other being despersed, and
fleing back unto the greatest company or battle of their fellows, the
horsemen chasing them in those very large and open fields, had been wholly
destroyed, if that by the advice and valor of certain old soldiers (who in
that frowning of fortune being mindful of discipline, never failed unto
themselves and their fellows) they had not retired unto their fellows that
were on this side the ditches and high way, in a thick Esquadron. Almost at
the very same time the third battle of the Switzers, the which we showed you
had stood over right against Trivulzo and Burbon, either because they saw the
iniquity and disaduauntage of the battle, or else were adduced by detestable
counsel, for that they had rather satisfy their faction and hatred, than
public necessity in being beholders of the slaughter and prowess of othermen,
began to retire with their ensigns toward Milan, neither would they as
men thoroughly attached with fear once come into the battle to fight, the
which yet they were almost forced to do: seeing that they had all the light
horsemen in sight, and were often shot at with the great ordinance: which being
politikely hidden behind the horsemen, were at the last when the troops had
opened at the sound of the trumpet, often shot off in the void spaces.
Therefore when the rest of the Switzers (whom we left fyghtyng at the Kings
battle) inflamed with fury and wrath, kept their ground rather by obstinacy
of heart, than strength, and saw other fresh regimentes of Launsquenetz to
whom the light had not yet come, ready to come upon them: they despairing of
the victory, soun^ded the retreite, for a little before they had received a
great detriment at the ditch: being maruellously endomaged from the higher
ground by an innumerable multitude of arrows, shot by the Gascoignes
Arcubalisters, who being placed hard by the harquebusters, that the one might
have time to chardge their harquebusses, and the other to bend their cross
bows, did so shoot off one after another by hundrethes, with mutual running
back, that the battle of the Switzers being overwhelmed with the continual
hail of the shot, were without revenge beaten down, they in vain seeking
succor of prowess and valor. The battle being thus broken off, when that
Rosty, Run, Anglarde, and the other Capitaynes could not succor so great
and so drsordered a multitude, by admonishment, and commanding them what they
should do, nor easily do the duties of captains, the soldiers themselves,
yea although they were quite spoiled by so many incommodities, did in that
iniquity of things prescribe unto themselves with marvelous constancy and
singular skill, what was to be done, that they might not seem to fly. For
having a care of the wounded, two soldiers did with singular pity carry on
their arms and shoulders one man weakened with wounds, and bringing back
every one of the pieces of ordinance that they had brought from Milan,
strengthened the hyndermost tail with a guarde of the fresher Soldiers. But
they marched with so stayed a part, that their departure seemed to have no
similitude of flight: neither indeed could they be easily invaded, because
they were defenced on both sides of the high way with very deep and
continual ditches. The Frenchmen, who had stood armed in the battle twenty
hours together, and the most part of the time with doubtful victory, and
their limbs now slowed with sweat, and their horses fainted for weariness,
and had almost lost the sense of their eyes and ears with the thick miste
of the raised duste, and the incessant and horrible thundering of the
ordinance, made an end of pursuing: yet having so gotten the victory, that they
rather vanquished them by fighting valiauntly than taught, that by all men's
opinion it is impossible to overcome them again by any power. The Switzers
being very courteously and liberally received and entertained in their old
lodgings at Milan, did put in the public hospitalles those that were
grievously wounded, and then gave the rest of the day and the night following
to recreate their bodies. The next day they filled the broad streate that
lies before the Castle, with so great a number, that by the estimation of
all men, they seemed to have riceyued almost no loss at all. There they
holding a counsel, requested three months pay, and unless that it were
presently paid, they said they would go home. But when Maximilian could not
perform it, because he had not so much ready money, they incontinently
advanced their ensigns at the gate that leads to Como, and went home. When
a view was taken of them that were slain, the Frenchmen contended, that of
the five and twenty thousand Switzers that had come forth into the field,
scarce the one half of them returned, and that of their men there were not
above three thousand slain. But the Switzers did very much augment the
number of the Frenchmen that they slew, and holding a muster at home in their
country, confessed that they had lost in that voyage, to the number of five
thousand very valiant men. Among the carcasses of the enemies, Claude Duke of
Guise, brother unto Antony Duke of Loraine was found drawing onwarde to death,
but yet was saved. This young Gentleman of singular towardliness, was Capitayn
of the Lansquenetz, and had fought so valiantly in the fore ward, that being
sore wounded, and at length the whole battallion of the Switzers lying upon
him, he was beaten down among the dead of his own men, and his enimyes.
After the departure of the Switzers, the King had the whole Duchye of Milan
yielded unto him with the Duke, and also Placontia and Parma by the Pope.

The Battle at Synga fought in Syria between Selym the great Turk, and
Campson the Sult an of AEgipt, in anno. 15 16. Out of Iouius.
SElym the great Turk intending a second voyage against the Sophy, sent
Legates unto Campson the Sultan of Egypt, whom dee understood had lately
entered into league with the Sophy: that he might without any displeasure or
impeachme^t of his, pursue the Sophy with wars, who had brought so many and
so grease calamities into Asia, and by inducing of new superstitions,
vehemently labored to deprave and defare the most certain laws of the
Mahumetane religion. But when Campson had answered that he would have no
peace with him, unless that he would abstain from molesting the dominions of
the Sophy, and also restore Aladine the expulsed son of the King of the
Aladoles unto his fathers kingdom: Selym changed his purpose, and striking
down from the Mountain Taurus into Comagene, came with above an hundredth
thousand armed men, and a great number of field pieces within two days
journey of Alep^ (where the Sultan was with a small power) before that proud
Campson; who had thought to terrif^e Selym with his only authority, and the
greatenesse of his name, could be persuaded that he, had passed the
mountains. But when he was thus caught unprovided, and was forced to consulte
in the mid^ of his danger what was to he done: he began to waver, and to be
tossed to and fro, with fear and shame, not being able to be redily resolved,
whether be should with stout stomach abide by it, and try the fortune of
battle with great disaduauntage, or warily gius place unto the imminent
deadly storm, and retire back into more safer places until that he had
levied a greater power. There were some of the Captains that preferred safe
aduises before glorious, and above all other one Iamburd, surnamed Gazelles, a
man brought up by the great Caitbey, and a valiant man, and famous for
martial prudence, and also Captain of Amanus, and Apamia, who as he thought
it would bring great calamity to encounter in battle the mighty and old
army of the enemies, with so small power: so he said that it was best to retire
back with speedse march, and to choose the seat for the wars at Damascus,
the which might very safely and easily be done, because the Turkishe army
having many footmen, and also being combred with wagons, was flow to pursue
them. In the mean time all the rest of the Mamaluches which were in garrison
in Judea, and Egypt, being sent for, and also the Arabians their neighbors
hired to serve them, the wars might be prolonged until that the enemy might
be easily overcome thorough lack of victualles. Neither would Alepo, if that
it were strengthened but only with a small garrison, straight way yield unto
the Turks, seeing they had no other ordinance with them, than field pieces,
and by this time to, there would (...) aid of Persians out of Mesopotamia,
and also the Sophy himself vnderst anding of the Turks voyage, would break
forth into Asia the lesser, neither would the Christians, (if they were
requested by legates) fail to supply great ordinance against the common
enemy, out of the Isles of Cyprus, and Rhodes. Which being gotten, and their
power made match unto the Turkishe, then he might (if he thought it to be so
glorious a thing to adventure the battle) not rashely descend into the field.
But very grievous, and weighty wars, which have at the first vehement and
sudden violent braides and forces, do commonly languishe in time thorough the
prudent lingering of their adversaries. Therefore he should not haste to make
proof of fortune, seeing that the errors and escapes of wars, which oftenest
proceed from the unskillfulness and rashness of the chieftayne, all good men
may bewail and heartily detest, but to restore and amend them, no not the
immortal Gods themselves are able. Gazelles had moved many with bys opportune
and grave sentence, but that the stouering of the Soldiers, and the foolish
couragiousnesse of the Mamaluches (the guarde of the Sultan) were a great
empeachment unto Campsons cares, for well hearing of the truth: for as soon as
they had heard more certain news of the coming of the Turks, they leaped
and skipped over all the Camp, for incredible joy, laughed, smiled, and rubbed
the elbow, and one gratulated another, that a time had come wherein they might
show their valor and win glory: And that now they would hold fast this so
long wished for occasion, thorough the which they discomfiting, and slaying his
enemies, would extol their Emperor Campson above the title and most renouu^ed
fame of Caitley the great. Neither wanted there some of the chief, who by
rehersing of flattery, and vain boasting, with how great glory they had
discomfited at Tarsus the mighty army of the Turks, almost with no labor,
boldly said, that the enemy would be easily and speedily vanquished. But
specially Cayerbey, the lieftenaunt of Alexo and the Province of Comagene,
hasted by speaking many high words of the zealous endeavor, prowess, and heat
of the Mamaluches, to make light of those things which had heene reported of
the provision, furniture, and number of the enimyes, and to overthrow the
reasons of most wholesome counsel: The which he did of pernicious treason, as
he that had intelligence that the Sultan ment^ to put him to death, as he had
also done his brother, but deferred the execution thereof, because that he had
in the Camp a very strong power of friends, and also was singularly well
beloved of the Citizens of that mighty City, wherein he possessed a very^
strong Castle. Moved with the which peril, he had sent privy messengers
unto Selym, who should in his name offer to pleasure him privily, to the
uttermost of his power, and to show unto him all the counsels of Campson, and
what his power was, and to advise him to hasten to fight with the Sultan. Thus
Campson despising Gazelles counsel, the which was very faithful and
wholesome, and impelled by the adhortation of the traitor Cayerbey, and of all the Mamaluches incontinently at the first news of Selyms approach determined to
darreyne hattell with him. The Sultan was encamped in a commodious place at the
river of SINGA, almost x. miles from the City, for this reason, that the
soldiers might use the nearenesse of the River, and be removed out from the
houses and delights of the City, and yet nevertheless might be easily helped
with the commodities, riches, and power thereof. The Mamaluches (a kind of
ordinary soldiers, out of whom the Sultan was always chosen) were scarce
twelve thousand: but every one of them according unto the greatness of his
wages, and wealth, had many servants attendant on him, very well appointed with
armor and horses. The Mamaluches terrible men for their long heardes, and
threatening eyes, mightily brawned in all parts of their bodies, and very
nimble, do use to fight with such art, that after the first shot of their
Lances, they with a certain wonderful agilitie and valor, do use now their
arrows, casting their shield behind them, then their mace of iron, sometimes
a sword crooked like unto a sith, as the place and encounter do require.
Their horses are strong and hot, and for making and swistnesse like unto the
Genets of Spain, and that which does seem to be beyond the opinion of our
men, they do especially excel in so great docilitie, that they have learned
by nature and usage to reach up unto their riders a lance, or arrowe taken up
from the ground with their teeth, to know the ennimies, and to fly on them
with their teeth, and beating down all cound about them with their heels: and
all this do they by signs and certain voices uttered by their masters. Upon
these horses are seen saddles guilt, bittes of silver, defenses for their
necks and breasts of pron plates. The horseman himself is contented with a
shirt of maile, or a coat of plate. The horsemen of the fore ranks, and all that are ren^umed for riches, wear helmets, the rest do think themselves
sufficiently defenced against all blows by the linen cover of their head, the
which is finely wretahed with many rolls: but the basest forte use red thrummed
hattes that can not be cut thoroughe with the weighty stroke of asworde.
Campson divided his army into five battles: the first he committed to
Cayerbey, because that the battle was fought in his province: the second to
sibey, who was furnamed ^^lman^, that is to say, the Tumbler, for his
wouderfull nimblenesse of body: he was Prince of Da^iascus, a man of singular
fidelity, and prowess. These two battles should at one time charge the right
and left wings of the Turks. Then did Gazelles ^ol^we with the third battle
for to, succoure the one o^ the other, as the case should require: The fourth
glisering with guilt armor, Campson himself led, twelve furlongs distant
from the rest, as it were for a battle of succor.

The fifte battle was left to guarde the Camp. But Selym had so aranged his
army, that according unto his accustomed manner, he placed the horsemen of Asia
in the right wing, and the horsemen of Europe in the left: but the Ianizars
with the great ordinance in the middle battle. And before the Ianizars in the
front of the middle battle stood the most bravely appointed and valiant
horsemen of the Guarde, among whom Selym would be that day contrary to his
wont. Is soon as the armies approached one unto the other, Cayerbey for show
of a noble courage gave a sharp onset on the Europian horsemen, and straight
way as though he would have enclosed their battle, he defeated with a long
circuit about on their backs, where he dysordered with greater terror than
staughter the hindermoste tail, where the drudges, the baggage, and
innumerable Camells were: that being both valiant and also traitorous, he
might seem both to satisfy his honor, and also his falshoode.

But in another quarter the Prince of Damascus, that he might invade the
ennimies on the open side, omitting the front, and bringing about his troops
toward the left hand, gave a charge ouerthwarte the enemies: and the
Mamaluches fought so fervently, that committing a great slaughter of the
Asians, they perced like unto a most violent stream even unto the ensigns,
which had been placed in the mids of the battle. Neither after that the
foremoste were overthrown, could Mustaphas the Bellerbech (he was an
Hungarian, son in law unto Bajazet) and Imbracorbassa the master of the
kings horse (who contended with great force unto the contrary) longer slaye
the horsemenue, but that they fled.

So the victorious Prince having cut into two parts the wing of the enemies,
was come sidelong unto the footeme^, and the backs of the horsemen of the
guarde, and filled almost all the middle battle with slaughter and tercou^.
The Turkishe state stood in great danger, for that Sely^ was by the
incursyon of the enemies almost cut off from his foot^^^ (in whom he reposed
his greatest hope) and also the horsemen of the guarde were very sharply
pressed by Gazelles: who followyng the fortune of the Prince of Damascus, had
now charged the middle front, and finally the Asian horsemen being disordered
and defeated, could find no mean to repair the fight, when Synambassa came
to succoure them being in great distress. By his coming, who had been vered
by Cayerbey with none or small fight, and thereby brought in a fresh multitude
of horsemen, the audacitie of the Mamaluches was abated, and the courages of
the Turks increased, and anon after the victory also was taken away from the
enemy. When by Selyms commandment the ordinance was shot off full upon the
enemies: whose unaccustomed thundering did so affright the Mamaluches their
horses, that their riders could not rule them, neither could they themselves
do any good with all their singular and wonderful valor, because they were
enclosed in the mids by the infinite multitude of their enemies. Yet
notwithstanding, in this asperitie of things, were not their hearts broken,
neither although they were forsaken by Cayerbey and fortune, failed they unto
themselves, either in advise or valor: for uniting themselves all together into
one thick troop, they brake through the battle that stood before them,
with the slaughter of the Europeans, and the detriment of the wing of the
horsemen of the guarde, and began to make their continued course unto the
Camp and City. Anon all the rest also were made to fly, Sinambassa
pursuyng them with the lightest and the freshest of the horsemen: for Selym,
who had that day without all doubt appeared greater than himself for the
patience and sufferance of body that he showed in that extreme heat, the
couragiousnesse of his heart, and the felicity of his counsel had (fleing
hither and thither) adhorted his men to follow the victory, and pursue the
affrighted. Now had Camps^n advanced forward his battle, either that he
might succor his men, or be present at the victory, if the Turks were
vanquished: when he understood, by the way of those that fled, that Cayerbey
had revolted his power was defeated, neither could now the flight of them
he stayed: finally so great was the force of the ordinance, and so great the
multitude of the eniuries, that they were able no longer to sustain them. With
the which news the haughty old man of. lxxvij. years, who living in
perpetual tra^quility of state had never before seen fortune frown,
conceyuing a supreme grief, almost wounded, nor long after a company of his
own fleeing men, and also of the pursuing enemies (who being carried with
violent course upon the spur, threw down all that they met indifferently
without regard) coming upon him: Campson being loaded with years, and the
weight of a mighty Hernia or rupture, and also fainting for extreme heat and
sorrow, was smouldered in that duste. Moreover as the Mamaluches sledde amain
unto the Camp, and from thence unto the City, the Princes of Damascus, and
Tripoli endeavoring to sustain the force of their urging enemies, in the
hindermoste tail were slain. But Selym causing a few tents to be set up in
the same field where they had fought, and the greater part of his army being
placed in station, passed that night without sleep, as he that being ignorant
of his victory and fortune, did greatly fear least that men of so great
valor would have returned again that night, and given a Camisado unto his
camp: Sithence he himself had seen, that they were defeated, and made to fly
rather for fear of the ordinance, than by the true prowess of his Soldiers.
But afterward when Gazelles, and the rest of the Mamaluches had more certain
intelligence of Campsons death, they departed from Alepe with spedy pace, and
hasted unto Damascus at the fourth watch, their horses being scarce yet
refreshed of their weariness The next day Selym marching forward, granted
unto his soldiers the spoil of his enemies Camp, the which was full of all
royal riches: and from thence marching unto the City, received the yielding
Alepans with their Captain Cayerbey, and granted them to be free from paying
tribute. There died in this battle not above one thousa^^ Mamaluches, but more
of their servants: and greater slaughter was committed in the flight than in
the fight. For when their horses fainting with sweat, and dying every where for
thirst, they were set on foot, and were easyly oppressed by every towardly
soldier, for a great number of noble horses died, because they being very
fat and kept over delicately in the shadow: and stable, could not bear
vehement and unwonted labor, and namely that day, when the Sun scortched all
things with his immoderate blaze. This field was fought the five and twentyth
of Iugust, upon the very same day (which is wonderful) that two years before
he had vanquished the Sophy in battle. But they report, that on Selims fide
there were stain above three thousand horsemen: that hereby we may confecture
how great a slaughter he had received if that the left wing, which had
remained untouched the ough the benefit of the traitor Sinambassa, had also
lighted on his Prince of Damascus: albeit in very deed seeing that Selim was
sully strengthened and established with the fresh and yet whole and un touched
guard of his footmen: it was thought that he could not come into any danger
of safety or ignomy. Two days after was the body of Campson found, without
wound, by them that were appointed to search for him, the which Selim
commanded to be openly showed: that those nations which thought wish obstinase
credulity, that Campson was yet living, and gone toward Caire to repair his
power, might be deprived of all the rest of their hope, and also they which
were faithful unto the Turk, might he made ever after more firm, now that
all suspicion of that matter was quite taken away. Nor long after, when the
body began to stink, and the fame of the common people seemed to be
sufficiently reproved by showing of the body three days, it was buried with
small funerals at a very ancient Temple of the City. Alepo being yielded,
Selim marched unto Damascus, a City of very great riches and power, which
also yielded: whose example caused the Cities on the Sea coaste, and especially
Tripoli, Beritus, Sidon, and Acres, to send Legates unto Selim, with surrender
of themselves unto his clemencye and fealty.

The Battle of Gaza, fought between Synambassa Chiestaine for Selym the
Turk, and Gazelles Lieutenaunt of Tomumbey the Sultan of Aegipt in anno.
15.16. Out of Ionius.
AFter the death of Campso^, Selym minding to pierce Aegipt, sent before from
Damascus Sinambassa into Judea with fifteen thousand horsemen, and a strong
power of Marquebusiers, which had been chosen out of the Ianizars and Asappes,
for to surney all that region; and to open the way unto Gaza, the which was
combersome and troublesome, by reason of the Arabians. That City stands on
the Sea coaste, and in the fines of Aegipt, near unto the sandy deserts,
through whom they must go with a hard and painful journey that will
tranaile unto the farther A^gipt, and unto the City of Caire. The Citizens of
Gaza, because they had no garrison of soldiers, at the very first received
Synambassa, and subtly thanked him for that he had vouchesafed to deliver
them out of the intolerable slauerye of the Mamaluches: for the memory of the
which benefit they promised to be, and remain true and faithful unto Selym
and his successors for ever. But whilst that Synambassa expected in Camp
within an arrowe shoot of the City, the coming of Selym, learning out
diligently in the mean time the region that they must pass thoroughe to go
into Aegipt, and endeavoring to win the friendship of the Arabian
Capitaines, and suborning espies to go unto Caire, to learn the counselles of
the Mamaluches and Tomumbey (whom they had chosen after the death of Campson to
be Sultan) the Citizens of Gaza, who by nature were extreme enemies unto the
Turks, and now began to feel daily great damage through the present
Turkishe army, certified Tomumbey of the coming of Synambassa, and also gave
him to understand, that the same power of the Turks might be easyly oppressed
and destroyed before that Selym were come, if that a strong crew of Mamaluches
with skillful Capitaines were sent unto them: for whilst the Mamal^ches did in
the dead time of the night at a time agreed upon between the Citizens and
them, invade the fleeping Tu^kes, they would also at the self same moment,
sally out of the Citiz and disorder and deface the enemies camp with fire and
swood. Temumbey and the Mamaluches do incontinently like the devise, and send
Gazelles with sire thousand horsemen or Mamaluches and a great multitude of
Arabians. But he was scarce departed from Caire, but Synambassa had
intelligence thereof by Syrian espies, and how they hasting without any
cariages, would be there within two days.

The which news, as it saved the Turkishe army, to also was it of great
moment to the obtaining of the entire victory of the whole wars. But
although Synambassa had no intelligence at all of the falshoode of the Gazans,
yet because he did suspecte (as he was a man of a provident and wise head) that
the like might happen unto him, determined left that he might have to do
with two enemies at once, to meet the Mamaluches by the way, and to try the
fortune of fight. Therefore dislodging after the second watch, he with
great silence departed out of the sight of the City, and marched fifteen
miles in the way toward Caire.

Now he was come near unto a small village, where all tr^uailers do
commonly use to ledge, by reason of the commodity of a plentiful Spring that
rises in that place.

It fortuned that Synambassa was minded to stay in that village, and also
Gazelles had likewise thought to rest there certain hours and refreshe his men
and horses, that he might fiye to Gaza in the night time on his refreshed and
^ayted horses: when almost at one time it was told the Chieftaines on both
sides by the auantcurrers, that there was a mighty duste raised, and that the
enemies approached.

Gazelles being vehemently troubled in mind with this unlooked for chance, for
that he perceived he should miss of his purpose and intent, and be unable to
match the enimye, if he would encounter him, special ye seeing hy^ d^oses were
weary: yet for all this, h^^ hearts fails him not, althought he wors forced
presently upon a sudden to devise what was to be done for the common safety
of the whole army: and adhorteth his soldiers to make ready their weapons,
and to think that the thing which they could not do by ambushe and stealth,
as they had meant they must now dispats he openly by true valor. On the other
side Synumbassa having his men far sooner set in array, than Gazelles
could, because he had told them long before at leisure, what he would have
to be done, if they should happen to sight: used ^^^ng and cheerful speeches
unto all the ranks of his soldiers but the end of his oration was, that
they should quite forget all fleing away, seeing that all places round about
them would do shall and ^^^urions to them unless they were victors: and
speriasly that they should fully persuade themselves this one thing, that
nouman should perish that day, but he whom God almighty had prodestinated to
death by the most certain laws of fate, and that with equal peril the
valiant should find safety in the minds of the ^^^^nses s^^ordes, and also the
fearful death in their most safest ^^ight throught the power of ^oau^ ^^^ble
let. The harquebus^^^ were in the wings, the which were stretched forth in
length, with a single array and one man not standing very nere unto another,
that they might be able to use their harquebusses more fo^^ly, and compass he
the^^nimy: but the pike men were placed in the (...), for to sustain the
impression of the Mamaluches. But Gazelles approaching, sent the troops of the
Arabians before, for to disturb the wings, and he himself with a square
battle charged the middle battle of the Turks. The fight was very cruel, and
a long time doubtful, for that the Turks yea though superior in number, were not
able is abide the fo^ce of the armed horsemen, and now being beaten (...)
ground, and dispensed some one way, and some an other, by the Mamaluches, that
brake in among them, looked round about for flight, both with eyes and
hear^es: when by Synambassas commandment the harquebusser^, who had with the
first storm of their sho^^ (...) a way ye Arabians, reducing their wings
enelosed all the who^^ battle of the enemies. Then both men and horsemen were a
fair^ (...) shenk ended^ with mortal yellets, which were shot by (...), and
no place for prowess was left unto the enclosed, for when that any troop of
Mamaluluches did run their horses violently upon the Turks, they by reason of
their lightness and nimblenesse, being accustomed to give ground, did very
swiftlye fly back: and in all places this was their endeavor, not to
encounter them with their horses, but to use only their harquebusses. When
Gazelles saw that his horses were tired with extreme weariness, and that
now many of his stoutest men were either slain or hurt, and he himself was
grievously wounded in thenecke, he with the rest making themselves away with
their weapons, fled unto Caire thoroughe those wildernesses that he came,
losing all his Ensigns.

There perished in this battle the Captain of Alexandria, and Orcomas the
Governor of Caire, men of great account, and besides them a great number of
Arabians, and almost a thousand horsemen of mark. Neither did Synambassa
win a joyful and unbloody victory, for he lost above two thousand
horsmenne, and among them some of the best of his Capitaynes. But because the
fight had continued from noone to Sun set, the Turks were not able to
pursue their ennimies, their horses being almost dead for thirst, and they
themselves fainting thoroughe lack of meat, and extreme labor: but
encamped in the place where the battle was fought near unto the Spring before
mentioned.

Three battayles fought between Selym the great Turk, and Tomumbey the Sultan
of Egypt, in the years. 1516. and. 17. Out of Iouius.
AFter that Selym had intelligence that Synambassa had taken Gaza, and
discomfited Gazelles, and also he himself had received a fresh supplye of
soldiers by sea from Constanethople: he marched with his whole army unto
Gaza, and from thence within eighte days came near unto the chief seat of
the Sultan, called Caier, Synambassa always going a days journey before him. Six
miles from the City, is there a Village called Rhodania, into the which place
Temumbey the new Sultan, had brought al his old and new provision and
furniture of great ordinance, and had made ditches cross over all the plain
field, and the high way, the which ditches he had covered over with small
sticks and earth laid upon them: and he himself had stood in an oportune
place with the Mamaluches, who were about xij. thousand, and a great number of
Arabian horsemen, for this intent, that when the host of the Turks did begin
to approach, they might be beaten down by the unthought of ordinance before
that they could come to reach the Egyptians with their Harquebusses, and then
he himself being spread round about them, would incontinently fight with
them being disordered and fallen into the ambushe.

These things were so cunningly and prudently devised, and also perfected in so
good time, that no man in the army did thynk that the victory of that day was
any thing to be doubted of. Doubtless a great calamity hanged over the Turks,
if that Fortune, who as she always favored Selym, so she enemy like, and
sharply persecuted Tomumbey, had not defeated the painful endeavors of the
Mamaluches, through the perfidiousnesse of a few persons.

There were in the Sultans army four Mamaluches, Albanoyses borne, who did
greatly stomach it, that Tomumbey was full sore against their will, advanced
unto the royal seat, by the voices of the adverse faction. They, whether
impelled by lewduesse of disposition, or adduced by hope of rewards and more
liberal entertainment, because they thought that now seeing their own side
went to wrack, it were wisdom for them to seek new and more certain
friends, fled unto Synambassa, as unto the chiefest Turkish captain, and their
countreyman. By these horsemen Synambassa, and incontinently after Selym,
understood all the counsels and intents of the enemies, and how great an
ambushe Tomumbey had laid for them with singular suttietie and art, into
which they must needs fall, unless they did forsake the high and direct
way. Whereupon they being guided by the same fugitives, did fetch a great
compass about on the left hand, and before it was day came again into their
old way, and with aranged battles, and produced ordinance (that there might be
no stay to attach the fight) showed themselfs at the backs of their enemies,
avoiding ye front of their camp. When Tomumbey saw this, he coniectured by
the march of his enemies, that his Ambushe had been disclosed thorough the
treason of his own men. But although he were tormented with incomparable grief
of mind, for that al those things which he had done with the toil of so
many men, and with so great endeavor, was quite dashed, and cast away in one
moment of time by spiteful Fortune: yet nevertheless, as he was a very stout
man, he incontine^tly revoked al his senses unto counsel and wonted valor, and
calling unto him all the captains, speedily told them what he would have to be
done. Tomumbey being placed in so great straight of things, must do all things
at one time: he must give the signal unto the soldiers, whereby they were
willed to mount on horseback, and to take their weapons, to turn the order of
his cape, to arange his battles, to encorage his soldiers, and to traduce his
ordinance into contrary quarters, as ye case did require Al which things, as
one chieftain could not do alone, but hardly and confusedly, so were they
hastyly and to halfes and peruersly administered at one pushe, by many. But the
thing that did most hinder the speedye dooying of all things, was the
huddlyng together of all men for to remove the ordinance, the most of
which were ill favored and houge pieces made of iron, and set in great
stocks of wodde, with rings of iron after the rude and nauall workemanshippe
used in old time: they by reason of their mighty waighte could not be moved
out of their places, without the draught of many beasts, and great thrusting
and heauing with iron crows and leuers, and with the grievous labor of men.
But the great pieces that were mounted on wheels, being drawn by the
witless and hasting multitude with the great clamor of those that pulld, haled
and shoued throughout all parts of the Camp, did with their tumultuous
passage disorder those that were mounting on their horses, and the Soldiers
that were repairing unto the ensigns. But two things were a great help unto
those difficulties, that is to wit, the cherefulnesse of the soldiers, and
the singular constancy of them all far greater than a man would believe: for
that they had not by any conceived fear, fallen from their hope and hearts, as
it commonly happens in sudden chances, in whom, yea the old soldiers, do
oftentimes forget their old valor: but being twice vanquished in battle,
they had always resumed greater confidence and courage than they had before,
because they persuaded themselves, that not valor and saill in fight, but
only Fortune sailed them. Therefore when Tomumbey had set his men in array, and
the soldiers with hot desire of fight, had requested the signal, he
commanded all the multitude of the Arabians, to fetch about their wings on
the back of their enemies, and to attache the fight first, so that the
Turkishe horsemen might be troubled and disordred, with a doubtful danger of
fight, before that he himself had run forth with his induced troops.
Streightwaye he commanded the great ordinance which had been now brought
about, and directed against the enemies, to be shot off. And incontinently did
the Turks the same: who had once shot of their smaller and greater pieces,
when they were a just distance of, and quickly charging them again, had now
drawn them within an arrows shoot of the Egyptian ordinance: they fought a
long time on either side with only often shooting off of their ordinance, while
that the armies approached. In the which contention, almost all the Egyptian
gunners were slain, and most of their artillery his mounted from their
wheels, and broken into pieces by the violence of the pellets of their
enemies. For the Turk had very skillful Gunners in his camp, whom he had
allured by his great rewards, and rich entertamment out of Italy and
Germany, and specially many out of that filthy rabble of Jews, who being
expelled by the piety of king Ferdinand out of all the Spaynes, brought
afterward such rare unused and deadly arts into all the Orient, to spite our
men withal. The captain of all these Gunners was one James, borne at Reggio
in Lumbardie, a man of passing skill in these arts: who being enticed by the
Turkishe gifts, had a little before forsaken the service of Christ, and
revolted unto Mahomets superstition. But after the fight is on both sides
brought unto handestrokes, the Mamaluches raise a cruel and horrible cry, and
in three quarters charge the Turks with great valor: for Selym keeping his
old order, so marched, that he approached in the form of a croysant. The
Captain of the Asians in the right wyng, was Mustaphas, and Innubassa of the
Europeans in the left but he himself governed the middle battle, wherein was
the Esquadron of the Ianizars, with a great multitude of ordinance. But
Synambassa, being made general of the field, had chosen for himself a
certain battle or band of the most valiantest horsemen, taken and picked out
of all the companies, for to serve for all uncertain events of the battle. Unto
whom he added out of Selyms esquadron five hundred footmen of passing prowess
and swiftness, that he being re^^^e in all places of the battle for all
chances (were they never so sudden,) might succor that part of his
fellows, which was most pressed by his enemy. So that when almost at one
time Tomumbey had stood in the middle battle against Selym, and the wings of
the Mamaluches had encountered the Turkishe with equal front, and the Arabians
had fought valiantly at their backs, as they had been commanded four fights
were holty attached at one time in diverse places.

They that were present at this battle, do report, that through the cry of the
Soldiers, the noise of the drums and trumpets, the thundering of the
artillery, the cloud of the dust, and the clashing of the weapons, all men's
minds were so amazed and confounded, that they being all on both sides
alyke, blinded with furye, they rushed forth with mad desperaetnesse, in
such sort, that neither could the voices and watch words be discerned
and known one from an other, nor the ensigns seen, nor the commandments of
the captains heard: they by mutual error slew a great number both of their own
fellows, and also their enemies without all regard: for never before that day
had any armies encountered together inflamed with greater hatred, never had two
most mighty Emperors more constantly and fervently showed their valor of body
and heart with less care of life and safety: For when both of them manifestly
perceived and saw, that with like danger of themselves and their armies, they
had set their lives and empires at six and seven, they also understood that
there would be no other hope left unto either of them, but that which the
victory it self would bring.

Now Gazelles enkindeled with desire of honor and revenge, that he might
repaye unto the Europeans a foil equal unto that which he had received at
Gaza, charging Innubassa with great violence, had ouerrunne the foremost and
the resisting troops, had thrown down the Guidons and the Arabians preassing
on the victors at their backs, had made the vanquishing companies of al wars,
where the strength of the Thracians, the Thessalians, and the Macedons were, to
turn their backs, which never any enimye had seen before: Then Synambassa
being ready and intentife both with mind and strength for all occasion of
victory, flew upon the side of the enemies with a fresh and strong company of
his men, and repaired the battle which was inclined and foully scattered. But
anon after, Synambassa who had discontinued the manifest victory of the
enemies, by exercising a supreme deed of prowess, was slain very valiantly,
fighting before his men, after that the Mamaluches under their fierce captain
Bido, had turned themselves on their new enemy. And also his horsemen
endeavoring to tak^ up from the ground their dead captain, and to save him, were
for a great part slain and put to flight by Gazelles, who did spread abrod^ his
troops, that they having more roone, might more freely vs^ their swords, in
which kind of fight, ye Mamaluches do most excel: and also that noble hand of
Ianizars being enclosed, were ouerrun and flain, after yt they being forsaken
of the horsemen, had long time very valiantly resisted. But in another quarter,
Mustaphas giving a vehement charge with all his horsemen upon the left wing of
the Egyptians, wherein commanded the most renoumed captains Neylius Diadarius,
and Giapal Oreemas, very sharply urged the^. They had a little before received
a notable, detriment by the ordinance which was by chance shot from Selymb
middle battle trauers the field. Mustaphas perceiving it, and being very
desirous to abolish old ignominy, very sharply urged the^ being once
disordered, and bringing in his troops by wedges, brake thorough, over ran
and beat them down, and being notorious all the battle over for his voice
and armor adhorted the Asians to think that they must now recover either by
passing prowess, or honorable death their ancient martial honor, the which
they had lately lost at the battle of Alepo. Also at the same time Tomumbey
having broken through the middle battle of the horsemen, was come unto the
footmen, and as he was a mighty man both in body and strength, did many
notable acts with his semitarre: and also the Arabians enclosed the outer
wings of the Turks, and forced them in many places to fight with double front:
when Selym advanced forward his esquadron of footmen, the which was his only
and assured help in this extreamitie, whose charge neither could the fierce
and harded horses, nor the victors men abide: for part of his soldiers being
harquebusierz, did much muschiefe when they were impaled with pikes, whose
immovable force being closed together into the array of one body, bare down
all that they encountered. Yet they fought with variable event on both sides,
from the fourth hour of the day, until Sun set, neither was there any
part of the armies, which suffered not sundry alterations, fortune being now
prosperous, and then adverse: for both the vanquished, and the victors being
made mad with mutual and implacable rage; fought with obstinate hearts: the
Mamaluches disdaining that the victory should be taken from them by those men of
whom they had slain so many, but the Turks chafing that they whom they had
before vanquished in two battles, did so long time resist them: in so much,
that yet the languishing arms, and the bodies wearyed and tired with wounds,
which were held up by only wrath and pertinacie of heart, might feeme would
have bin able to have continued an other day in murdering, if that the very
night had, not brought an end unto so great a slaughter.

Tomumbey, who no doubt was vanquished, distrusting the entier loss of the
field, first commanded the retreat to be founded, that his men, who now could
not match the esquadron, might seem not to have been beaten back, but led
back: The which thing he thought was of very great moment to establish the
hearts of his soldiers, and also to reteyn his own authority: for that same
dame Fortune, who had deceived his first hope, did seem to promise unto him,
(who hoped, as me^ in misery do) for better lot, prosperous events of things,
if that his heart quayled not, and he saving that power which was yet left,
would repair the wars. The battle being broken off, by the coming of the
night, the Turks who were victors, and had gained the ordinance and tents of
the enemies, pursued until it was late nights, the Mamaluches that marched to
Caire almost in fleeing manner.

In the flight were taken Biadarius, who could make no speed, by reason of his
grievous wounds, and with him Bidon, who had one of his knees broken with the
shot of a falcon, which did also kill his horse. The next day Selym
commanded both of them to be slain, either because they could not be healed,
or for that it was decent, that he might with so worthy sacrifices appease the
spirit of Synambassa, for whom he singularly lamented. Although the Turks had
nobly vanquished, yet was their power vehemently decayed, yea through these
fortunate battles. The fourth parts of them was quite spent with sickness and
wounds: and also a great number of their horses were brought weak, through
the toil of the long fourney, and specially by the weariness of this day. For
the which causes, Selym was constrained to renut somewhat of his old manner in
hasting: for he knew not as yet the minds and devotion of the Aegiptians that
inhabited Cair, neither did he yet understand by fame, in what place Tomumbey
soforned, and what he intended to d^. But before he had maturely and diligently
learned out all these things, he in no case minded to commit the safety of his
own person, and of his whole army unto the innumerable Citizens, and the
greatest City of the whole world. Wherefore staying four days in his old
Camp at Rhodania, he caused the wounded to be cured, and the bodies of his
slain soldiers to be buried in the ground, but left the carcasses of the
enemies to be torn into pieces by birds and beasts. And then he dislodged,
and marching toward Caire, enc^mped in a plain between old Caire and Bulach
(for the City of Caire is diulded into three towns: old Caire, new Caire,
and Bulach) that they might be the more commodiously served of water.

The Battle at Caire.
IN the mean time Tomumbey being nothing broken with so many and so lamentable
unfortunate successes of things, but gathering together the Mamaluches from all
parts, had pitched his camp in a commodious place between new Caire, and
the river of Nilus, had armed an eight thousand Ethiopian bondmen, the which
kind of me^ he had not used before by reason of the memory of an old
rebellion. Morcouer, he opening the old armoury, had delivered armor and
weapons unto the sons of the Mamaluches, and the Moors their reteyners, the
Jews, and the Arabians, and with all diligence had prepared greater and more
cruel wars against the Turks, than he had made before. But after ward when
his devise to give a camisado unto the Turkishe camp, had been disclosed unto
the Turks, who being prepared therefore, had with loss repelled his foremoste
ranks: he by the adhortation of all his captains entered the city of Caire,
for ye Mamaluches being vanquished in all battles, thought that they must
take another way in administering the wars, and therefore counseled him to
strengthen the City, by placing his army in guarde in the most commodious
places thereof, and to impeache the enemy from entering the town: for in this
lamentable state, seeing that they must needs fight for their houses, wives
and children, they thought it honorable and correspo^dent to the glory of their
ancient valor, to dye fighting in the sight of them, and before the doors of
their houses. So every horseman, or Mamaluch, going to his own house,
furnished all his household, and the top of his house with all kind of
weapons, and every one suppliauntlye desired the Egyptians of his streate and
ward, that they would take arms against the common and cruel enemies, nor
suffer them selves to be slain, and their wives and children to be carried
away for slaves: for if the savage and most covetous enemy should win the
victory, (which God forbid) they would not spare, no not them, yea though
they would bear them selves indifferent, and healye neither the one part nor
the other, because that victory being fraught full of licentiousness and
insolency, will know no man, but him, that without staggering and doubting
what to do, did help with goods and hand the fortune of their part, while
that the wars were of uncertain event. Most of the richer sort of the
Aegiptians, as they did foresee that the alteration of the state and of the
Empire, would be very hurteful, and bring great loss and hinderaunce unto
their traffic and wealth: so in devotion and healpe they failed not unto the
Mamaluchs. Contrariwise most of the mean sort of the Citizens, and a mighty
multitude of the worser, who being void of danger, do always gain by other
men's losses, remembering all the villainies and extreme oppressions that they
had suffered almost three hundredth years under the Mamaluches in wailefull
and wretched slavery, kept themselves within the doors, waiting for the event
of the supreme fight, and rejoiced in their sleeves, that not without the care
of almighty God a time had come, when their wicked and outrageous lords should
be punished for so many heynours facts, yea and the revenge should be sought by
the blood of strangers: whereby it would come to pass, that they should anon
fully satisfy their eyes with a most desired and wished spectacle and sight. In
the mean time Tomumbey with most intentise labor and travel, fortified the
gates, and all the ways into the City, appointed Capitaines over every
streate, made adhortatorie orations in every court, market place, and assemble
of people: suffered not any light loytering to be used in the works, and
finally, (which is thought to be the most hardest thing in calamity, and
danger) showed a surpassing great hope, and a renewed and singular valor in his
unappalled face and countenance. But the Mamaluches over and above necessity,
(the which do use in extremities to enkindle and to make mad and desperate,
yea the very cowards) being stirred up by emulation, did speedily and
courageously execute the duties and offices of Captains, for every one of
them, as his wit, invention and industry did bear, made ditches cross the
most notorious streats, and also laid mighty great pieces of timber overthwart
them: other did set in privy pits, holes, and ditches very sharp stakes,
upon whom the enemies unwarily falling might be gored: other furnished with
gunnes according to their store, the windows and houses that stood in the
turning of the streets, yt were much freque^ted. Al which things were done with
so great celeritie, yt no man no not ye ioyliest fellow of all the Mamaluchs,
made courtesy to take the spade, or to do any servile or foul work: so ye all
things seemed not to have bin devised before they were don and finished.
Although the city being very great and very old, was enclosed with no walls,
yet there were gates, and but certain ways into it, of whom the one with direct
and very broad way or street did lead from the East gate unto the Castle, and
into the mids of the City. The rest of the ways into the City had very
narrow paths, and ill favored streates, in whom the ordinance could not be
well and aptly drawn, neither could aranged battles safely join together.
Into this place and way had Tomumbey chiefly brought a power, because he
understood that of necessity the enemy must break in at that place by reason
of the wydenesse of the streats, but the other quarters of the city father
off, he kept with small gards: but the inner and middle parts of the city,
where the castle stood: were guarded with a very strong part of his power, yt
they being very intentive, might speedily run with succor to al places of the
city, where yt the cry of the enemies, and the peril of their fellows did
call the^, because that the city being of al other the gretest, could not be
defended round about the outward compass with so small power, namely ways
lying open into it in every place. But when Selym certainly knew that Tomu^bey
was entered Caire, and all the Mamaluches gathering their strength into one, would
try the uttermost fortune of the wars, he admoued his host more near unto the
City, and adhorted his soldiers to think that they must that day entierly
vanquish, and quite destroy their enemies, whom they had so often overcome, and
to take a little pain more, that they might receive the rewards of their
former labors and victories: the which would be so many, and so great, as
they had before coueted with immoderate minds: that there remained a few men
with the forsaken and naked king, who because they being attached with wounds
and fear, were not able to abide the field, had decreed to expect at home in
the sight and arms of their wives, and children, the supreme and last cast
of wretched life. That the Aegiptians of their own accord had sent for him,
for they deadly hating the name of the Mamaluches, did most greedily exspect
their destruction, and did promise to fight from their houses for to destroy
that progeny of most wicked and savage men. But yet notwithstanding, that the
very absolute victory of the whole wars consisted in the utterly vanquishing of
the remnauntes of the defeated and thoroughly affrighted army: because they
could not be accounted overcome, that yet hoped were yet in arms, and
possessed the siege of the Empire, and the greatest City thereof.

Therefore they should think, that whereas their safety and glory, then also
their whole state and welfare did consiste in the event of that day. But that
it would be a thing almost of naught, and of no danger, if that they would
persuade themselves that they must needs vanquish in this new kind of
fight, as they had valiauntly done before under his conducte in all other.
The soldiers hearts burned for desire of spoil, and being ready and
deducted into ranks, exspected the signal of the irruption: When Selym
entering the City at Bassuell gate, sent in his horsemen at many places at
once, but the Ianizars at the broader way: horsemen met with horsemen, and
attached a cruel fight in the turnings of streats, and narrow lanes, but the
footmen drawing forth their falcons and culuerings before them in their
front, did flank with them all the streats, along as they went, making them
naked of defendants. But when they were come unto the munitions and ditches,
and went about to remove the logs, and great beams that lay in their way,
and to pass the ditches: and on the other side the Mamaluches valiauntly
obsisted, they fought on both sides with so great valor, and so great
pertinacie of hearts, that never none in our memory encou^tred either more
fiercely or more bloudily, for both the Mamaluchs and the Turks showed all
their strength, and all their sleights of war, in this one dangerous fight,
not being ignorant that they fought in this last encounter for life and Empire:
seeing that sporting fortune did set indifferently before them both supreme
rewards for the victors, and extreme punishments for the vanquished. Very
great slaughter was committed at the munitions, by reason that the Turks
unawarely running into the blind and prive ditches, pits and holes fell down
into them by heaps, one upon another, the hindermost thrusting them forward
that were before: and other were gored on the sharp stakes. The Mamaluches
their wives and children did with manlike hardiness hurl and tumble down
tiles and great stones on them that were beneath. On the other side, the Turks
would with their harquebusses fetch such off as they could see in the
windows, and on the houses, and break open the doors where they saw any
hurtefull thing hurled down, and fight within the houses with diverse event.
Also the Egyptians beholding the fortune now of the one side, and then of the
other, did with diverse devotion take for enemies and assail them both, that
unto whether of them lot would give the victory, they might seem also to have
greatly aided that party. Many encounters were attached in diverse quarters at
once, as they ran into diverse streates, yea and in sundry parts of one
streate, now this company, now that lighted upon new troops of the enemies, and
they that urged the victors in the front, were often intercluded by the
enemies, and were beaten down behind. The ways, and the space that were left
between house and house, were (an horrible thing to behold,) so wet of the gore
blood that ran out of the slain men that lay on leapes every foot, that
the raised dust, which at the beginning was very thick, was now quite laid.
Yet nevertheless the air was darkened with the smoke and miste of the gunnes,
and the clouds of arrows, and so great was the cry of the soldiers, the
clashing of the weapons, the thundering of the ordinance, that the earth
seemed to tremble and quake, and the houses to be torn into pieces. They
fought continually two days, and so many nights with doubtful fortune: but yet
so that the Mamaluches who being few in number, and were not able to sustain
the labor and watching, had withdrawn themselves by giving back by little
and little into the inner parts of the City, forsaking the foremost munitions.
The third day when the Mamaluches were in the very pitch of the peril of all
their whole state, and all that ever they had (which thing is wont to augment
the supreme enterprises, endeavors and hearts of all men) they renewed the fight
with such surpassing valor, that they drove the Turks a great way back and
intercepted certain of their falcons. Which chance, they say, made Selym to
despair of the victory, and then he commanded the houses to be set on fire in
all places, he being also impelled unto that heinous and cruel proclamation
almost by just wrath conceived against the Aegiptians, because that a little
before Innusbassa had bin grievously wounded in the head in Selyms sight with
a stone thrown out at a window. Now were the houses light on fire, now was
heard the houling of the weeping and suppliauntly entreating Aegiptians, and
new the Turks fightyng somewhat faintly, expected that the retraite should
be sounded: when see, news was brought by many men at once, that in another
quarter the Mamaluches being beaten from their ground, and defeated by urging
Mustaphas, had reposed their last refuge in running away: for Mustaphas
through the intimation of certain Aegiptians, and fugitive Mamaluches, had
come unto a very large streate, where the Mamaluches had set their horses
ready bridled and sadled: that if any ill chance happened, they might have
recourse thither, and taking their horses, flee unto those next places whither
they had determined to go. He got all those horses and led them away, having
chased their guarde, the which, as in a part of the City, that they did
nothing suspect, was very weak, consisting wholly of boys, and horse keepers.
This thing (as it commonly happens in weighty and unlooked for chances) did
maruellously wraken their valor and impression. Wherefore when hope of flight
was taken away, and they perceived them selves to be enclosed round about,
and that the fight was sustained by none other hope, and by none other help
and aid, than prowess, they being vanquished by their own confession, turned
their backs. Many hasting unto Nilus with Tomumbey, who had in vain tried all
arts of valiauncy, wisdom and devise, that he might not be vanquished in
this battle, passing over the river by boat, went into the region of
Seiectica. Another multitude hid themselves in the houses of the Aegiptians,
and in most shameful lurking dens. But above a thousand and five hundredth
of the valiauntest of the Mamaluches fled unto the greatest Temple in all the
City, where after that they had long time defended them selves, as out of a
Castle, because they would not yield but upon honorable conditions: at the
last being vanquished by thirste, weariness, wounds, and ordinance, they
yielded themselves unto the will and pleasure of the victor. A part of them
were slain presentlye before the Church by the angrye Soldiers: Selym
winking thereat, and part were certain days after carried down the River to
Alexandria. When the victory inclined, Selym sent two bands to put out the
fires, and also sending about cryers throughout all the City, caused
proclamation to be made, that all the Mamaluches that would come in, and yield
them selves, within twelve hours should have no hurt, but all found after that
time, should die for it, and also that he would give rewards unto all those
Aegiptians that would diselose the Mamaluches that lurked, and contrariwise
incontinently stick them that had hidden any: and selling their wives and
children, burn their houses. Upon the brute of this proclamation, a great
number of them came abroad, who were straightway put in yrons, and also
afterward all most cruelly slain in prison, for that they were said to have
practiced an escape. But diverse that would not violate the rights of friendship
and faith by bewraying their friends, being accused by their neighbors, suffered
loss of life, dying very constantly for their friends.

After this, the soldiers being made fierce through the victory, searched all
places, drew out all them that were hidden, and slew them, and also spoiled
the Aegiptians their houses, and left nothing shut and secreate. The very same
day Gazelles happened to come unto Caire, who had been sent a little before into
Thebais to leuy Arabians, and to hyre aides. Then he seeing the state to be
quite euerted, and that he was able to do no good, either by hand or counsel,
came in with three Arabian Capitaynes, and many horsemen, and yielded himself
unto Selym, who entertained him with all his train very honorably, every man
according to his calling.

The Battle at Nilus.
BUt Tomumbey being (as ye have heard) fledds over the river of Nilus, into
that region that is called Seiectica, which lies toward Cyrenaica: although
he had been vanquished with so many mischiefs, yet be courageously repaired
the wars. There had come unto him a strong crew of Mamaluches from Alexandria,
who were sent for by letters out of the garrison of the City, and many also
followed him in the flight. Moreover the Arabians of Africa repaired unto him:
and also the Moors the inhabitaunts of that country, promised him their good
will and healpe: yea and sundry Aegiptians of Caire, whose houses and households
had been spoiled, and dishonested by the covetous and lecherous Turks, promised
that they would raise an insurrection and tumult, if that he would speedily
come thither one night: that it should be brought to pass that all the Turks
which were lodged in the houses of the City, should be suddenly destroyed by
the cry, and invasion of all the whole people: for the Citizens having
suffered at their hands, all abominable and enemy like parts, could not
longer abide the injuries of the most proud and malaperte oppressers. They
also said, that the Turks were brought from a very mighty army unto a
contemptible number, for a great part of them were slain in the ba^el^s at
Ihed^nia and C^^r^, and almost all the rest were quite spent with wounds and
sickness. But whilst that Tomumbey was busied about the preparation of these
things, Albuch^^^r the greatest man in of ^^^ecti^^ for authority, lands and
riche^, came unto Selym, either that he ^^g^^ auert fr^^ his country, and
lands, the mischief of imminent v^^r^es, or else to win the victors favor by
treason, and certified hi^^ of the po^^er, and new devises of Tomumbey and the
^^tizens of C^re. The which when Selym understood, he caused strong and
straight; watch and ward to be kept in all parts of the Gitie, her c^^^^
manded the suspected Citizen^^o be kept (...) the cas^^l. the (...) he h^dde
casely taken the garr^^^ forsaking it) and plated indiuers places all ^lo^g the
river of Nilu^^ great number of vessels furnished wy^^ ordinance and soldiers
for to watch and keep the farther ^au^ke of the river. But yet he (...)
i^hing^^ith hyms^^^^ wi^^ how great peril^ he ha^ fought so often with his
most v^li ^u^verti^^^e^e, and how hard (...) thing it would be fore hiue to
intercept Tomumbey, who by sleing into waste and unknown regions prolonged the
wars, and s^ll got^e new and new asdes, and also considering that his power
being so small and so far from sue^^^r, might be easily oppressed in that most
mighty City by the huge multit^de of men of uncertain faith* was desit (...)
rather to end the wars by ^omposition, than by contending with force to
entangle himself in new dangers: and especially seeing that he had
intelligence by those of the province of Seiectica; that companies of horsemen
of all sorts were levied in all parts by the Mamaluches that had fled into
diverse regions and that the navy which had bin sent i^^to the sl^^^ghts of the red se^ in the Arabian g^ulf against ye Po^^ugals, was looked for at P^rs
Svezzia. In that navy were above three thousand Mamaluches, and Amyrasses, an
Ray Solomon very skilful Captains; and a great number of brass yeeces: whereby
it se^^en ye Tomumbey might be able to repair the receued inco^moditie^, and
come again unto the City, be^ing sent for by: his friends to repair thither*
But the mighty^ care of the Persian affairs did most move him, least that if
Hymbracossa, whom he had sent before unto the mountain C^nrus, should not be
able to match the Persi^^ power, that then he should be excluded out of Asia
the less, and Syria, before that the Constantinopolitan fleet could come to
Alexandria with supply of soldiers and victuall^. Wherefore he sent very
honorable men of the clergy, and also among them, certain Argiptians of great
estimation in ambassade unto Tomi^^ley: who should counsel him to l^y^ down
arms, and at length acknowledge the fort^^e of the victor, and therewith
should also give the^^ says, that if he would come in suppliaunt sort unto
Sely^^, be should by the humanity and benefit of the victor and conqueror,
obtain the kingdom, the which he had not ben able to keep by arms: but if he
would proceade in renewing the war^es, and forget his own weakness, that then
after the fortune of the wars were throghly adjudged and determined, he should
according unto his d^sert, fl^^ no condition of dignity and life at a^g^^d
Selyms hand. But ^he^ these ambassadors were come into Se^^ction they were with
^^antil^ and barb^rous cruelty, slain by certai^^ ^^^al^cht^, before they had
any ^^dience.

The which proud and cruel fact, brake off al Selyms patience, who was a man
by nature yea being not moved, very vedement and fierre: and streightway he
proclaimed avoiage into Seiestita against Tomumbey, and commanded victual^ to
^e prou^^ed therefore and gathering together boats from al parts (...) a sure
and very broad bridge to be built over the river of Nilu^, thinking it neither
for his dignity, nor for the present occasion to pass over in boats.

But when Tomumbey understood by espies and the Citizens of Caire, that a
voyage was prepared against him, and a bridge made over Nilus, he fearyng the
falshoode of the Prouincials, whose hearts, he lightly suspected were
alienated from him, by the reuoltyng of Albuchomar, because of his great power
and authority among them: determined to try the self same Fortune of
battle, which had so often times deceived his hopes: for he being
inferior in all things, could not draw forth the wars, nor expecte his
enime: neither did he think it good for him to flee again with loss of his
dignity, through farther wildernes^^^.

Wherefore consulting with his Captains, (she which was the last attempt
that he and the Mamaluches made) he departing in the break of the day from
Seiectica with four thousand armed horsemen or Mamaluchs, and double the number
of Moors, and Arabians, hasted to Nilus with journey continued day and night
that by hardy attempt he might deceive the Turks, who he understood would
suspect no such thing of the vanquished, and very weak enemy, and also that he
might by celeritie prevent the fame of his approach: thinking that he should
by his soddaine unlooked for coming, destroy that part of the Turkish power
that had first passed the river, before that they could be succored by their
fellows. Neither did the space of the time deceive his opinion: for the hours
being very truly reckened with the celeritie of his march did agree iumpe: and
as he had coniectured it would happen the forewarde of the Asians had passed
over the bridge. The Mul^tters and boys that were of Selyms chamber ranging
some what far to seek a more pleasant place to pitche their tent in, were
the first that saw the dusto of the approaching enemy: and Must^pha was
streightwaye certifyed thereof, and a larum was ^ryed.

The which rumor did cast great fear into the hearts, both of them which
had already passed over, and also of those that stood on the hither bank
ready for to pass, Tomumbey charging suddenly with great valor the Asians,
while they were making themselves ready and resorting unto the ensigns, slew
the foremoste that durst sustain the shocke of the assatlantes, ^ispersed
other, and forced them to flee. Neither after that almost all the whole
foreward was ouerrunne and trodden down, and the rest disordered was Mustaphas,
able (although he fought fearelesse in the fore front, and cheerfully
encouraged his Soldiers) to repair the array, or to retain the turned into
flight: foo in this cruel and unsuspected chance, every place was full of
h^dling together of people, slaughter, slight, and fear, and all along on the
bank of the river, both above and beneth the bridge, were co^panyes of men
seen looking behind them and criyng for ^^^ccor.

And many being driven by the urging trou^^es of the enemies unto the verse
brinke of the b^nke, fell down into the river and many also perished at the
end or head of the bridge, when they ^oulde not run over it for them that
were continually sent over from the further side: and also many that would have
climed the bridge, being impeached by fear, and thrust back by their felows,
were drowned in the river. The bridge was so broad, that four horses might
well go over in a rank, and a great number of them be sent over in an hours
space. But because the ordinance was to be drawn over, fewer horssemen were
sent, than the greatness of the danger, or the sudden chance did vrgently
requite: neither was there any help or aid in the ordinance which could not
be speedily drawn over, or shatte off from the hither bank unto the other
against the enemy without g^ea^ damage to themselves, by reason of their own
men that stood in the way. In the mean time Selym, who had run down unto
the river side at the beginning of the hurly burlye, filled small boats with
Ianizars harquebusiers, and sent them over to succoure their distressed
fellows, and also commanded the horsemen to haste over by the bridge. The
speedy Mariners using al celeritie, often returned, and took in mo, so that
within a short space they had set over many bands of Ianizars. Whose coming,
did confirm the Asians, who were disordered, and now hardly sustained their
enemies violence.

^ls^ Ca^ogl^^ the son of a Tartare king, encouraging his troops v^ T^ra^es
to take the over with their horses, came to the farther bank of the ^^uer, to
the ad^^^rasion of all men, leesyng but a few of his men^ for the Tartares had
^carned to swim over on their horses accustomed thereunto, the very violente
and mighty rivers of Tanall and Volga. Also at the same instant Tomumbey for
seeing ha^ spe^^^ victory consisted therein) endeavored to pierce with thick
troops unto the head of the bridge, and to ^ntim^^t^ that then for to
interclude his enemies, he might pull ^^^ay the foremost boat, and cut in
sunder the cables, with which that row of boats were tied unto the bank.
Which being cut off the whole bridge being of necessity resolved and undone,
would through the violence of the nightie stream, be carried away with the Turks
that were upon it. This caused a very dangerous conflict, for the chosen and
best armed Mamaluches that urged at the front, fought with singular valor: and
on the other side Mustaphas perceiving the danger, brought the ensigns, and
all the valiauntest fellows unto that place. So that they both contended with
such surpassyng prowess, as the waightinesse of the case required: the
Mamaluches manifestly seeing that if they could win ye place; that then they
should with short work afterward overthrow the former victories of the enemies:
and the Turks understanding ye unless they kept and saved the bridge, the
safety of themselves, and the rest of the army, yen and of their Emperor was
brought to utter despair. But Mustaphas prevailed through the Harquebusters,
and the troops of Greek horsemen, of whom now many had passed over, and the
enemies were repulsed and being fierc^ly urged, forced to give a great way
back. Tomumbey that he might give some space unto the Mamaluches to breath
them, who were not able to fight fiercely, because their horses were tired, and
that he might again try by them after they had repaired their strength, the
extreme and last chaunes and fortune of the battle, adhorted the Arabians and
Moors to sustain the fight until the Mamaluches had a little breathed
themselves. The which when they had valiantly performed, and anon after the
Mamaluches having somewhat recreated their horses and bodies, had come in
their place: the battle was again renewed with so grea^e valor, that Selym
distrusting the victory, doubted not to ascend the bridge, and run to
succor his men, although that his friends earnestly besoughte him in no wise
so to do. His coming (which brought hope into the hearts of the soldiers,
who desired to ^^inne rewards and praise by doing some notable feate of
prowess in their Emperors sight repressed the endeavors of the enemies, who
were straightway all forced to fly through the valiance of the Ianizars. They
were pursued over all ye fields by those horsemen that had not been at the
fight, and also by the Tartares, who galled them with their arrows. But
afterward Mustaphas, Cayerbey, and Gazelles, were sent with a company of
fresh and swift horses, to follow the foot of the fleing, and not to suffer
Tomumbey to escape away, whom the third certain ^esauntes found standing in
a marish up to the waste in water among bulrushes and reeds, who for fear of
death delivered him to the Capitaynes, who brought them unto Selym. But he
would not vouchsafe to see him. But after he had caused him to be along time
tormented in vain for to disclose the treasures of ^^pson, at last he
commanded him to be carried about all the famous streats of the City on a
vile Carmell in an old ragged garment, with his hands bound behind him, and
then (...) he hanged up with an halter, for the murtheryng, as be pretended,
of his Ambassadors, although the noble Prince were altogether guiltless
thereof. The like fate also befell unto all the Mi^ ^^^hos and horsemen that were
in prison, or could he taken. After the shameful death of Tomumbey, who was
executed the thirte^th day of April, in Anno. 1517. all the whole Empire of
the Sultan yielded; as also did all the Princes that had been Tribucartes unto
the Sultan euea unto the domintons of Prestra John.

The Battle of Bicona, fought in the Duchy of Milan between Prospero de
Colonna, and Ferdinande Marquis of Pescara, Generals for Charles the Emperor,
and the Lord Lantrech Chieft^ine for Francis the French King in Anno. 1522
taken out of Io^^^ in the life of the Marquis of Pescara.
ANno. 1521. Charles the fifth Emperor of Rome, and Leo the tenth Bishop of
that city, co^spired together (for displeasure conceived) to expel Francis
the French king out of the Duchy of Milan, and to place therein Francis Forza
brother unto Maximilian, late duke of Milan, but then prisoner in Fran^^e. The
which erploite Praspero de Colonna, and Ferdinande Marquess of Pescara, the
one being General of the horsemen, and the other of the too te^^en, did in
^^r^e per^^^^ that same year, having won Placontia, Paiula, N^^ara,
Alexandria, Como, Puni^, the City of Milan, and diverse other places of the
duchy, which caused the French King to send down the next year, Renee the
bastard of Sauoy, and great master of his horse, and Seignour de la Palice,
and other with a new supplye of soldiers, unto the Lord (...) his lieste^a^t
general in Milan. With this power and the old that he had before, and also
being aided with an army of the Ve^^ans, he laid ^^ege unto the city of P^nia,
the which yet he brake up, when the Emperialls (who had lately received a new
supply out of Germany of (...) thousand Lans^^^^^; under the conduct of George
Tr^ndes^erg) were come from Milan is ^etor Pania: and marched toward
Landr^^o, that he might come to the City of Milan as void of garrison,
before the Emperials could return, or if he could not so do: he hoped some
good opportunity of battle in place of advantage would be gotten by often
dis^edgings and sundry iorueys. But Prospers and Pescara incontinently going
bathe again the same direct way that they came, (...) at Milan many hourex
before that Lautrech, who marched somewhat about, could come thither, although
he used passing celeritie. The Lautrech having thus missed Milan, marched to
Monze for many regardes, and namely counseled thereunto by Gutti the Legate or
Prouiditors of the Vinetian army, that he might he victualled with more
e^^^ment of ways from the Regions beyond the river of Adda: and also the
Switzers requested it, being desirous to go home, as they that being wearied
with the unlucky wars, in whom fortune would favor none of their
enterprises: had languished both in body and heart, and therefore with proud
and lead tongues requested to be dismissed. But the Bastard of Sauoy, Palice,
and Galeazo, Sanseuerino Grande Esquier, or master of the horse unto the King,
going unto the Switzers earnestlye desired them that they would not haste to
forsake them, and by their infamous departure quite overthrow the assured hope
of ready victory: seeing that Francis of all Kings the most liberal, would
requite this their singular benefit, not only by frank dealing with them
selves, but also with their wines and children.

Surely the Captal^^^ and (...) well a^^ec^ed, and very faithful, but the
common sort of the soldiers, as they which were bou^^^e by no gifts, did
very leudly waver: but yet so that it seems that all of them would fight
valiantly, if they were speedily brought to darraine battle. When Prasper^ and
Pescara understood the intent of their (...), they staying almost never a whit
at Milan, eu^^^^^ thei^^^ were well furnished with all things, being fully
ref^^ed t^ giver the enemy battle, if that any indifferent occasion were
offe^^d. They eueauped themselves at a village called Bicocna: in a place very
fafe and commondious: for on the right (...), it was enclosed with the ditche
of the highway, but ^^^the leasie, and on theh^^ke with two small rivers
secuing to water the corn fields, but in the front it had a cross way so
broad, that two waiues meeting might pass one by another, the which was on
both sides so low, that the edges of the corn fields were navel high abo^^
it. This way for that it was very hollow, did Pescara use for a ditche, and in
the front thereof pla^^^ the ordmance and footmen: and behind stood the
horsemen with Prospero. But Francis Forza the Duke of Milan, who had brought
thither bands of the Citieof Milan, and all the nobilitle of the whole duchy,
that he might be present at the battle, encamped in the high way. Now the
Captains of the Switzers being singularly addicted to the French welfare, and
honor, and namely Albers Petra a captain of sucpassing same in many wars who
had then the chief authority among the Switzers, assoo^e as nows was brought
by the horsemen that the Emperitialls were encamped middle way betweeno Milan,
and Mo^za, and were in a plain and level piece of ground not above five miles
from them; they can unto the French Captains, and Alber^ spoke unto them and
told them, that the Souldioures could be kept by no means but that they
would go home unless they were lidde into the field to fight: and that he
him self might satisfye the kings Majesty (who had very well deserved of him)
and also the dignity of the Switzers, was fully resolved to give hat^^ll:
neither ought they to doubt of the victory, if that the frenchmen as they were
by buc^y bound) would with courageous hearts follow the Switzers, who would pierce
even unto the ordinance of the enemies: If that there were any that would
rather linger shamefully, than fight valiauntly they ought not to be thought
faithful to the king, or the common wealth. Therefore he, to show his
fidelity and unfeigned heart unto the King, would go against the enemies yea
with only the Switzers, if no man else would follow. This couragiousnesse of
Albert was not displeasant unto Lautrech as yt man that had rather fight yea
with doubfull eue^t, than to be forsaken by the Switzers: for this was his
opinion, that their hot valor, seeing that they did request the battle with
such flaming hearts, was to be used out of hand, namely seeing that he seemed
inferior to the enemies, neither in footmen, horsemen nor yet in number: for
he privily accounted it an ignomye, if that now, as it had happned the year
before, he should again be driven out of Lumbardie, and never fight battle,
and namely seeing that whereas the Switzers, then specially the french horsemen
had always in vain requested of him with many prayers, that they might show
their valor in a pitched field: which thing (as it often happens in adverse
fortune) had got him great envy among the Frenchmen. But Palice both
greenously offended with the rashenesse and arrogancy of Albert, and also
moved with the nothing tymely inclination of Lautrech, praised in deed at
large the good will and devotion of the Switzers, but could in no case abide to
hear the counsel of assaulting the Camp, as a device full of extreme
madness, and deadly desperatnesse: often saying that he, who had wared old in
the Italian wars, did very well know the valor of young Pescara, who always
uses to fight lustily and the arts of old Prospero, who had learned to lodge
his army skilfully to the disco^moditie of his enemy, and with his own
chiefest and highest praise. He did not think the french state was brought
unto that despair, ye as it were in extreme necessity, they should rather
chose to fight and be vanquished, than by staying with very good and wholesome
reason moderate the violent fease of unadvised courage. Wherefore what was more
safe and better, tha^ to get them between Milan, and the enemies camp, and
encamping themselves there, force the enemies (being intercluded from the
city, and victuals, either to fight with disadvantage, if that they would
assail their Camp, or certes if they would return unto Milan, to offer them
the field in an indifferent place. In deed the Lord Lautrech, who had the
supreme government, might fight with disadvantage both then, and also at al
other times, when he would: but it was the duty and part of a wise General,
never to provoke ye enemy, unless he having before surely shifted the eue^t,
might with firm reason assuredly promise himself undoubted victory. But then
thus (answered the Lord Lautrech) we need not slouthful lingering in sitting
still, but lively valor in fight tore-couer the honor and Duchy lost: the
which doubtless can not be done, if we do suffer the Switzers, who are now
going away, to depart home and do no feate of prowess. Wherefore make your
selves ready to fight, that we may this day end the wars one way or an
other. Thereunto replied Palice: God assist the mad and desperate: I for my
part, that I may not seem to have shu^ned the peril, will certes fight on
foot in the forewarde of the footmen: ye French horsemen, behave your selves
to day valiantly, that in a hard case, rather fortune than courage, may seem
to have failed you. So before the Sun was up (it was the.xxix. day of April)
Albert leads forth his regiments of Switzers (they were about fiftene
thousand) with the ordinance, being puffed up with so foolish, or certes fatal
pride, that he would not one whit be ruled in any thing by either Lautrech, or
Palice, Captains of great skill, but with barbarous stateliness, promised
that he would chardge the Emperialls full in the face. And without stay, the
famous Petro de Nauarro, and the renowned Captain Biciarde, being sent before
to surueye the situation of the enimyes Camp, Lautrech made two battles of
all the french horsemen, the first he committed to his brother the Lord
Lescune, commanding him to fetch a great compass about, and to invade the
enemies on the backs, but he himself followed the maine army. It was enjoined
unto the Venetians, who were on the left hand, to back the Switzers, being
thereby quite out of danger, or certes very far from any. Moreover John de
Medici was commanded to go before all the battelles with his horsemen, who
were very passing excellent, consisting both of light horsemen, and also men
of arms) and with the light bands of Italian footmen, who also served under
him, that he coursing this way and that way, might take all prospecte from the
enemies, and not suffer their auaunt currers to take any view of the French
power. So the footmen being hidden by Medices horsemen, approached with great
pace, not being seen of the enemies, yet the foremost of Lescunes horsemen were
(by reason of their glistering armor) seen of the Emperials between certain
trees upon the left hand: but they did fetch such a great compass about,
that they seemed to be beyond the camp, and to march toward Milan. In the
mean time Pescara, (than whom, no man kept a more constant judgment of mind
in sudden chance) commanded Gastaldo to scout with a company of horsemen: he
had not gone far, but that he met with Medici, and then their horsemen
skirmished together very bravely, now one side, and then the other was driven
back, and the loose shot came also in among them: finally they were so
blended together, that neither the one was suffered to have any certain
knowledge of the approach of the Switzers, nor the other of the situation and
array of the enemies camp. The ordinance as I said, was opportunely placed in
the front of the ditche, and the footmen were cast into four battallions, but
yet so with equal front, that Almaines and Spaniards were mingled together by
course. The captain of the Almaynes was George Frondesberg, a notoriou man for
his mighty body and strength: the harquebusters standing before the pikes
occupied all the whole length of the front: when Pescara commanded by as new
and witty, as afterward happy devise, that they should not set fire to their
pieces before that they had seen volagues dischardge at his commandment. But
he willed the foremoste ranks, that after they had dischardged, they should
immediatlye stoop down on their knees, and charge again that the second
ranks might incontinently discharge without danger of the foremoste, he also
commanded the second, and then the third, and so the fourth to do the same:
so that when the last had discharged, the first and the s^^ond ranks should
quickly and readily shoot off again they^ ^^charged pieces. So that this
order being repeated incessantly, the footmen of the enimyes might be beaten
down as it were with a continual storm, before that they could come to hand
strokes. Event wanted not to Pescara his devise. For when the Switzers
approached, they first shooting off their great ordinance, as also the Emperials
had done, ran amain unto the ditche, suspecting nothing of the disadvantage
of ye place: Where all things were oportunely administered by Pescara, both with
great quietness, and also celeritie, and he did suddenly let fly a storm of
small shot, which did so much mischief, that not only the ensigns, but
whole bands fell down at once: yet Albert himself lustily scaling the rampire
flewe unto Frondesberg; whom he knew, and calling him by an opprobrious name,
did with a mighty arm thrust his pike into his side, grievously wounding him:
but Albert himself was immediately slain, being stricken at from all parts
round about. And also that band of desperate fellows that succeeded him with
frantic fease, were easily slain by the Almaines and Spaniardes from the
upper ground.

In this encounter Alfonse the Marquis of Guasto, cousin germa^ to Pescara, was
wounded in the arm. But the rest of the Switzers after they had been a long
time turmoiled and troubled among the heaps of the slain, and the piles of
their pikes, turned their backs. Also at the same time Lescune bringing about
his horsemen, both give a charge upon the backs of the enemies, and passing
over two ditches does break into the Camp. Ambrose Landriano the Captain of
the Dukes wing of horsemen, is defeated and taken prisoner, the tents are cast
down, the hales of Antony de Lena, and the Earl of Termine, and their silver
plate fall to the share of the lackeys and drudges. There is a wounderfull
great hurly burly raised throughout the whole Camp, fear attacheth not only
the Soldiers, but also the Captains themselves, yet Prosperi gets himself
quickly out of the fear of this sudden chance, and sets his horsemen cast
into troops against the Frenchmen, A^ir^o, and the Earl of Collisa valia^tly
helping him, (...) Antonin de Lena r^ning th^^her foremost of al. Now Lescune
fought upon the bridge with singular prowess: which if he could have gotten,
the French horsemen had doubtless broken into commit a great slaughter of the
Emperials: when see the dukes horsemen aduauncing forward their guidons from
the high way, received the encounser: also a band of Italians Harquebusters
speedily ran unto their succor, and also the Milanese, that lay beyond the
river in a very safe place, did shoot their field pieces overthwart upon the
enemies: Fraunces Forza the Duke was in that quarter a continual encourager:
the fight was diverse, and cruel, as that which was fought in a place very
combersome in all parts, not only for the ditches and deep streams, and
small rivers, but also for the ropes of the tents, and many long polles, that
were set up to tie the horses unto. But there was a very sharp encounter at
the bridge: for there Lescune himself being notorious for his Caparissons, and
plume of feathers in his crest, contended with great valor to break through:
whose prowess the Monsieurs Montmorency, Baiarde and Pontiremy, very forward
Capitains, honorably emulated: and also Frederick de Bozolo one of the house
of Mantoa, had pierced into the high way, but the iniquity of the place did
withstand the prowess of the French horsemen. For neither were they able to
break through with thycke troops, nor yet to defend themselves, because they
had brought no and of footmen. So the Frenchmen that fought on the bridge;
after that many on both parties had been cast down hedlong into the River, with
foul slaughter of men and horses, were at length driven from the bridge:
Lescunes horse was slain under him, and anon after when he had taken an
other, he was wounded in the mouth with a sword, which was thruste thorough
the bener of his helmet, and Mounsieur Baccalaure the Ensign bearer of
Monsieur de Brion was slain, and Hugh Earl of Pepoli, had his leg shot
through with an harquebusse, the French guidons were rafte and torn: and the
Harquebusters that were beyond the ditche, tourning themselves on the side of
the enemies, did with their often and thick shooting much endamage the men of
arms, and specially their horses. In the mean space, the battle of the
Switzers being defeated, the footmen freste cried, Victory, victory: this
most fayful cry brought from one to another event unto the hindermost ranks,
the Frenchmens hearts incontinently quailed: but the courage of the Emperialls
increased: Lescune windeth himself out of the fight, and with singular
constancy (although he had lost many of his horsemen) recouereth his brother
Lautrech, who when he saw the slaughter and flight of the Switzers, consta^tly
stood still with his whole battle. But when Pescara saw the foremoste ranks
disordered, and the footme^ turned into flight, entreated and besought
Frondesberg as earnestly, as he could for his life, and adhorted the Almaines,
that they would pursue the fleing and beat the backs of the discomfited,
take revenge of the nation that was the most deadly enimye of the Almaines,
and finally without any danger, win an entier victory. But when he could not
obtain this of them, who of insolent contumacie would not obey, and with
terrible muttering requested to have treble pay: he for to enkindle them by
example, sent forth three bands of Spanishe footmen. But because they ran
forth scattered, neither would the Almains follow them, they leesing Guinea, a
valiant pety Captain, were almost enclosed, partly by the Switzers that drew
back the ordinance, and partly by John de Medici, who running trauerse the
field, guarded the backs of the departing Switzers with a strong troop of
footmen and horsemen: yet the Imperial horsemen, when Prospero commanded
them, and Pescara requested them with angry countenance to make have, pursued
them and then Medici boldly turning his troops upon them the horsemen
shirmished together above two hours, for both the French and Venetian light
horsemen repaired from al parts unto Medices standeres. But at the beginning of
the battle when the Switzers were ouerthrown, almost all the Venetian power
went away with Theodoro de Trivulzi their Captain, never once attempting to
fight. There perished of the Switzers what in the fight, and afterward of
their wounds, about three thousand: among whom next to Albert Petra, Arnolde
of Vnderwalden did most excel for authority and valiant courage. But there
were slain of the Frenchmen Mounsieurs de Molans, and Ghisci, and two noble
young gentlemen Mounsieur de Montfort, and de Turnon. But of the Emperialls
Peter Earl of Colisa, of the house of Cardona, Pescara his mothers brother,
being shot into the eye as he plucked up his beuer, with the quarrel of a
crosbow, whereof there was but one in the whole field The next day after when
the Emperials pursued the frenchmen, they dissolved al their army, ye Switzers
went home, the Venetians repaired unto Bressa, Lescune and Medici to Cremona,
Bozzolo with the rest of the horsemen to Lodi, and Lautrech the bastard and
Palice into France. Then the Emperials following the victory, wan Lodi, Cremona
and finally all the duchy, except the Castells of Milan, Cremona, and Nu^ara,
and then also sacked the rich City of Genea.

The battle fought at Pauia in Lumbardy betvveene Frauncis the French King and
Charles Duke of Burbon, Charles de Lanoy viceroy of Naples the Marquess of
Pescara captains for Charles the fifth Emperor on Saint Mathies day in
anno.1525. written by Iouius in the life of the Marquis of Pescara.
IN the year of our Lord.1524. the Imperial power having utterly expelled
the Frenchmen out of all the duchy of Milan, invaded France, and besieged the
strong City of Marsiles in Prouente: but when they heard of the approach of
Frances the french king with a puissaunt power, they speedilye brake up the
siege, and hasted into Italy: whom the king pursued so fast, that the
Emperials were no sooner entered the City of Milan, but that he was also at the
gate, and took the city, the Emperialls for saking it, and fleing with all
their army unto the City of Lody: but that they had before placed Antony de
Leua in the city of Pauia, with all their Lansquenetz (being five thousand)
and five hundredth Spaniardes footmen, and two cornets of horsemen The king not
staying at al at Milan (but only leaving the L. Tremouille with a power to
besiege ye castle) marched inco^tine^tly to Pauia, and came thither ye 28. of
October.) which he besieged so long, that Charles the duke of Burbon (who had
revolted lately unto the Emperor, and had then the government of the Emperial
army in the duchy of Milan) went into Germany, and brought from thence
George Frondesberg, with twenty bands of Lansquenetz, and Nicholas the earl of
Salme with two thousand horsemen, and Ferdinande the Archduke of Austrich, sent
v. C. horsemen, and six thousand Lansquenetz. As soon as all these Almayus
were arrived at Lodi, the Imperial power did set forth against the French
king at the earnest persuasion of the Marquis of Pescara, who wan both Lanoy
the viceroy of Naples (who being fearful of leesyng his proper province,
would have gone unto Naples with the horsemen, and namely the Neapolioans, and
all the light armed footmen of the Almayns and Spaniardes, to defend the
kingdom of Naples, against the Duke of Albanie, whom the French king had sent
with ten thousand men to invade Naples, in the which enterprise he also
should be aided by the Pope) to turn and to bend al their force against the
French king: and also had gotten the Spaniards to go forth to fight, which
they at the first refused for long lack of pay. So their army being mustered
(wherein were found (says Francis Guicciardine seven hundred men of arms, and
so many light horsemen, and one thousand Italian horsemen, and above sixtene
thousand footmen, part Spaniardes, and part Almayns: (but Iouius seems to
insinuate a greater number:) they departed from Lodi the five and twentieth day
of January, and marched toward the French king, taking the town of saint.
Angelo by the way, that they might forage and be victualled freely without
interception. The King understanding of the winning of saint Angelo, removed
from the west part of the town into the camp of Seigneur de la Palice, who lay
on the east side close unto the wall of Pauy park. He also made strong munitio^s
from the wall of the Park even unto the river of Tesino: and beating down a
part of the Park wall in three places, he made three ways, as it were three
mighty gates, yt his horsemen, who did almost al of them lodge in the park on
the left hand close unto the wood side, might speedily at all times help the
footmen, and also the station, that the King had left on the west side of the
Town. But after that the Imperial power was encamped near unto the French,
there was many a sharp, shirmishe attached; and also Le^^ incessantly sallyed
out of the city: in one of these skirmishes, or more truly after one of them,
(when that he showed unto the lord Bon^uer the Admiral of France, the place and
manner of his fortunate skirmish) John de Medici was shot into the leg out of
a low cottage, and to grievously hurt, that as despai^ing of life, he obtained
of the king to be carried down the river unto Placenza with the incomparable
incommoditie no doubt of the Frenchmen: for he was so courageous, vigilant, and
expert a Captain, that there was no sou^^ior so very a cowarde and faint
hearted, that would not cheerfully follow his ensigns, and would not desire
to be seen in the ^^elde with him. Also about the same time (as though that
fortune being sore displeased with the Frenchmen would bring all incommodities
upon them in one day, the hands of the Grisons, (who were six thousand)
being revoked by domestical wars began suddenly to advance their, ensigns
and to depart home: for James de Medici a Mil^^esse: afterward created
Marquis of ^^drinian had at the comm^indement of Francis F^rza, and the earnest
request of Pescara invaded the Grisons upon a sudden, and won the town and
castle of Clauenna, and thereby brought great terror unto all the whole
nation. The which danger being certified by the magistrates unto the Grisons
that were in the french camp, they could not be caused to tarry by any
entreatie, although they were offered double wages: and which did augment the
inco^moditie also, diverse ensigns also of those Switzers that were their
confederates followed them, although that Marshall Lescune openly reviled with
reproaches of avarice and perfidiousnes their Colonel. Then when that be
obstinately persisted in his purpose to be gone, challenged him unto the combat.
Now had the armies lain many days almost close one unto an other with so nere
front, (a thing that had never happened in our age) that it was wonder that the
soldiers would so long abide the incommodities either of perpetual labor or
most hard winter, and would ^^ert^se their bodies with continual watchings
and shirmishes: neither a thing seldom seen, although all things in all
parts were beaten with the great ordinance, yet would they not join in
battle, fortune inclining* neither to the one side nor the other. But hope of
guerdon and praise, the noble stirrers up of men's hearts and fear of dishonor,
which is a very sharp prick, yea unto dastards, did wonderfully sustain and
hold them up, who contended with equal power, as though they must vanquish
not by force, but by sufferance: for the french king being of an high mind,
thought it for his dignity rather to suffer all hardness, than not to
maintain the fame of egregious constancy, the which virtue seemed to be
strange to the French men's nature: for as they had gotten all the victories
of former times, rather by hot courage, and swift fease, than long
perseueraunce: so in deed they being tired by the long lingering of the
Imperial Captains, and broken by tediousnes of long wars, had lost the name
of their ancient glory. He also knew that the besieged were distressed with
incredible penury almost of all things, and namely of wine, the which by long
custom and usage is the thing that holds up ye bodies of the Almains, and
makes the^^^ cheerful and courageous to sight, he also vnderstoods that those
me^ which had arrived lately out of Germany, and also the spaniardes, and
Italians, could not be long kept together without wages, seeing that the month
was now almost out, the which they had promised at Pescara his ^ntecaty to
serve without money: finally seeing that his camp was fortified in all places
with so great rampires and munitions, he did not think that the enemies were
so^nuche to be feared, that he ought to leave his enterprise with ignominy:
seeing that they which had proudly come with so great fease and violence, and
boasting, to assault his camp, seemed by dishonorable lying before it xx. days
with frustrate attempt, to have spent not only their victuals, provision, and
money, but also that terrible fame of fiersnesse. Yet nevertheless not being
ignorant how much his power was diminished, he very earnestlye endeavored to
augment his army with new supplies: yet does Guicciardin write, that he had
in his camp. 1300. men of arms, 10000. Switzers, and so many Lansquenetz.
50000. french footmen, and. 7000 Italians, although that through the s^aud of
the captains and the negligence of his officers, the number of the footme^ was
far less tha^ be paid wages for. But first of al other things, ye king made
truce with the Genouese, ye 4000 Italians might be inco^ttue^tly brought into
his camp from Sau^na by ye Marquis of ^alures, but Gaspar Mayno a Milanese
suddenly setting upon this power with certain bands of Sforzans, as they
passed ^uer the river of Burnta, did so defeat the^ yt he brought the captains
prisoners, and almost all the ensigns unto Alessandtia. Thus the K. having lost
the hope of aid from Sauana, sent for Tremouille from Milan, with a company of
horsemen, and for the greatest part of the footmen; ye besieged the castle of
Milan. Now there were at Milan, by Guice^ardins report. 300. men of arms,
6000. footmen of Grisons, and VValisse land men, and.iij. thousand French
footmen. Tremouille carried with him to the king all the footmen, except.ij. M.
The K. also commanded Momorentey, who was captain of the third french camp,
which lay in the small Island, yt the river of Tesino makes before ye city of
Pauia, to bring all the most chosen horsemen and footme^ into ye greater camp,
and leave the earl of Claramont with a certain to keep ye Isle. The sum of all
ye kings intent and purpose was this: to send forth a part of his horsemen
unto S. Columbano, yt they fleing about and remaining at the backs of the
^nimies, might take away from the^ al ability to be victualed, and to forage
freely at their pleasure: and in the mean time he would keep himself within
the munitions and continue still the siege, and expect, intentive, and ready,
with what eue^t Albany did enter the kingdom of Naples, and what the Pope and
the Venetians his confederates would attempt: yet there wanted not men of great
quality for their long service in the war^, who with free speech did
disco^mend these counsels which were fraughtful of supreme peril, and
endeavored to pluck out of ye kings mind that determination of fatal
se^te^ce: and specially above other Tremouille, Galeazo Sanseuerino, Palisse,
and Theodoro Trivulzi: for they said ye both the honors and dishonours of
warrefare are defined by none other estimation, than the supreme victory,
whereunto a prudent and grave Chieftaine would revoke al his cogitations? for
what may seem unto men skillful in martial matters to be more foolish and
shameful than being not forced by necessitye, to bring the kings person into
that peril: whereby the whole Realm of France should endaunger both their
diguitie and safetye^ finally, what could be moro estraunged from reason, tha^
with less number of Souldtors and with less reward of victory, to fight a
doubtful battle with their most valiant and desperate ennimyes, For a^
their adversaries their hope was reposed in hasting (...) t^ le^itie, that
before they were vahquished by difficulties of all things, they might fight
with more indifferent conditions while that they are yet strong by great and
fresh power. What said Palice, do not our sharp^ witted ^nimies most
manifestly see, that by stay and tariance our power grows stronger and
strong^t, and contrariwise that theirs is greatly lessened, and also their
devises and endeavors do wax weak and will be turned into an uncertainty,
seeing that within these few days, their money and victuals, provision, and
the good wills and aides of all men will quite and utterly fail them? Al
things surely, if we play the wise men, will speedily fall out fortunate for us,
and adverse for them: so that we get us out of this pound^, and encampe our
selves at large at Binasco, that the battle being avoided, we may by
continual lingering frustrate the rage and violent fease of these wild
beasts, thereby to obtain assured victory: for the Almaines (unless I be
deceived) will as soon as ever they come out of Pauia, demand their due wages
of the ^e^y Captains, as poor men that are almost starued up for lack of
meat, and also wanting all other necessary things neither will gay glosing and
large promises now any longer serve their turn to appease and please their
soldiers, but present and great store of gold, for over and above their
ferocitie naturally ingrafted, their valiant service will not without just
cause make them insolent: and thus they being defrauded and deluded, will either
raise up some sedition, or else being contented with the glory of constancy
will incontine^tly return home: in so much that I do not despair, but that
the rest of them, as then which have now delivered their kinsemen from siege*
will return into Germany, when that no present money shall be paid them. In the
meanetime, both yt priuers that are our friends will with more open end euour
help us, and also France at hand will commodiously and abundantly supply al
things that the wars shall require. Surely your Majesty has vanquished, if
that you will va^quish by new and wholesome reason your mind which is induced
with the vain praise of perseverance. For it seems not to be the part of a
wise and good chieftain, to seek glory by (...), that may bring dishonor,
(...) assured destruction under a certain false, or shadowed name of
constancy. These things were true, and so much the greater authority was in
Palice his words, as he was accounted to by more forward to fight, and more
fervent than the rest of the Captains. For it did appear that he had bin
adduced, not by some doubtful, but a most certain reason, for to forsake his
old wont, and his natural judgment: since that he had before time deserved
the name rather of an effectual and valiant, than a lingering doubtful, and
wary Captain. And also unto this effect (which seemed to be sent out of
Clemente the Popes mouth) did Albert Pio Earl of Carpi the kings Ambassador,
write unto him from Rome, and very diligently and earnestly admonished and
counseled him to shun the hazard of universal sight by removing his camp
back unto Binasco: because it seemed that the fease and violence of the fresh
and fierce Almain enemy was not to be broken by force, but by timely and
commodious staying and lingering. This also very well liked Renee of Sauey the
kings uncle, who, as one hofull for the kings safety, had condemned al hazard
of battle. But one above al other Bio^niuet the Admiral, who had through his
sine wit, great art, vigilancie, and seruisablenesse, gotten him a most sure
and firm place of favor with the king, spoke against them that counseled the
breaking up of the siege, in company modestly, but in private and withdrawn
talk, when he was alone with the king, very vehemently. What (says he) shall
a King of so passing courage, and instructed with the surpassing precepts and
experimentes of martial discipline, as your Majesty is, be with this root of
dishonor and infamy ruled by Tremouille a man very extreme old, or Galeaze?
all the sense of both which men's lively and spedy vigor, and lusty courage,
three score and ten years have dulled and blunted? What and has not that noble
order of fight, wherein of late Palice most surmounted, now waxed through cold
in him by encroching age? It is so in very deed: in so much that me thought he
plaieth to day the very fond man in counselling that thing old man like,
wherein he himself was never good, nor does not now lend us the help of
valiant hand, the which we do to day need and he has bin always ^^^^^t to
(...) also ^^sely therein excel among the stoutests. But as for Theodoer, it
is meet that he follow the inclination of his age, nature and disposition:
seeing that he had rather by suspectyng, doubtyng and prouydyng that every
thing, which is far off, fall not, warely to save himself and your royal
army, than by fightyng valyauntly, and byentryng into the chances of wars with
not most certain and infallible event, seek for and get, yea almost an
assured victory. What then does empeach, but that I may set against these
worn old men fire hundredth others, that have for valor of courage and their
noble acts deserved the name of captains General: whose noble hearts fear
never entered, for it is ye usage and manner of French men to vanquish famously,
when their king is present, does give them the signal of battle, does
encourage them, and fight himself, as we have learned to ^^ght valiantly and
fortunately at Tarro, under the conduct of king Charles, at Adda under king
Jews, and under your Majesty, with so great comme^dation at Milan? Surely we
are not the same men that we have always been, that is, valiant and desirous
of honor, if we do once think that we ought to fear least these mighty high
rampires, and these strongly entrenched camps, may be expugned and scaled one
night as it were by thieves and cut throat robbers. But for Gods sake let not
this dismaiall of a few bloudlesse men, redounde unto the ignominy of the
Switzers and Almaines that serve your highness, and the old horsemen, who
whereas they do utterly despise and contemn yea in an indifferent field, this
army of the enemies levied up by sodeyne and hasty musters, and choice, and
hired for small wages, do also repose in the fortune and name of your roial
person, who laying apart Majesty, will fight most valiantly of all other, the
moment of most assured victory. But although the king being suspended with a
very sharp care, did very diligently weigh in equal balance the words of
his Captains, yet fortune inclining, he followed those counsels which seemed
most honorable, and most meet for his hie heart. But this habit of hearts
was among Themperials, that not only every Captain, but also every common
soldier did think that the victory was certainly theirs, if that they
coul^e join in battle with the king, by any indifferent means, before that
he got him thence. On the which only occasion of fight, among other, Pescara
was so vehemently bent, that whilst he with incredible patience and desire,
did both day and night view and survey all things: it is reported that he
withdrewe from nature the desires and necessaries of ^^ats, and fleepe, to the
grievous hurt of his health. But sithence it was apparent that the Kings
Munitions could not be won, but with doubtful event, and assured loss of
soldiers: he determined to enter into the Park by breaking open the wall,
that fetching a little compass about, he might come to Mirabelle, the which is
a lodge of singular pleasure, very commodions for Hanking and hunting, standing
almost in the midst of the Park, the which is sixtene miles about. In that
place the King removing from his elde lodging* had placed his horsemen, and had
left there a great company of merchants, and straglers, and men of peace. Now
was Pescara desirous to take this place specially, for two causes? for if he
could without empechement of the enemy get Mirabella; (the which thing was
first purposed in this journey) then he manifestly saw that with his
surpassing praise, and the infamy of the French men, Leua were delivered from
^^ege, and also the enemies were utterly excluded from the City of Milane: But
if the King to impeache that journey, would nothing doubt to issue out of the
munition of his camp for to fight, then ability would be given commodiously
to join in battle with him: the which thing the Emperials did so greatly
desire with ardent hearts: and in very deed were forced by necessity to wyshe
and seek it, because they wanted money to pay the soldiers, and also now
the hearts of their old allies were not doubtfully turned unto the French
king. All these things as they were invented and devised by a saylfull and
sharp percing wit, in like manner did Pescara declare unto the captains,
descrybing every thing with so great efficacy and couragiousnesst, that he
seemed to rejoice not in the victory surely surueyed, and found out, but
gotten and obtained. And also Lanoy and Burbon conceyuing greater confidence,
did now believe that they had vanquished. For when that he proved all
things by most weighty arguments and grave speeches, his credit and authority
increased so almost immesurably, that it was utterly void of obtrectation and
envy: (the which vice does always hurt flourishing, virtue) and in so much
that the chief captains did of their own accordes commit unto him the supreme
authority in wholly ordering this matter, the which thing was almost more
glorious unto him, than afterward to have vanquished, as he that having often
at other times tamed his enemies, yet had this one work only left him to
overcome envy by unwonted glory: and certes it seemed a wonder, that Lanoy who
was yea ambitiously desirous of honor and the highest authority, and Burbon,
who had the chief charge of martial affairs, preferred him before
themselves, as the better warrior not only by secret, but also by free and open
judgment, for Piscara was at that time void of all authority and honor,
because he had before in the journey to Marsilas given up the office of
governing the footmen, unto the Marquess of Guasto his uncles son and his
own heir apparaunt. But he was so loosed of peculiar charge, that he aloue
almost administered all things, and taking incredible toil both in body and
mind, was still among the footmen, the horsemen* the victuallers, the
purueyors, and ordinance, and continually viewing and seeing that nothing were
done over hastily, negligently or unskillfully. So then the resolution being
allowed of all the inferior Captains, and the exploite taken upon him,
Pescara sent Arrio, one that had charge of horsemen (promising him great
rewards) unto Antony Leua, to tell him that he should incontinently sally out
of the City, when he should have intimation thereof at the time appointed by
the shooting off of two mighty great pieces of ordinance. Neither did
fortune fail unto Arrio: for he setting forth in the dead time of the
night, came in safely with his troop (fetching a great compass about) unto
the back gate of the town, having deceived the Frenchmen that watched, by an
happy lie: for when they asked him for his watch word, he faining himself to
be one of Medice^ companies, (as he had also counterfeited their habit with a
while cross) made his excuse, that he could not tell the watch word because he
had been two days out of the Kings camp in a wood. After ye Pescara had
intelligence by a fire made out of the top of the toure, that Arrio was
fortunately entered the town: he commanded Salsede to break open the wall of
the Park, delivering unto him to do it withal, Rams made after the
ancient form: and also iron. Crows and Pickares. But he commanded Jews
Viacampe, and also Hercera, and Gaioses, to stand with their bands in several
places over right, against the munitions of the enemy, and make a noise all the
night long with their weapons and Drums, and by putting them in fear, and
provoking them, keep them still occupied. But when they had received word that
he was entered the Park, they should incontinentlye follow with their bands.
He also willed Honofito Montano to stand not far from the Park wall upon an
high bank over right against the black regiment of the Lansquenets, and so to
bestirre himself and his men, that it might seem that the bands were in
arms throughout all the camp, as they had used to be many nights before. He
also commanded that all the cariages of the army should go forth into the
high way toward Lodi, with a guard of a troop of light horsemen, and also
commanded an other company of horsemen to take way that lay upon the left
hand, that if there were espies in the Camp, they being distracted and
deceived by so many and diverse goings forth, and so su^drie preparation of all
things, might not be able to tell the French men any thing for certainty. But
Salsede who had come in the dead time of the night unto the place before
prescribed, spente the night in long beating and bouncing in vain, so that the
dawning was broken before that he had opened the wall in three places, somewhat
later than Pescara would have had it. For the wall being made of Brick after
the old buylding, was very strong, and resisted the Rams with singular
contumacie, although they were driven against it with the arms and strength of
whole bands. The first man of all that was sent into the Park by Pescara, was
Alphons Marquis of Guasto, with the valiantest of the Spanishe and Almaine
footmen, and three companies of horsemen. Incontinently Greco Iustiniano, a
Genouese, who watched in the station next unto the place, where the enemies
brake in, was chased away. There were with Guasto about five thousand men,
unto whom it was enjoined to march directlye to Mirabello, and to take that
place without any return. When that Guasto entered the Park, Pescara said
unto him with severe, but yet with cheerful countenance. Pluck up a good
heart unto thee (valiant brother) for this day thou must endeavor to win the
place: but if that your hands (which God defend) shall not suffice against
your so often vanquished enemies, then see that your bodies by dying honorably,
do nobly pay (your enemies not unrevenged) that which they do owe unto unto
their valiant hearts. To whom Guasto answered with a joyful countenance: I
will this day manfully do my deuoyre, that I being either alive, or dead, the
honors of our house may be augmented by heap through some new and famous
deed of prowes: and then breaking into the Park with square battle, marched
to a stream called Vernacula, meeting with none of his enemies, and then
passing over the small river, went to Mirabello, where, because of the
largeness of the house, a myghtie multitude of Merchauntes, straglers, sick
soldiers, and men of peace had settled themselves, and great store of
victualles, and much of the Kings furniture of household was also laid there.
And there was among all other (that he might lodge the more quietly and
wholsomely) the Popes Ambassador Hierome Aleander, a man very excellentlye
learned, and of great fame, n^mely for his wonderful memory. So when the
ennimies had flowen thither unlooked for, all that whole company was
streightwaye oppressed, and all things were in a trice spoiled, and then
Guasto gathering his bands together into one, as Pescara had commanded him,
he did set up the Imperial Ensigns within the diche of the house. In the
mean time, Pescara immediately brings in the rest of the footmen: Lancy and
Burbon do send in the horsemen: the artillery is drawn into the Park by
Oxen and horses, although hardlye yet at one time. The fields are filled with
white linen battayles: for all the Emperialles had by Pescara his Edicte put
their waste-coates uppermost, and they which lacked waste coats, and
specially the Almaines, had so covered their breasts with white paper, that
by the unwonted white, the weapons glistering between, a show of a greater
and more terrible host might he presented unto the eyes of the amazed French
men. For now the dawning had brought in fair broad day light, and the
somewhat thick cloud which had been spread over the fields, began to vanishe
away by little and little. But the French King, who perpetually watched
intentive for all chances, is nothing appalled with that novelty, and
therewithal, as it became either a King of high heart, or a skillful and
stout Chieftaine, gives sign by the Trumpetie, that every man taking his
armor and weapons, should stand by the Ensigns, he commands the great
ordinance to be drawn forth by the harnessed horses, and by the Captains (as
need was) administreth all things speedily, but yet not without all tumult and
uproar, for he had learned long before by the report of Greco Iustiniano, what
the enemies went about by thick thumping against the wall of the Park, and
when he heard the thundering of the enemies ordinance, who^ Leua by
appointment had answered with the like number, he had judged by conjecture,
that it was doubtless a sign either of attaching battle, or of attempting
some great exployte. It is also reported, that he sharply reproved certain,
that of vain flattery told him, that the Emperialles being oppressed with
penury, and lack of all things, were fleeing back again unto Lodi. Thus
when he plainly sees that the battayles of the ennimies march with full pace
not unto him, but to Mirabello, he thinking it not good to linger, leads the
Switzers and Lansquenettes out of the munitions: he commands the French
footmen to stay in the Camp with Bussie de Ambois, he leaves the Italian
footmen in commodious places under the Castle against the sallyes of Leua,
and marches himself unto the ennimye in array of battle, with this order,
that on the one side, the great ordinance, and on the other, wings of horsemen
should flank the Switzers, and march with them with equal front, one as
far forth as another: and not far off the Lansquenets were flanked in like
sort with other horsemen and ordinance. They report that when the King led
the footmen out of the camp, he being very joyful in countenance, nor any
thing fearing the malignitie of fortune, said unto the Captains that stood
round about him: that he went not rashlye forth to fight the battle, never
calling reason into counsel, but with a right and noble judgment, seeing that
he could with most equal lot wish nothing more commodious for the winning of
the victory, than to get his enemies not within diches and munitions, (as it
had often happened at other times) but in the open and wide fields, and in
their march and journey: where it might be seen, what the standing Esquadrons
of Switzers and Almaines were worth, what force ye most strong horsemen had,
what good the great ordinance flying our swift wheels could do. For against
the Lansquenets, who only of all other seemed most to be feared, he did
rightly set the Switzers, as their matches indiscipline, furniture, strength,
and courage, so also alwais their most bitter enemies by natural hatred. But
he thought that the Spaniardes would not be able to abide, no not the first
impression of the black regiment of Lansquenets, if that they would keep
their ranks in thick array: neither if that they would fight scattered, and
running hither and thither, that they could escape from being ouerrunne by the
horsemen. Doubtless these things were foreseen, and provided with very good
advise and reason, if that (as it most times happens) insolent fortune being
foe unto noble devises, had not preuerted all things by confuse order. For
they ran together in sundry places with so great confusion of horsemen and
footmen blended together, that never any armies fought more confusely and
scatteringly. For hap came straight ways into the place of Martial
prudence, and valor was oftentimes vanquished by an unthought of chance, when
rashness seemed by happy event to vsurye the name of mature counsel and
reason. In the hindermost tail of the Emperialles were seven bands of Italian
footmen, and three of Spaniardes, appointed t^ guard five battering pieces of
ordinance. When they hardlye followed the rest of their fellows that went
before, because that almost as soon as they had entered the Park, the wheels
sinking in, the ordinance sta^ke fast in a watrie plot: it came to pass, that
they which were last in order, were contrary to hope, the first of all that
met the Frenchmen their enemies. For the King seeing them separated far from
the rest of the army, did out of hand send thither Philip Lord Brion, and
Frederick Earl of Bozzolo, with a strong company of men of arms, and with
certain speedy pieces of ordinance, and also certain small loose companeis of
footmen were joined with them. They do speedily his commandment, and do
set upon the enemies being busied in weyghing up the ordinance. There is a
cruel fight: but although the Emperials fought with singular valor, yet they
susteyning neither the storm of the ordinance, nor the force of the horsemen,
took the wood adjoining to save themselves by the guard of the trees, from
the violence of the insulting horsemen. So the Frenchmen quickly cutting off
the legs of the drawing beasts, do get the ordinance, and with the same
violent pursuit do enter the wood, where being oppressed with the
disaduauntage of unaccustomed encounter, Sebastian Squaccia, a man of passing
prowes was slain, and with him certain stout petie Captains and Ensign
bearers, yea, and four whole bands. This exployt being prosperously done in
the sight of both armies, as it did greatly augment the courage of the King
and the French men, so did it strike Pescara with incredible sorrow, because he
could not succor them. But on the other side, he being greedy of fight, as
soon as he saw the Kings army (the which he did not think would have come
forth into the field out of their camp) wonderfully rejoiced, as though he
had conceived the victory. Neither stayed he, but immediatlye sent Falzi, an
horseman of his acquaintance, unto Lanoy to admonish him to stay his march,
and all things set apart, and turning the Guidons toward the enemies,
incontinently to encounter them: he also signifies the same unto Burbon, and
Nicolas Earl of Salern, and gallopeth himself to call Guasto, but Guasto as
soon as he had seen his enemies, leaving Mirabello marched back to
Vernacula, and setting his men in array of battle, had turned the ensigns
toward the enemies: for he did not think that in this moment of time, he
ought to obey that which had been at the first commanded him, but speedily to
use the new counsel which chance did present. Then Pescara said: this is
well brother, you have done that which I would you should: wherefore haste you
on the left hand unto the ennimie with speedy pace, and valiauntlye endeavor
that the victory may most specially^ arise at your wing. When he had thus
said, he flewe unto the Lansquenets, in whose valor and strength he did
foresee that the weight of the battle, and the whole victory did consiste.
In the mean time, a troop of the Imperial light horsemen, boldly charging
the black Esquadron of Almaines, were easilye repelled, and thrust back with
foul disorder, into the valley of Vernacula that lay underneath, and also the
French ordinance being commodiously drawn with swift horses into all
quarters with marvelous skill and celeritie, did so annoye the enemies, that
the Spaniardes, yea laying their breasts flat upon the ground, could scarce
escape the fleeing pellets through the benefit of the lower greunde, and Lanoy
and Alarco were forced to bring their fearful troops of horsemen behind a
country Cottage, which happily defended them. But then the king being
vohemently incited by these, as it were beginnings of not doubtful victory,
and moved both by the disposition of his own nature, and also through the
adhortation of his Captains, doubted nothing to give the signal, and to
dismarche to give the charge. The rest do the same: and before all other Palice
the leader of the auantgarde, did in the right wing charge the Imperial
horsemen, who were now lustily turned. This fease and charge of the Frenchmen,
as it was grievous and terrible to Lanoy, so by the opinion of many men it
seemed to have afterward not doubtfully carried away the victory from the
Frenchmen: for by that headlong and speedy departure, not only the Switzers
and Almaines, who could not follow after with equal pace, were bared of the
guarde of the horsemen, but also the use of the ordinance was for a great part
taken away, for that the Gunners were forced to cease shooting, least that
they should strike both the sides and backs of the kings troops, who were
run forth far before them. But never in our age did horsemen encounter
together more couragiouslye and strongly: for on both sides old beaten
Captains and horsemen, fought with burning hearts, not for only glory (a
thing yet that does most sharpen the edge of true prowess) but also for the
Empire of Italy. The Frenchmen being greedy of revenge, sought in all places
of the encounter most narrowly for Burbon, as a forsaker of the King and his
country, with the ignominy of treason and perfidiousnesse: but all in vain,
for Burbon that he might more safely show his valor, had given his
Cognizaunces unto his familiar freude the Lord Pomperant, and fought himself
in his coat, and apparailed like unto a private soldier. But the King
himself being notorious for his coat of cloth of silver, and specially for
his tall stature, fullye performed the duty of an encouraging Captain, and a
valiant warrier, he setting spurs to his horse, brake through the enemies
battayles, he encountered those that he met, and namelye those that were most
of mark for velvet and gold. In this uproar, Ferdinand Castri^ta, who
brought his pedigrue from the Kings of Macedon, and was also a noble Captain,
was slain by the Kings own hand: and Hugh of Cardona, the Lieutenaunt of
Pescara his company of Horsemen, was also beaten down, two Guidons were
torn into pieces, and the horsemen of Ba^ier, whom Ferdinande the Emperors
brother had sent, lustilye attaching the encounter, and most constantlye
fighting, were defeated: so that now the Guidons and troops of Lanoy and
Barbon did almost swaye and shrink back. For the French men were superior
in horsemen, both for number and strength, because the Imperial men of arms
did lack the aid of light horsemen, for of the three troops, the first had
gone to Mirabello with Guasto: the second, as we have toldo you, being
shamefullye repulsed by the black Almaynes, had fled back: But the third
being left without the Park, under the conducte and guyding of Guy Gaino,
did guard the cariages, and baggage of the whole army. Also that surpassyng
company of horsemen, which consisted wholye of Italian and Spanishe
Gentlemen, and was the peculiar company of the Viceroy, aided them not at all,
as they which were not at the battle. For Lanoy had commanded Monsieur
Verereis a Fleming, his cousin, and Lieutenant over that hand, to stay without
the wall of the Park, nor by any means to stir from thence, until that he
had received from him by assured messenger, the token of departure, and of
entering the fight. But when the battle was incontinently attached, and very
hot, and Lanoy had all his senses and memory so vehemently occupied about the
present and terrible matter, that he sent no man to call his cousin: the young
Gentleman thinking that he must in any case obey his uncles commandments,
and the precepts of Martial discipline, stood still, and moved not until
the end of the battle: neither could he be adduced to go forth into the
field by any entreaty or chasing of the horsemen, unto Lanoy, being for these
causes in great distress, and hardlye susteyning the force of the Kings
battle. Pescara (who viewing all things and places with wonderful and
present prudence, and specially with intentive eye, did meet with and redress
every difficulty in this place and in that, finallye in all parts, sent about
viij. C. Spaniards harquebusiers to succor him, who being suddenly spread round
about at the back and sides of the French horsemen, beat down a mighty
number of them with their terrible storm of pellets. And also he set straight
after them a band of armed Pikes: and then the harquebusiers being safe through
their guard, did more boldlye and incessantlye use their harquebusses. When the
Kings horsemen had received this great incommoditie, they not being able to
abide thick together in troop, and thinking that if they did spread abroad
their wings, they should be able to repugn with less peril: brake their array,
scattered themselves abroad. But when by this devise they met with more
infestuous fortune, they being relied again into a thick troop, for shame
and anger run upon the Harquebusiers. But the Spaniardes being nimble by
nature, and light armed, did swiftly flee back, loosing their array, and by
turning and winding this way and that way, eluded the violence of the horses,
and being augmented in number, they did as they had been taught both by long
experience, and also by the new precepts of Pescara, scattered themselves all
the field over without order, twenty and thirty, and ten or sixtene (as it
happened) in a company. This was a new kind of fight and not usual, but very
cruel and miserable, because that the use of noble prowes in the horsemen was
utterly lost, the Harquebussers with great advantage dispatching all before
they could reach them with their Lances: neither could, yea the most
stro^gest arms do any good long, but that they which were thick and many
together, were slain by the thin and few, and often the most famous
Captains and horsemen were euerywhere stricken down with unrevenged death, by
the base and common footmen. Also in another quarter, Guasto having from the
right wing advanced his footmen, and bringing in his wing of horsemen, had now
prosperously encou^tred with Annas Montmorencie and his horsemen, being
defeated by the Harquebusiers, he himself before other, had gotten the enemies
ordinance, having slain the Gunners. But it happened in this encounter (which
I think is not to be passed over unspoken of) that Guasto and Montmorencie
(who afterward became most famous Chiefetaines) did a good while (as we have
learned of them both) very sharply fight one with the other, man to man, with
this event, that not long after Montmorencie his horse being slain by
Gastald^, he was at length taken by Errera a Petie captain of the Spanishe
footmen. Guasto being made more courageous by this success of things, did set
upon the lesser battallio^ of the Switzers, who were appalled with the loss of
the ordinance, and the flight of the horsemen, and therefore did attache the
fight with doubtful and lingering acts. But then might you see (an incredible
thing to be spoken) that nation which a little before were feared of all men
for their excellent and approved valor in the field, and specially in a
battle, quite forgetting both honor and discipline, and also their ingrafted
ferocitie, to refuse to fight welny before they had once charged their Pykes,
and for fear of honorable death, sought an infamous and most shameful
destruction in the very deep river. Floranges in vain going about to keep
them still in the battle, and and to confirm them with great obtestations,
and he who was of very familiar acquaintance with that nation, and indignity
one of the Marshals of France offered and professed yt himself would fight on
foot in the forefront with his peculiar company of horsemen, al of the^ sending
away their horses, insomuch that either angry God, or certes that fatal day
unto the King did seem to take away the wonted vigor of their huge and
mighty bodies and hearts. Neither with less deformity did also another
battallion of Switzers flee, which, as it was fuller for number of bands, so
it stood a while unmoved, but when they were a far overwhelmed by the
Harquebussies, spreading them selves round about them, with certain
perpetual shoure of pellettes, and the valyauntest of the petie Captains (as
it does most commonly happen) were slain in the foremost ranks, and when
they had seen the discomfiture of the Kings horsemen, they hurling away their
Pykes, turned their backs. They report that when John Diespach (who had the
highest authority among the captains of ye Switzers) saw the bands shamefully
to flee, no not once attempting to fight, and slanding in their way all to
chased; was not able to stay the Ensign bearers, by reuiling and beating them
back, he being compelled by most grievous dolor, would not live after so
great a foil and shame received, but in that decree of hardye heart ran
into the thickest of the enemies, and died very honorably: yet the Switzers
that suruiued, did lay the fault of this overthrow and slaughter in Alanson,
who had married the Kings sister, because that he as a man nothing valiant,
and a long time a beholder of the inclining battle, at the length fleeing
away (whilst that the fight was yet hot) with the untouched and whole
horsemen of the rerewarde, had by ouerthwarte hasting cross them, and violent
impulsion, broken the battallion of the Switzers, that fought noblye in good
array. But in the right wing of the French men, the black Almaynes only of
all their footmen sought sharply and valiantly with the Imperial Almaynes, as
it were, in the very despair of their lives, and of victory, yea they
encountered together almost with greater hatred than strength (the which yet
did surmount) for that their hearts being enraged one against the other
through long dissension: they did think that unto neither of them that should
be beaten from his ground or give back and retire, there would be left any
hope at all, either of pardon or Martial mercy. The Emperialles were wood
angrye that the black Almaynes, contemning and scorning the Emperors
Majesty, and despising the authority of the Almayne name, had come with
Mercenarye arms, for to besiege and assault their brethren and cousins, in
the behalf of the French men their ancient ennimies. On the other side, the
black Almaynes thought it most honorable to do most valiant service for
that King who had maintained them so many years by his liberal wages, to
keep the says of their oath, and in no case to admit ought that should be
unfitting for old soldiers. Neither in deed was there any man among them,
that was not fullye persuaded, that he ought in this doubtless last act of
life, and endeavor of warlyke work, revenge the injury of insulting fortune
with unwonted valor and honorable death. When the Esquadrons drew near one
unto the other, Longamentes, a very noble Captain of Auspurg, came forth
alone before the battallion of the black Almaynes, chalenging unto the combat
George Frondesberg and Mark Sitsch, by lifting up his hand, and with a loud
voice. But he being refused with a gastlye hemmyng, and withal stricken at
by many men at once, was soon slain, and a common soldier, as it were,
for a triumph* held up alofte his cut off hand with his bracelette and
ryngs, and then the Emperialles giving a great shoute ran forth
couragiouslye. But whylest that the two battallions made one toward the
other. Pescara was between them on horseback, but in a footemans armor,
often desiring Frondesberg to amend his pace, and rehersing the battles before
time, in whom his prowes had been seen, inkindled him to win a victory of
all other most noble and most worthy of memory. So when both battalions ran
together, and Pescara galloped his horse on the enemies, he was wounded in the
face (which was bare) and afterward his horse being slain under him, he was
also thrust through the left leg with a Pyke. In this terrible clashing
together of weapons, he had doutblesse been oppressed by the Pykes both of his
enemies and his friends, unless that now at this pynche* when he could
hardly wrestle out himself, first an horseman of his own household, and
afterward the petie Captains and Ensign bearers that were near at hand,
had not with much ado got him out and saved him. In the mean time,
Frondesberg and Sitch stretching out in length their battalions on both sides
with wonderful skill, for to enclose their enemies, received them as it were
into their bosom, and then streyghtway clasped together their wings,
compassing them in round, and five them all, who resisted very manfully and
constantlye, so that one regiment fighting with three, and therefore repugning
with unhappy valor, almost no man of the black regiment escaped. There
perished besides Longomantes, Richard de la Pole, surnamed ye white Rose,
son unto the Duke of Suffolk, who for his honorable birth being descended of
the blood royal of England, and his great skill in Martial affairs, had
been made Captain of the black regiment. Also Francis brother unto Anthony
Duke of Loraine, a young Gentleman of passing prowes, who being notorious for
his armor and crest, had requested a place in the foremost rank before all
other men, and also two Almaines, Earls of Hortumberg and Closfen, famous men
of war, and Theodoricke Sconberg knight brother unto Nicolas the Bishop of
Compagna, and one also of great fame for his honor of Ambassades, in which he
had been often sent, for the industry of his excellent wit. Thus whilst the
Switzers are put to flight in one quarter, and the Almaines slain in another:
almost at the very same time, the Kings battle is broken by the Harquebusiers
and the horsemen, to whom also came the Pykemen. But then every notable
Captain, and notorious horseman runs to defend and save the King. Many for
desire to do their last serui^e in the sight of the King, do forsake their
appointed places and wards. Now whiles that Salice his horse being slain
under him, does hardly retire unto the Switzers, he being laden with years and
armor is intercepted by the horsemen. But being yielded unto Gastaldo, Vsurtes
a Spaniard, envying that the horsemen should have the ransom and pryse of so
great a prisoner, did set his Harquebusse to his breast, and flue him. And also
Tremouille an old Captain that had won many noble victories, is also shot
through in two places, and slain. Moreover Galeazo Sanseuerino galloping his
horse this way and that way, with singular cunning, repelleth the enemies, and
fights valiantly: but at length being slain in the Kings sight, paid that
by honorable end of life which he owed unto the Kings great favor toward
him, and the fame of his noble name* When his horse fell down under him, he
calling unto William Lord Langey, a noble Gentleman, who endeavored to help
him in his fatal fall, said: Son, let me take my fortune, and run back
as fast as you can to defend the King: and if you do escape, friendly
reverence the memory of my name, and honorable end. It was a battle of all
other most deadlye and adverse for the horsemen, for the deadly bullets were
shot from all parts by the nymble Spaniardes, who were spread round about
them: and now they used not such small pieces as they had done a little
before, but greater, whom they called Arcubusses, with who^ they would stryke
through, not only a man of arms, but oftentimes two men and two horses at a
shot, so that the field being strewed over with the miserable lying along of
the noble horsemen, and the heaps of the dying horses, did both hinder the
valor of the horsemen, if that they would endeavor to break in with thick
troop: and also if that any man accounted his life dearer than his honor, he
could not cedily and speedily flee, for the heaps of the stayne that lay
every foot in his way like unto great rampires. In this cursed state William
Lord Boniuat the Admiral, after he had long galloped to and fro, endeavoring
by adhortation to stay the Switzers, and also the horsemen that were ready to
flee, seeing at length that the battle was doubtless lost, neither would he
either to be punished, or to live in ignomie, survive so great an overthrow,
whereof he him self was reported to be chiefest author, with grave and
obstinate shame ran into the mids of the enemies, and offering his throat
unto their weapons points, was slain there, as he ^^ade with open face after
the manner of the Captains that gallop to and fro, and command the soldiers
what is to be done. But when the king was bared almost of all the companies
that were appointed to guard his body, and so many had been slain round
about him, and the rest had scattered themselves abroad into all parts, he
labored to get himself out from his enemies: but certain horsemen of sundry
companies being mingled together, followed him, as one that was richlye
appointed and apparailed. Neither does the king forsake him self, although he
were forsaken by his horse and fortune, but turning his horse this way and
that, defends himself with his sword against the infulting Emperialles, and
both giving and taking wounds, does valiantly repugne. But while he stryueth
to go unto the next bridge which went over a small water course, his horse was
thrust in* and fell down. The first men that came unto him lying under his
horse, were Didaco de Abila, and John Orbieta, a Biscaian, they not well
knowing him, did shake their swords over him, and willed him to yield unless
that he had rather be slain. In the mean time came Monsieur de la Motte a
Frenchman, Lieutenaunte unto Burbon, who knew him by the face, although it
were fowly embrued all over with the gore blood of his wound. But when Motte
adhorted him to yield unto Burbon, who was not far off: the king chafing at
the name of the traitor, and speaking as though he commanded, said: Call me
hither Lanoy. Who in the mean time that Motte galloped unto Burbon, being
sought for in every place by the calling and running of the soldiers, came
timelye, and removing from the King the great company of them which stood
houering over him, and causing him to be pulled from under his horse, did reach
forth his hand, and helped him up. Abila pulled o^ his ga^^let, and they that
were next, his coat armor* the which they tore into pieces, other got his
gyrdle, and other his spurces, every man hasting to catch some thing of the
Kings, the which he might be able to show with not obscure credit, either for
his honor, or for to win reward^. After the King is taken, the Emperials in all
places cry, victory, victory. The French men's hearts quayle, they foully
flee in all parts of the field. The Switzers being fearful like sheep, run
into the river of Tesino, and being utterly unskillful of swimming, are
drowned by whole troops at once, but other of them casting down their
weapons, suppliantly desire life. But rare praise of humanity and mercy
appeared that day, but in those that were tired with much slaughter: for that
mighty victory made the soldiers proud and merciless. And Leua his
soldiers, who had sallied out late at the castle and new gate, of all other
raged most greedily and cruelly: for as they had not ^ene present at the
battle, so they opportunely issuing forth after the victory, met with the
afrighted and wounded, intercepting from them all hope of flight. Also the
Italian and French footmen, who we told you were left about the castle and the
camp, the king when he doubted of the victory, had sent for to come to his
aid, and Bussie de Ambon hasting into the battle, brought them with him, but
they lighted upon the Lansquenets, that had defeated the black Alma^nes, and
by them were defeated and put to flight, Ambou being slain. But the nearenesse
of the camp gave many space to escape: for the Lansquenets would not break
their array, to follow any man, but they stood in array of battle, even until ye
very last of ye fight, ready against al'cha^tes, because they are forbidden by a
^^uere and very noble law of ma^tial disciplins to go out of their array and
wards, i^ take any enemy prisoner, or to gather up ye spoils, the which other
men greedily catched. By reason where of it is well known, that almost never a
noble prisoner, and a very little of the spoil and pillage came unto the hands
of the Alma^nes, but as ye Spaniards by valiantly discoms^ting the horsemen,
and the Switzers, doubtless won the victory: so as it were by very good
right, they got and obtained the most precious pillage, and the noblest
prisoners. There were taken prisoners He^^e king of Navarre, and Renee the
vastard of Sauoy, the kings uncle, and great master of his house: who dyed not
long after among his enemies by an ague that grew upon him by reason of his
wound, and also Montmorencie, Brion, Bozzole, Obegn^, Floranges, who was
Captain of the Switzers. Fortune saved Francis of Burbon, Count of Saints
Poule, lying grievously wounded among them that were slain, when that a
Spaniards did cut off his finger as though he had been dead, that he might
have his ring. With contrary fortune Lescu^e whom none of the French nobility
did excel in strength of body. and valor of heart, being shot into the hyppe
with a great pellet, dyed of his hurt at Pauia, within ^yne days after. They
report that when as he lay sore grieved with his deadly wound, and the
Imperial Captains, and namely Guasto often visited him, he bitterly cursed
Boniuet, and his pestilent nature, and said moreduer, that he sought for him in
that unfortunate field* that he might revenge the public mischief with his
infestuous sword, for that he had through his perverse counsels brought so
great a foil and dishonor unto the French name, and namely unto the king, who
had nothing deserved it. There also perished the Counts de Tour^er, a noble
gentleman: and seigneur de Turnon, who had been General with Lesparre,
^^^tu^^^ brother, in the wars in Navarre, at the which time they aduance^ the
French ensigns even unto the river of Ebr^, the Spaniardes being then busied
with eiuill wars and tumultes. Turnons body could not be found. Only the
Duke of Alanson escaped away untouched* with a mighty troop of men of arnies,
that he might bring into France the (...) of ^o great an overthrow, who
p^rhaps would have ^^ne worthy of the singular praise of prudence* if that it
might have been thought that he had fled rather to save a company of valiant
men, for to succor France which was brought into great lack of good men of
war, than for to keep himself harmless, and get him out of danger, the
horsemen following him because he was their Captain. But Alanson dying within
few days after of great grief of mind, Roch de Main his Lieutena^t defended
ye fame of that return by an honorable testimony, which was: that he himself
(who was a lusty courageous Gentleman, and an approved man in martial skill)
did reduce the horsemen home full sore against the will of Alanson, thinking,
that seeing the victory was past all hope, that necessity was to be obeyed
Moreover, when Claramont that lay in the Isle, perceived that he could bring
no succor unto the lost battle, encouraging his soldiers not to be dismayde
with this cruel mishappe, but with confirmed and manly hearts, to follow the
Ensigns, to win safety, and not doubtful praise by constant return,
educed his soldiers in warrelike order, and passing over the river, and
cutting off the bridges after him, first came unto the town of Mortaria, and
afterward into France without any incommoditie. And the like did they that
besieged the Castle of Milan, for they suppressing the fame of the received
overthrow, and in the mean time spreading a false brute of victory, escaped
away safe with all their bag and baggage under the conduct of Theodor^ de
Triuulzi. But it is reported, that there were slain in the battle to the
number of ten thousand. And afterward the King to obtain liberty, renounced
for ever all his titles unto Naples, Milan, and Asti, and the superiority over
Artois, and Flaunders, and paid unto the Emperor twelve hundredth thousand
crounes. But three things I do think worthee to be added out of Iouius. The
first, that the king told the Marquis of Guasto, that he had thought
assuredlye to have died in the battle, but that angry fortune envied him an
honorable death, and reserved him life against his will, for to be a gasing
stock unto that scorning dame: the second, that the King being entered into
talk with the Imperial Captains about the event of this battle, affirmed,
that if the battle had been to fight again, he would not doubt to use the
same order that he had done before, as the very best, but that he was deceived
by the Switzers, who had shamefully deceived, not only his, but also all men's
opinion, and that he was couetously defrauded by the Italian Captains, who did
take wages for a great number m^ than they had in their bands. Finally that he
was to hastily forsaken by the third battle of the horsemen. And the third
thing that I note is, that all which he had written, and namely of this
battle, he had learned it by the report of the greatest Princes and Captains
themselves, whose great friendship and familiarity he had deserved and gotten,
that he might be able to write the truth in his hystories. But in that long
and hard study of honest labor, no man did more freely^ and cloquently
favor him, than Francis the French king, who told him all things with
marvelous order and upright truth of the success of the wars, and namely of
this battle, first at Marsiles, and afterward at Nizza, with his so great
admiration, that those things which were uncertain and obscure, he conferring
them with the testimonies of his enemies, found them to be most true and
plain.

The Battle of Nugas in Hungary, fought in Anno domini. 1526. between
Solomon the great Turk, and Jews the king of Hungary.
ANno domini. 1526. Jews the King of Hungary having intelligence that Solomon
the Turk was set forward from Constantinople with a myghtie power, to
invade Hungary, sent Legates in vain, unto all the Princes of Christendom
for aid, and summoned an armed parliament after their order, where the Bishops
brought the bands that they were bound by the tenure of their lands to find
scarce half full, and also less money than they ought. But the nobles of the
Temporaltie, as they that had forgotten the old discipline of war, and had
never seen the Camp of the Turkishe kings, but used to fight by incursions
inskirmishes, did of a certain arrogancy naturally ingrafted in their proud
hearts, so contemn the Turks, that they boasted that they would with a
small power overthrow and destroy in a pitched field, yea, a mighty army
of Turks. And among all other, Paul Tomorrey, a Friar, Archbishop of Tolosse,
who in roades had used often to skirmish, was carried with so great fierceness
of mind, and so great desire of hoped victory, that he made many sacred
sermons unto the soldiers to encourage them to fight, and promised that he
himself inflamed with religion, would break his in^estuous staff first
before all the Nobility, on the front of the Turkish battles. A little before
they had levied with the Popes money certain bands of Almaines and Bohemians,
with whose guard they thought that the battle of their horsemen might be
established, and the force of the Barbarians sustained. For neither, yea by a
very diligent muster could they find that there in their were army both of
horsemen and footmen five and twenty thousand soldiers: so that the
desperateness of Tomorrey, and the ras^^esse of the rest of the Captains that
requested the battle, was greatly condemned by the old soldiers, who said,
that it was most miserable to encounter with that enemy, who would bring
into the battle a power eight times greater than theirs. Wherefore some
thought it good, that the young King should be removed out of the imminent
danger. Stephan Verbet councelling in vain^, that for the public safety, the
person of the young king should be kept in the castle of Ofen, without the
hasarde of fight, for both the euentes of the battle. But the enraged
soldiers cried out against it, and said, they would not fight unless the
King led them. Then Tomorrey speaking his opinion, obte^ned that they should
fight out of hand, and the ^^^ble King under the defense of the great God,
should go ^^^th against the enemy to give the signal of the battle. So with
frantike fease and unlucky advise Jews marched even unto Nugass, which is a
small town almost middle way between Ofen and Belgrade. Now the Turkishe
auantgarde approached very near, when that the Christians consulted whither it
were best to keep them selves in their camp, environed round with wagons on
the bank of Tho^aw until that the power of John the Veruode or Leiutenant of
zipserland were come, who was reported to haste thither with great iourneyes.
But Tomorrey, who should obey the Veiwoode if he were come. by reason of the
dignity of his office, blaming all cause of stay that he might still retain
the government of the army for hope of victory and hasting headlong to his
fall, so withstoode this wholesome counsel, that he drought the unwary king
into a very unequal hazard of battill. For the Turk had sent four battles
of horsemen before, who by course di^iding between the^ the hours of the day
and night, should continually molest the Kings Camp on all sides. And they
besieged it so streightlye, that no man durst to go forth either for fuel or
forage, no nor unto the near bank of the river of Tho^aw to water his horse,
but that he fought with great danger, and disaduauntage, by reason of the
multitude of the Turks. Through the which necessity Tomorey was forced to
arrange his battayles, and to fight a pitched field for the ancient honor
of that Nation, before time invincible, and the dignitye of the Kings name. The
form of the battle, or the array, was almost single, that is to wit, the
bands of the footemenne were stretched forth in a long rank, and in
commodious places, the horsemen were interlaced, that the Barbarians
ouermatching in number, should not enclose the whole battle, and the
Hungarians be forced to fight almost in a ring. The Camp and tents being
entrenched with chayned wagons, were left on the right hand with a small
band to guarde them, and near unto the trenche had Tomorey placed not with
absurd counsel, a band of chosen horsemen, that the King might be defenced
by the^^ strong and ready guarde against all uncertain chances. But that
day, unlucky unto the Hungarian name, and ^^^ste unfortunate unto the King,
ouerthrewe this last wholesome deuyce, for at the very first encounter,
although the great ordinance of the Turks being lenesled to high, did no
hurt, yet were our battayles without any labor quite overthrown, namelye
Tamorey, and almost all the nobles of the Hungarians being slain, and the
Vsarones (which are the light horsemen of the Hungarians, being scattered and
put to flighte, and with them all the rest of the horsemen being foully
discomfited and slain. In this so great asperitie of fortune, when that a
troop of Turkishe horsemen had galloped to rifle the tents, and they were
hardlye defended by the guard that was placed in them, that band of chosen
horsemenne, the which (as I said before) should have been a guard unto the
King, could not conteyne themselves, but brake out upon the assaulting
Turks, that they might save the Camp. In the same moment of half an hour,
King Jews seeing all his power in all places beaten down, and also being
bared of them, whom he had hoped and prepared for his guard, did begin to
flee, but his headstrong horse turning on one side, did cast him into a
Marishe, where he was drowned. Then the Turk prosecuting the victory, took
Ofen, the chief City of Hungary, where he did no more harm, but only
took out of the castle three goodlye statues of brass, set up by the samous
King Marthie, and then returned to Constantinople, leaving Hungary to be
almost quite destroyed by civil dissension.

A Battle fought on the sea in Anno domini. 1528. at the Cape of Orso in the
kingdom of Naples between Vgo de Moncada, and other Imperialles, and
Philippine Doria, for the French King Frauncu the strf^.
THen the Lord Lautrech General for the French King had driven the acmie of
the Emperials out of the city of Rome which they had sacked into the City of
Naples, he sent for Philippine Doria Viceadmiral unto Andrew Doria, the French
Kings high Admiral in Italy, to besiege the city by sea. By whose coming
with viij. galle is, he thought al hope of victuals by water would be cut away:
and so much the rather, because the news was, that the Venetian fleet (their
confederates) of twenty galleys would shortly pass the Faro of Messina, to
annoy and keep the sea coast of the kingdom of Naples. The Imperial
Captains being moved with the report of these news, thought it for their
safety to fight with the Genowayes, before that the Venetians were passed the
Faro. The Emperials had only six galeyes, and two foystes, but trusting to
the valoor of their soldiers, and to four long boats of great ships,
whom they had fraught with Harquehusiers, and other small vessels, whom they
call Fragates, they nothing doubted to fight with the Genouese, for the flower
of all the Spanish soldiers was embarked with the marquis of Guasto, the
general of all the Italian and Spanish footeme^, who had gone aborde the
Admiral galley with Vgode Moncada the viceroy of Naples. For Dorbine ye master
of the camp had diligently chosen man by man the most valiant soldiers, and
those that had been accustomed unto the Spanishe seas, and among them the most
forward petie Captains and Ensign bearers, whom he knew could brook the
lothsomnesse and tossing of the sea. There also went aboorde Ascanirde Colonna,
the Lord high Constable of the kingdom of Naples, and many other noblemen of
their own free will, as doubting nothing of the victory. And least that the
Almaynes should give place in prowes unto the Spaniardes, about two hundredth
of them under the conduct of Conradine Glorne, had filled two galleys, and with
great cherefulnes rowed unto the Isle of Crapy, and there at a pleasant spring,
long and sumptuously banketted, yea and heard Barecta a Portugal, (who had
built him a Cottage or Cell in those solitary rocks) preach unto the^, he
vehemently adhorted the^ to use their ancient valor, and being mindeful of the
piety that they ought to bear toward their country, to revenge those cruel
Geneuoyes, and by valiant victory to deliver out of miserable and infamous
bondage so many valiant Spaniardes whom the merciless Genoueyes kept tied
with chains for galley slaves, afflicting them with continual stripes and
reproaches. While that Barecta preached in this manner both long and hotely,
Biardo Agnesi, a Neapolitan, not so much addicted unto the French faction, as
offended with the arrogancy of the Spaniardes, took a small swifte Boat, and
flewe unto Doria, giving him intelligence of the number, furniture, and
Captains of the Imperial fleet. Nor long after the Emperial navy departing
from the Isle, with many flagges hanged cut, came into sight of Doria, who was
then about a small furlong called by the Mariners the Cape of the Bear, or
Orso, not far from the famous promontorie now called Campanella, and in
ancient time Atheneus. This brave show of the enemies their fleet seemed not a
little to have moved the Geneuoyes at the first sight, but anon after the
skillful sea men did centemne them, and not fondly, because they had not
according to the discipline of the sea, places on the tops of their Mastes for
men to stand in and fight. But then Philippino assembling together all the
Captains and Masters in the Admiral galley, spoke almost these words unto
them, showing with his finger the fleet of his enemies coming toward them:
Valiant fellows (said he) and good countrymen of invincible prowes, a great
honor is set before us (as I see) by almost a certain victory, sith that we
do surpass in number of galleyes, and all Martial furniture, yea and courage
of heart and skill in sea fight. Let our enemies in Gods name be, as they do
boaste of themselves, noble warriors by land, doubtless they will not be
able in conflicte by sea, either readily to trauerse their ground, or yet to
cast themselves into rings, seeing that they shall fight among the benches of
the row slaves, and on the straight hatches, and must receive the pellets of
the Gunnes, as chance shall bring them, no place being left either to retire,
or to leap aside, namely the great number of the rowers empeaching them: So
that they lying open unto strokes, and being terrified with their danger, will
not be in any wise able either to stand stoutly, or to change their place
politikely. Therefore seeing that we must not once think of retiring back,
and least we do incur dishonor, must needs fight with our offered enemies:
persuade your selves that the glory of our ancestors gotten by so many
prosperous conflictes by sea, is reposed in your valiant hands and skill. This
glory (as I think) ought every good Citizen, not only to conserve, but also
to augment, least that otherwise we may be thought both of our fellows, and
also of our enemies to be degenerates, and men forgetful of our discipline.
But think that Andrew Doria our Admiral is present, and will be a witness of
prowes and cowardice, for to give rewards unto the valiant, or by equal right,
ignomie unto the cowardes. The Captains and Masters gave such a shoute as the
cherefull and greedy of fight do use, and in few words setting order how to
receive and invade the enemy, returned unto their galleyes, that they might
aptly make ready all things which should be needful for the instant fight.
The sum of their speedy decree was this: that Philippino should directly go
against the enemy with his five galleyes, but Nicolas Lomellino rowing into
the main sea with his three galleys, should fetch a compass about, and after
the conflicte was begone, in commodious time, courageously run upon the deckes
and sides of the enemies their gallyes, and chiefly of the Admiral, Philippino
launching forth from the forelande into the open sea, offered himself unto the
conflict, neither did Vgo refuse it, and the rather for that he believed, that
these three galleys of Lomellino, whom we spoke of, had fled away for fear,
and did think that the five of Philippino should fight with him much
ouermatched. When they drew near, and both the Admiral galleyes directed
their stemmes for mutual encounter, Guasto with wholesome counsel adhorted Vgo
to hasten first to shoot off his great gunne called a Basilisco, that the
thick smoke thereof might take away from the enemy all certain stroke. But
Vgo (who would be accounted very skillful in sea affairs, and a little before
had gainesayd at the Isle of Crapi all the old masters of the galleys, who
dissuaded the fight, vpbrayding them with cowardice) deferred so long to
shoot, that Philippino being very diligently intentive therefore, and aptly
leuelling the first shot of his Basilisco with piercing the Imperial
Admiral, passed from the stem to the deck, slaying thirty men, and among
them Peter of Cardonna, a kinseman of Guasto, and Leo Tassino, one borne in
Forrara, who had slain upon a quarrel between Guasto and the Duke of
Potenza, the Duke his son, a gentleman of great hope, and Gusman a spaniarde,
a gentleman that played very excellently on the Cithron. But the Basilisco of
the Imperial Admiral did no great harm unto the Genoueys, because that the
Gunner could not see how to shoot right for the smoke of the Genoway piece,
and also the Geneuoys lay not so open as did the Spaniardes, upon the open
hatches, but being defended with a sure netting made of strong boordes, shot
with Harquebusses a crook out of loope holes, they themselves being safely
covered. But in the mean time three of the Imperial galleyes, of whom one
was called the Gibba, the master whereof was Justinian a Genoway, but the
Captain of the soldiers, was Caesar Faramusca, the other two, the Secamia,
and the Villamarina, so called of their valiant masters Secamo and
Villamarino, run upon two of Doria his galleys, named the Pilgrim and the
Handmaide, and fight very vehemently, and the hardy Spanishe soldiers leap
into them, when Lomellino saw this, he timelye turned his course, and at one
time his three galleys, discharged their three Basiliscoes upon the Imperial
Admiral. The Moore hitting the deck, struck off the rudder. The Neptune
slaying certain of the galley flaues, did so shake the Maste, that the sails
yards fell down, and oppressed many with the fall, and among them Hierome of
Trani, who had succeeded his father Antonello in the office of Master of the
ordinance unto the Emperor. Finallye the Mistres brake of the Imperial beak,
and sore annoyed the stem. Neither stayed they, but speedily rowed for to
aid the Pilgrim, and the Handmaide, that were now bourded. Then the Moore
turning about her self very artificially, discharged such a tempest of small
and mean shot, which fell as thick as hayle upon the Gibba, that she was
brought into great danger. For besides the slaves and the Mariners, and
soldiers foully slain, Caesar Feramusca was also borne over the boorde dead
with a shot of a small Falcon, and Justinian the Master was shot into the
thigh, and Baredo a Captain of an hundredth Harquebusiers, was hurt with three
deadly wounds. In another quarter two Imperial galleys called the Perpenniana
and the Oriana encountered with the Mermayde and the Fortune, whom when they had
much endammaged and almost bourded, they seeing the discomsiture of their
fellows, left and fled away in safety: for they despayring of the victory,
because they saw the baner of the Admiral thrown down, and the Secamia and the
Villamarina circumuented, and the Pilgrim and the Handmayde whom they had
bourded, recovered, and the small fleet of long Boats and Foystes scattered,
had chosen rather to save themselves for the Emperor, than with the rest to
fall into the same mischaunce of adverse fortune: although that this counsel,
as to soon put into practice was blamed of many. Incontinently after the
flight of these two galleyes, the victory was granted unto Philippino: for
Vgo being slain with a small Falcon, Guasto being grievously burnt with wild
fire in the neck near unto the care, and also his helmet sore battered to his
head by stones, and other things thrown down from the tops, and Ascanio de
Colonna being wounded in the right hand, and in one of his feet, yielded
themselves unto Lomellino. In the winning of this victory the galley slaves of
the Moares and Turks stood Philippino in great stead. For when Philippino
had promised them liberty, and had taken off their chains, and weaponed them,
and adhorted them as the fierce enemies of the Spaniardes, and namely of Hugo
to fight lustily: they courageously leaped unarmed into the enemies galleys,
armed only with sword and target, fighting very fiereely. On the Empertall
side were lost about seven hundredth old soldiers Spaniardes, besides so many
Mariners and slaves, but Philippino the victor lost of all sorts five
hundredth, and among them diverse skillful Mariners, but no master of any galley,
but only one Of the Emperials, two galleyes, one Foyst, one Brigantine, and
certain long Boats were drowned, two fled away, and the two other were
taken, and one of them was the Admiral. Of the Emperials were slain besides
Vgo, and Feramusca, the stoutest Captains of bands, Macinio, Daia, John
Biscaine, Zambron, and Bar^d: But there was taken alive besides Guasto, and
Ascanio de Colonna, Francis Hirarde the master of a galley, the brother of the
Captain of the Castle of Naples, who, had the brawne of his fat buttocks
stroke off with a piece of ordinance, Philip Cerbellion, John de Gaietta,
Monsieur de Verreis a Flemming, Monsieur de Acogne a Frenchman, who had fled
cut of France with the Duke of Burbon, and Sereny a Spaniarde, Scribe unto the
Senate of Naples, and worthy knights Camillo de Colonna, and Aniball de
Geuari. The rest of the petie captains, Ensign bearers, and soldiers, that
were not maimed with wounds, were incontinently put in chains, and turned to
the Oar, in the place of the rowing slaves that had been slain in the fight,
and the Turks and Moors that for their valiant service were made free. Not
only no profit, but great inco^moditie fell unto the Frenchmen by this
victory. For when Francis the French K. requested of Andrew doria to have yt
noble men taken in this battle, to be delivered unto him, Andrewe revolted
unto the Emperor, and carried all Genoa with him, the which has continued ever
since faithful unto the Emperor and his house. And also a great mortality
rising in the French Camp, the power was utterly defeated by the Emperials.

Of the Battle of Landriano in the Duchy of Milan, fought Anno domini. 1529.
between Antonio de Leua general for Charles the Emperor, and Francis of
Burbon, Conte of S. Poule, general for Francis the French King,
THe Conte S. Poule, and the Duke of Vrbine Generals for the French king, and
the Seignorie of Venice, after that they had won Pauia, for the behoof of
Francis Forza, now oppressed by the Emperor, understanding that Antonie de
Leua the Imperial Captain had a great power of soldiers in the city of
Milan, the which they had meante to have besieged, thought it best to besiege
it far off after this manner: That Vrbine should go back unto Cassiano, upon
Adda, and suffer nothing to be brought into the City out of the most fertile
Country of Martia, but in another quarter S. Poule should lie at Abiato, and
cut off all victuals that might be brought unto Milan by an arm of the river
of Tesino. For they did hope, yt their enemies which could not be subdued by
force, would not be able to abide the incommodities of a long siege. This
being determined at a village called Landriano, ten miles from Milan, Vrbine
dislodging, marched unto Cassiano, admonishing S. Poule with equal digress to
bend his journey to Abbiato. But the day being well spent, S. Poule said,
that he would not remove that day, but would go the next morrow unto Pauia,
and leave there certain great ordinance, and other weighty cariages. But Leua
who most diligently watched for all occasion to hurt his enemies, understanding
that Vrbine was departed from S. Poule, and coniecturing that the French men
would not speedily set forward, called together all the Captains, and
commanded them to be in a readiness with all their soldiers, to go forth
with him about one of the clock in the morning, cohorting them to go this
journey chearefully, and promised to give them for a booty the vanquished
French men before the sun arose. But if (said he) they do more hastily flee
(as surely I do not think but they will) yet the tail of them will fall unto
us for an assured booty. The soldiers crying out, answered, that he should
proceed to conceive in his mighty mind, valiant acts, correspondent to his
former victories: for they would with cheerful and fearelesse hearts take
upon them this dangerous journey, and doubtful hasarde that he had commanded
them. And without stay he putting on his glittering armor, (although he were
tormented with the pain of the gout almost in every joint) sent the horsemen
before, and he himself with two battles on each side, the Almaines on the one
side, and on the other the Spaniardes flanking the Italians that were appointel
to the guard of the great ordinance, hasted to the enemies, whom he found not
yet removed, and busied about dispatching away of their baggage. S. Poule who
had thought nothing less than that Leua would come upon him, with all his
power aranged in battle when he was preparing to dislodge: seeing (the sun
was now risen) the battles of his enemies with shirtes over their armor,
after the manner of them that give a Camisado in the night, was astomed, and as
it does commonly happen unto those that are so caught unawares, was attached
with great fear, and not without cause: namely, for that he had commanded the
Conte Guido de Rangoni to go before with the auantgarde unto Pauia, and there
to provide lodging for him and the rest of the army. Thus he being unprepared,
and unready, and also disioyned far from the forewarde, was circumuented
with so great perturbation of the middle battle and rerewarde, that he was
forced with wonderful uproar, and tumultuously to set his men in array, and in
vain to repugne, being quite put out of heart by the violence and celeritie of
his urging enemy. Fortune also gave Leua space to win the victory by an
unlooked for chance. For when one of the great pieces had broken his wheel,
and fallen in the mids of a dirtie way, it was a great discommoditie unto
them, for the French horsemen, yea, and the best of them were lighted on foot
to lift up and amend it. For by an old usage of theirs, they do accounte it
a great dishonor to leave any of their ordinance behind them as they march,
to be gotten by the enemy. Through this staying both Rangoni was gotten so
far before, that he could neither be called back, nor in time told of the
sudden coming of the enemy: and also Leua had time to bring forward his
footmen, who being advanced forth, and the horsemen fighting very
courageously, the middle battle of the Conte S. Poule with whom the rerewarde
had also joined, began in a moment of time both to turn their backs. When
that Antonie de Leua cladde in glysteting armor, and adorned with a brave
crest, commands him self to be brought into the forefront borne ^y force of
me no^ with terrible voice adhorteth his soldiers, and terrifieth the French
men with his fierce look and fiery eyes. In the mean time the Almaines that
served the French king (a thing which had almost never happened at other times,
shamefully turned their backs, as they that were of the omnigatherum, that had
in former time served the French King, or else had been taken up in the region
which is on this side the Rhein, and does abutte upon L^r^i^^, who have no
great estination for Almaine valor and discipline. The Almeynes and the French
footmen, and after them also the Italian bands followed without any care had
of dishonor, and small was the slaughter, because that neither the
harquebusiers could shoot among the confounded and blended ranks, nor the
great ordinance be discharged without equal peril. The Conte S. Poule
assaying daungerously to take a dich with his horse, was taken by the horsemen,
nor far from him the valiant Claude de Rangoni, the Captain of the rerewarde
had the like luck, but S^^phan de Colonna escaped, although he had been cast
by his horse headlong into a diche. Leua having gotten all the Ensigns and
ordinance, and taken the General prisoner, wanne great estimation in the
world. But the French men openly complained of Guido de Rangoni, whom they
said had left them to the spoil through his over hasty pasting: but Guido
defended his honor by alleging the commandment of his General: chalenging
all his obtrectors to the combat, But afterward in familiar talk^, the Duke of
Vrbine decided this controversy (both Leua and the Marquis of Guasto assenting
unto him) who gave judgment, that they had both with almost equal error
swarued from the discipline of war, the which does will that in marching, the
Captains that lead distict and several bands, do with mutual diligence,
by horsemen ryding to and fro, measure the march, nor suffer the Ensigns to go
any thing out of sight: ye auantgard to observe with what pace the middle
battle marches, and so likewise the middle battle the rerewarde, that
every battle may^ be readis at hand for all sodeyne incursions of the
enemy, and to succor that battle which is circumuented: and finally to
sight with all their power vuited into one. This victory utterly destroyed the
French power in Milan, and made Francis Sfuza whom the French King maintained,
to come in, and suppliantly yield himself unto the Emperor.

The Battle of Frumentaria fought on the sea by Rodoricke Portundo, Admiral
unto Charles the fifth, and Aidin, and other miscreant Pirates, in Anno Domini.
1529.
AFter that Rhedoricke Portundo had brought Charles the Emperor out of Spain
into Italy to be crowned. He in his return, hearing that fifteen vessels of
the Turks and Moors Corsale^ were before the Isle of Erumentara, came into
great hope to oppress them. Wherefore of his fifteen galleyes, he chose out
eight of the strongest, and furnished them with the rowers and soldiers of the
rest of his galloys, and obtained of the Captain of the Isle of Ibiza about a
hundred and fifty valiant soldiers, whom he bestowed in his galleys.
Portundo being thus angmented and strengthened, was fully resolved to sight
with the Barbarians, and setting all things in a readiness, departed about the
third watch from Ibiza, and made toward Frumentara, which was ten miles off.
The Barbarians seeing galleys coming, speedily got them aboorde, and prepared
to sight. But when it waxed light, John, Portundo his son numbered the navy
of his enemies, and therefore admonished his father not hastily to sight being
ouermatched i^^ number. Portundo vehemently and bitterlye reviled him as a
cowarde, and that so insolently, that he swore he was not his son, who feared
his enemies, who were furnished only with Foystes and Brigantines, so that, yea
he himself alone would with his only Admiral galley drown all those small
vessels of the Barbarians. Portundo was in deed a man of a noble and stout
courage, but very lostie and proud: and so through vain boasting being made
obstinate, wilful, and untameable, no consideration either of assured or very
hard dannger, nor any horrible show of present peril presented could fear
him. Then his son (who was both of surpassing prowes, and also prudence)
replied: God grant (father) ye we may rather be ashamed of our conceived
fear, than sorrowful for our foil. But Portundo made such baste toward the
enemy, that he was far before the rest of the galleys who were not able to
row so fast, and looking back, commanded the slaves in his Admiral to cease
rowing, that the rest might overtake him, and they were called unto both by
voice and whistle, to make have, that they might make front with the Admiral.
Aidin of Smirna the Archpyrate, who was surnamed Cocciadiab^l^, seeing the
unequal course of his enemies, and that one coming behind another, they
could not make front with the Admiral, calling together the soldiers and
masters, with speedy deliberation resolved upon this counsel, that the
stronger Foystes should run directlye upon their enemies with their stemmes,
but the smaller should every two on both sides lay aboorde one of their
enemies galleys. Friendly fortune favored the Pirates, but was a cruel foe to
the christians. For Assanes, Celebine, and Solomon, the most desperate and
fiercest fighters of the Pirates, at one time ran upon the Admiral, one on
the side, and the other on the stem, and before that succor could come, sieve
Portundo with all the soldiers, and took the Idmirall galley, so that
suddenly the banner was thrown down, the which did much diminishe the courage
of the rest, and with the like speed did Aidin himself lay aboorde the Cock,
the Captain whereof was John Canticler, who was slain, with all his men. In
the same moment of time, an other Pirate called Salec, valiantly setting upon
the galley of Derthosa, the Captain whereof was John de Ciueres, and also the
next thereunto, wherein was John, Portundo his son, took them both, Ciueres
being slain, and John taken, and all the soldiers slain. In the same moment
of half an hour, Mathewe Sances was slain by Saba a Pyrate, and his galley
taken. But Naggali. did so hotely pursue the hindermoste of the Spanishe
galleyes that fled, that one, wherein was Martine Oriego, he lost, but the
other wherein was John de Cordoua, he forced to run hirselfe upon the rocken:
the galley was taken, with the captain, who would not flee away after so
foute an overthrow, but all the rest fled out of her, but were so fiercelye
followed by the Pirates (who also went a short) that many mot were taken than
escayed.

The Battle of Gabiniano, sought betvveene Philibert Prince of Orange general
for the Emperor Charles the v. and Fer^^i^ a Captain of the Flor^^tines, in
Anno. 1530.
AVno domini. 1530. the Florentines being streightlye besieged by the power of
Charles the Emperor whose general was Philiber^ Prince of Orange, for
banishing the family of the Medres, sent for a Captain of theirs called
Fernaio, who had gotten great glory of late for the valiant recovery of the
city of Vo^^e^ra from the Emperials* and also for no less famous defending
thereof against them, that he with his power assaulling the Emper^alles without
on one for and the garrison of the City sallying out on the other, some
fortunate sight might be committed, to deliver their country from the imminent
peril of sack and servitude. Fernaio accordingly gathered his power together,
which was three thousand footmen, and of armed horsemen and Epyrotes, or
Albanoises unarmed, fine hundredth the Captain of the Epyrotes was Nic^tas
Masio, surnamed Pulled^^. But of the other horsemen Charles earl of Ciuitella,
and Amico Arsula. Besides this power, he had also solicited the Mountain men
about P^st^ia, of the Cancellariel action, who as they had promised, were
looked for to be press to join with their countriemen, (...) they matched
that way. He had also laid on Sumpter horses above an hundredth stunkes of
wild fire, and also ten pieces called. Moschattes, the which being laid upon
re^^es of ^oods, are commonly used to be a guard in sai^^^ she for the footem^n
against the violence of the horsemen. Which this power and furniture, and a
^er^^tue prouisson of victuals, and specially of Bishes, as much as might
suffice the soldiers, hasting through the woods and mountains (if that they
could find none other victualles among those poor mountain men) he did set
forth from Pista, and fu^uing toward certain of the Captains, spoke these
words: (My valiant hearts) we are commanded to go, neither must any
in^^^nant violence of danger he seared, seeing that we must in any case obey
the Senate, who do maintain and find us, and does repose the hope of their
supreme safety in our noble valiance* He seemed unto some not to have spoken
with his wonted chearefulnesss, as though he did abode how vnluckilye he
should fight in a voyage that he made at other men's appointment and pleasure.
In the mean time the prince of Orange having intelligence by spies, of the
intent and journey of his enemies, wrote unto Fabric^o Maramaldo, and Alexander
Vitelli, (who lay with their regiments in the territory of Pis^) that with
all possible speed they should haste to cut off Fernaio his journey, and
follow him at the hard heels. There also followed Vitelli, a hand of
Spaniardes, who being put out of wages by the Emperors commandment lived by
robbery, them did Vitelli abhort to do some good service in this voyage,
whereby they might deserve pardon of their mutiny, and be interteyned again
into wages. The Prince also sent before out of the Camp, R^scio the Earl of
S^n second^, Marito de Colomia, and Sculengo with their regiment^^, and also
adjoined Theodore Bischeimi^, the Captain of the Epyrote horsemen, unto Rasci^
his wing of horsemen. After them sold wed a regiment of old Lansquenets, and
also he himself with all the light horsemen, and also the men of arms
marching toward Pistoia He traualling all night ^a^ue unto a place called
Lagoni, almost and way between Pist^ia, and a town named Gabiniano, where he
stayed to refreshe the horsen with a little rest, and the soldiers with a
light breakefast. While that he thus rested, there came a priest unto him
running, who told that Ferna^^ was at hand, and had entered, sacked, and burnt
the town of S. Marcelles, out of she which he had bardly escaped: and
moreover, that the Emperials were at the heels of them, the which was known
by the often crackes of the harquebusses. Then the Prince commanded Francis de
Pratey, and Rossales Spaniardes, and zucers an Epirote, to go before with all
the light horsemen, to whom he added for a guard Pompeio Farino, with three
hundred harquebusiers, and admonished them that still as they went, wheresoever
they found the way narrow, so that the horses could not well pass, that
they should place upon commedious hills certain bands of Harquebusters, for
this purpose, that if the horsemen after they were come into the sight of their
enemies, chanced to be pressed, then they might retire fayze and foftlye unto
those sure gardes: but if that they met with any level ground, the which
they saw was commodious for horsemen, they should stay the enemy so long by
flow skirmishing, until that he were come with the men of arms. When the
horsemen were come unto Gabiniano, and could not be suffered to enter the
town, they turning about, rode under the wall of the town toward S.
Marcelles, and began to skirmish with the aua^tecurrers of the enemy. For
Fernaio was minded to come unto Gabiniano, thinking that his enemies would not
have met him with so great speed. Yet there had been some, who being
skillfull of the country, and having received more certain intelligence of the
coming of their enemies, had counsayled him to climb the high mountains
besides Saint Marcelles, and so safely come down again at Scarparia, the
enemies not being able to pursue him in that very strayte and troublesome way.
To the which advise inclined the valiant. Captain Pa^lo de Cere, who accounted
the loss of the baggage but small, so that escaping their enemies, they might
come in safety to Florence. But Farnai^ with a lofty mind detesting that
advise whith might give some sign of fear and flight, marched still forward,
the horsemen going before with their Captains, Charles the Earl of Ciuirilla,
and Arsiolas. And whereas Gabin^ano is two miles from S. M^railler* the
auant^arde which ^arnarde Strozzi, surn^^^d Cap^^unzo, led, was come unto the
gate of Gabini^no, when the and Ensigns of the re^einarde were yet at Saint
M'arcelles gate. The way is not very ill, but that they must go a little down
the hill, for Saint Marcellea, which stands in a low bottom enclosed counde
about with mountains. Now the Emperials, who as we have elphe you, were sents
before, molested the hindermost of the enemies. For Refe^^ had brought a band
of Harquebusiers with him, euerys horseman taking an harquebuster behind him,
who with their shot much vexed the enemies. But when Maramaldo saw that the
enemies bended toward Gabiniano from Camalenbo, where they lodged the might
before, be crossing over the mountains and woods, was come to Gabiniano. And
also Vitelli by another shorter way, but very ill, was encamped not far
from the town. In the mean time Fernaio tyding on a white horse with his
sword drawn, adhorted his men keeping their array, to haste to take the town
first, the which was then in sight, and to propell the urging borsemen of
their enemies, for the Earl of Ciuitella and Atsula fighting with singular
valor, did not only sustain their enemies, but also the charge, being on both
sides often renewed along the sheluing banks, forced their enemies to retire
with turned backs. While, that they thus sought with great tumult and noise,
for that certain bands of Harquebusiers had been sent forth out of Fernaio
his battle, and also the shot of, Pompey: (who as we have showed you) had
been sent to be a guard unto the horsemen, had intermedled themselves in the
conflicte of the horsemen, and now many men had been slain on hoth sides,
when Maramaldo got into the town at the farther gate, and at a part of the wall
which was easilye thrown down at the very same time that Fernaio entered in
at the foregate. Ind thus a cruel and bloody fight was committed along the
town, so that they fought with great contention in the mids of the Market
place: for Fernaio leaping off from his horse, and taking a footemans Pyke,
laid about him lustilye. Neither failed Maramaldo unto his men, but casting
them into the form of a wedge, fought fiercely to win the whole street. In
the mean tune, part of Fernaio his battle following their Captain, fought
valiantly in the town, but part defleeting along the town wall, and having
gotten a commodious place among the Chestnut trees to defend themselves
against the insulting horsemen, overwhelmed their enemies with a great tempest
of small shatte. By them (as it was afterward known) who were in number
almost five hundredth, was the Prince of Orange slain, when he hastred with the
men of arms to be present at the fight. Neither was he straight way known
being speedily spoiled of his coat of cloth of silver, and his guilte armor.
They say that before he was wounded, he fought or horseback, hand to band
with Nicolas Masio the Greek, who battered his head piece with a Mall of
pron, and Orange often assayed to thruste him through with his sword. But
Masio fearing the shocke of the men of arms, fled back unto the Chestnut
trees, but the Prince, pressing forth over hardily, received two deadlye
wounds by barquebusse. Almost at the very same time Vitelli charging
ouerthwarte the rerewarde, which Paolo de Cere led, did so break their
array, and scatter them almost at the first encounter, that he got all
their ensigns: although that Paul himself valiantly resisted; and lighting
on foot, repaired the array of his men, and also renewing the fight, brake
through unto the town to aid Fernaio. But when it was bruted abroad that
the Prince was stayne, and the troop of the men of arms (a thing shameful
to see, and incredible to he reported) was fled back headlong: Fernaio
crying victory, victory, gathered the Florentines close together, and began
to press on the appalled Emperialles. And if that the Lansquenettes (who had
not yet stirred, but kept in array not far from the town their Esquadron, as
it were a Castle to receive their fellows) marching forward, had not
repressed the tumultuous procursions of their enemies: doubtless not one of
the horsemen had made courtesy to flee, seeing that many of them, and before
all other Rossales following the example of Chiscera the captain of the men of
arms, fled with continued course even unto the gates of Pistoia, with so
great perturbation, that the same that the Prince was flayne, and his army
discomfited, was brought unto Gonzaga, who lay in siege before Florence, and
also unto the Consalioner within the City. At the very same moment of time,
Vitelli pursuing a while, and urging and slaying the regiment of Bail^ de Cere,
as he entered the town, did tymely hit upon the gate where Maramaldo had
entered, and then such a cruel fight was remed, that one could scarce pass
along the street for the heaps of slain men. But Fernaio and Paul being
tired with long fight, and the scorching heat of the mids of the day, took a
high h^^se, and from thence pelied the Emperials with harque^usses, until that
all their horsemen were overthrown, and destroyed by the light horsemen of
their enemies, who for shame would not follow Rossales when he fled, but
did cast themselves into thick troops, and a little before the bands which
either could not enter the town, or which had remained without by Fernaio his
commandment, and had slain Orange, using such Malles of iron, as the helmets
could scarce resist, had been overthrown: neither did the prepared trunkes of
wild fire do any great good that day. For the Florentines could cast but
few of them upon the Almaines and horsemen, neither because their baggage was
spoiled, and their Sumpter horses put quite our of order, could, the Moschats
be made ready, and laid on their restes, as they had trusted and hoped to
have done. Then Fernaio and Paul acknowledging the event of adverse fight, and
fortune insestuous unto the Florentine name, all their soldiers being either
slain or taken, and all the houses of the town won and sarked, and
Maramaldo having now gotten assured victory, yielded themselves, and
incontinently Fernaio was brought armed as he was, unto Maramaldo, who said
unto him: when that thou did Iewdlye hang up my Drummre with an halter,
against the law of arms, had thou thought ever to have come into my hands?
Then answered Fernaio: this is the chance of Mar^, who is not always
wrongful, and the like may also befall unto to you, strung in the field. But
if th^^ you murder me, you shall wind by my death, myther profitable, nor
honorable praise. But Maramaldo reuiling and calling him a Captain made of a
Mer^^a^t, com^^^aunded his helmet and his armor to be pulled of, and thrusting
his s^oorde into his throat, left him unto the soldiers to be stain. But
afterward Maramaldo used to say, that he slew him not for any private
quarrel, but to please the soldiers, and namely the Almaines, who would
have chafed that the Captain of their enemies should have bens saved, after
that their so great a General was slain. There were slain in this conflict
on both sides, little lack of (...) M. For many died afterward of their
wounds. And of the Florentines, Captain de Borgo, and Francis, and Paul
Corsi, Charles Carle of Ciuicell^, and Alph^ns Stipician^, And of prisoners
taken Paul de Core, Amico Arsula, Masi^, and Captiuanz^ Strozzi. But there
were stayne of Maramaldo his regiment, John Mai^ his valiamitest Captain, and
three Enfigne bearers. Anont after this victory, the despayring Fl^^^^e^nes
yielded their almost starued City, and whole oppressed state unto the mercy
of the Emperor, who deprived them of their liberty, and created Alexander de
Medies, base son of young Laur^nco do Medici, Duke of El^rnce, and of all the
domini^us theceof

The Battle of Exech, fought in Hungary between Cazzianer General for King
Ferdinande, and Maho^ut Lieutenant for S^lyman the Turk, in anno 1537. Out of
Iouius.
ANn^. 1537. Ferdinande the Emperor sent Cazzianer the Captain of Vienna into
Hungary, with a power of ten thousand horsemen of Almaines, Hungarians,
Bohemians, and Carinthians, and sirtene thousand footmen Almaines and
I^alians, to win the town of Exech upon the river of Draw, which Mabomet
lahia^gles the Turkishe Captain of B^lgrade, and Lieutenam general of all
^^^se patten, has fortifies in a part of Hungaris called Prossega, and made it
to be the feate of his wars, to vex the kingdom of Hungary. But before
that this arinie could come unto Exech, the sixtene thousand footemenne were
brought throught sickei^sse unto eight thousand, and the rest were also much
weakened with diseases, the which inconunoditie was also smut ^asucably
augmented through lack of victualles: so that they were not so senne come
before the town (wherein was Mahomet with fixtens thousand men) but that they
were forced to break up their siege, and to retire hark unto a cowne called
Car^, the Tickes pursuing, and continuallye skiclasshing with them, in which
skirmishes they slew Peter Raschinius the Marshall of the ^^hemians, and Baule
B^^chitius the Captain of the Hungarians, one accounted the valiantest and
most expect Captain of that nation. And the Christians hearing by certain
r^^^ors that Mahomet looked for ^ewe and strong supplies of s^uldiours: the
Christians tarefully deereed, that all the whole army should haste unto a
town called Walpons ten miles of, where was stor^ of victoals, leaning behind
them their great ordinance which could not be easily, carried, and setting on
fire all their gunpouder, and destroying all the rest of the Martial furniture
of the army, and all such baggage as could not be carried on horseback and
that Cazzianer should give the signal when they should dislodge, with a
kind of Pype that the Almaynes use, and is called by them Schalmeyen. Now was
the time of the second watch almost spent, and all men watching, did so
expect with hofull hearts the signal of dislodging, that they thought every
little moment of tariance to be a year, and very incomdious: and diverse
Captains of great mark by frantic instinct, brake off all stay* and hasted
to depart without commandment, and to go before their fellows. They say that
this heinous and shameful departure was begun by the light horsemen or
Vsar^nes of the Hungarians, who trusting to their knowledge in the blind ways
and woods, ^ent their course toward Valponi, whom Ladislaw More, a noble
man of Hungary following with dishonorable example, fled unto his own castle
of Zeuthuerzebeth, and also all the horsemen of Staermarke forgetting shame,
with great tumult hasted after with their Captain John Hunganolt, who had been
appointed to lead and defend the rerewarde. In the mean time it was
fearefullye reported unto Cazzianer, that the Vsarones were fled, and that
Ladislawe, and Hunganolt had done the same with the horsemen of Staermark, and
that the rest of the army never a whit expecting the sounding of the Schalmeyn
(as it had been decreed) made themselves ready for the same flight. Then the
astonned and afrighted General, got him to horse, and forgetting to give the
signal (for he had surely thought (as he said afterward) that all the army
had been already gone before) fled away unarmed, leaving behind his tent rich
of filuer, plate, and other ornaments. In this hurly hurly the Carle of Lodron
Colonel of the Lansquenets, is waked out of his sleep, and being told by his
servants that the General was run away, he fearelesse answered, that it
could not be that he would so shamefully and falsely forsake them, and so as
one grievously tired with watching many nights, and great toil taken in the
days, he returning into his tent, and laid him down again to sleep. Nor
long after the noise and uproar in the Christians their camp, is brought unto
the ears of Mahomet, who lodged within the shot of a small piece of ordinance,
all the Barbarians rise up, and prepare themselves to invade their enemies. But
Mahomet thinking it good to know more certainly what the enemies intended, and
for that consideration the day light was to be stayed for, commanded his men
to stand still in a readiness, and with silence to expecte the signal which
the use was to be given throughout all the ranks, by the soft sounding of a
drum on horseback. For the old Captain, yea, and an old man in deed, who
had hene practiced in many conflictes against our men, somewhat doubting it to
be a feygned flighte, would not be drawn into fight, but in a place of great
advantage for his men, as he that had been fully resolved before, to obtain
the victory not by sighting any universal battle, but after his manner by
fleecing the Christians by parts and pieces. At the break of the day Lodron
is called up again, he hears the noise of the imminent Barbarians, and sees
that he was forsaken of far the greatest part of the horsemen: he in vain
complayneth that he was betrayed, yet his courage nothing quayleth, he speaks
unto the footmen, and adhorteth them to be myndefull of their wonted prewes,
and to think that the danger which froward fortune then brought, was to be
overcome by only fortitude of heart, that valiant men ought to mind honest
death, and not most shameful flight, the which would also be uncertain: that
he himself who had often fortunately led them in many wars, was fully
resolved by repulsing the enemies, to reduce them into safety, or else
honorably to end his life with them in valiant fight. The horsemen of
Carinthia, Saxon, Austrich and Beheme, who like unto obevient soldiers in
vain expected the signal of dislodging, appointed by the General, neither
would be companions of that shameful flight, came unto Lodron thus confirming
his soldiers, as unto the valiantest man, beseeching him that he would take
upon him the charge of General in the place of the traitor. For they would
be obedient unto all things that he would command them, and as long as
strength and weapons would endure and hold, would most constantly fights
with the barbarous enemy for Christ's religion and their very good King.
Lodron would not take upon him the offered office, professing of a certain
noble shame fastness, that he was unworthy thereof, yet he of his pity, and
magnitude of mind pitying the unworthy lot and case of so great an army,
exercised the charge, ye which he took upon him with protestation, so long as
fortune would license. They report that when he made an oration unto the
soldiers, and detested and vehementlye discommended all hope of flight, there
was an old Alwaine soldier found, who durst to say unto him courteoustye,
but not vnwittilye: Flight, good Captain my Lord of Lodron, can seem to be
fo^sha^^efull a thing in you: when that you ryding on a goodly horse may be
thought to ride about to ^e we who do^ flee, Lodron understood the witty
meaning of the old soldier, and lighting down on foot, huckened his horse
with his dr^^en sword, nobly crying out: This day (fellow soldiers) shall ye
have me both captain, and soldier to fight with you on foot with equal
condition. Therefore that ye may not seem to have deceived my opinion,
valiantly endeavor to win the vi^^o^ie, or else to end your warfare with me
by an honorable death* and not vnreue^ged. Moreover, with like curtefie he gave
the rest of his horses unto the soldiers of his acquaintance, that were weak
either by wounds or sickness. The soremost troops of the horsemen, and the
foremost bands of the footmen: were searce out of the munitions of the Camp,
when that the Barbarians with cruel howling spread themselves round about out
men, and their horsemen attached many skirmishes at once in diverse places as
our men marched, and with this event, that our men sometimes egregiouflye
sustained their charge, and at other valiantlye renning their onset, propelled
far from them the urging Barbarians. In these sundry conflictes Aney Macer
Fuchstat, a Saxon, Captain of the Carinchians, was said, fighting very
fervently, being taken by the Turks to be the General, by reason of the
ornaments of his cognizances, and with like lot were slain above xxiiij.
horsemen of noble mark, and their ensignebearer. Among who^ were iij. noble
men. Andrewe Refcht, Christofer Hernaw, and George Hemelberg. But in another
place a very bloody skirmish was attached with the Saxons, the men of Misne,
Thuring, and Frankland, who followed the guidons of the Sixon horsemen, for of
them (who fought with singular prowes) above xxxvj of the galantest, either
Captains, ensign bearers, or Lieutenants of companies were slain, and
Chwenrick the chief captain of the Saxons was taken prisoner, and died
afterward in prison among the Barbarians. The men of greatest nobility of the^
which were there slain, were Sebastian Methesce, and James Scullemberg. And
also with the same lot of frustrated valor, the Austrian horsemen when they had
resisted a good while, were at the last slain, after that. N^^^l^s Turrian
their Captain escaping, many men of great mark for valiance ^bir^h had been
slain: as Fettay, and Holchirch, noble men, and next to them Ho^enfelder, and
Aanspurger, and also two very hemons noble m^^ of the house of Maideg, an^ with
them Limberg and Velezer, men of great worship. And also men borne in the upper
Austrich, William Folgehemstorph, Leonarde Lamberg, Gaspar Bargheim, and
Schellemberg, men famous for their dignity at home, and also in the field.
But far the greatest slaughter was committed on the Bohemians, whom being
disordered by the Ianizars through continual tempest of small shot, sent
overthwart them the old troops of Turkishe horsemen, hotly charged and beat
down every where with their heavy semitarres, and iron malles, no man
succouring them when they were enclosed, and their Captain Albert Slith had
sooner g^t him out of the mids of the slaughter than he ought to have done.
But the battallon of footmen being afflicted with great detrimente, and
brought even upon the very point to break array by the Ianizars and Asappes,
who wonderfully annoyed them from a certain high bank of a wooddie Marishe,
with their harquebusses and arrows, but would not come to hand strokes with
them. Amurathes invaded on the side with the horsemen of Bostie, and quite
disordered, and defeated, beating them down fiercelye with swords and battle
axes. Lodron himself was driven by the violence of the horsemen into a Moorish
and foul dirtie hole, where, when he being grievously wounded, and also much
encumbred with the slipperie dirt, endeavored to show his supreme valor, he
was willed by the Barbarians rather to yield, than to be slain, the which he
did, with three bands of footmen, who were all that were left him: whom the
Barbarians promised to save, as men of singular valor. For now the unmerciful
Barbarians embrued with the abundant blood of our men, were glutted with
slaughter, in so much that many of their arms fainted, and they turned
themselves very greedily unto the pillage, following those that being dispersed
some here some there, thought to have escaped the enemies hands by faint and
fearful pace: with this success, that many were taken prisoners to be made
gaues, few footmen escaped, and almost all the rest of the horsemen that had
not, (...) we have told you, fled before the battle, were lying slain once
all the whole field. For this shameful dis^x^^s^ture at Exech. is sayd^ to
pass all the lamentable ouerthro we^ that ever were given to the Christians in
former years: for the flower of the horsemen and footmen, were slain and
unite destroyed rather through the rashness and fault of the General, than
the prowes of the enemies, so that it caused great lamentation almost in every
country of Christendom. For it had never happened before, as one might see by
the adverse battles of Sigismunde the Emperor, and king Jews, that the
Barbarians were both victor, and also unbloody: so that our men which dyed at
Exech vnreue^ged, may seem to have much augmented the detrime^t received with
great ignomie. But afterward when it was thought that ^^dran could not be
carried alive unto Constantinople, by reason of his grieuoi^s wounds, he was
said by his keepers, and his head sent thither. But Cazzian^r being cried out
at by all men, as a man unworthy of light and life, requested of the King,
that he might safelye come unto Vienna to clear and acquit himself and but
when that the King gave him but ill countenance, and comniaun^ing c^rtaine to
attend upon him for fleeing away, deferred him trial, he being doubtful of
his safety, priuilye escaped, and fled unto Mahomet, by whom he was put in
hope to have good intertainment of the grande Seigneuer, and the whole country
of Croatia to hold it of him by homage, so that he would promise to his
uttermost to annoy the Austrians. But when he went about to sollicit^ and
familiar fre^^e of his called Skrin, a noble man of that Province, to reuolte
also with him unto the Turk, he was slain by him one night in bed, and his
head sent unto King Ferdinande.

The Battle of Buda or Ofen, fought in Hungary betvveene Mahomer Bassa
General for Solomon the great Turk, and William Earl of Rocandulphe,
Chiefetaine for Ferdinande the King of Hungary, in Anno. 1451. Out of Ionius.
WHen that in Anno 1541 a great power of King Ferdinandes under the conduct of
the Earl of Rocandulph, besieged the ^^^is of Bu^^s or offen, kept by the
favorers of Steven the ^ong son of John the V^^^^de, who had long contended
with Ferdinande for the kingdom of Hungary, Soliman the Turk sent a great
a^mie led by Mahome^ Iassa to succor his vassal Stephen. This Turkysbe
power with whom also joined certain Hungarians* favorers of the pupil,
encamped near unto R^candulph, and very much ve^^d h^^^ with often
skirmishes, in whom the Turks had most commonly the better. The Turks and
their confederate Hungarians had also brought thither a fleet by the river of
Thonaw, the which navy lay at a final Islande called Gapella, over right
against their army by land. But Rocandulph had a navy twye^ as great: for he
had xxiiij. Fragates of great and small Nafades (a hynde of ships of war
used by the Hungarians in the riues of Thonaw) about four score, and little
fewes than an hundredth Hulkes and Hoyes. But after that many bloody skirmishes
had been fought between the two armies, that lodged very nere one unto the
other. At last Peren ye captain general of ye Hungarians in Ferdinands camp,
was friendly advertised by George Valentine the General of the Hungarians with
the Turks, that Solomon himself approached: wherefore he should provide
speedily for the safety of him self and his countriemen: Whereupon Peren
resorted unto Rocandulph, and the Captains, declared unto them what news he
had received, willed them speedilye to depart thence, or else he would not
other ways neglect the safety of his countr^men. Although that the opinions
of the Captained did vary, yet all were of this mind, to remove unto Pest by
night, only Rocandulph dissented; and flatly affirmed, that he would not
depart from Offen without the commandment of King Ferdinande. Whereupon the
Earl of Sabine was sent in a swift Fragate to Vienna, to bring from thence the
Kings resolution. In the meant time, fear urging, and Peren chasing, they
determined to waft over to Pest in the right season, when the Moon shined not,
by four passages: in the first they embarked all their great ordinance, and
the Hungarians: in the second, the Almaine and Bohemian horsemen: in the other
two, all the footmen, and the bag and baggage of the army. Batocke an
Hungarian, and Balthazar Pocan an Almaine had the charge committed unto them,
to transporte the army without tumulte. Fortune failed not unto the first and
second passage. For although that when the Citizens of Offen and the Turks
saw from the high places all their enemies vessels to be gathered together,
did lightly suspect that, which was in very deed, and every man according to
his head, did adduce sundry causes of this new uproar, yet they had no
foresighte of the sodeyne flights of their enemies, but it was not long
unknown unto them, who did intentiuelye and diligently scoute and pry: for
two Vsarones fleeing from Peren unto Valentine, gave him intelligence of the
intent of their enemies, and Mahomet being incontinently advertised thereof by
Valentine, hasted with almost all his power to assault the enemies Camp. He
brought forth the field pieces, the Fan^zars going foremoste, and the rest of
the footmen, whom the younger horsemen dismissing their horses, followed on
foot, and with terrible howling assaulted the Camp. Then the Austrians
perceiving that their flyghte was descryed, were put out of heart: yet the
Bohemians, and also those Genmaynes that warded at the Bridge of the Islande,
did valiauntlye and manfullye resist. There was a great vproare and tumulte
throughoute all the whole camp, and namely at the bank of the river, when
every man conceyuing fear, hasted without order, and without shame, yea and by
wounding one another to get a ship bourde. For the dead time of the night,
and then very dark by cloudie weather, made all things to seem more
terrible, yea unto the valiant. But Rocandulph could bear no rule in the
dark, and in so great a noise and uproar of his own men, and crying of his
enemies, and the mighty thunder of the artillery tempesting from all parts.
He, besides his grief of mind, lay then on his bed, being wounded by a
marvelous chance. For as he was writing of letters unto the King, alpellet of
a Falcon lighted in his tente, and brake in sunder a chest, a piece of a boorde
whereof wounded the Earl in the shoulder very grieously. Moreover, the rest of
the Captains of the footmen, vehementlye envying at the already transported
horsemen for their fortunate flight, the which was now taken from them, did as
men busied with their own fear, nor preferring the public peril before
private safety, rather abide still, than repugne their assayling enemies. So
then first the upper camp, where Peren had lodged, was taken by the bands of
the Captain of Belgrade, and Valentine, and the Almaines were driven down
with headlong flighte from all the hill of Saint Gerarde. Neither do they in
Ofen let slip this good occasion offered to interclude their enemies, but
incontinentlye sallyed out at the gate of the water toure, and at that gate of
the Camp that was over right against them, assailed the stations which was
now forsaken, and casting upon the ennimies balls of wild fire, endeavored
to burn the tents. But George the Regent of ye young King, with as sudden as
happy devise, did set on fire at the Kings stables mighty heaps of straw and
hey, whereby there suddenly appeared such a great shining flame, that when the
Thonawe received on his brighte water the shyning of the light of the fire, and
it being spread abroad by reuerberation, was cast forth very like unto day
light, came unto the back of Pest^, all that soul fight bath of the tumult^^n
the l^^de, and also of the flight of the water was apparantlye bebelde. But
then was the ordinance directed, and shot from all parts at the fleeing
fleet, so that the vessels which had been disordered, yea, with the uncertain
shootes, were now shot at not only from the water toure, and the castle of
Ofen, but also from the Turkishe camp, and from Cepellia: and now that so
great light was brought into all places, Casson also the Admiral of the
Turkishe fleet rowing the lighter vessels up the stream, gave a charge on the
side of the enemies navy. So a conflicte by water being also attached, our men
fought unfortunately in all places: certain Hoyes laden with soldiers were
taken, and many drowned, and sunk with the ordiance, all the river was filled
full of slain men, and the wretched company of Mariners and soldiers that
labored to swim to the shore. For when the Ianizars overthrowing the
foremost bands, had broken into the lower camp, and the rest of the Almaines
fleeing into the Island by the bridge, were wounded in the backs with
Semitarres: they for fear of honest death sought shameful destruction in the
gulf of the water. Many were drowned in the deep channel, or else were
repulsed and thrust from the shipes by the weapons of their enemies. Three
hundredth vessels being that night with incredible conturbation intermedled
together, and for a good while remaining together, one would have thought
there had been a bridge made over the river: but Ferdinandes Fragates, and the
greater Nasades dispairing, got themselves speedily out of the hands of the
Turks, and keeping the enemies from them with their ordinance, shot out at
their stemmes, went up the river unto the Isle of Comora. Also the army by
land had the like luck in the camp: but the Bohemians manfullye repugning,
ended their lives very honorably, as also the bands of Otho and Hech, the
chief Colonel of the footmen, died of wounds received in their fore parts:
but diverse escaping by the top of Saint Gerardes hill, when they were come unto
the edge of the cliffe that hanged over the camp, darkness, and fear of
their instant enemies, confounded their hearts and senses, and so they fell
down hedlong from the cliffe, and brake their necks. But many running out at
the principal gate of the camp, met with them of Ofen, and exercising the
clemency or cruelty of their enemies, as they were of diverse dispositions,
sitions, were either slain or saved. But when the sun rising did discover
the slaughter of our men, and the victory of the Barbarians: about three
thousand men of all sorts, who erecting their ensigns at the Church of
Saint Gerarde, on the hanger of the hill had souldiourlike cast themselves into
a ring, were slain by the enutroning multitude of their enemies: yet almost the
third part of them, casting down their weapons, destred to have their lives
saved, and yielded to be kept for a show more shameful and worse than death it
self. At the same time also Casson bringing his victorious navy unto the
bank of Pest, struck such terror into their hearts that had escaped (and
might easily have defended the walls) only with their Turkishe clamors and the
thundering of the artillery, that the horsemen ran so fast out at the gates
with fearful flight, that one of them did hurt another in the througing
forth. For the Almaines forgetting their wonted prowes, did so tremble at the
name of the Turks, that when they saw in the Boats the beads wrapped about
with lynnen, they ran a way afrighted and unarmed, leaving behind them their
plate, and all their dearest and best baggage, with their wagons: yet the
Vsarones stayed a while, with whom greediness of pillage prevailed more than
all fear of death, they being busied in ryfling and spoiling of the mercha^ts
shops: for a noble and rich Mart of al wares was set up at Pest, Marchantes
resorting out of all parts unto the safe seat of the strong and very
commodious town for that it was without danger of the wars, and the tumultes
of soldiers, and yet near unto the camp, there being but a short cut over
the river between the town and the camp. But when no man desended* the
walls nor gates, Casson incontinently brake into the town, and slew certain
of the spoiling Vsarones, but he took such delight in christian blood; that
he spared no man in the town, no not the sick, of whom there was a great
number, nor the women that followed the Almaines, for they killed all sorts and
sexes indifferently, unless it were those whom goodly personage and strength
had reserved to be slaves, or the flower of tender years had purchased pardon,
for hope of lechery. So that it is reported, that there were stain in these
wars by sundry chances above xx. thousand Christians. But there were taken
in Pest, in the Camp, in the Islande, and in the ships, that had not yet ben
discharged, six and thirty very goodly battering pieces, but of smaller
mounted on wheels an hundredth and fifty. Moreover, the enemy got such
wonderful store of gunpowder, and iron shot, armor, weapons, and victuals
provided for all the winter, that by estimation of the Barbarians that booty
was accounted far the greatest part of the victory. But when the Turks
having won the munition, sought in the mids of the camp, Rocandulph lying
in his bed, desired rather to be slain in his tent than to survive so great an
overthrow, but he was against his will and chafing thereat, carried aboorde a
boat by his physician and chamberlain, and so transported into the Isle of
Comora, where a little while after he dyed of the grief of his wound and
hurt. But all the prisaners, who were in number about eight hundredth, being
presented unto Soliman at his arrival unto the camp, were by his commandment
all slain; except certain known captains and noble men, among whom were
Balthazar Pocan, and Task an old captain, master of the watch.

The Battle of Ceresoles, fought in Piemonte bevveene Alphons Marquis of
Guaesto, General for Charles the fifth, Emperor, and Francis Duke of Anghieu,
General for Francis the French King, in Anno. 15^4. Out of Paulus Iouius.
WHen that Francis Duke of Aughieu, Lieutenaunt General in Piemont for Francis
the French king, befieged with a great power Carignano, a strong town, and of
great importance in Piemont, Alphons Marquis, of Cuasto, Governor of Milan and
Piemont, for Charles the Emperor, being moved with the peril of the town,
and the Captain whom he had before faithfully promised to succor, as soon
as he had received out of Germany two regime^ts of Lansquenets under the
conduct of the two Scaligers, and six thousand Italians (for the most part
shot) led by Robert Prince of Salerne, with whom an old Captain Caesar
Massio was joined for a Counsaylour, and seven hundredth men of arms (but yet
in comparison of the Frenchmen, but light horsemen) and a singular cornet of
old men of arms from the Duke of Florence under Radulpho Baleone, and to
these were adjoined his old store a few Spaniardes, and the regiment of
Lansquenets of Baron Seisnech, whose bands were not full: he marched toward
Carignano. But before he came there, he was met with in a plain between
Ceresoles, and Carmagnola, by the French power, the which was thus ranged. In
the middle battle stood the Gascoignes, and the rest of the old French
footmen singularly well appointed, and very bravely, close unto whom stood
the strong regiment of Switzers that had served long in those wars in
Piemont, and stronglye backed all the front of the Gasc^ignes, which stood
very broad. The right wing was appointed unto the Switzers that came lately
out of their country, who with singular heat of hearts had desired to fight.
But the Gruieres a kind of half clownishe soldiers, and of no great use,
were placed in the left wing. These Grueres do dwell about Geneua, and
Losanne, and border on Berne and Sitten. Among these Gruiers were certain
Italian bands, namely of banished men of Milan, Sauoy, and Piemont, were
admixed. This was a great battle, and had many ensigns. But because it
consisted for a great part of fresh water soldiers, and men of diverse
languages, and had also been taken up without great choice, they gave almost no
opinion of assured valor, or firm consent. Moreover, between these three
battles of footmen, there stood also three of horsemen. Between the middle
battle, and the esquadrons of the Switzers stood Monsteur de Thermes, with
whom were all the light horsemen, and one troop of men of arms to strengthen
them. And the Lord Boutiers guarded the open side of the Gruiers with an other
power of horsemen. Then the Marquis seeing this array of the enemies, dso set
right over against the middle battle and the Gascoignes, a whole battallion of
Almaine footmen (whom he did take to be of invincible strength) with this
order, that in the forefront he placed Aliprand Madruches brother unto the
Cardinal of Trent, who had desired to have that honor. For the lusty and
valiant young Gentleman had in time before couragiouslye professed, that he
would with his only regiment (wherein were not full three thousand)
encounter, and valiantly overthrow the Switzers, whose force the Marquis
seemed not vnskilfullye to fear. Behind him, the two Scaligers led their
regimentes, their ensigns being placed in the mids of the hattell. The right
wing against the Gruers was appointed unto the Spaniardes, but so that he
adjoined unto them five bands of Lansquenets under the charge of Seisnech, men
meet for a standing fight. He placed all the Italians in the left wing, and
willed them by little and little to clyme the hill, which rose up gently from
the small valley, as the better place, and willed them not to stir from
thence, least that they should be disordered and defeated by the Switzers that
stood against them, to whom they were inferior in discipline: but to stand
still in array and be obedient unto the commandments of the Prince of Salerne
and Massio, and use their harquebusses as the chance of the battle should
require. Philip Lanoy a Flemming, Prince of Salmona, who was General of the
horsemen) was commanded to stand in the void room between the Lansquenets
and the Spaniardes, and Baleone did the like, standing directly against
Thermes. But Charles Conzaga had a special charge to observe and invade
Boutiers, who stood right over against him. The battles on both sides being
thus aranged, and the great ordinance on both parts shot off, the signals were
sounded, and the battles began to approach, between whom the Marquis ryding to
and fro with great danger of the pellets which slew from the great ordinance
and harquebusses round about his cares, and vewing all things with his eyes,
perceived that the Almaines came forward more slowly than he would have them,
insomuch that he came near unto them, and courteouslye encouraged the
Captains to amend their pace: when see, he beheld undoubted signs of
deadlye fear in the faces of the Scaligers, they looking more sad and pale
than they were wont. Wherefore turning toward his familiars, Scalengo,
Landriano, and Saiaureda, who continuallye followed him to receive messages
from him, and to carry them unto the battles and ranks, said: Almighty God
auerte this ill abodement, and be with us to day with his omnipotent power, as
we have great need thereof, seeing that I do see in these Almaines, in whom
is reposed all our trust, and the mean to obtain the victory, no chearfulnes
to fight, now the enemy is present and provoke them, the which thing has
never happened before this time. The first that ran together, after that the
Marquis had given the signal through the encouragement of his soldiers, were
the horsemen of Thermes and Baleone, the which they did with so great valor,
that on both sides many were borne to the ground, and after their staves were
broken, they courageously used their battle axes and swords. There Thermes
charging on the Italian footmen, was repulsed, and his horse being hurt, and
falling to the ground, he was taken by a fresh water soldier. But although
Baleons wing of horsemen excelled in prowes, yet they being inferior in
number, could not sustain the force of the French men of arms. So that many
of them were slain in that sharp conflicte, and among them Iulie Azzo, son
to the Prince of Tuder^^, and Baleone having his horse slain under him, hardly
escaped wounded unto the Italian footmen. But in another wing Fortune (who
uses as it were with a kind of play, eftsoons to exchange the euentes of
battelles) seemed to smyle upon the Spaniardes and old Lansquenettes. For
they under the conducte of Raimonde de Cardonna, and Seisnech, charged the
Gruers so couragiouslye with a Manique of harquebusiers, that they disordered
all their battle, and made them to flee, and got the Cottage that they had
stood by, and certain pieces of ordinance, and also with great slaughter
brake through a troop of horsemen that was sent to succor them. In this
encounter, the Monsieurs Destro, and Charles Dross, who were the chief
conductors of that ^^ing, were slain, and also Monsieur de Assier, a young
Gen^^^man of singular hope, over hotelye breaking in, was cast out of his
Saddle by the Almaine Pykes, and dyed within three days after of his two
wounds. In this speedy, but uncertain feese of victory, the Spaniardes
being inflamed, so fiercely followed the fleeing Frenchmen, that with continued
course they did flea and take even unto Carmagnola. At the very same time the
Lansquenettes who had lain flat on the ground that they might avoid the
great ordinance, being commanded by the Marquis, arose up, and taking up dust,
threw it over their shoulders, the which is an old and religions custom of
that nation, thinking by that ceremony to win the favor of bloody Mars,
and then they made toward the enemy. Aliprande, who was in the forefronte of
the battallion, going certain paces before the Esquadron, challenged to the
combatte Monsieur de Molle, a notorious Captain on the French side. But when
the Frenchman refused it not, they ran together so furiouslye, that one
wounding the other in the face, they both fell down to the ground, Molle
being thruste in with deadly Pyke a little above the eye, and Aliprande into
the ball of the cheek up to the ear. Thus both the Captains falling down, a
very sharp and a bloody fight was begun by the foremoste ranks, where
the strength of the most chosen soldiers and petie Captains of both armies
fought for the dignity of their name, and for glorious victory. Aliprandes
regiment that went forward very hotelye, was more slowlye followed by the
Scaligers than they should have been, by reason of the empeachmente of the
low and uneven ground, whereby neither could their Pykes be borne with
equal order, nor their ranks be aptlye set close together. But in the hotest
of the fight, the Imperial horsemen made into the left wing of the Frenchmen
where Boutiers stood with his troup ready to fight, and ran forth very
courageously, but vainly, and as it appeared anon after, very incommodiously
and shamefullye. For when they were come unto ye Frenchmen, they never once
giving any charge, no nor so much as charging their stanes, whirled themselves
round about like unto the form of the Moon, either to train out the light
horsemen from the guarde of the men of arms, or because they being light
armed, durst not adventure upon their ennimies, who were all in complete
armor, or else were adduced so to do by an uncertain speech uttered (as they
said) by Goit their Captain, who commanded them to turn about their horses,
that they being ouermatched, might not fight with the men of arms by
encountering them with their horses breast to breast, and with thick troop, but
with often running upon them, and incontinentlye reculing back again, after
the manner of the Moors. This unlooked for turning away of the Emperialles
caused first the Frenchmen to maruayle, and anon after also their fellows
assuredly to suspecte that they did flee: so that Boutiers suddenly with great
valor charged on the backs of them that turned: who, although that the Marquis
cried out, and rated them, could not be stayed, but with headlong course ran
upon the Esquadron of the Almains, and finding it loose behind the ensigns,
opened and brake through all the whole battallion: and also the French men
following the^, got in too at that breach, and with small ado slew all the
foulye disordered hindermost ranks, because that they were not armed with
head pieces and Costelets, as were the fore ranks: the Frenchmen caruing off
whole limbs from the unarmed, with their broad and heavy swords, not unlike
unto wood knives that hanged at their saddle bows. But when the Switzers who
stood over right against the Italians, saw this wavering and slaughter of
the Almaines, they neglecting and omitting the Italians, turned their
infestuous ensigns on the Almaines, as on them, whom for natural hatred they
bare them, they accounted for their very and peculiar enemies: neither in deed
could they commodiously charge the Italians for the holownesse and inequality
of the place: and also they thought that if the Almaines were timely destroyed,
then the victory were surely gotten. This chance of counsel suddenly taken,
brought not doubtful safety unto the Italians, but most assured destruction
unto the Almains: for as the Italians being inferior both in furniture and
number, men thought would not have sustained the force of the impression of
the Switzers, namely seeing that they had before seen the flight of their
horsemen, so the Almaines that did very constantly propell the Gascoignes and
old Switzers that fought in their front with singular valor, were not able to
bear the fresh force of these Switzers that charged them on the side, so that
being disordered by the mad miserable irruption of their own horsemen, and
succored by no man, but slain behind by the French horsemen, and in the
front by the urging enemies their footmen: after that their captains were
slain, and their ensigns thrown down, they turned their backs, and were
almost eucrye man slain. There died with the Scaligers diverse noble men of
great renounce for sundry honors borne in the field, and Captains of
bands, and most honorable of all, Vulcane son to the Earl of Furstemberg,
Michaell Prensinger, Lieutenant to Brannor Scaliger, and Anty Vrse, a man of
great fame for his many martial voyages, and Hildebrande Tunney, Balthazar
Chaldese, James Figer, Matrice Burse, Adam Brall, and the Baron of Grinisten.
But Aliprande Madruckes being sore wounded in many places, was found half
dead among the slain carcasses, and taken prisoner. But when the Italian
footmen saw the Almaines defeated, and the horsemen fled, they using a
deuyse rather needful and profitable (as it afterward appeared) than
honorable, fearing the victors, began to get themselves out of danger, and to
retire through that low place that I spoke of, but yet still keeping array,
and so no strong band of their enemies molesting or pursuing them, they came
before midnight unto Asti, whither long before had Lanoy come whole and
untouched with his horsemen: but anon after the sun was set, the Marquis came
thither wounded a little above the knee with an harquebusse shot that went
through his steel saddle, as also his helmet was battered with the many blows
of horsemens Malles: but because he wore not at that time the Ensigns of a
General, as he was wont to do, but only a black and mean cassocke, he was
not known of his enemies, and so defending himself with his sword, got out
of this bloody broyle. But the cause why yt the French horsemen did not set upon
nor pursue the Italians, we learned, was this: They having lost Terms their
Captain, and also being dispersed, had turned themselves to oppress the right
wing of their ennimies. For when the Spaniardes, Seisneches, and Lansquenettes
that had defeated the Gruers, and had pursued them far, returned joyful of
their valiant service, and were ignorant of the discomfiture of their
fellows, they being suddenly amassed with the sight of that slaughter, and also
being in suspense what to do, lighted on the victor Frenchmen, by whom being
enclosed as in a pownde (the horsemen enuironing them round, were taken
prisoners almost without wound, because the valiant nien thought it better
in this desperate state to yield to fortune, than to repugne with foolish and
deadly pertinacie. There yielded Raimonde of Cardonna, the Camp master, son
unto that Raimonde, which was General at the battle of Rauenna, and with him
Captains of great mark, John Beamont, Jews Ch^xada, Consalres Hernandes,
and Cheuedes. But the Baron Seisnech getting on horse, escaped the danger, and
Charles Gonzaga when he saw the horsemen shamefully flee, that he might not be
attainted with the like dishonor, brake in among the French men, and being
hurled off from his horse, was taken prisoner. And also Hercules Martinenge,
borne of a noble house at Bressa, being incensed with the self same shame, but
with harder lot of honorable attempt, lustilye thrust into the thick battle
of his enemies, with his cornet, as it became one brought up by Guasto, where
he was slain, with his brother Attilio. They report that there was stayne
xij.M. of whom far ye most were Almaines. And whereas there was in the field
almost with equal number on both sides above xl.M. footmen, the victory
happened not unto the Frenchmen altogether without blood, namely seeing that
their left wing was defeated and put to flight, and diverse of the French
nobility slain. I heard afterward the Marquis himself say, that he had
never thought but that he should have sustained and defeated the force of the
French horsemen (which was otherwise to be feared) by his bacquebusiers, as it
had happened at the battle of Pauie, and also he did ouermatch the enemies
their footmen in strength of thick Esquadron. The fruit of this victory was
nothing else but the winning of Carignano.

banished men of Naples, the duke of Somma, and the prince of Capazzi, who had
levied power in the Roman territory. But when that Strozzi would have passed
the Po, the Marquis of Guasto who had gathered together a power, showed
himself on the other side of the river ready to impeache his passage, and
also sent the prince of Salerne with the greater part of his power to take the
straites of the mountain Apenine, that he might not pass that way neither.
Whereby he was forced to seek safety by retiring back over ye painful
mou^tains. But with in iij. days, ye Prince and Strozzi were in sight one of
the other at the river of Scriuia, and began streightway to skirmish. But when
Strozzi for fear, of ye princes horsemen, passed over the river, and withdrew
himself to the vineyards that stood on ye hanger of an hill, certain of the
Princes bands of footmen took a hill nere unto the^. The which the Strozzians
could not abide, but did set upon them so fiercely, that they put them to
flighte, and forced them to leese their enfignes, and also to forsake their two
pieces of ordinance. Then Strozzi being very joyful of this good success, as
though he had seen victory now coming toward him, by the adhortation of
Mathewe, a Captain more aduenturous than skillful, could not keep in
himself, but brake forth out of the vineyards, and cried victory, victory,
and sent unto the Captains of Petilians regiment (for he himself being
grieuouslye hurt by chance in the leg, stayed at Placentia) for to follow
with speedy pace with the rerewarde, and to be present at the victory begun.
Petilians bands who were not ruled by one man, but many, and were obedient not
unto the skilfullest Captains: but the noble men of greatest honor, as soon
as they heard the cry of victory, could not be kept in, although that Somma
and Capezza commanded them to march unto the vineyardes in a thick
Esquadron, but that they ran forth with loosed ranks, and by their thin
array gave occasion unto the horsemen of the ennimies to break forth, to the
which occasion Salerne failed not rating the horsemen, who a while lingering
with infamous sloth, would neither run their horses lustily, as though they
were weary, nor courageously charge the Esquadron. When (said he) will ye
think that the ignomie lately taken at Ceresolos must be wyped away by some
valiant fact, if that ye do not now charge ouerthwharte the side of this
thin Esquadron of the wearye ennimie marching with loosed ranks? The
horsemen blushed, and immediately gave a courageous charge on the enemy,
Bartholomewe Greece the Lieutemant of Beleons company being the first that
brake forth: the ill closed battallion of the enemies was broken through, and
at length the horsemen charging on all parts, and the footmen following, all
the Switzers were foully defeated and scattered, with this event, that few being
slain, all were almost taken unhurt, the memory of ye unbloody wars of our
fathers being renewed. For the Italians did courteously spare them that yielded,
being contented with the spoil. Neither were the Almaines and Spaniardes
present, whose cruel hands reioyeing in slaughter, few had escaped. And also
with good lot the two Neapolitane banished Princes, Somma and Capezza, who were
in assured danger of death, were let go, when that every soldier thought
that the noble men allied by blood unto Guasto and Salerne, were rather gently
to be let go, than to be severely delivered unto detestable death by the
judgment of Strangers. One only noble man, and he also a young Gentleman of
surpassing towardlynesse, Ulysses Orsino, was stayne in the fight with a
harquebusse shot. Strozzi himself escaped into the near dominions of the
friends and confederates of the Frenchmen, with Nicolas the sorme of the Earl
of Perilia, and Flaminio the Earl of Anguillara. This overthrow dashed all
the intended attemptes of Anghien. This battle was fought in June, and that at
Ceresoles in Aprist before.

The Battle of Locken fought in Saxon, between Charles the fifth, Emperor of
Rome, and John Frederick Duke of Saxony, in Anno 1547. 24. of April Out of
Natalis Comes.
WHen that the army of the confederale states of the Empise assembled against
the force of Charles the fifte, their Emperor, who was fore displeased with
their straight alliance, was dissolved, and the chief conductors thereof John
Frederick Duke and Prince Elector of Saxon, and Philip the Lantgraue of Hessen
were returned home to defend their own countries: the Emperor passing over
the river of Elb, entered Saxony, hasting with his ouly horsemen to fight with
the Duke before he had dispersed his power into his impregnable holds. And in
deed the Emperials used such celeritie, that they were upon the Saxons before
that they were ware of them, in so much that when the Imperial anantcurrers
were suddenly come so near unto them, that they could not well be set in
array, all the Saxon army was fraught full of trembling and fear, and were
even upon the prick to flee all away: of so great moment in wars is
celeritie alone. But whylest that the auantcurrers Imperial being very few
in number, stayed for more power, which continually came unto them: the Duke
had leisure to set his men in array, but yet not as he was wont, and as the
discipline of wars would have it, but as the present necessity requested
and permitted. He divided his footmen into two Esquadrons, whom he guarded on
both sides with his horsemen, and placed his great ordinance, and his
baggage, and cariages in the mids. In the mean time the Emperialles were so
increased, that they doubted not to encounter their enemies, who now marched
toward Wittenberg. And first there passed between them light skirmishes,
whom the Saxons still marching on their way forced not off: seeing that they
did not only stoutly resist them, but also repelled with slaughter such as
over hardily pressed upon them. Afterward when that the Duke of Alua, the
Imperial General was come into sight with a great troop of horsemen, the
Saxons fearing by the great cloud of duste that was raised up, that the
Emperors whole power was come, began to march on a round pace: the which
certain of the Imperial light horsemenne taking for a kind of flyghte, gave
a great shoute, and lustilye charged the Saxons: and certain men of arms
went about to enclose them on the other side. But a great troop of Saxons
harquebusiers on horseback, charged the Imperial horsemen, with so great
violence, and so myghtie and horrible a storm, that not one of them durst
abide, but incontinentlye turned their backs, and were forced to flee back
among the men of arms. These horsemen were taken up in the confines of
Hungary, Poloue, and Croatia, and had to their Captain Bartholomewe, a
Croatian, an old and expert soldier. When that the Saxon understood that
his footemens* hearts were a little confirmed through the valor of these
horsemenne, he commanded that the footemenne of the Earl of Bichlinghen, in
whom he reposed greatest trust, and the horsemen of John Ponicawe, and
Gangulph of Eislinghen should be placed against the front of the ennimies,
wyllyng them that if they were invaded and charged for to feygne that they gave
place until that at commodious time the signal of fight should be given.
While that the Saxon is doing of this, the Emperor with the King of the
Romans had overtaken Alua his horsemen: Wherefore his Majesty thynking that
opportunity of fight was offered him, whereof he was very desirous, and
because that the day was now well spente, he incontinentlye aranged his power
into a vantgarde, and a battle. In the auantgarde he placed six hundredth
Lances to the charge of Maurice Duke of Saxon, six hundredth Hungarian
horsemen, and seven hundredth Italian horsemenne, and one hundredth
harquebusiers on horseback, they being all in number two thousand. He divided
them into three troops, the Hungarians stood on the right wyng, the Almaines
on the left, and the Italians in the mids: of the rest of his power he made
the battle, the which he divided into two Esquadrons, of whom he committed
the one unto the King of the Romans, but the other he led himself: the one
consisting of seven hundredth horsemen, and the other of one thousand, part
Lances, and part Harbuebusiers on horseback, and wylled his soldiers to
auaunce in such order, that the front should be broadest, contrary to the
usage of the Almaines, who do make their front narrow, and their sides
broad. The reason hereof was, because it is not only goodlye unto the eye,
but also very sure. For in this array a battle cannot so eastlye be
enclosed, by reason of the breadthe thereof, the which may happen with no
great difficulty, if that the Esquadron be narrow. The Saxon had six
thousand footemenne cast into two Esquadrons, and nine Cornettes of
horsemenne, which was two thousand, six hundredth, and four score horsemen:
but be himself ryding from rank to rank, provided for all necessaries in all
places. And when he saw but only the forewarde of the Emperialles, because
that the duste did hyde the battle, he was in good hope that he should be
able very easilye for to sustain the force of so few horsemen. But when he
was admonished by his Marshall, to go a little on one side, that he might more
diligently vewe them with whom he should fight, he saw also the battle
aranged, wherefore understanding that all the Emperial horsemen were come, and
also perceiving their array and purpose, he returned unto his host, and
determined to take a wood full of Marshes, and very blind narowe paths,
thinking that through the benefit thereof, he should be able to prolong the
fight until it were night, and then he should be safely shrouded therewith,
and commodiously recover Wittenberg. But there was between both the armies so
large an open plain, as would suffice for them to fight in, for it was above
three hundredth paces long: the which plain, the Emperials thought if that they
could get, then they should defeat their enemies. Wherefore Alua sent the
light horsemen before for to impeach the ennimie from taking thereof. But
because that the Saxon footemenne and two troops of horsemen stood
thereupon, the Emperialles were forced to retire unto their fellows, the
exployte vnatchieued. But Alua with a stronger troop of Almaine horsemen,
strengthened the light horsemen, who contrary to his expectation had been
repelled, and adhorted the rest to glory and valiance, and greatly were his
commandments advanced through the skilfulnesse of the soldiers, who did
execute Martial precepts speedily an exactly. Wherefore they renewing the
fight, did so valiantly give the charge on their ennimies, that they had
almost made them to turn their backs. The Saxon perceiving the faint courage
of his men, that he might not be environed on all parts, and the way of his
safety taken from him, called a troup of horsemen from the left wing, and
commanded them to succor their distressed fellows, and as the shortness of
the time would suffer, adhorted them in this manner to reteyne the stoutnesse
and glory of their ancestors: Unless that ye your selves (fellow
soldiers) did very well know that almost all man's nobility and glory does
consist in Martial matters, it would have been needful for me to declare
with many words, that our ancestors got estimation, glory, and empire by none
other thing, and I would have revoked into your memory their diume and
wonderful acts. But seeing that the straytnesse of the time does not bear
it, the which does require fortitude of heart and strength of body, than any
eloquent speech: This only thing do I say, that at this time we must fight for
all that we have: the conservation whereof, is reposed in only fortitude, and
valor of arms. For if we shall play the valiant and stout fellows, as in
deed we ought to do, this day will be unto us the happiest day that ever
shined, and of greatest memory among all our posterity. For we may (I do
not say) defend our goods, country, liberty, religion, wives, children
(although that these things are of them selves most dear, and of such price,
that for them all perils are to be contemned) neither conserve ye recovered
principality of Saxony, but with surpassing praise and admiration of all
foreign nations, augment the glory of the Germane name, deliver from thraldom,
and make free the Almaine Empire, and fear the rest of the enemies of the
Germans from ever again vexing of Germany, and finally obtain a glorious
and quiet peace for ever. But contrariwise, if we give place to fortune, who is
mostlye friend unto the hardy, but seldom unto the fearful, we must needs
come into the hands of our enemies with extreme shame, and at one time leese
all that we have, and possess. By these reasons were the Saxons a little
confirmed, who being set in such array as was thought best for that present, the
Duke himself stood with his horsemen before his footmen, that they might be
confirmed. For he did not a little distrust their prowes. In ye right wing
against ye Emperials he placed Ernest the Duke of Brunswicke with the horsemen
of Nicolas Bernarde, and John Segherne, whom he did take to be his best. He
gave order, that if the Emperials did give any charge in their battles, they
should shoot off all their Pistolets and harquebusses at once, and always
keeping their array, suffer the invasions of their enemies, and also commanded
that no man on pain of death should go out of his place, for he himself
would be careful to bring them succor: and thus they fair and softlye
expected the onset of the Emperialles. The Saxon himself road hither and
thither, opportunelye providing and seeing to all things: then he commanded
the horsemen and certain harquebusiers to give a charge upon the Imperial
light horsemen, that the rest of his footmen might the more commodiouslye get
into the wood, through whose guard they thought they should be safe. But by
this time had the Emperor joined with the auantgarde of his men, and with few
words adhorted his soldiers to attache the battle, crying Saint George,
Hispaine, and the Empire. But when all the Imperial troops ran forth together
equally fro^ted, they came unto a dirtie plot, where many of ye horses did
slide, as in a slipperie place: wherefore the battle was forced to stay until
that the fore ward were passed the slough least that else both battles should
be disordered, and one intermired with another, whereby it came to pass, that
they going aside, the auantgard was passed by at that same time that the Saxons
gave the charge that I spoke of with very good order, on the light horsemen of
the Emperialles. When that the Emperor saw this opportunity to have a sayre
day, he sent from the one side men of arms, and from the other the
harquebusiers on horseback, and Duke Morris to charge that part of the
Saxons that had before seemed to be the more fearful. The battle was begun
in the right wing, where the Saxons discharging their shot altogether, as
they had been commanded, the fight seemed at the first to be very cruel. But
when that the light horsemen of the Italians and the Hungarians charged them in
another part on the side, and would grant the shot no leisure to recharge
their pieces again, and in another quarter, the men of arms of Naples, Duke
Morrices, and the Harquebusiers fiercely urged: they so feruentlye charged the
Saxons on all sides, that the auantgarde which had not entered the wood, was
opened and scattered. It was marvelous to see within how small a space of
time, and as it were in a momente all the army of the Saxons was overthrown
and defeated, the light horsemen and the Hungarians pursuing the victory with
wonderful celeritie. The Saxon although he endeavored opportunelye to succor
his men, and timely to provide all things: yet when he fawe that so great a
number of his men were laid on the ground, and ouerthrown, he determined to
save himself by taking the wood, after that he certainly perceived that he was
in no wise able to resist with the rest that were left him. But when he was
disclosed unto his ennimies by one that was taken prisoner, and his Princelye
port, and almost Kinglye majesty did persuade them to believe that it was he
in deed: first two Italians pursued him, and although he were valiantly
defended by his men, yet at the last, when that more of the Emperialles came, he
was taken prisoner after no small fight by Hippolito a Vientine, who pulled
off his head piece, and did put him on an hatte, in sign of a prisoner. But
when that the Emperialles came afterward into the wood, they found so many
armours and weapons thrown away, and lying on the ground, and so many
slain bodies heaped in the ways, that it was a lamentable sight unto their
countrymen, some seeing their berthren, other their cousins and friends slain
by them, and also it was no small impediment unto the rest to pursue the chase.
Moreover, there were such a number of prisoners taken, that many of the
Emperialles led fifty or xx. prisoners a piece with their haudes bound
behind them. But because that the Emperials seemed to be greatly dispersed for
desire of spoil, the which is no small danger in victory, for that unknown
aide^ may come to the vanquished, and with small labor defeat the scattered
victors (a thing which has often happened) the Emperor commanded the men of
arms to be called back, and the retire to be sounded. But inco^tine^tly after
news was brought unto his majesty that the Saxon was taken. There were stain
of the Saxons about ij. M. footmen, and above vij. C. wounded, and more than
vto. C. taken, and of horsemen v. C. slain, and far more taken, and yet many
Germans were let go by the Germans: of all the army not above iiij. C.
horsemen, and so many footmen escaped to VVite^berg. Few of mark were slain
there were taken beside the Saxon, Ernest the Duke of Brunfwicke, and Charles
of Thuring, and two of the Saxon his secretaries: There were also taken xvij.
ensigns of footmen, and ix. of horsemen: great store of household stuff,
money, and martial furniture, two Culnerings, iiij. Demiculuerings, four
Demicanons, and five Falconets. His eldest son John being wounded in two
places, was thrown off his horse, but being succored by his friends, and he
that had wounded him being slain, he escaped to Wittenberg. There were slain
of the Emperials unto the number of five hundredth, because that the fight being
begun at eleven of the clock, continued until seven: for the Saxons
marched fighting fiftene miles from the river of Elbe. After this victory, all
Saxony yielded, and also the Lantgraue came in, and other Almaine states
submitted themselves unto the Emperor, who was now absolute victor.

Muscleborough field fought in Scotland between Edward Duke of Somerset,
and James Hamelton Earl of Arraine, Regents of England and Scotland, during
the nonage of Edward and Marie, the Princes of the said Realms, in Anno.
1547. Taken out of William Patens.
WHen that Marie the young Queen of Scotts was not delivered unto the English
nobility to be joined in happy marriage with Edward the sixth, the young King
of England, according unto faithful promise made: Edward Seimar Duke of
Somerset, and Protector of his Majesty's person and dominions, invaded
Scotland the third of September, with an army by land of ten thousand
footmen, of whom six hundredth were harquebusiers, s^ure thousand men of
arms and Demilaunces, and two thousand light horsemen, and of them two
hundredth were hakbutters on horseback, thirtene hundredth Pioners, and fiftene
pieces of great ordinance, and a fleet of Lxv. vessels, whereof the Galley,
and xxxiiii more were perfectly appointed for the wars, and the resid ue for
munition and vittayle. The Admiral of this fleet was the Lord Clinton. The
ninth of September the Englishmen were encamped within two miles of the
Scottish power, levied and led by lames Earl of Arrane, Governor of
Scotland. The next morning the Scotts leaving their lodging which was very
strong, and of great advantage, and to the intent that as well none of their
soldiers should lurk behind them in their camps, as also that none of
their Captains should be able to flee from their enterprice, having caused
all their tents to be let flat down to the ground ere they came out, and
then all as well nobles as others (few except) that were not horsemen,
appointed to leave their horses behind them, and to march on with their
soldiers on foot) hasted toward the Englishmen, who were also marching
against them, but neither side any whit ware of the others intent. But the
Scotts staying a while upon the way, our Galley shot of, and slew the master
of Greyme with xxv. near him, and therewith so scarred the four thousand
Archers brought by the Earl of Arguill, that where (as it was said) they
should have been a wing to the foreward, they could never after be made to
come for ward. Hereupon did their army hastily remove, and from thence
declyning Southwarde, took their direct way toward an hill called Fauxside
Braye. Of this, Sir R^fe Vane Lieutenant of all our horsemen, quickly
advertised my Lord Protector: who thereby did readily conceive much of their
meaning, which was to win of us the hill, and thereby the wind and the Sun
of it had shyned, as it did not, for the weather was cloudie and louring. The
gain of which three things whether party in fight of battle can hap to
obtain, has his force doubled against his enemy. In all this enterprise they
used for haste so little the help of horses, that they plucked forth their
ordinance by draught of men, which at this time began freely to shoot of
toward us, whereby we were further warned, that they meant more than a
fl^rmish. Herewithall began every man to be smitten with the care of his office
and charge, and thereupon accordingly to apply himself about it: and also my
Lords grace, and the Council on horseback as they were, fell streyghte in
consultation. The sharpness of whose circumspect wisdoms, as it quickly
espied out the enemies intents: so did it among other things, promptly provide
therein to prevent them (as needful it was) for the time as^ed no leisure.
Their devise was this: that my Lord Gray of Wilton Marshall of the army, and
Captain General of all the horsemen, should with his band of Bulloners, and
with my Lord Protectors band, and the Earl of VVarwickes (Lord Lieutenant
of the army) band, all to the number of xviij. C. horsemen on the one half:
and Sir Rafe Vane, with Sir Thomas Darcie Captain of the Pencioners, and men
of arms, and my Lord Fitzwaters, with his band of Demilances, all to the
number also of xvj. C. to be ready and even with my Lord Marshall on the west
half, and thus all these together before, to encounter the enemies a front,
whereby either to break their array, and that way weaken their power by
disorder, or at the least to stop them of their gate, and force them to stay
while our fore ward might wholly have the hills side, and our battle and
rerewarde be placed in grounds next that in order, and best for advantage. And
after this then, that the same our horsemenne should retire up the hills
sides to come down in order afresh, and infest them on both their sides,
whiles our battles should occupy the^ in fight a front. The policy of this
devise for the state of the case, as it was to all that knew of it, generally
allowed to be the best that could be, even so also taken to be of no small
danger for my Lord Marshall, Sir Rafe Vane, and other the assaylers, the
which nevertheless, I know not whether it were more nobly or wisely devised
of the Council, or more valiantly and willinglye executed of them. For even
there with good courage taking their leaves of the Counsel, my Lord Marshall
requiring only that if it went not well with him, my Lords grace would be
good to his wife and children, he said he would meet the Scotts, and so
with their bands these Captains took their way toward the enemy. By this
were our fore ward and theirs within two flight shottes a sunder. The Scotts
basted with so fast a pace, that it was thought of the most part of us they
were rather horsemen than footmen: Our men again were led the more with
speed. The master of the ordinance Sir Francis Flemming, to our great
advantage, plucked up the hill then certain pieces, and soon after planted
two or three Canons of them well nie upon the top there, whereby having so much
the help of the hill, he might over our men's heads shoot nyest at the
enemy. My Lord Protector (whose peculiar charge of all this voyage, was the
conduct of the middle battle) being cladde in fair armor, took his way
toward the height of the hill, accompanied with no mo than Sir Thomas
Challoner* to tarry by the ordinance, whereas he moughte both best survey us
all, and succor with aid where most he saw need, and also by his presence
be a defense unto the thing that stood weakest in place, and most in danger,
the which thereby howmuch it stood in stead, anon shall I show. But the Scotts
in the mids of their swifte march, were all at a sudden stay, and stood
still a good while (the cause whereof is uncertain) and then made hastily
toward us again. I know not (to say the truth) whether more stoutlye of
courage, or more strongly of order, me thought then I might note both in their
march. But what after I learned specially touching their order, their armor,
and their manner of fight, as well in going to offend, as in standing to
defend, I have thought necessary here to utter. Hackbutters had they few or
none, and appoint their fight most commonly always on foot. They come to
the field well furnished with Jack, Scull, Dagger, Buckler, and Swords, all
notably broad and thin, and of exceeding good temper, and universally so
made to slice, that as I never saw none so good, so think I it hard to devise
the better, hereto every man his pike, and a great kerchiefe wrapped twice or
thrice about his neck, not for cold, but for entting. In their array toward the
joining with the enemy, they cling and thrust so near in the ^ore rank
shoulder to shoulder together, with their pikes in both hands straight before
them, and their followers in that order so hard at their backs laying their
Pykes over their foreg^ers shoulders, that if they do assail vndisseuered, no
force can well withstand them. Standing at defense, they thrust shoulders
likewise so nie together, the forerankes well nie to kneeling, stoop low
before for their fellows behind, holding their Pykes in both hands, and
therewith in their left their Bucklers, the end of the Pyke against their
right foot, the other against the enemy, breast high, their followers
crossing their Pyke points with them forward, and thus each with other so
nie, as place and space will suffer, through the whole ward, so thick, that
as easily shall a bare finger peerce through the skin of an angry Hedgehogge,
as any encounter the front of their Pykes. My Lord Marshall notwithstanding,
whom no danger detracted from doing of his enterprise, with the company and
order before appointed, came full in their faces from the hills side, with
present mind and courage continuing their course toward the enemy. And my
Lords grace also at his place furiously tempested aloft with the ordinance.
The enemies were in a fallowe field, whereof the furrows lay sideling
toward our men: By the side of the same furrows next us, and a stones cast
from them, was there a crossedich, or slough, which our men must needs pass
to come to them, wherein many that could not leap over, stacke fast, to no
small danger of themselves, and some disorder of their fellows. The ennimies
perceiving our men fast approach, disposed themselves to abide the brunt, and in
this order stood still to receive them. The Earl of Anguish next us in the
forewarde, as Captain of the same with an eight thousand, and four or five
pieces of ordinance on his right side, and four hundredth horsemen on his left:
behind him somewhat westward, the Governor, with x. M. inlande men (as they
call them) the choysest men counted of their country. And the Earl Huntley in
the rerewarde, welnie even with the battle on the left hand, with eight
thousand also. The four thousand Irish archers as a wing unto them both, last
in deed in order, and first (as they said) that ran away. These battelles
and rarewarde were warded also with ordinance according. Edward Shelley
Lieutenant under my Lord Gray, of his band of Bulleners, was the first on our
side that was over this slough, my Lord Gray next, and so then after two or
three ranks of the former bands. But badly yet could they make their race,
by reason the furrows lay trauerse to their course. That notwithstanding, and
though also they were nothing likely well to be able thus a front to come within
them to hurt them, as well because the Scottishe men's pykes were as long, or
longer than their staves, as also for that their horses were all naked without
bardes, whereof though there were right many among us, yet not one put on,
forasmuch as at our coming forth in the morning, we looked for nothing less
than for battle that day, yet did my Lord and Shelley with the residue, so
valiantly and strongly give the charge upon them, that whether it were by their
prowes, or power, the left side of the enemies that his Lordshippe did set
upon (though their order remained unbroken) yet was compelled to swaye a good
way back, and give ground largely, and all the residue of them beside, to
stand much amassed. Before this, as our men were welnie at them, they stood
very brave and bragging, shaking their Pyke points, crying, come here Loundes,
come here Tykes, come here Heretics, and such like opprobrious words: Our
Captains that were behind, perceiving at eye, that both by the unevenness of
the ground, by the sturdie order of the enemy, and for that their fellows
were so nie, and straight before them, they were not able to any advantage to
maintain this onset: did therefore according to the devise in that point
appointed, turn themselves, and made a soft retire up toward the hill again.
Howbeit, to confess the truth, some of the number that knew not the prepensed
policy of the counsel in this case, made of a sober abuised retire, an
hasty temerarious flight. My Lord Marshall, Edward Shelley, little Preston,
Brampton, and Gerningham, Bulleners, Ratcliffe, the Lord Fitzwaters brother,
Sir John Cleres son and heir, Digges of Kent, Ellerker a Pencioner, Segraue.
Of my Lord Protectors band, my Lord Edward his Graces son, Captain of the
same band, Stanley, VVodhouse, Conisbie, Hergill, Morris, Dennis, Arthur, and
Atkinson, with the other in the fore rank, were not able in this earnest
assault both to tend to their fight before, and to the retire behind: the
Scotts again well considering hereby how weak they remained* ran sharplye
forward upon them, and without any mercy slew every man of our men that abode
furthest in prease, and a six me (of Bulloners and other) than I have here
named, in all to the number of xxvj. and most part gentlemen. My Lord Gray yet,
and my Lord Edward (as some grace was) returned. again, but neither all in
safety, nor without evident marks they had been there: for the one with a
Pyke through the mouth was raced a long from the tip of the tongue, and thrust
that way very danger ously more than two inches within the neck, and my L.
Edward had his horse under him with swords wounded sore, and I think to death.
Like as also a little before this onset sir Thomas Darcie upon his approach to
the enemies, was stricken glauncing wise on the right side, with a bullet of
one of the field pieces, and thereby his body bruised with the bowing in of his
harness, his sword hilts broken, and the forefinger of his right hand beaten
flat: even so upon ye parting of this fray, was sir Arthur slash at with
swords, and so hurt upon the wedding finger of his right hand also, as it was
counted for the first part of curing to have it quite cut away. About the same
time certain of the Scots ran out hastily to the kings Majesty's standard of
the horsemen (the which sir Andrew Flammake bare) and laying fast hold upon the
staff thereof, cried a king, a king, that if both his strength, his heart, and
his horse had not ben good, and hereto somewhat aided at this pinch by sir Rafe
Coppinger a Pencioner, both he had been slain, and the standard lost, which
the Scots nevertheless held so fast, that they brake and bare away the nether
end of the staff to the burrell, and intended so much to the gain of the
standard, that sir Andrew (as hap was escaped home all safe, and else without
hurt. At this business also was my Lord Fitzwaters captain of a number of
demilances unhorsed, but soon mounted again, escaped, yet in great danger, and
his horse all hewn. Hereat further were Cauerley the standard bearer of the
men of arms, and Clement Paston a pencioner, thrust each of them into the leg
with pikes, and Don Philip a Spaniard in the knee. Diverse other mained and
hurt, and many horses wounded beside. By this time had our fore ward
accordingly gotten the full advantage of the hills side, and in respect of their
march, stood sidelong toward the enemy, who nevertheless were not able in all
parts to stand full square in array, by reason that at the west end of them
upon their right hand, and toward the enemy, there was a square plot enclosed
with turfe (as their manner of fencing in those parts is) one corner whereof did
let the square of the same array. Our battle in good order next them, but so as
in continuance of array, the former part thereof stood upon the hills side,
the tail upon the plain, and the rerewarde led by the Lord Dakers of the
north wholly upon the hill: so that by the placing and countenance of our army
in this wise, we showed our selves in a manner to compass them in, that they
should no way escape us, the which by our power and number we were as well able
to do, as a Spiders web to catch a swarm of Bees. These indiscreet gadlings
that so fondlye brake array from the horsemen in the retire (as I said) ran so
hastily through the orders and ranks of our fore ward, as it stood, that it
both there disordred many, feared many, and was a great encouraging of the
enemy. The earl of Warwick who had the guyding of our fore ward, right
valiantly had conducted ye same to their standing, and there did very nobly
encourage and comfort them, bidding them pluck up their hearts, and show
themselves me^, for there was no cause of fear. But to return unto ye Scots,
they were somewhat disordred with their coming out about the slaughter of our
me^, the which they did so earnestly then entend, that they took not one to
mercy: but more they were amassed at this aduenturous and hardy onset. My Lords
grace having before this for ye causes aforesaid, placed himself on this
Fau^siae Bray, and thereby quickly perceiving the great disorder of these
strag^ng horsemen, hemd the in from further straying, who sir ^^se Va^e sone
after with great dexterity brought in good order again, and therewith ye rest
of our strengths by the policy of my Lords grace, and diligence of every
captain and officer beside, were so aptly applied in their feate, that where
this repulse of ye enemy and retire of us, was doubted of many to turn to the
danger of our less, ye same was wroughte (according as it was devised) to our
gain and victory. For first at this slough where most of our horsemen had
stood, sir Peter Meutas captain of all the hackbutters afoote, did very
valiantly conduct and place a good number of his men in a manner at the faces of
the enemies. Whereunto sir Peter Gamboa a Spaniarde, Captain of two C.
hackbutters on horseback, did readily bring his men also, who with the hot
continuance of their shot on both parts, did so stoutly stay the enemies,
that they could not come further forward: then our archers that marched in
array on the right hand of our footmen, and next to the enemy, pricked them
sharply with arrows as they stood. Therewith the master of the ordinance to
their great annoyance, did gall them with hayleshot, and other out of the great
ordinance directlye from the hill top; and certain other gunners with their
pieces a flank from our rerewarde: most of our artillery and missiue engines
then wholly thus at once with great puissance and vehemency occupied about
them, here with the full sight of our footmen, all shadowed from them before
by our horsemen, and duste raised, whom then they were ware in such order to
be so near upon them: and to this, the perfect array of our horsemen again
coming couragiouslye to set on them a fresh. The miserable men perceiving
themselves, then all to late, how much too much they were misenformed, began
suddenly to shrink. Their governor that brought them first to the bargain,
like a doughtie Captain, took hastily his horse, that he might run
foremoste away. The Earl of Anguishe and other chief Captains did quickly
follow as their Governor led, and with the foremost their Irishmen.
Therewith then turned all the whole route, cast down their weapons, ran out
of their wards, off with their Iackes, and with all that ever they might,
betook them to the race that their governor began. Our men had found them at
the first, and sharply and quickly with an universal outerie, they flee, they
flee, pursued after in chase amain, and thereto so egerly, and with such
fierceness, that they ouertooke many, and spared in deed few. Before this,
at the time of our onsette came there Eastwarde five hundredth of their horsemen
up along this Fauxside ^raye, straight upon our ordinance and carriage. My
Lords grace (as I said) most specially for the doubt of the same, placing
himself thereby, caused a piece or two to be turned toward them: with a few
shottes whereof they were soon turned also, and fled to Dakith. But to
return unto the Scottishe chase, it was continued with blood and slaughter
five miles in length, westwarde from the place of their standing, which was in
the fallowe fields of Vndreske until Edenborough Park, and welny to the
gates of the town it self, and unto Lyth, and in breadth nigh four miles from
the Frith sands up toward Dakith southwarde. In all which space, the dead
bodies lay as thick as a man may note cattle grasing in a full replenished
pasture. And for the smalnesse of our number, and shortness of the time (which
was scante five hours (from one welnie unto six) the mortality was so great,
as it was thought the like before time not to have been seen. In deed it was
the better maintained with their own swords that lay each where scattered by
the way, whereof our men as they had broken one, still took up another, there
was store enough, and they laid it on freely, that right many among them at
this business brake three or four ere they returned homewarde to the army.
There were thus slain in field, of Scotts xiij. thousand of the which
number (as we were certainlye informed by sundry and the best of the prisoners
then taken) beside the Earl of Loghemwor, the Lord Fleming, the Master of
Greym, the master of Arskin, the master of Ogleby, the master of Auendale,
the master of Rouen, and many other of noble birth among them: there were of
Lardes and Lardes sons, and other Gentlemen slain, above xxvj. C. and xv. C.
were taken prisoners, among whom were there of name, the Earl Huntley Lord
Chauncelour of the Realm there, the Lord of Yester, Hobbie, Hambleton Captain
of Dunbarre, the master of Sampoole, the Lard of VVimmes, and a brother of the
Earl of Casselles. Two M. by lurking and lying as though they were dead,
escaped away in the night all maimed and hurt. Herewith wan we of their weapons
and armor more than we would vouchsafe to give carriage for, and yet were
they conneyed thence by ship into these parts, of Iackes specially, and
swords above xxx. M. The camp also was taken well replenished with their simple
victualles, and also some pieces of plate and chalices were found. After this
my Lords grace took the town of Lyth, with thirtene vessels in the haven,
the which he burnt with the town, brought under the English obedience all
Tiuidale, and their marches, all the Lardes and Gentlemen thereof coming in,
and swearing fealty, and within the mids of the land did win (and placed
there garrisons) S. Colmes Ince, and Broughtie crag, a place of great
importance standing at the mouth of the river of Tey, whereby all the use of
the river might be cut from Saint John's town, Dundee, and many other towns in
those parts. And upon Michaelmas day returned over the Twede, with loss not
of above lx. men.

The Battle of Weser fought in Saxony by Morris Duke and Prince Elector of
Saxony and his confederates, against Albert Marquis of Brandenburg, in Anno.
1553. Out of Natalis sins.
WHen that Albert one of the collateral line of the house of Brandenburg,
raged with a great power through Franklande, and Saxony, sparing neither
friend nor foe, he brought his faithful friend Morris Duke of Saxon in his
top, who being aided by the power of Ferdinande king of the Romans, Henry the
Duke of Brunswicke, Philip the Lantgrane of Hessen, the Bishops of
VVirtzpurg, and Bamberg, the city of Nuremberg, and other, did by taking of a
streite, force Albert to fight. The wind blewe with Albert, which does
somewhat help in fight, and also he had taken a little hill that stood in the
plain, and fiest the great ordinance was shot off on both sides, but with
small detriman^ of either army. But although that Albert was inferior unto
his ennimies in horsemen, yet he was very well furnished with eyghtene goodly
Cornets of horsemen, and in footemenne did much ouermatche them. The hosts
began to draw near one unto the other by little and little, and suddenly a
most cruel battle was begun, they fighting on both sides with great valor
and courage. In the mids of the fight, Albert commanded the best of his
horsemenne to charge four Cornettes of Morris his men of arms, the which
was done, both parties approaching one so near unto the other, that for lack
of room they could not break their Lances. The shot encountered together
with noble courage, singular prowes, and incredible alacrity and
charefulnesse. But at the last, Albert being invaded on all parts, and weakened
through the great slaughter and discomfiture of his men, was forced to seek
safety by flight, and fleeing with only eight horsemen, left his defeated
people, his ordinance, furniture, and baggage unto the merciless usage of his
enemies. This battle which was begun in the morning early, continued almost
until night, and was fought in a plain that lies between the Duchies of
Brunswicke and Lunenburg: in the which battle were taken liiij. ensigns of
footmen, and fiftene of horsemen, and there were slain iiij. M. horsemen, and
many footmen. There were taken on Albert his side, of noble men, the Earl of
VVarenberg, and Nicolas Berney, and many other slain. On Morris his part
were slain, Charles Victor, and Philip Magnus, sons of Henry Duke of
Brunswicke, and many other noble men. Many ensigns of Albertes power were
saved, by reason of the great woods that were near at hand, and also of the
speedy approach of the night. But Morris himself being shot into the body
at the battle with a Pistolet, dyed the next day. There were some that
thought he was not wounded by his enemies, but by one of his own familiars, to
whom he had done reproach in former time, the revenge whereof he deferred
until this commodious time. This one adverse battle did so break the power
of Albert, that whereas before he was invincible, a terror unto all Germanye,
and spoiled all states at his pleasure, he was never afterward able to do
any thing, but being anon after again overthrown in fight with his small
power, by Henry the Duke of Brunswicke, was turned out of all his dominions,
and forced to die in banishment.

The Battle of Martiano, fought in the territory of Seen in Italy, betvveene
John James, Marquis of Marignano, General for Charles the v. Emperor of Rome,
and Peter de Strozzi Chiefetaine for Henry the second, King of France, Anno.
1553. Out of Natalis Comes.
ANno domini. 1553. Henry the French king to molest the Emperor Charles in
Italy, sent Peter Strozzi a banished Florentine, and one of the Marshals of
France, to take into his protection the noble city of Seen, and to his
uttermost to endammage Cosmo the Duke of Florence, a faithful favorer of the
Emperor. Which caused Charles to send the Marquis of Marinian his Lieutenant
in Milan, with a power to besiege Seen, the which he was forced to
discontinue, when Strozzi invaded the dominions of the Florentine, whom the
Marquis sought by all means to defend: and made Strozzi to retire again into
Seen, out of the which he came again, after that his power was so augmented,
that he had two thousand Gascognes, and so many Switzers, two thousand five
hundredth Lansquenets, six thousand Italians, and about one thousand
horsemen, with intent not to refuse to join in battle with the Emperials, if
that any good occasion should be offered, although that they were xiiij.
thousand footmen of Italians, Spaniards, and Almaines, and one thousand five
hundredth horsemenne, partlye men of arms, and partly light horsemen. Between
these two hosts passed many bloody skirmishes, and namely one upon the
xxviii. of Iulye, in the which continuing ten hours, were one thousand and
two hundredth slain on the French side: and of the Emperials above four
hundredth. But when both armies had long lodged very near one unto another,
they were in great distress for water, for the which they must continuallye
fight when either men or horses needed it. Moreover, the soldiers being
pinched with penury of victuals, and tired with the continual toil of
skirmishing (ye armies lodging so near together) many weried with this
warfare, dropped away out of the camps by little and little, so that both
armies began thereby to be much weakened. The^ the Marquis of Marinian made
proclamation that al men that would depart from the French camp, should have
safe passage through the Duchy of Florence, and if they would serve the
Emperor, they should have better intertainment than the French king gave
them. And like kind of liberal promises did Strozzi also cause to be
published. On the first of August they skirmished again, in the which conflict
both the horsemen and the footmen of the Emperials having the better, struck
no small terror into the hearts of the Frenchmen. But when Strozzi saw that
by the Italians their slyding away from him, he was brought to weak for his
enemy, he went about by little and little to withdraw his host out of
danger, sending his cariages and ordinance before: but yet so, that he would
not only not seem to fleee, but also of his own accord to offer the battle
unto his enemies, the which yet he thought he should avoid, because it was
so near night. But his counsels being known of the Emperials, were infringed
by them, for they incontinently followed him in array of battle, and light
harquebusiers were sent before to haggle on the backs and tail of the
Frenchmen, and to hinder their march until that the Imperial horsemen could
overtake them, who were gone forth unto the river of Thiane for water. The
Marquis egerly pursuing and following Strozzi, thus ordered his army: He did
cast the Almaines into a square battle, placing the Spaniardes under the
conducte of John de Luna in the left wing, and the Italians in the right. But
the Earl of San Fioria stood with all the Horsemen on the left side at the
foot of the hill called Women's hill, over right against the French horsemen.
But thus were the French battles aranged: A thick battallion of Italian
footmen stood upon the Women's hill directly against the Spaniards, an other of
Gascognes and Frenchmen, and a third of Switzers, the horsemen were set
opposite to the Imperial horsemen, and were guarded with seven hundredth
harquebusiers. Strozzi had before him Martiano, behind him Luciano, on his
left hand Fogliano, and on his right diverse other towns. When both the
armies stood thus aranged in order of battle, and the Marquis was doubtful
whether he should try the fortune of the battle that day or no, he was
impelled through many reasons, and specially by the Spaniardes, to determine to
fight: wherefore after he had given the signal, he got him unto the
rerewarde. For seeing he fought almost against his will, he thought if
that any ill luck happened, he would provide for his own safetye: but if
that all things succeeded well, then he would encourage his soldiers to
follow the victory. As soon as the signal of the battle was given, the
Conte of San Fiora passing over a ditche that ran along the plain, gave the
charge on the French horsemen, who were all led by the Earl of Mirandula.
They fight fiercelye on both sides, but the French men being inferior in
number, and also ouermatched by reason of the strength of the men of arms,
although they were guarded with harquebusiers, were put to slighte and
defeated, the which happened, because that Bighet fled with the chief guydon
as soon as ever the enemy gave the onsette. When this had happened sooner
than could be credited, San Fiora fearing that there was some ambushe laid,
would not at the first suffer his horsemenne to pursue his fleeing enemies,
as the reason of the victory required. But afterward when he certainelye
understood that it was a true slyght and not a feygned, he granted his
horsemenne leave to follow the enemy in chase, which when Strozzi saw, he
utterly casting away all hope of the horsemenne, and their repayring of the
fight, seeing that the pursuing of the Emperialles would grant them no place
to strengthen their course, and to stay and stand, and understanding that he
should be environed round about on all parts, if he did come down into the
plain, but on the other side, if that he stood still on the hill, he should
be very greatly annoyed by the ordinance of the enemies, and besieged, he of
necessity determined to adventure a pitched field. And because the
straightness of the place did so require, he reduced his three battles into
one battle, for that at neither side there was any use of harquebusiers, who
had in their often skirmishes spent all their powder, and emptied their
flaskes. The Emperials standing still, expected the coming and charge of the
French men, and namelye seeing the French footmen and Switzers came forward
very lustilye and couragiouslye, the Emperialles used the benefit of a good
deep ditche that ran cross the plain, near unto the bank whereof, they
placed their foremoste ranks: for it was judged that they which should first
pass over the ditche, would come into great difficulties, and give an easy
victory unto their enemy, by reason of the going down and climbing up again
of the ditch. Now seeing that matters of very great importance are set
before wise Chiefetaynes, as the glory of their armies, Empire, the safety of
their subjects, and all humane felicity, they ought to be most circumspecte
in all things that do appertain unto their honor, and the safety of their
people, and to provide and foresee that those things which are profitable and
good for them, if that they cannot get themselves, yet then at the least to
be sure that they suffer not their ennimie to have them, because that the
commodities of the ennimie, do redounde unto their calamities. For the which
effect, the natures and dispositions both of his own soldiers, and of the
ennimies are to be known, their counsayles and deuyses to be learned out,
their weapons and martial furniture to be understood, and their art in
setting their men in array, and the nature of the place must be viewed: of the
which things if that any one be not well known, or neglected, oftentimes it
brings all the whole state into very great danger. For there is nothing so
perilous as an host aranged in battle against the nimie, for a very light
matter, yea and a very small and vain false rumor may make them to turn
their backs, and flee. But to return unto the battle, the Frenchmen as they
are of nature prone to fight, and ready to adventure all warrelike dangers
to win glory: being nothing at all stayed with the difficulty of the
ditche, go down into it for to give the onset on the Emperials. The
auantgarde, and specially the foremost ranks which consisted of the most
chosen bands of the whole army, was put to flight. The difficulty of this
ditch took the victory almost out of the hands of the Frenchmen, and gave it
without blood unto the Emperials: although that the Frenchmen charging the
Imperial Italians, had defeated the left wing. Then the Marquis fearing least
that all his battles would have the like ill hap, mounting on his horse, got
him unto an hill on the back of all the host, where he might see in what
state his army stood. But anon after when he saw the French battle that had
discomfited his left wing, being enclosed round by the Spaniardes, the
Almaines, and the Florentines to be defeated, and chiefly through the valor of
the Spaniardes, who fought worthily that day, he returned again unto his men,
to incite them to fight. Thus the most flourishing army of Strozzi, ye which a
little before was a terror unto all Tuscan, the which houered over the walls of
the city of Florence, the which threatened slaughter, captivity and fire unto
all the towns of the Florentine Duchy, was in short time overthrown and
destroyed, the Italians fleeing, and the horsemen being discomfited, afflicted,
and put to flight through that ditche, whereby it may plainly appear in how
slipper a place man's state stands, which is subject unto frail and fickle
Fortunes pleasure. But whereas in all matters it is convenient, that men placed
in chief charge avoid errors and dotings, then most specially in martial
affairs, in whom, yea a small error of the Chiefetaine does draw with it the
ruins of Cities and Countries. There were slain in this battle about four
thousand men, and many also were killed with intolerable heat, and many
stifled for thirst, and they for the greatest part were Frenchmen and Switzers.
For the field was foughten the seconds of August. There were taken about an
hundredth ensigns of footmen and horsemen, and diverse field pieces. There were
also taken prisoners by the Emperials two thousand of the enemies. There were
slain of men of the greatest mark, the Lord VVale^o^, the Colonel of the
Switzers, with all his petie captains and ensignebearers, Reuer^ce ye colonel
of the Almaines that were with the Switzers, and John Bentinogli. Of French
captains, Cablas, Conbasse, and John de Ville. Many of the Italians Captains
and all the Captains and Ensignbearers of the Almaines There were also taken
Seignour Forques Galeazzo Bentiuogli, Earl of Gaiazzo, Paul Orsini, Turchett^
Agabito, and Bartholomewe Murena, and many Captains and Ensignebearers. But
Strozzi himself, and Aur^li^ Fregoso, a man of great authority and nobility,
escaped to Monte Aleino, but yet wounded with shot. After this overthrow, the
greatest part of the towns of the Senese territory yielded, and anon after,
the city of Seen it self, when the Citizens could hold out no longer for
famine.

The Battle fought at Saint Quintines in France, between Anne Montmorencie
high Constable of France, and General for Henry the French King, and Emanuell
Philibert Duke of Sau^y, Lieutenant General for Philip King of Spain, in
Anno. 1557. Out of Natalis C^mes.
WHen Emanuell Philibert Duke of Sau^y, Lieutenant General for Philip the king
of Spain, bes^eged the town of Saint Quintines in Vermandois, with thirtene
thousand horsemen, forty thousand footmen, and eight thousand Pioners.
Henry the second, the French king, being moved with the danger of the town
which was unprovided of men, munition, and victuals, to withstand so great a
power, sent Montmorencie the Constable with an army wherein was almost all the
nobility of France, and twenty thousand footmen, and four thousand
horsemen, and twenty pieces of ordinance, to relieve the town with men,
munition, and all other things needful. The Constable being come within xv.
miles of the town, sent before ij. M. horsemen, who after they had vaunted
themselves about noone unto the enemy on a small hill, they commanded certain
to try the foord of ye river which they must pass, ye which was so narrow, ye
not above vj. horsemen could pass over at once: but in other places they could
not pass the river for ye gards of the Spaniards. When the Duke of Sauoy
understood that the Frenchmen had found the foorde, he sent a great number of
harquebusiers to keep it. But the third day after, which was the feast of S.
Laurence, the same horsemen but many mo in number, with many footmen, showed
themselves again unto the Spaniardes, who could not by reason of the
iniquity of the place, perceive what number they were: but the Frenchmen
determined to pass over ye river, having brought with them for that purpose
small boats and bridges. The French ordinance began to shoot off upon the
Spaniardes, and not without their great damage, and the boats began to take
the water, to transport the French soldiers, whom the Spanishe
harquebusiers, unto whom was sent a fresh supply of four hundredth, did much
annoye. Then the Duke also determined to pass over the river, (the which was
three miles from the town) and to fight with the enemy, after that he had by
very faithful espyes learned the number of the Frenchmen. Wherefore the matter
being communicated with the Conte Egmont, who was one of the chief of the
nobility of the low Country for lands, birth, and authority, and also not
unskillful in Martial affairs, and with other of the nobility, it was
resolved that this present occasion should not be let slip, seeing that their
enemy was inferior unto them both in number and strength, Egmont was
commanded to pass over the river with one thousand horsemen of Burgonions
and Spaniardes, and Ernest and Ericke Dukes of Brunswicke should back him
with their two thousand and v. hundredth horsemen: after whom the Conte
Mansfeld followed with eight hundredth Pistolets, and then the Conte Horn with
one thousand men men of arms of Gelders, and with him about a thousand of
other men of arms of diverse bands, passed over the river, and also some light
horsemen, so that they were in all about seven thousand horsemen. They were
not so soon over the water, but Egmont ranged his soldiers against the
Constable, who was come thither to divert the Spaniardes, and to molest them
with skirmishes, until that in another quarter relief might be sent into the
town, for that was the Constables intent, the which when he had done, he
determined to retire back in array of battle, and to save himself through
the benefit of the hills. And in deed by this skirmishing with the
Spaniardes, he opened opportunity unto three hundredth footemenne to enter the
town: but when he saw that Egmontes horsemen, and afterward the whole army
were passed the river, he began to draw back by little and little toward
the hills, skirmishing with the Spanishe light horsemenne, who endeavored to
hinder their flight, until that all the Spanishe horsemenne were come, and all
the footmen had passed over the river. When the French men had given back a
little way, they were forced by the imminent danger to stay, and to set
their men in array of battle: But Egmont who saw that assured victory was
offered him, after that he had stayed a little while, not thinking it good to
omit the present occasion, gave a charge upon the greater troop of the French
horsemen with incredible valor, being backed by the Dukes of Brunswicke with
one thousand pistolets, he admonishes Ernest Duke of Brunswicke, whom the
Earley of Horn, Mau^felt, and Hochstrat should follow, to give the charge on
an other troop of two thousand French men of arms. Ernest with surpassing
courage ran upon the French troop, who met him with like fortitude and
constancy of heart, and at the first sustained the Spanishe force with so
great prowes, that they had almost put them to flight. Thus they fought very
fiercely on both sides, and many were slain, but at length the Frenchmen
being overcome by the number of panish horsemen that still increased, were
forced to retire unto their footemenne by little and little, but when Egmont
and the rest of the nobility followed them fiercely, they came unto the
footmen, who standing close together in thick Esquadron, strongly sustained
the shocke of the Spaniardes. When that the fight had been long time doubtful,
the Duke of Sauoy, sent a fresh troop of horsemen, and willed Egmont: to give
a charge upon the footmen, and not to abuse the benefit of fortune, who had
offered so easy and assured victory: for if he should make any stay, he
thought that thereby the victory would slide away, and be wrested out of
their hand, because that the enemy having by these means leisure granted
them, might gather together, and rely their strength, and c^nstr^^^ their
horsemen, who were almost defeated. When they had thus fought long, and on the
one side Egmont invaded valiantlye; and on the other, the Frenchmen resist
stoutly: at the last, the Frenchmen fled, and reposed all hope of safety in
the sweetness of their feet, whom Egmont and the rest speedily pursued and
quite defeated all the French power. There were taken of the Frenchmen, the
Constable, hurt in the thigh with a Pistolet, the Dukes of Longuile and
Montpensier hurt in the head, the Marshall of Saint Andrewe, Jews, borther
to the Duke of Mantua, Vassy, Gurton, Roth du Maine, the Ringraffe. Colonel of
the French Lansquenets, and all these were of the order: the Conte Rochfocaul^,
the Lords O^eg^y, two Birons, Monbrun, and Merne, (being two sons of the
Constable) and a great number mo. Finally, about two thousand of Noblemen and
Gentlemen, and of all sorts of soldiers, to a four thousand, fifty two
ensigns of footmen, eyghtene guidons of men of arms, and xx. of light
horsemen, xx. pieces of ordinance, of whom ten were battering pieces, the rest
field pieces, iij. C. wagons lade^ with martial furniture and provision, with
a great number of horses. There were slain of Frenchmen, to the number of six
thousand: among whom men of great mark were John Duke of Anghieu, brother
unto the king of ^^au^rre, the Vicont Touraine, nephewe unto the Constable, and
the Lords Campoden^ie, Ey^^ie, Galan, Plenot, Gelot, and many other noble
men. There escaped the Dukes of Neuers and Montmor^ncie, the Prince of Condie,
the earl of Sanxerre, the Lord Burdelion, and great number of other noble
men. But on the Spanishe part were slain somewhat above one thousand, among
whom were of name Binicourt the master of the Camp, two noble men of
German, and diverse other, and the Conte Mansfels was hurt in the thigh, and
Monbrey in the knee. After this victory, the Spaniardes wanne Saint Quintines,
Haron, and Chastellet, and freelye ranged about in those parts all that Summer
without any impeachment.

The Battle fought at Graueling in Flaunders between Monsieur de Terms
Generalt for Henry the second, King of France, and the Conte Egmont
Chiefetaine for Philip the king of Spain, in Anno. 1558. Taken out of the
Commentaries of Jews Guicciardine.
Hot wars continuing still between France and Flanders, Henry the French
K. in June in Anno. 1558. sent from Calice Monsieur de Terms, a valiant and
expert Captain, one of the order, and captain of Calice, with an army of
almost nine thousand footmen, and a thousand and five hundredth horsemen to
road and wast the confines of Flanders. With this army he passing over the
river of Ha, defeated a multitude of peysants, and certain hands of
sduldiours that went about to empeach his passage, and then leaving Graueling
and Burburg on his back, he s^denly by assault took Lunkirke, a town on the
sea coast six leagues from Calice, and after he had sacked it, and left a
garrison therein, he went further into the country, wretchedly wasting with
fire and sword, even unto Newpo^t. To repress this ^a^ing of ^^^^e^, Philip.
the King of Spain, and Duke of Burgen* (...) the ^a^^^ of Eg^^^i^* unto
Flaunders, who joining at Graueling with Monsieur Binic^urt the Camp master,
and sending for the soldiers that lay in garrison at Be^^une, Saint Omers,
Are, Burburg, and other towns adjoining, and also receiving a supply of
soldiers from the Duke of Sauoy, Lieutenant general for the King of all his
low countries, and armies therein, within few days gathered together an
army of twelve thousand footmen, and three thousand horsemen, besides
almost an infinite number of pcysants, who being enraged for the loss of their
goods, and wasting of their lands, flocked thick and three fold from all
parts unto the camp, part armed, and part unarmed. In the mean time Terms
having drawn back his power unto Dunkirke, because he was cruelly molested
with the gout, and smelling out that a shrewd turn was meant him, commanded
the army to depart from Dunkirk, and to encampe within a leage of Graueling,
that he might be the nearer unto Calice. But as soon as he had intelligence
that a great power of the enemies were suddenly gathered together, and that
Egmont was their general, he neglecting his torment of the gout, called for
his horse, and rode incontinently unto the camp, the which was pitched in a
co^modions and well defenced place. Nor long after, Egmont and Binicourt came
in sight with their army aranged in order of battle, and with haughty hearts
lodged within an harquebusse shot of the Frenchmen, and with incredible
ferocitie skirmished with the^ in all quarters. Then Terms calling the
Captains together that same night, because he saw that he was far
ouermatched in number of soldiers, and he was environed in his enemies land,
as it were with an euclosure of infestuous towns, and that the power of the
Burgonions did daily increase, he concludes to flee back unto Calice the next
day along the sea sands when it was low water, and so to escape by the
benefit of nature. At the which opportunity, the Frenchmen, as they had before
determined, came hofully unto the mouth of the river of Ha, where it runs
into the sea above Graueling, and now it being low water, easily passed over
the river. On the other side as soon as Egmont understood of this flight of
the Frenchmen, h^speedily passed over the river beneth the town, that he might
stop the passage of the fleeing enemy. This was done the xiij. of July. Then
he met with the enemy on the front about Calice since, and in the sight of
Graueling: Here when Terms saw that he was intercluded from his intended
journey, he serving the time, wholye prepared to fight, and when the broad
sealaye on the one side of him, but on the other a plain without any tree,
bushe, hill, or any other impediment, and he coueted to have the place of most
advantage, as much as might be, he aranged his host in this order: he
deflected all his army on the right hand northward, on the which quarter the
sea flowed, and therefore did well defense the one side, but on the left hand
Southwarde, he did set the wagons for a trenche, and his back was guarded with
the river of Ha. So that the Frechmen being safe on all other sides, lay open
unto the Burgonions only at the front, where before their ranks they placed
all their ordinance, which were six Culnerings, and three Falcons, yet so,
that large spaces were left between for the horsemen: that by this means,
both the ordinance, and also the incursions of the horsemen might at once
infest the enemies, both sides of which horsemen were flanked with Gascons
harquebusiers. The rere ward and third battle consisted of Frenchmen and
Lansquenettes, who stood at the backs of the horsemen with blended ranks,
Lansquenets and Frenchmen together, that they might succor their fellows, if
that need should be. But although that Egmont had no ordinance (which had
been left behind, that they might march the more speedily) yet he not greatly
forced that his enemies did therein ouermatch him, for he trusted chieflye in
prowes and valor. He then knowing that the enemies had bewraied their fear by
their premeditated flight, and that they meant to drive away with them a mighty
booty, communicating his devise with ye captains, determines incoutine^tly to
fight, least ye Terms might else escape out of his hand by the coming of
fresh aid, nothing regarding the common Prove the: that we must not only give
way unto our sheing enemy, but also make a want for him. Egmont encouraging
his soldiers to fight, does thus arange the^. He deuideth all the horsemen into
five troops, commanding the light horsemen to ride before in three troops,
of whom the Earl of Ponteuaules a Flemming, governed the right wing, and
Eriques a Biscaian the left: but the middle battle Egmont reserved for
himself. Behind the light horsemen followed and troop of Reysters with
Pistolets, and then a troop of men of arms of the low Countrymen, a certain
space being left between either of the battles. Then were all the footmen
divided into three hattels: the footmen were high Almaines, Nederlanders,
whose regiment was greatest, and certain bands of old Spanishe footmen: they
were led by their Colonels, Hilmaner of Mumchausen, Binicourt, and Caruatal The
army being thus aranged, Egmont cried out with a loud voice, we have
vanquished: All that have regard of their own praise, or the glory of their
country, let him follow me, and setting their spurs unto their horses,
run in with me among the thickest of our enemies. And suddenly as soon as he
had spoken the word, be giving the signal, ran forth. The prepared Frenchmen
do manfullye sustain the charge of the Burgonions, and with their ordinance
commit great: slaughter in the foremost ranks, so that Egmonts borse fell
down under him. But the Burgonions being nothing appalled with this chance,
valiantly insist in their enterprise, and are carried with all their whole
strength upon the c^imie, by the admonishment and impulsion of Egment.
Incontinently all ye hattels on both sides join together, they fight with
swords, lances, pykes, harquebusses, pystolets, halbards, and al other
weapons. The troops of horsemen encounter one the other, and so likewise the
footmen: finally they fight with handstrokes, setting foot to foot: whether
this happened by chance, or whether it was provided by the industry of the
captains, certes it seemed a strange and also a marvelous thing, yea unto
those that were skillful in martial affairs, who did plainly say, that it had
not happened in our age, that any battle was fought with such equality of all
ranks, and orders, and weapons, and joined together in such indifferent sort.
Thus they fought very sharply a long and doubtful battle. For although the
Lansquenets stood still, and fought not, yet the valor of the Gascons footmen
was so great, that they supplied the others dastardie, and with their strength
sustained almost all the brunt and force of the battle: for the Lansquenets
standing still, as it were men separated from them, and left a certain space
of, the Gascons flewe upon the urging Burgonions, they resisted them, and with
haughty hearts received their anpression. The French horsemen also
encountered, but more slowly and dissolutely than their wont is, neither as it
became Gentlemen of their quality, although that according unto the manner of
that nation they were chosen men, and very well and bravely appointed with all
furniturie and horses. Moreover, while that they fought so valiantly, and with
so great contention of hearts, that neither party would turn their fares, a
strange and marvelous chance happened: for at the same time ten English
ships chanced to sail by, who descrying the encounter when they were in the
maine sea, made toward them, and it being full sea, came near unto the shore,
and with their ordinance did beat the side of the French army, the which we
sold you before, lay full upon the sea. The French men being dismayed with
this sodeyne chance, began to be in great fear, distrusting that mo ships
would come unto them. But on the other side, the Burgonions pressed the more
instantly, and when they had defeated the horsemen, anon after they also
disordered the footmen, and so at the last quite overthrew and defeated all the
whole French power, not without great honor generally of all orders, but
chiefly of the light horsemen, and particularly of Egmont, who deserved the
high commendation both of a wise chieftaine, and also a valiant soldier,
through whose approved noble courage, and valiant heart that notable victory
was chiefly gotten, but yet so that the rest of the Captains deserved
singularprayse, as Monsieurs Binicourt, Renty, Rues, Enriques, Ponteuauls,
Font^ynes, Hilmaner of Munichausen, and Caruaial. On the other side Thermes who
had the overthrow, is reproved of many for carelessness and also sloth, for
that he had ouerlong deferred his return, and had not at the least removed his
camp the night before the fatal field: for the report was, that he of
covetousness ^eking to get a very rich booty of the spoil of Flaunders, did
pretermit a fit opportunity of free regresse: But some do affirm that he
stayed in Flaunders by the Kings commandment, to whom, the rumor was, that
the King had appointed to send aids. But howsoever the matter was, doubtless
Terms erred in this, that he suffered himself to be intercluded by that
means, and after a sort to be oppressed. But of the number of the slain,
there were diverse reports, as it always happens in the bruites of the
people: but we diligently enquiring the truth, have heard of men most worthy
of credit, and of those soldiers that were present at the battle, that
there was a public note taken of about one thousand five hundredth slain in
the battle. But of them that fled, far the most were slain by the
peysantes, who had gotten them into the streyghtes, through which the
discomfited Frenchmen did seek to escape. Besides the great slaughter, foul
ignomie also happened unto the French men: for the Flemmishe women as well of
the towns as country, like Lacedemonian viragoes, assembled together in great
troops, and when they metts with a French man, they would rail upon him for
that he had wasted Flaunders, spoiled their towns, and burnt their houses, and
when one of them could not kill him, many of them would flee upon him, and
pitifully tear him with their nails, or beat him well and thriftily with
their Distaues. That in the mean time they may be wrapped in deep silence,
whom either the river swallowed up, or the sea and tide overwhelmed. But the
English men leaving their ships at anchor, rowed in the long Boats unto the
shore, and took alive about two hundredth of those Frenchmen that swimmed in
the sea, who^ although they might have drowned, yet moved with sweetness of
glory, they did take up into their Boats, that thereby they might as it were
partakers and helpers of that hattell, be able to show at home in England
sure witnesses of so famous a victory: the which few they having gotten of
many, did unto their ignomie transport into their coutrie, as it were for a
triumph. Moreover, of those that being intercluded from flight, were taken
prisoners, (of wh^^^e there were a great number) these are numbered for the
chief: first of all, the Lord Terms the General of the army and Captain
of Calice, who had received a grievous wound, not only in his fortune, but
also in his body, and with him the Lords Danebault Villebon, and Simarpont,
and many other men of very good quality, whom for breuities sake we do
pass over in silence. Moreuer, they lost all their ensigns, ordinance,
munition, bag, and baggage, and all the furniture of the camp, and also all
the booty that they had gotten in Flaunders fell unto Egmont and the
Burgonions. There (...) slaygie on Egmont his part fine hundredth and not above.
But among them was Monsieur de Pelew a noble manne of the law country, with
some number of horsemen and footmen that were of great mark, and accounted
among the chief. Those three hands whom we told you Terms had placed in
Lunkinke, when that he departed unto the camp, he commanded to sack and sire
the town, and streyghtwaye to follow him, the which they did, but being
intercluded by the victors Burgonions, they were slain every man. This noble
victory no doubt did much repress the insolency and ferocitie of the
Frenchmen, that then had a great power in the Duchy of Luxenburg, and made the
French king very glad to incline unto peace, the which did take effect
within few months after.

The Battle of Dreux fought in Normandy between Jews of Burbon prince of
Conde, and Anne Montmorencie high Constable of France, in the year of our
Lord 1562. Taken out of the Commentaries of the state of Religion, and the
Common wealth in France.
WHen that the furious civil wars in France for religion, brake out in Anno
domini. 1562. the Prince of Conde General for the resormed religion, marched
into Normandy to join with the English arm that their was landed at New
haven, to empeach the which purpose, the power of the contrary faction under
the conducte of Anna Montmorencre the Constable, hasted from Paris, and came
with great armies into the ^erriforie of Dreux, where Conde also had stayed:
and the two armies lodged within two leagues one of the other. The Catholics
had chosen a commodious place to lodge in, being near unto the town of Dreux,
wherein they had a garrison, and unto diverse villages, and also unto a wood,
which was good for all sodeine defenses of uncertain event. There lay between
both their camps, a long and even plain, only in one part there was a little
valley between them. When Conde saw that his ennimies were come so near unto
him, he consutting with his associates what was to be done, determined to give
them battle, that the end of the whole matter being committed unto the
providence of God, the long lingering calamities of the wars might be more
speedily ended. And yet his enemies did far ouermatche him in footmen, for
they had six and twenty thousand, whereas the Conde had scarce eleven
thousand, but it was partlye recompensed in his horsemen, he having almost
four thousand, where his enemies had but three thousand. The next morning a
little before eight of the clock, the Prince brought forth all his army, the
which he had so aranged, that the horsemen wherein he was the stronger, should
be in the foremost ranks: he himself led the battle with Rochfocault,
taking to him certain light horsemen of Cureys his company, and placing on
the one side of him the cornets of horsemen led by Money and Auarell, and on
the other side certain cornets of Reysters. But the auntgarde was guarded by
Chastillion the Admiral, with the Prince of Porcien, setting close unto them
two troops of horsemen consisting of certain cornets. Then followed a strong
battallion of Lansquenets, and five hundredth loose shot, whom they do call
Enfans perdus, who marched a little before the battallion. Then was there
placed a strong Esquadron of xxiij. ensigns of French footmen to guard the
great ordinance, and this Esquadron was guarded with a wing of Reystres. Thus
Conde went toward the enemy in array somewhat broad and deep. But his
enemies were ready aranged in this order: the Duke of Guise led the one wing of
the auantgarde with a strong troop of horsemen, nere unto who^ stood two
Esquadrons of Spaniardes footmen, and of French footmen, old soldiers
with fouretene pieces of ordinance, and the Marshall of Saint Andrews guided
the other wing with a strong troop of horsemen, and was guarded on the one side
with a battallion of Lansquenets, and on the other with a battallion of
horsemen. Of the maine battle the Constable led one wing with a strong troop
of horsemen, near to whom were placed a battallion of seuentene ensigns of
French footmen, whom there followed xxij. ensigns of Switzers, with eyghtene
pieces of great ordinance, the other wing his soune Danuille led, with a
strong troop of horsemen. Thus stood the battles of the Catholics in great
length, on a row, here footmen and there horsemen being still interserted. The
Admiral stood over right against the Constable, and Conde against Danuille
and the Switzers, but no body against Guise and the Marshall of Saint
Andrews, who were in the auantgarde. Conde first gave commandment that the
soldiers should be present at divine service, and that being ended, he
ryding about unto the ranks, abhorted them to constancy and confidence: and
having thus prepared their hearts, he gave the signal, and he himself, Curey
going before with the light horsemen) charged upon the Switzers in that part
where he saw they were bared of horsemen, and strongly brake through them,
Rochfocault in the mean time standing still. The Switzers at the first stoutly
sustained the charge, partly through the power of their ordinance, and also
the strength of their own weapons, but yet through the thick hayle of the
shot; they began to give ground, and anon after not being able to bear the
force of the horsemen their Lances brake their array, and forsook the great
ordinance, and were scattered, the Condeans raging with great slaughter. And
almost at the same moment the Admiral charged the Constable, and in the mean
time the upper troops of the Reysters ryding unto Danuils troops, skirmished
with their pistolets. When Conde had with great slaughter defeated and put to
flight the Switzers, he gave a charge on the next battallion of French
footmen, and breaking through their ranks, discomfited and put them to
flighte. But there was a furious fight between the Admiral and the
Constable: but at length the Constable his men begaune to shrink back, and
after that the Constable being wounded in the face with a Curtelace, and sore
bruised with small shot of pistolets, was taken, they fled, the Admiral and
Conde pursuing them. But while that Conde his horsemen, were busied in pursuing
of the enemy, the French and Almaine footmen were left naked, which Danuill
espying, charged upon the Almaine footmen, who fled at the first sight of the
enimye, toward a village called Blinuill. Then a strong troop of Guises
horsemen gave a charge on the French footmen, and brake their array, and quyte
defeated them at the first shocke, taking the ordinance, and committing great
slaughter, yet when that diverse of the French footmen fought couragiouslye,
many of the Guisian horsemen were slain. Moreover Danuill seeing Conde his
horsemen to be disordered and dispersed by pursuing the Switzers, and the
Constables troops, charged upon them, and wounding the Conde with a Pistolet,
and vnhorsing him, did take him prisoner. When the Admiral saw his fellows
fleeing in all places, and also the Reysters giving back unto a wood in a
thick troop after their guyse, that when they had recharged their Pistolets,
they might lustily altogether recharge the ennimie, (the which usage of theirs
being unknown unto many, did put them in great fear, they suspecting them
to flee) and finally when he perceived that all the Condeans were now in
despair because that Conde was taken prisoner, he was very pensife, namely
when he saw three mighty troops of horsemen of the auantgard of the enemy
(wisely reserved by Guise for the last brunt) to make toward him. In these
troops were the Marshall of Saint Andrewe, the Dukes Daumall and of Neuers,
and other noble men: but they say that the Duke of Guise stood still with
other bands that had not yet fought, for to behold the end of the battle:
then the Idmirall speedilye relying all the French and Almaine horsemen that
he was able to make, and also by the return of those Reisters that I said
went aside unto the wood, their hearts being confirmed, stoutlye sustained
the charge of their enemies. Then there began a sharp encounter, both sides
fighting full suriouslye (their hearts being constantlye set to murder one
another) with almost equal fortune: yet the Guisians gave ground, and by
little and little drew back, and more grievous had been the fight, namelye
the soldiers of Conde being chased, if that the night had not parted them,
who were wearied with long labor of fight. Both parts caused the retire to
be sounded, and returned unto their Camps. The Admiral for lack of horses
left four field pieces behind him. In this last encounter were slain the
Marshall of Saint Andrews with a Pistolet after he was taken, Monbrun the
Constables son, the Lord Piennes, the grand Prior, one of the Guises, two
Brosseys, Giures, Anneboult, and a great number of other of the Nobility,
Daum^ll was grieuouslye hurt, and also Neuers who died thereof, and many
other, and an hundredth of the nobler sort were taken prisoners, and also
certain of the order, as Beau^ay^, Ro^^fort, ^t. Of the faithful or
Protestants Mouy and diverse other noble men and Captains were either taken or
slain. God so mode rated the event of so great a battle, that neither part
could be said either to have won, or to have lost the field: for on the
part of the faithful, was Conde the patron of the cause taken, and on the
Catholics their side, the Constable was taken, and the Marshall of Sains
Andrews slain. And as the faithful flewe a great number of the Catholics
their footmen, so did the Catholics of the faithful their footmen: but mo
horsemen were slain on the Catholics part, and also footmen, for of the
xxij. ensigns of the Switzers few were saved. but Conde his loss was more
difficill to be borne and repaired: but Guise being better furnished for the
wars, had great incommoditie by the loss of so many great Captains and
noblemen, as were there slain and taken. This battle was fought the xix. of
December. The Admiral gathering together his power, returned unto Orleans, and
the Guise unto Paris, either of them to repair their sore weakened armies.

The Battle fought at Saint Dennis near to Paris in France, between Jews
of Burbon Prince of Conde, and Annas Montmorencie Constable of France, in Anno.
1567. Taken out of the book entitled, The true and entier history of the
troubles and things memorable, which have happened as well in France as in
Flaunders and the country about, since Anno. 1^62. supposed to be made by the
Lord.
ANno 1576. Jews of Burbon Prince of Conde, the Admiral, Iaspar Lord
Chastilion, and other their confederates doubting their safety, and suddenly
leuying a power, sought to famishe Paris, whither the King was fled from
Meaulx: but Montmorencie the Constable as soon as he had received power from
all parts, issued out of the City of Paris, to fight with the Confederates or
Protestants, who were encamped at the town of S. Denis, the which is a place
renoumed for the Coronation of the French Kings, and the rich and excellent
tombs of many Kings that do lie buried in the Abbey of that town. A little
from it on the right side is Saint Ouin, as on the left the village of
Auberuilliers. The Prince lodged at S. Denis, making the form of a battle,
the Admiral at S. Ouin, and Ienlis at Auberuilliers with their retinues, to be
unto the Prince as it were two auantgardes. More upon the right hand toward
Paris stands a house of religion called Montmortre on an hill. Between Paris
and Saint Denis (which are two small leages one from the other) there lies a
great and large plain, so even and vncumbred, that one may see from the one
end of it unto the other. This plain is as it were divided into two parts by
a long and large causey which leads straight from Paris to S. Denis. Close
unto Saint Denis on the side of the Causey as one goes toward Saint Ouin,
there is a great quarter assigned for to keep a great fair in, it is called
Landit, where there stands a Chapel which served the Protestants to place
the Corpse du guard of Saint Denis, as the Catholics had theirs at a place
called la Chappelle, as one goes out of Paris. The Catholics had in their
army of horses of fight (I do not account them that served but only for a
number and show) three thousand, and four score ensigns of footmen, which
might amount unto eyghtene thousand men. Two thirdes of the Catholic horsemen
were companies of men of arms and the ordinances of his majesty. Few light
horses, and no harquebusiers on horseback at all. The men of arms (which were
the two thirdes of all the horsemen) were mounted and armed to the advantage,
the men in complete harness, and their horses all barded, and caparaconned
with chansraines, and the horsemen in stead of little Pistolets many bare with
their Lance a Pistole, and some a mass of arms, but most were only Lances.
The light horsemen were well horsed, and wore on their head a Sallet,
Bourguignomie, or other such habilliment, with a Cairasse hause, colbracates,
long tassettes, Gantlets, and a case of Pistolets at the Pummell of his Saddle,
with a tocke or Coutelas hanging at his side. The enfignes and guidons of the
men of arms were charged with crosses, as also were the ensigns of the
footmen, to make a diversity between them and those of the Protestants. The
footmen were divided into three gross battallions (except those harquebusiers
which rested at the Chapel, and those that flanked certain companies, which
made the left of the Constable) who might amount unto fiftene or sixtene
thousand men. One battallion was of six thousand Switzers, Pykemen, whose
thick and close hedge does well dare to abide the shocke of the strongest
horsemen of the world, except the fury of the men of arms of France, armed
and barded as aforesaid, who have often times broken and defeated them. They
were armed with a bourguignoune, a Cuirass^, furnished with a gorget, tassets,
long bracats, and gantlets, and many had sleeves of mayle, also the three
regiments of French footmen were no otherwise armed, unless it were the
harquebusiers, who had nothing but a Morion, for the most part of them (but the
chiefest had Cuirasses on their backs) for to be the more nimble and light for
to skirmishe. Their white cross distinguished them from the Protestants, and
they namely those that were light armed as harquebusiers, wore a mandile, or
such another habit marked with a number of white crosses, that they might not
be taken for the Confederates. But the Protestants had not above half their
army at Saint Denis, for Dandelot and Montgommerie were sent to take Poissy
and Ponthoise, la Noue to take Orleans, and the Conte de la Rochfoucault and
Mouye were gone against the troops that were levied for them in Guien and
Poitou, to safe conducte them to the Camp: all which things being known unto
the Constable, made him to haste that he might take the profit of this
advantage. But of the fouretene or sixtene hundredth horsemen of the
Protestants, not one was armed with all pieces, both because they dislodged
hastilye at the commandment of the Prince, as also for the weakness of
their horses, who were almost all Curtalles, and such like base horses, so
that there was not one harded or caparaconned, but they were armed like light
horsemen, the two thirdes of them having only a helmet, or bourguignonne, a
gorget, a euirasse, bracats, tassets, gantlets, and a couple of Pistolets, and
after they had shot off them, they would set their hand unto their tocke and
Coutelas. The Cassockes of the Protestants were white, begarded with such
colors, as the devise of the Captain did demand. All their footmen were
harquebusiers well enough furnished, the third part of whom had a Morion for
all their defense, with a white scarf for to discern them from the
Catholics: they also had their Ensigns of diverse colors beguarded with the
devise of the Captain, in lieu of a cross which the Catholics bore. Now I
come to declare the intents and purposes of ye two Chieftaines of the armies.
The Constable seeing the small number, and the ill assured lodging of the
Protestants, resolved to fight with them. And because he saw that Saint Ouin
and Auberuilliers were the defenses of Saint Denis, not once thinking that the
confederates would be so bold as to come into the field, considering their
small number, and to make head unto so great an army as followed him, and
specially seeing that they had not one Canon (because that since they took the
field, they had not any town that could furnishe them) determined to drive
the Protestants out of those two villages into Saint Denis, and there to
besiege them, and make them yield at his pleasure. In very deed the
Protestants would rather have refused (if they had been assured of their
coming) than have accepted the battle: but because they had intelligence but
in the morning, that the footemenne were issued out of Paris, and that the
Constable was resolved to dislodge, necessity to say the truth more than good
will, brought them to the fight, the which they would have presented, if
that Dandelot and Montgommerie had been there with their bands, who then lay
before Poissy, yet nevertheless they were resolved in no case to give the
charge before it were toward the Evening, if it could be possible, both as
well for to cover and the better to favor their retraite, if they should be
pursued, as also by so doing, to take away from the Catholykes the felicity
of an entier victory and journey: and finally that in the mean time Dandelot
who had been sent for, might haste with all diligence to be there in time. Upon
this general resolution the Constable issued out of Paris, and leaving the
Chapel, whither he sent a good number of harquebusiers, marched with his
army straight unto the villette, for to stretche out his army in length for
to take the commodity of the field, and to stand more like unto an hedge,
than any thing else. On the left side whereof he did set the battallion of the
Switzers, flanked with a good number of French harquebusiers, and all these
stood for to assure fouretene pieces of artillery which he had placed in ye
mouth of Auberuilliers, toward the which he made the most part of his army to
turn head: he encamped a regiment of horsemen on the left side of the
Switzers, and did set before them one great troop of horsemen, as it were to
cover them, the Captain of the which troop was Mareschall Montmorencie his
eldest son. He had on his left side the regimentes and companies of the
Dukes of Nemours, Longueuille, ye Conte de Rez, Chauignie, de Thoree, Lansac,
and many other: close to the which companies stood one good troop of
harquebusiers on foot. Behind those horsemen, and toward the Chapel was
the regiment of footmen of the Parisians, who did all glister almost with
armor, Pykes, and Halbardes, and did hide the left side of the army
Catholic, the middle and the principal force whereof did the Switzers and the
Constable make. On the right side of the Switzers were the regiments of the
Conte Brissac, and Strozzi On the right side more higher, did the companies of
the Mareschall Cosse, Biron, ye Vicont de Auchy, la Riuiere, and diverse other
which stood more near to Auberuilliers, showed themselves: behind whom more
low than the villet or small town, stood the Duke de Aumaule, and Mareschall
de Anuille, assisted on both sides with two troops of horsemen, as it were for
the assurance of the Switzers, and the French footmen. But now we will show the
disposition of the army Protestant. When that the Prince had intelligence upon
a sudden, that the Catholics were issued out of Paris, drawing with them the
artillery, he well knew that the day would not pass without fight. And
therefore all the companies being advertised, came into the field, being fully
resolved for to accept the fight if they were forced, although that their
fellows were not come, and stretched out themselves (which thing only rested
for them to do) in this form. As their army had been divided before that time
into three parts, so they now also made three troops. The Admiral being
assisted with Clermont of Ambois, his two sons, Renty, and six cornets of
horsemen, and with four hundredth harquebusiers on foot, who followed the
horsemen, and were led by Valefeniere, placed himself above Saint Ouin, as it
were for to cover and defend his lodging right in the face of those that
guarded the side of the Constable. To the same end Ienlis being accompanied
with Lauardin, Vardes, Bressant, Besancourt, and v. or vj. cornets whom three
hundredth footmen harquebusiers followed for to help them at the prick of the
charge, made the other horn, and the form of a left auantgarde, before his
lodging at Auberuilliers, (against the which they saw that the Catholics had
made head, and bent the greatest force of their army) directly against Biron
and the rest before mentioned. To prevail the better against whom, they had
made a ditche from Auberuilliers, even unto a Windmill, which is between the
village, and the villet, the which ditch, and the Windmill it self, they had
filled with many of the best harquebusiers that they had, for to salute them
that would come to seek them. The Prince of Conde, the Cardinal of
Chastillon, Sechelles, (who under title of Lieutenant conducted the company of
the Duke of Angieu) with the two Vidames of Chartres and of Amiens, the Contes
of Saux, and of la Suze, of Esternay, Brouchauanes, and Stuart accompanied with
certain Scots, with four hundredth harquebusiers, stood lower inform of the
battle covering Saint Denis, and all that run behind the cross which is
upon the causey, and the Chapel of Landet, right in the face of the
Constable, and of them that were before him: All the Cornettes stood along in
a row like unto an hedge, and their horses were ranged front to front, in such
form as they meant to fight. The cause of this array (it may be so) was lack of
men to make an entier battallion, or because it is most ordinary among the
Frenchmen, who use the Lance: or to the end they might charge altogether, and
not one tarry behind an other as most do in battallions. The footmen were
divided into three troops, as they were before, and they carried no ensigns,
but being all harquebusiers, they served for Enfans perdus, who as the most
assured and resolute to fight, do bear death engraven upon their foreheades,
as well for themselves, as for those that they first attach. These
harquebusiers followed good and near unto the horsemen, but when it came unto
the point that they should go unto the charge, they should advance
themselves forth before upon the sides for to shoot right and with assurance
upon the first of the Catholics, that would join with the Protestants, as you
shall hear. So that the disposition of their army was in the form of a
Moon, more than of any thing else, if that their companies had been joined
together, and had stood nearer and closer one unto another. But as I told you
before, they were divided into three parts, of whom the troops of the Admiral
and Ienlis made as it were the two horns of the Croisant, whereof the battle
of the Prince made the but or bottom, and the mids was stronger than the
ends, who not having so many Lances and horsemen were more clear, thin, and
less furnished of men. They had all their forces in the field, for thinking
that none could come unto S. Denis, but that they must first defeat them
who covered their lodgings, they left none there, but their Pikemen and
Holbarders, who not being inowe in number, and sufficient for to make a
battallion of Pykes in that plain, they would have to remain in the town for
to guard the baggage, and the Ensigns of the harquebusiers. Neither was it
long before that a skirmish was attached on the side of Auberuilliers. The
artillery began to thunder, and was shot off four V^lees, but did little
harm: yet some died thereof dismembered, and other were so hurt that they
cursed them all their life after: the skirmishe is reenforced, the space
between the troops is now covered with the horsemen that flee about to the
taking, ye ruin, and the death one of another: his is it that causes some to
turn the noses of their pieces for ^o shoot right on the battle, this is it
that makes Ienlis (when he saw that the light attaches waxed still hoter and
hoter, and increased every moment, fearing that the Catholics would not charge
his troops in gross (to go unto the Prince to demand of him if he were not of
ye advise that he might charge according to the occasion and estate of the
skirmishe. But as he returned with permission to do it, he saw that Vardes was
in fight. For the chief Captain seeing that the Catholics augmented their
number upon the skirmishers, had no sooner made them to retire, but that two
companies marched for to ouerrunne them. Then was he constrained to take part,
to range and close together his men as well as he could, and having desired
them not to break their array, and to charge with might and main, and to
entersuccour one another, he auaunced apace for to receive the Catholics, who
changing their pace into a trot, reencountred them with such fury, that the
most assured made their Lances to flee into shiuers, the other that could not
assign so right, peerced the bodies of the horses: all in general came unto
the Pistoles and Coutelas, which hasted death to above fifty in that first
charge, and there were a good many more hurt that fought not after, namely by
reason of the pellets which the harquebusiers that were in the trench made to
rain upon them that first came to attach Vardes, who perceiving that he
should not be long able by reason of his small number to stand up against the
Catholics that came to renforce their first men, retired by little and little
for to rallye his men with the help of the ditche, out of the which came such
a strong salve of harquebusses, that many made conscience for to approach near
unto it. At the same ^yme Ienlis (who had assured the rest of his fellows,
that he had left the Prince and the Admiral (who were ready upon the point
to go unto the charge) fullye resolved to die all of them before that the
Catholics should gain upon them one foot of ground, and less of honor)
encouraged them so much, that without making any oration (but only going before
his troops as guide ^he was followed of them all: after that he had made the
harquebusiers to come forward, who being assured by the countenance of their
horsemenne, would meet in the face the foremoste of the Catholics that
would present themselves, who (no otherwise than the noble Greyhounde does
grow in courage for the first pinche that he has given unto the chafed beast,
and as you see the gentle Faucon to founder and to encourage her self the more
upon a bird of pray, because that she has once given her a grype with her
tallons:) so in like manner they were allured out to the entier hazard of a
journey by the encounter of Vardes. They being all rallyed and incorporated
under their Ensigns, had (it might be) laid on the ground all the Cornets
Protestants, if that their harquebusiers, who had now cleared and made thin
the foremost and most strongest ranks, had not caused the courage of many to
quayle, so that they charged no more so courageously, and therewithal to they
were received with a resolution so hard, and reencountred with such
pertinacie, that the greatest evil fell upon themselves. The first charge of
Ienlis was more cruel than the second, although that the least of the three
was very bloody for the death of many brave gentlemen that never after struck
blow with the sword. But this is true, that neither obstinate desperateness,
nor the help of the harquebusiers could have sure warranted them to stand up
long, seeing that the most of the forces Catholic turned into that quarter, if
that the mortal charges of the Prince and the Admiral had not made many to
turn tail, whilst that Ienlis and many of his companions entertained the
fight against the hotest of the Catholics, giving leisure unto them that were
most wearied with so long and furious a fight, to remain quiet, and aranged in
battle, and to prepace themselves for the first occasion that should present
it self unto them. Now cast your eyes toward Saint Ouin, and you shall see
the Admiral well forward, and also immediately followed by the Prince and all
the rest of the army, who would give and receive their part of blows. You
have seen the good mean that the Catholics had to prevail with their
artillery, and how it served them. During the time of this great thunder, the
Captains of both armies waited for ye time of their charge, and the
commandments of the Generals, namely the confederates, who found the tunes
of that Music more than very violent, and all according with their
intention, because they had not one Canon for to answer to that s^^ching
diuelrie, which vomited so many curses upon them, sometime to high, and
oftentimes more low than the gunners thought, but always doing less hurt
than the General Catholic desired. Hereupon the Admiral had no sooner found
his advantage, but that he sent to advertise the Prince of all that he had
marked concerning the state of the Catholics, who stayed not long after to
follow him. The Conte of Colignie made his harquebusiers to hasten their pace,
and having made them to advance themselves on his side, they served him to so
great purpose, that the reencou^ter was through them much the more fortunate
unto him. At the same instant he so lustily charged the red Coats, and those
troops that were near unto them on the left side (who had come to seek him)
that they were not able long time to sustain the furious pursuit, and were in
the end chaced even unto the Chapel. Those men that have flight more
natural and ordinary than resolution in such affairs, canassure you, that
troops broken and hotly pursued, have no discretion and consideration of the
places through which they pass for to save the prison of the soul. This
caused the greatest part of them to make way with the force of their horses
(who had their sides scorched) through the Parisian bands, whom they very
much brake, and also much more affrighted, so that they were not able long time
after to reassure them out of the trembling and fear of Saint Denis. And not
only the footmen were discouraged, but also many of the brave horsemen had
augmented the number of the other companies. Upon this the Mareschall Cosse
seeing those of Ienlis his regiment to retire by little and little (after that
he had appointed certain companies for to make head if they would begin
again) made all the rest of his troops to turn directlye toward the
encounter, whereof we now come to speak, sending one to desire the Mareschall
Danuill and the Duke of Aumalle, to follow him to the charge which he went to
give (the which they promised him to do) and so much the more, for that he saw
many catholics so afrighted, that they disbanded themselves, and also the
Protestaintes cried in that quarter, victory, victory, as though they had
been assured of the gain of the field. In another place, and for the same
occasion, Chauignie advanced himself, and without cheapening, gave into the
troop of Cleremont, who because he had been sore hurt at the first charge,
would not sustain the shocke, but retired with a great pace from that charge,
which was mortal to many of the Consederates. Although that I can not
express unto you but one feate of arms at once, yet imagine you that all the
troops, or at the least two thirdes of them were at one time encountering
together to the ruin of the weaker, and the less happy: think you that the
charges were diverse, and that in diverse places many troops did charge one
another at once. The Prince was that same time in the mids of the Catholics:
for as soon as he saw the Admiral charge, he made his men to depart with
such diligence, that the harquebusiers that should have assisted him, could
not follow, nor do any service that was of advantage unto him. He
dismarching, went directly as it were, for to join with the Admiral, that
they might both together charge the Constable, and those that made his left
side, doubting that the Admiral alone was not able to work the effect: but he
had not gone far, but that the Mareschall de Montmorencie (who covered his
father) made all his power to dismarche to give him on the side, and to put his
power to flight, the which he had without doubt done, if that certain which
had cast their eye into that quarter, had not advertised the Prince thereof,
who at the same instant, turned head unto all his troops, and encouraged them
according as the time, and the near being of the Catholics would permit: He
the Vidame of Chartres, the Cardinal of Chastillion, and many other ran
amayne upon the Constable, while that the rest of his troops employed
themselves to make head to ye Marshall de Montmorencie. Now, whither because
all the troops of the Prince did not afronte their enemy with equal fury
and pertinacie, or (the which I do rather believe) for that the one were better
sustained than the other, without doubt, the two charges had far diverse
events, for the Prince marched against his part with such violence, that be
euerthrowe them, being appalled with the long and fearful flight of their
companions, whom the Admiral had also before chased, and made such a hole or
breach in the great battallion, that the Constable being abandoned by above a
thousand run awayes, and finding himself hurt in the face, and enclosed and
pressed to yield by Stuart a Scot, could not for choler to see things frame so
ill, answer otherwise, than with blows of his sword, with the pummell
whereof he gave Stuart so hard upon the Iawbones, that he could not a long
time after use them with ease when hunger pressed him to move his teeth (two or
three of whom leaped out of his mouth, and the rest were sore shaken and
loosed:) then another Scot shot his Pistolet into the Constables reins,
because for feebleness of above fourscore years, he had put upon his back
but only a single and light harness. This would have afrighted the Switzers;
thinking that they had been abandoned by the rest of all the horsemen, of whom
they saw a great part already dismayed, and many to retire with a great
gallop, thinking that all was lost (to the foremoste and most hardy of
whom, the gates of Paris seemed not near enough,) if that the Duke of
Aumalle, Mareschall de Anuille, and certain other had not reassured them,
protesting that they would dye before that any other evil should happen
unto them, than the fear that they had already conceived. Wherewyth they were
no less contented, than joyful for the well doing of the Mareschall de
Montmorencie, who having a little while encountered with equal and incertayne
shocke, certain of the Princes troops, in the end laid the most assured
and best of them on the ground, making the rest to flee, who brought a
great fear unto all their footemenne; namelye, to those of the Admiral, and
the Prince, who because they had followed them but a little way, marched for
to intertayne shirmishe with the footemenne Catholics: but they, who otherwise
would not have been made to fear, being reencountred by their fleeing
friends, were entierlye and wholly broken, the horses ran over many of their
bellies, who found themselves very much offended and grieved with this
journey. After this was done, every troop drew into that quarter, where he
heard the plaintes of his General: for in a very little moment every one
leaving the advantage that he thought he had, turned face: the Catholics to
the cries of the Constable, the Protestants to the Prince of Conde, who
playned of his horse, who having his sides trauersed with a Lance, and being
hurt with diverse pellets, began to founder under him.

By these means the place of conflict was by little and little, and within
short moment quite abandoned by the fighters, as well for the hurt happened unto
both the two Generalles, as also because they all saw that the day declined,
and was come unto his end, so that the brown of the night did greatly inuit
them to retire. The Prince was no sooner lighted off from his horse, but that
he fell down at his feet stark dead. The Admiral retired from the charge,
and seeing the Catholics to run from all parts to succor their General,
turned toward the troop of the Prince, for to rallye and to deliberate upon
the rest of the journey. But the night coming while that these things were in
doing, brought an end both to the day and the battle, which had endured
little lack of two hours. For the obscure vale of the dark, and the travail
of so long and hot attaches, did by little and little abate the heat of the
most courageous, who all in the end rallyed themselves under their ensigns.
These things with the rest that are many times found in such encounters, do
authorize me in that which I shall say (too to satisfy them with one word, that
being maistred by I cannot tell what blind passion, may think that such an
end of the fight between such and so unequal armies, is very strange) that
men resolute, and despairing of retraite, and of all other means than the
force of their arms, and in sum, they that will make a virtue of necessity,
may do oftentimes far more than this was.

When the Protestants saw that they were not pursued, they conducted the
Prince unto Saint Denis, where the counsel assembled, was of advise, that
every one of them attending the coming of Dandel^^ and Montgomme^ie should
retire unto his quarter for to guard his lodging, and not to show sign nor
give occasion unto the Catholics to think that they were afraid, or that
they would refuse an other rencounter. The which the captains did: upon whom
the Catholics enterprised nothing, seeming to content themselves with the
remaining masters of the field, and the disposing at pleasure of all the
field for to bury their dead, and to leave the despoyled Protestants, and
to send the wounded to Paris. Those that were appointed to do it, tarried
there until midnight. The Constable was borne back wounded to death. The
Conte de Chaune, Hierome de Turin, and mo than forty other as well Captains
and chief, as members of companies left their lives there, whom above three
hundredth other did accompany, as well then as afterward, leaving behind them a
great multitude of hurt men. Of the Protestants, Vidame of Amiens, de Piquigny,
de Saux, la Suse, Saint Andre, de Garenes, and above fifty gentlemen of mark
were lost, and mo than three hundredth other horsemen. The flight of the footmen
was more notable than the slaughter, although that a good many died there, but
few of the Catholics footmen. This battle was fought the x. of November. The
next day the Protestants after that Dandelot and Montgomery were returned with
their forces, came in array of battle, even unto ye suburbs of Paris,
presenting battle unto the catholic army which was retired into the city.
But they accepted it not, being dismayed with the death of the Constable. But
when that the Catholic power hourly increased, and victuals failed at S.
Denis, and also they had intelligence of the coming of Cassymire the Pfaliz
graves son with a power of Almaines for their aid: the Protestants dislodged
from Saint Denis, the xv. of November, and marched to the confines of Loreyne,
to receive the Almaines.

The overthrow given by Jews Conte of Nassau, unto John Earl of Aremberg at
Damme in Freselande, and the discomfiture of the said Jews by Ferdinande Duke
of Alua, at Hieminguen in Freselande aforesaid, in Anno. 1568. Out of
Popellenier.
Civil troubles, as it were a creeping contagion, attaching also the dominions
of the low countries or base Germany, Jews the Earl of Nassau, brother unto
William Prince of Oranges, entered Freseland, with a power of Almaines, unto
whom within short time resorted a great number of the inhabitants of the
Province, and he took diverse towns thereof, among whom were Vedem, standing
in the marshes, and Danuille nere unto it, and also lying on the sea coast,
whereof when that Ferdinand Duke of Alua Lieutenant general of all the low
countries had intelligence, he sent into Freseland for to stay the course of
Jews his victory, the regiment of Sardaigne, and his master of the Camp,
three companies of the regiment of Lumbardy, three hundredth horsemen, Spaniards
and Italians, the Conte Melga Lieutenant of Ghelders, with part of his own
troops, and five companies of the regiment of the Conte of Aremberge, besides
a M. soldiers that the Lieutenant of the Conte had assembled at the coming
of the Protestants. But this was not sufficient for to rembarre the Conte of
Nassau, who daily grew in forces for any enterprise that could be done
against him. Then the Duke sent John de Lignes, Conte of Arembergue, Governor
of Friseland and Ouerissell, and Knight of the Golden fleece, to whom he gave
one regiment of Spantards, and one of Lansquenettes, with a good number of
horsemen for to chase Lodowick, between whom was a hot skirmishe, and well
interteyned.

Lodowick for to gain the advantage, retired to Damme. The youths of Spain
boiling in courage, took it for a flight, and also pursued more courageously:
but they perceived not the ambush that he had prepared for them of fiftene or
sixtene hundred horsemen behind a wood, at the wings whereof he did set three
hundredth horsemen for to train the Spaniards, who made a semblance as though
they had a mind to know what they were. Arembergue seeing them, hasted to
gain the bridges of the river which were between them, with all his forces:
at what time he discovered also three thousand footmen standing in ftro^g array,
and making show but of two bands, which had deceived him. Yet nevertheless,
the Spaniards having incorporated three ensigns into one, and distributed the
whole army into the show of five ensigns, were so importunate on their
Chief (and also for that time their General) (who because the three hundredth
horsemen would sometimes come for ward, and provoke the^, and at other retire
again, presumed some such thing as was in deed) and therefore was loath to
fight, that they mutining, called him traitor to the King, and without staying
for the Conte de Megue, who was hard by them, constrained him (as our desire
always grows greater in things denied) for to lead them straight unto the
iu. C horsemen, who feygning that they retired for weakness of defense, dre
we the Spaniards beyond the Bridges: the which also still gave more coulor
unto these inconsiderate footmen, and made them still to advance themselves
further and further. But the Conte of Nassau having gotten the Bridges,
enclosed them so strait both behind and on the sides, that he easily five
them welneare all.

The Conte de Arembergue, (because he would not leese any one point of his
reputation, defended himself valiantlye, but when his horse was slain, and he
himself thrown down to the ground dead with the blow of a Pistolet, he
ended his days, after that he had slain the Conte Adolph of Nassau brother to
Jews, who entered into such furye, that he of choler caused three hundredth of
the Spaniardes to be hanged up, although there had died twelve hundredth of them
in fight, and so many of other. Six pieces of artillery, all the munitions,
part of the soldiers wages, the casket and plate of the Coute Arembergue,
and all the baggage of the Camp was lost.

The Conte de Megue, and the Conte Curtie de Martinenguo, drew near with one
troop of horsemen, of whom Arembergue had lack, and the bands of the
Colonels Sambergo, but being pursued by the army victorious, they were
constrained to retire into the Groningen, the which the Protestants suddenly
besieged, battred, and enclosed in two quarters. Moreover, they being masters
of the field, roded all the country, because the Spanishe forces were not
united, but scattered through this discomfiture. But anon after Chiapino
Vitelli, master of the Camp general, assembled as many men together as he
could, and encamped before Groningen, for to remove the siege of the
Protestants, the which he could not do. Many skirmishes were attached and
fought. The Conte Lodowicke sent twice to Vitelli to demand a journey for to
end the wars by one general battle, the which he would not accord unto,
saying that it was not yet time to fight. Also he expected the Duke of Alua,
and the rest of his forces, of whom yet he was not well assured, seeing those
of the Protestants, although that the Emperor being requested thereunto,
commanded Conte Jews as he tendered his obedience and duty, to retire, and
to withdraw his army out of the country, with all possible speed. Where
unto the Conte answered, that he could not do it before that his brother,
and the other Princes and Lords his confederates were advertised, the which he
promised to do very shortly: yet nevertheless many began to ware cold, and
namely when that the goods of certain of the Colonels were seized and
arrested by the Emperor. Yet the siege continued until the approach of the
Duke Martial, at what time the Conte Lodowicke brake up the siege, having
before sent the baggage toward Embden, breaking down and cutting off all the
bridges and passages for to hinder and stay the enemy, yet not without
continual skirmishes. The Duke having sent the horsemen of the Duke of
Brunswicke into Groningen, because the Country being full of soft dirtie
plashes and great vitches, is very ill for horsemen, followed the Protestants
even unto Secloten, where they made their stay. In the me^^^e tune he sent some
to beat the ways on all stoes, and for to learn out the mientes of the
Conte: in the end he understood that the Rende-von^ was at Hieini^guen,
whither certain horsemen and footmen were come unto him, there minding to
stay for the Duke and his fury. For the which purpose he took the deep
river of Hems for to back him, lodging his camp in a place very strong also
on other parts, for he was flanked wit^ great ditches, channels, and rivers,
and he could let out the water upon the Duke and his men at ease, and had on
the other side the rich town of Embden at his back, all the which seemed to
be for his advantage.

The Duke approached within two leages of Lodowickes army, and being resolved
upon his aduertisements, sent the Captains Sanchio d' Auila, and Montero, with
an hundredth Argolets or harquebusiers on horseback, for to attache the
skirmish, and to train him out of his fort. Besides this, he charged Julian
Romero master of the Camp to follow them with five hundredth harquebusiers,
and three hundredth Muschats, who were followed by the Camp master Sanchio de
Londaiguo, with one thousand harquebusiers, appointing Caesar Gonzaga, and
Martinerguo with two companies of men of arms to be on the wings of the
footmen. Alphonse de Vllua, and Dom Gonsaiuez de Bracamont conducted the rest,
with charge not to depart out of their place without his express
commandment. In the tail of these Spaniardes footmen, he set six ensigns
of Almaines, followed by fiftene companies of VVallons, and after, the light
horsemen three hundredth Lances, and the Cornette of Hans Vernan, all along one
at the tail of another, by reason of the nature of the country, for they must
needs pass in those very strait places one after another, not being able to
go either on the one side or the other, for the ditches, channels, and marshes,
that make the country very troublesome, and ill to traunile.

The Conte who knew the deliberation of the Duke, that he might hurt and anoy
him before that they were come to gripes, sent a number of footmen and Pioners
for to cut up and mar the passages and ways, to the end that the water
which was pent up, might ouerflowe all the field, and ouerwhelme the Dukes
army, so that the auantcurrers had not rode long, but that they perceived the
footmen and their guard, who labored to make a way for the water. This caused
the first skirmishe, and the beginning of the journey. In the end although the
Pioners were forced to retire, yet being sustained sodainelye by other footmen
that were sent unto them, they drove the Spaniards out of the place, who sent
unto their General for to demand certain Pykemen and harquebusiers, the
which yet he refused to do, and not without good considerations) he saw that
according unto the disposition that he had set in his army, every troop
should sustain and help themselves to their uttermost, and as long as they
could for their lives, so that when the foremost were pressed, necessity
would sooner stir up their spirits for to invent some good mean, and would
sooner redouble their courage for to sustain the impressions and attempts of
their enemies, than if they reposed themselves upon other.) He had also
fantasied the like at another time and place, when he thought it not good to
fight in gross with the desperate, nor to put in the hazard of one only
journey the entier estate of his Prince, seeing the small assurance that he had
in fortune, who does make her inconstancy to be seen more in deeds of arms,
than any other thing of the world. Wherefore a General ought not to fight
with his whole power, unless he be constreyned. Moreover, he had his men in so
careful regard, namelye after the blow received at the defeat of Aremberge,
that he esteemed more the life of one of them, than the death often enemies. And
as one resolved for all events, in case that he should be forced to come to
fight, his mind was through the loss of some, not only to save the lives of
the rest, but wholly to break the enemy, assuring himself that if the
foremost would be sufficient for to overthrow the enemy, that then their
fellows that followed, would make the breach far greater, but if they being
to weak, were broken, then he persuaded himself that the enemy would come
forth in so ill order, and out of array for to follow the victory, that the
rest of his power would easily defeat them. On the other side, the Conte
Lodowick renforced his foremost, and commanded them to give in farther,
assuring them that he would always be at their heels, and not suffer them to
lack succors, and in deed they so lustily tasted two or three of the
foremost Spanish bands, that the Masters of the Camp advertised the Duke
that they were lost, unless they were speedily succored. Then he made the
horsemen of Caesar Gonzaga Martinenguo, and certain other troops, to set
forward with three hundredth harquebusiers, which Dom Felis de Gusman
conducted, who came to the village where the fort of ye recou^ter was.

But as the time passed, the water ran in, and in short time covered all the
field, to the great disadvantage of the catholics, namely of the Duke, who was
thereby brought into the state to ^oandon the gross and greatest part of his
army to the pleasure of fortune, specially when that he saw himself
sodainlye recharged with another ill hap: which was, that the air began to be
dark, and troubled with great cloudy raines, which thretned the soldiers a
thousand incommodities. The Duke was as much offended and chased as the
soldiers, for that they must stay to fight there in the water up to the
waste, and therewithal if that it should rain, the shot (the principal force
of the Spaniards) would be to no purpose, and moreover, he had no place to
retire, but for half a leage nor other remedy for to cover and defend
himself, than to chase the enemy out of their forte. Whereupon he commanded
the Prior Dom Ferdinand his son to make all the Esquadrons to march forward,
and he himself retired whither he thought good.

The skirmish had begu^ at x. a clock, and the Prior arrived there about two in
the afternone, whose succors did so set on fire the courage of ye other, that
they giving upon all the rest of ye Flemmings, forced them to abandon the fort,
with so great mortality, that this victory may well he accounted equal unto
the other that Jews gave unto Aremberge. For they gained all the artillery,
and a good number of the Ensigns. The Conte Lodowicke, and Antonie de Lalain
Conte de Hochstrate, who had given place to the Catholics two days before,
retired into Embden a City subject unto the Earl of Aldenburg. After this,
the Duke of Alua recovered all Freselande, and marched even unto Amsterdam in
Hollande, where he caused the heads of the Captains of Sard^gones regiment,
to be cut off, for that they had been the cause of the defaite of Arembergu^.

But because that Popelleniere seems over brief in the enarration of them
that were slain, I do think it good to set down the words of Schard one of
the Judges of the Imperial chamber, in his Chronicle, inserted in Corpus
hystoricum Germaniae. The Spaniardes (says he) followed the chase four miles,
and took prisoner Henry van Sygen, Lodowickes Lieutenant, with twentye
ensigns, sixtene pieces of ordinance, and slew (some say) seven thousand,
but the number must needs be less, seeing that the whole army was scarce so
many, of whom yet it is manifest that many escaped. There were slain many of
the banished Nobility, whose plate and monye fell unto Alua his share. The
Earl of Schwartzburg fled away at the beginning of the fight.

The battle of Bassac, fought in Poitou in France, between Henry Duke of
Aniou, brother and Lieutenant General of Charles the ninth, King of France,
and Jews Prince of Conde General of the Protestants, in Anno. 1569.
AFter the battle fought at Saint Denis, the army of the French Protestants
(as I told you before) marched into the confines of Loreyne, to meet with
Casimire son unto the Pfaliz grave, with whom they returned back again,
and besieged the City of Chartres, when a peace was concluded in March 1568.
but it held but a little while: for in August following, the Protestants were
again in the field, with an arm of fourscore and fouretene cornets of
horsemen, and two hundredth and forty ensigns of footmen, of whom d Acer
brought twenty thousand out of Prouence and Daul^hinte, and eight hundred
horsemen. Against this power being in Xaintoigne, a power of Catholics came,
under the conduct of Henry Duke of Anieu the kings brother, between whom were
diverse skirmishes, until that the cold of the winter forced them both to
abandon the field, ye which they did take again as soon as ever the time of the
year and state of the air would permit. But in March 1569. Monsieur de
Anioi^ having a little before doubled his forces, had intelligence that the
Lord Piles was coming out of Gascogne with a new supplye of Soldiers for
the Conde, who had lost by sickness four or five thousand of his footmen.
Wherefore his Excellence aduauncing his army through Poitois, Limosin, and the
country of Augomois, descended along the river of Charente, as though he
would take Chasteau-neuf, there for to pass the river, and that done, bar
Piles from joining with the Prince, and be at choice to fight with either of
them. The which the Prince doubting, passed the Charente at Cognac. But
Monsieur having taken Chastean-neus standing upon the river of Charente,
between Cognac and Angoulesme, commanded the bridge to be repaired that the
Protestants had broken down. And the next morning being the xj. of March, his
Excellence marched toward Cognac, as well to do some enterprice upon the
Protestants, and to put them in doubt what he meant to do, as also for to
cause them to think that he would not return again to Chasteau-neuf, to
pass the water. The Princes who were at Cognac only with their ordinary
traynes (the men of war being in their quarter) sent one suddenly to demand
aid of the Admiral, who was at Iarnac with the auantgarde. Dandelor hasting
thitherwarde, understood that Monsieur was turned toward Chasteau-neuf and
therefore the Prince being assured, returned to Iarnac the twelfth of March.
And in the mean time to impeach the reparation of the Bridges of
Chasteau-neuf, he caused the Admiral and the auantgarde to advance themselves
selves unto the encounter, whilst that he went to Iarnac. But the Admiral
seeing the diligence that was used in making of the passage, retired himself
unto Bassac, and for the retrayte ordained Soubize, Puviant, and other
companies of Poitou, who should remain there in battle until midnight. As
the diligence of Monsieur was great in making of the Bridges, so was it
extreme in passing over them all the night: on the other side, the Prince (all
things being well weighed) was not willing to resolve upon the battle, but
commanded the Admiral that he should cause the auantgarde to dislodge, and
he with him at larnac upon the break of the day. The which was done, but
not by all: For the companyes that Puviant led, could not march so
speedilye, the which was the occasion that they saw the companies of the
Catholics at their tail, and were so strongly pressed by them, that they
must needs disgage and succor them to the peril and discomfiture of all the
Protestants: for the Chief was charged by so many Catholics, that be being
in the head of the army, was in great peril, if that the discovery of the
troops which the Admiral led, had not made them that were advanced
nearest, to stay a little. Then the footmen of the Catholics were no sooner
passed the Bridges, but that without resting they doubled their pace, for to
gain a little hill that was directly over against the Bridge. The Protestants
also made for ward very fast for to sease it, but suddenly when they perceived
the crossed men, whom they there discovered very easilye, they retired a two
or three harquebusse shottes from thence, for to take a place for the battle,
the which they found in a place of indifferent good advantage, the which was a
plain covered in one quarter with a great village, which did afforde many
commodities unto their footmen. Near unto the said village there was a
little hill, and more lower the^e ran along before them a river that did
deuyde the plain. There they rested them, and all being set in array of
battle, stayed there a good while, whilst that the Captains Catholics did
take a place, for their army upon the plain near unto the hill.

Then they that were less lasie remained not long without shirmish, namely
those that had the hill in their power: for they having discovered how small a
power the Admiral had, who was now retired, came down and advanced
themselves so nere, that the Protestants could not retire without fight,
unless they would be intierly defeated. So that when some and then other
Catholics came forward, Puviant saw that he and his regiments and Cornet was
so gaged, that if the Lord Nore, and the Lord Love (to whom the retrait of
the auantgarde had been commanded) had not with forty harquebusiers of the
guard of de Acier, delivered and disgaged them, the greatest part had remained
there for a mark and sign of the victory.

But when they had with all their deuoyre succored them to their great pain,
they were forced to defend themselves with all their power upon the bay of a
pond, where they were all charged with such force by Martigues, Malicorne, and
other, to the number of v. or vj. C. horse, that Noue and Louee were taken in
the field, and their companies put to slight. Love had this good hap, that by
saying he was la Briche ensignebearer to Martigues, he escaped death, the which
he had been sure of, if he had been known. Upon this, Puviant after he had
been charged, and saw that his company was to small, retired with the rest of
the footmen. While that these charges were given on Noue, other Catholics
passed farther, and gave in even to the village, and ii. C. of them advanced
yet more lustily, whom the I diniral and Dandelor (after they had discovered
them, and were ignorant of the defeat aforesaid, because that the village was
between them) charged Dandelot being foremost with his Cornet, gave in so
furiously, that he did put them to slight, and having pursued them even into
the village: In his return be found one of their ensigns, but he was no
sooner out of the village, but that the Catholics reentred it more strongly
than before: for they were followed but a good way off by twelve hundredth
harquebusters, who came to seize on the village. Then he turned upon them, and
made them to retire into the village, where they renforced themselves with the
footmen, who in their favor did so bar and fortify themselves in that
place unto the purpose, that it was made impossible afterward to chase them
thence. In the mean time all the troops Catholics began to show themselves,
and every regiment did take his place for the battle.

This was done when that the Prince of Conde being advertised by the Admiral
(who had sent unto him the Baron of Montagus) of the danger that the
auantgarde was in, unless he succored it, advanced himself with those few
horsemen of his battle, that he had assembled tumultuouslye in that uproar,
because that his army was distributed by quarters, dispersed here and there,
by reason they were not then encamped. Then every man on both sides came to
seek the advantages of place and fight, and many good blows were given, and
many valiant deeds passed, the which I will not set down particularly. While
that these things were dove, the Admiral perceived that the army of Monsieur
was all passed, and came forward on the lest hand as fast as they could, the
which was the very mean for to enclose the Protestants between the river
and the army of the Catholics. Then he seeing no mean left for to retire
without fight, commanded la Tour to make the companies of the auantgarde to
advance forward, the which he did, and bare himself so, that his horse being
borne unto the ground, he was taken, and being known for him that had slain
Captain Charry at Paris, was slain in the field, with many other that had no
better market.

Now the army of the Catholics ran over a great part of the field upon
the left hand, where stood the troops of Soubize, La^g villier, Puivant,
Cressonierre, and many other Captains in chief of Poitou, who thinking that
they ought not any longer to expect any occasion for a better charge, seeing
that the Catholics renforced themselves every moment, with the advice of the
General, charged upon the foremost with such fury, that they made them to
recule: but being broken by the succors that came unto them without cease,
Soubize and Long villien were taken, Mesanchere and Brandaniere, and many other
were slain in the field.

In the mean time his Excellence would come another way, for being desirous
to break them in many places at once, he caused an other way on the right
hand to be learned out, which although it were hard enough for the nature of
the place, yet nevertheless he found it more easy on that side, where he
made the most part of his army to march, by reason that the Protestants who
hitherto maintained the acuantage of the Baye of the Poude, after that they
knew his enterprice, did abandon it, that they themselves might retire safely.
Moreover, at the same instant one regiment of Reysters was commanded to pass
over the Bay, for to strain them on the side, the which they did very lustily.
When all these troops were passed for to advance them selves, the Prince of
Conde with three or four hundredth horsemen, turned head against them, and
gave a very hot charge, being followed by the most part of his men. So that
he being chased for despite to see almost all his men fled, and that the
whole army bare it self no better, did thrust in with such fury, that he
bare to the ground, and made to recule all those that durst to tarry him,
until such time as his horse being wounded, he was thrown to the ground, not
being able to do the deuoire that he had well desired and wished. For the
hindermost troops of the Catholics aduauncing themselves for to hold up
the forenesse (who gave back) and being aided by the Almaine horsemen, did
thruste in so furiously through the Protestants, that two thirdes of them
rested upon the place, either dead or fore hurt. Namelye the Prince of Conde,
was him self thrown under his horse, that he could do nothing any longer
for the blows that he had received, so that because he was not followed by
his men, who should have refreshed him with a second horse, all succor to
help him to arise, sawled him, being constrained to give place unto the force
and the great number of the Catholics, who came upon him thick and
threefolde. So that hearing himself named and spoken unto by de Augence, and
Saint lean, who going to the chase of those that fled, by fortune passed by
before him and they having promised him at his request to save his life, he
yielded. But ill fortune streightway followed: for being known, he was at the
same instant slain by Montesquiois (as some say) who shot him into the head
with a deadly Pistolet. Certain had counseled him before the fight for to
retire, seeing his army not being joined together, he could not resist the
power of his Excellence. But he would give no more ear thereunto, than would
Curi^, and the Conte Lodron in the like cases.

At the very same instant of the Princes death, the disorder among the
Protestants, marueylouslye increased, whose spurs were not so sharp as to
make their horses post fast enough. D'acier being advertised by the Admiral
of this rent counter, made six thousand harquebusiers to march with a^ great
diligence and speed as be could possible: but when he was yet one leage from
Bassac, (for he came from Cognac which is v. great leagues from Bassac) he
understood of the loss of the battle by those that fled, which made him to
lead his footmen toward Iarnac, where yet he could be no sooner arrived, but
that he saw the Catholics at his heels, yet he made head unto them, in
such sort, that he had afterward leisure to retire. Then having intelligence
that the greatest troop was in Cognac, he passed over the water with his
footmen for to flee that way, and for to assure himself against the pursuit^
that might be made at his tail, be caused the bridges to be broken down, the
which did impeache the passage of the pursuing Catholykes. And also hereby the
artillery which some had caused to be brought out of Cognac, was also soon
assured.

Then Iornac being abandoned, was taken by those that pursued their victory
upon the footmen. Of so many Protestant^ many would have rallyed themselves,
but they were chased so near, that they had no leisure. Moreover, to the
pursuit arrived a regiment of Reysters, who with the rest of the Catholics,
did very hotelye pursue the fleeing souls one leage from the place of the
battle: but they continued their slight even unto five of the clock in the
afternoon.

The Admiral and Dandelot seeing the flight irreparable, and the affraye so
marvelous, retired with a few of the Nobility: but when they would not
follow the way that the greatest part of the afrighted took, for fear of
being pursued with the other, they deflected into the way on the right hand,
and the tract that was least beaten, and retired unto S Iean de Angely, where
they being advertised that the young Princes (of Navarre and Conde) were at
Xainctes, whither they retired (having given commandment to the rest of the
footmen to tarry at Cognac) they sought them there, and made that the place for
the Reindevous, or abode for them that escaped out of the battle: whither many
(who had taken the way to Cognac, thinking to find the Princes there) came
unto them.

Many Protestants of mark (besides the Prince of Conde) saw the end of their
days in this journey of Bassac. Among other of the Poiteuins, these were of
greatest name, Tour, young Chasteliers, Portant, Chandenier, Mesanchere,
Brandaniere, ye eldest of the Bessons, young Tabariere, Barette, la Mesleray,
and above fifty other gentlemen lamented in that country. Few of the
footmen, and of the Captains in chief none, but Ogier called la Moriniere,
and certain other of the regiment of Puivant, Soubize, Langvillier, and ten or
twelve other Poiteuins were taken, of whom a little while after Soubize
deceyuing his keepers, escaped. As touching other Montigeau, Breton, Stuard a
Scotte (who was slain with a dagge) and certain other, died there. Camtel of
the race of Glass, was slain. Captain Corneile a Scotte, and diverse other of
the same nation could not survive the fiftenth day, by reason of their
wounds. Corbeson brother to Montgommerie, and Lieutenant to the Prince, was
taken prisoner, and after estarged on his faith, and being offended for that
they would not change Sessac for him, he returned unto his house. Guerchye
Ensign bearer of the Admiral, being hurt in diverse places, was taken, and
being given by Monsieur unto one of his kinsemen, had liberty to return unto
his house upon his faith. La Noue was changed for Sessac Lieutenaunt to the
Duke of G^yse. The sum that this journey did importe, were near four
hundredth of the Confederates, and two hundredth Catholics, of whom there died
Monsalez the Barons of Ingrande, and of Prunay, both of the house of Billy. The
Conte de la Mirande, de Morete, Moncanure, Linieres, and certain other of
mark: but few or none in comparison of the Protestants, which made the
Catholics as well Frenchmen as Spaniards, to compare this discomfiture unto
that which Charles the fifte, Emperor, gave unto the Almaines, and do account
it for one nothing less and inferior. But certes the fruit was far less:
for none other ensued thereof, but a free running over all the Xantongeois,
Angumois, and Limousin. But while that Monsieur attempted in vain Cognac and
Angoulesme, the Protestants gathered together, and united their dispersed
power, and creating Henry the young prince of Navarre or Bearn to be their
General, in Iulye following joined with the power of the Duke of Deux pontz
(who died by the way) which consisted of 7500. Reysters, and 6000.
Lansquenettes very well armed and appointed.

The Battle of Moncontour, fought in Poitou in France, betvveene Henry Duke
of Aniou, and Henry Prince of Bearne, the tenthe of October, in Anno. 1569.
THe Protestants having (as I said) received the aides of Deux Pontz, became
very strong, and did many great exploytes, and at the last the x. of October
joined in battle with Monsieur, who had eight or nine thousand horsemen,
sixteen or eyghteene thousand footmen, and fiftene or sixtene pieces of
artillery. But the Confederates had six thousand horsemen as well Frenchmen
as Reysters, eight thousand harquebusiers, and four thousand Lansquenets, of
who^ some did vnhandsomelye help them selves with harquebusses, six Canons,
two Culuerings, and three Muschattes. But the cause why that the Admiral (who
in deed ruled and governed the army, the Prince being scarce a man in years)
being ouermatched in number, joined in battle, was first necessity (because
he could not commodiously neither go back nor forward, Monsieur was so near
unto him) and secondly, desire of reteyning the ancient honor and reputation
of the Protestants, who were always accounted very hardy and valiant: but
if that they should now have fled, they might perhaps have alienated from
them the hearts of many of their favorers, both in foreign countries, and
also at home. The place where this battle was darreyned, was a plain called
Cron, half a French leage from Moncountour, and two from Eruaux. This plain
in some parts is charged with little hills, whom the Captains might orawe to
great advantages for the future battle, as the Admiral did: who having marked
that toward the place where his Excellence would come, the plain ended in
certain little hills with small and sweet discents, he purposed to place
there the greatest part of his footmen, and certain Reysters, because that
they (by reason they do march in the form of a battallion) are more subject
unto the mercy of the Canon, than the French horsemen (of whom, because they
march and fight in length in the form of wings, one piece of ordinance can hit
but one, and him to very seldom:) and also for to lodge his ordinance on the
small hills that were at the end of the plain, he made the battle too
advance more on the right hand, as if he would take toward Eruaux, whereof
he gave the charge unto Lodowick Conte de Nassau, to whom he delivered three
Canons and one Culuerine.

The auauntgarde was on the left hand drawing toward the river a little
less forward than the battle, whereof he himself did take the charge and
conduct, having with him Puygressier, la Noue, Telignie, and certain other,
who had the charge of two Canons, two Longues, two Muschats: And the Conte de
Mansfelde (the Chief of the Reysters) of whom he had distributed almost the
one half into the battle, as also of Lansquenets, whom Granuillrers
conducted. All of whom having kissed the ground, made protestations one unto
another, for to enter-succour each one the other, and to dye in the place
rather than to recule and give back.

The Admiral has had one fashion very familiar (if it be not to be called a
strategemme of war) which is in general fight and battle aranged, for to
enlace the footmen with the horsemen, in this sort. After he had chosen the
best footmen for Enfans perdus, he would set them in the head of every
rank of horsemen, for to shoot and that too with assurance at the horsemen
that would come to encounter his horsemen: seeing that every harquebusier
might always according unto the place, the time, and the persons, recharge
three or four tunes. As also it is not possible but that the ranks of the
horsemen on the other side must be well lessened, and made thynner, and also
that their party coming upon the enemy to recharge them, shall (if they be
good men) have such an hand of them as they will themselves. Neither are the
footmen that begun the attache, thereby in any distress or danger, for their
horsemen will defend them if any will recharge them: and in the mean time
they will find mean to save themselves if they be alone on a plain, or else
cover themselves with some baskets or trenches if the places be proper
therefore. Here he practiced again this form of fight, but a little altered
from the former, as we shall declare unto you.

In disposing of his horsement, he separated the Cornettes as well French as
Almaines, intermedling two of Reisters, with two of French, as the hindermoste
ranks of the auantgarde were. Those companies of his own men of arms, and of
de A^ier (who conducted his own in person) were flanked on the right side with
two Cornets of Reysters, which were a little more advanced, and kept still
their form of batallion. On the left side of those French Cornettes, was
Captain Ramiers with his company of harquebusiers, for to serve for Enfans
perdus, and on their side five and twenty or thirty harquebusiers on
horseback of the guard of D'acier: all these harquebusiers stood a little
more forward than the Cornettes. More higher, drawing always toward the
right hand was the domestical Cornet of the Admiral, and two or three other,
that he himself would conduct, flanked on the one side with four or five
Cornets Almaines, over whom Mansfelde commanded, and on the other, with two
companies of harquebusiers of Doge, and an other captain. But four or five
companies should fight before the Admiral, who were therefore a little
farther advanced. The rest of the auantgarde still aduauncing themselves, a
little more forward in form of batallions, even unto Money and la Noue, who
were in the head or front with their regimentes, were followed by the like
number of Reysters. And so likewise was the battle aranged, the which was in
array standing higher on the right hand, drawing toward Eruaux. Although that
all these troops did one stand more forward than another, yet this was not in
right line and in head, but brawing toward a direct line, to the end that
the Admiral who stood at the bottom and end of all his troops, might see a
far, the disposition, countenance, and dismarche of the Catholics, and
upon a sodeyne puruey according to the occurrence.

But although that all these troops were so varied and interlaced, yet
nevertheless they might go to the charge all together, or a part, as they
would themselves, without one impeaching of the other, namely seeing the
Reisters, had requested, that they might not be any whit hindered at their first
dismarch. For the Reister using another and diverse way and manner of fight from
the Frenchman, in incountring his enemy, can not endure any troop to be near
him: because they will break his course: for the Reister fights in this
sort. When he does see himself near enough unto his enemies, the first
rank does advance upon them, and when he has shot off his Pistolet, he does
not run still in forward (as does the French man, who does still pursue his
point) but more short on the right hand, or on the left, according unto the
place where he is, and so is also speedilye followed by the second rank, that
does the very same. Then the third follows the second, to give the charge,
as soon as ever he sees him departed that stood before him. All the ranks
following one another, in such manner, even unto the last, the hindermoste
runs (they fighting with Pistolets only) for to come unto their fore
ryders, they standing all along one at another tail. And for as much as it is
impossible, but that when they do present themselves, some of them, or else
their horses be slain: therefore as soon as ever one of the foremost rank is
seen to fall down, he that is in the second rank, directlye behind him
that is departed, or else disabled, must take his place, and he of the third
rank must furnishe the void place of the second, and so the rest in like
order, so that they always make their foremoste ranks, of the most assured:
for in all things (namely in feats of arms) the beginning is of greatest
moment.

You see the reason why the Admiral had thus disposed his men: neither was
this form and disposition profitable, only for this regard, but also was
very auantagious for the Reisters. For the French horsemen would impeache them
that would come against their Reisters, from ouerrunning or breaking them, and
also would give them large liberty to recharge, and return unto the
encounter. And on the other side, when the French men should see that the
Reisters Catholics charged their Reysters, and namely when they should turn
(as also the Reisters Protestants would do) to recharge their Pistolettes,
then would they run upon them lustilye, and break them at their ease, I say,
that all of them should not have leisure to recharge. For seeing they have
nothing to fight with but their Pistolets, when they have discharged, they are
half dead, and namely when they see their ranks broken. In this battle,
the Reysters. Catholics and Protestants entercharged one the other: but if
that lot had given, that the Reisters Catholics had charged the French men,
they might easily have been broken. For the Frenchman that still follows his
point, does easily break that rank of the Reisters, which he finds going
about to rally and recharge. And through this form of fight many Reisters
Catholics ended their days in this journey, and not only by this mean, but
also by that which I have before declared: that is to wit, the shot of the
harquebusiers on foot, that were intermedled with the horsemen. Such was the
disposition and ordinance of the horsemen of the Protestants.

As for the footmen, those that were in the auantgarde, were inmasse or
plumpe, having the form of one gross battallion, which the Lansquenets made
under the charge of the Baron of Grenelesee, and of Granuilliers, flanked on
two sides with the regiments of harquebusiers Frenchmen, led by Piles,
Rouiuray, Briquemaut the younger, de Ambres, and du Chellar. Moreover, this
battle was sustained by four troops of horsemen, as well Frenchmen as
Reisters, ordered as I have showed before. The footmen of the battle made
another battallion, composed of the harquebusiers of the regiments of Beaudine,
Mombrun, Blacons, Mirabel, and Virieu, sustained as before. And also these two
bodies of footmen had their harquebusiers in their front, who (as Enfans
perdus) should give and receive the first blows, as they were conducted by
their Captains who went before them. They had not one Pyke among them, a
weapon the best and most necessary that a footeman can devise to bear, and
such an one for a footman, as the Lance is for an horseman, as we will show
at another time, by Gods help.

The Colonels and Captains of every band were a little auanced for to
encourage their men: all the army was clothed in white. The Protestants stood
still, not moving out of their places, and it seemed that they would have been
well contented to have been dispensed with for fighting that day, the which
thing some men advised. Yet many presuming that which afterward happened unto
them, said: that a General which has his troop ready for the shocke, ought
not to stay for the charge, and that this had always been hold for an assured
Maxim among the old Fores of times past. And for proof more certain, the
Confederates themselves had marked, that in all fightes past, they had done
better when they charged first, than when they expected the dismarch of the
Catholics.

Now you have seen the estate and disposition wherein the army of the
Protestants, expected that of his Excellence, who by the advice of the most
old practiced warriors of his troup, disposed his army after the manner that
I shall tell you. He being a little advanced in the plain, and having caused
certain of the principal Captains to come unto him, disposed his troops
after the French fashion, which is to divide the mass of an army into two
parts, which they do call an auantgarde, and a battle. Diverse times if that
the army be very great, they make three, and to these two adioyne a
rerewarde, for to sustain those two foremoste troops, if they should chance
to be overthrown, and to succor the bands that shall have need: and also for
to reallye, as well those that for long fight have lost or stragled from their
Engsines, or for to stay them that flee, and to constrayne them to make head.
The auantgarde was composed of horsemen, as well Frenchmen as Almaines and
Italians. Of Frenchmen were the Prince Dauphin, the Duke of Guise, Martigues,
Chauigny, la Valette, and many other Captains: the troop of whom was no
less than two or three thousand horsemen. Of the Almaines, the regimentes of
the auantgarde of the Conte of VVestambourg, the two other regimentes of the
Reingraffe, and Bassompierre, their troops, mounting near to two thousand
horse. Of the Italians, the Conte of Saint Fiora, the Conte Paul Sforza, the
Contes Disci, Santelle, and many other with their troops, who amounted to few
less th^^ thousand horsemen, almost all very good and well appointed.

The footmen stood in the form of one gross batallion, which was made by
the regiment of the Switzers, led by the Colonel Clery, which should have
been of eight thousand, but it was brought to four, through the long travail
and weariness of the wars. Five regiments of harquebusiers French men, and
Italians, for to flank them on two sides, conducted by the Captains la
Barthe, Sarlabou^, les deux Isles, and he of Onoux And because that the plain
was fair and large, the artilleri^ was departed into two, eight pieces for the
auantgarde, and seven for the battle, and laid at the head of the
battallions. Before these troops of horsemen, and the footmen, there was
advanced (after the French fashion) a good number of young men as well
horsemen as footmen, for to scrue for Enfans perdus, and attach the fight
first. Over all these commanded the Duke of Montpensier, who made his
auantgarde to keep this order. The Switzes and their flanks of harquebusiers,
as men ready to come to the charge, were set upon the right hand, and before
them advanced Martigues, who should charge first, after that the Enfans
perdus of the horsemen, whom he had before him, had given their first charge.
Martigues was followed by the Prince Dauphin, who being accompanied with
Chauigny, had on his right hand the Conte de San Fiora, Marie and Paul
Sforza, brothers, with Charles de Birague followed by their regiments, for the
most part Italians. Behind the Prince for to sustain all that were before,
marched the Duke of Montpensier, having on his side two thousand Reisters,
conducted by the Lantgraue of Hessen, the two Contes Reingraffe, brothers, the
Conte de VVestambourg, de Bassompierre, and Scomberg, who led eyghtene
Cornets. And because that the Duke of Montpensier did doubt that the Switzers
who were on his right hand, would not charge at all, if that they were not
flanked and sustained by French horsemen, appointed for their left side the
Duke of Guise, la Valette, and many other Captains, with their companies, who
should assure them against all hazard. All this mass went furiously to the
charge together, as I will show you, after that I have represented unto you
the battle. The which was composed of the Dukes de Aumalle, de Longville,
Mareschall de Cosse, Tauennes, the Marquis of Villars, (who had before received
in gift of the King, the state of the Admiral of France) la Fayette, Mern
Colonel general of the Switzers, de Tore his brother (sons of the late
Constable) Carpauallet, la Vaugui^n, and Villequier, Vatan, Vesigny, de Maily
Governor of Moutreul, Greau, and many other Captains, the companies of whom
could amounte to no fewer than three thousand horse of fight. Of the Almaynes
were the Conte Mansfelde cousin to the Protestante, who conducted and led
five Cornettes of a thousand, or twelve hundredth horse, whom the King of
Spain had sent, the Marquis of Baden, who had about one thousand, and
certain other particulars. Likewise the battle had well near four thousand
Reisters. The footmen were in the like manner distributed, as they were in the
auantgarde, in one battallion of Switzers, whom Colonel Phiffer led, and
before him Mern, Colonel general of all the Switzers, having on their wings
the Burgonions and the Spaniardes which the Catholic king had sent unto his
Majesty, and four regiments of Frenchmen, conducted by Cossins, young Monluc,
Gohas, and Rance, who had seven great pieces before them. Over all these
commanded his Excellence, who had a little behind him on the right side the
troops of the Marshals of the field for to rally, and moreover to do their
deuoyre in that which should be likewise thought needful. All these
battallions had their Enfans perdus in their front, as I have said of the
auantgarde.

Now ye shall see the order that every company has in the battle for to
dismarch, when that the signal of fight shall be given. I will take my
beginning at the person of his Excellence, for the good luck that he brought
unto the whole army. Monsieur would be between the Marquis of Baden, and the
Regiment of the Switzers. And therefore when it was upon the point of the
charge, he commanded Duke du Aumalle to lead the Reisters of the Marquis, who
were on the right hand. Mareschall de Cosse with his companies, and the Conte
de Mansfelde with his Cornettes guarded the Switzers on the left side. Before
his Excellence Carnauallet had fifty Gentlemen for to charge first. Behind on
the right side of his Excellence was Biron with his fellows Mareschaux of the
field and their troops.

Such was the disposition of one and the other army, such was the array and
order which every company had for to go to the charge. Now it remains for
to declare how the two armies began to dismarch, to charge, and to encounter
one the other, as furiously as any man has seen who ^^gan^t, and how. For it
is to be noted, that although the bodies of the two a^^n^^^ were divided into
two parts, that is to wit, into an aua^^garde and a battle, according to the
French fashion, yet nevertheless they had encamped themselves in such a place,
and so disposed the companies of every Captain, that they might fight all
togi^her, and at one time (as it also now happened:) for the auantgarde of his
Excellence had no sooner marched, but that the battle which Monsieur himself
conducted, began to buskle themselves to go unto the charge, as I shall tell you
hereafter, otherwise than the most part of the ancients have used to do,
whose battles did most commonly attend the happy or unhappy success of the
auantgarde. Wherein a man may note the promptitude of the spirits and courages
of this time, in respect of the simpleness and slownesse of the ancient ages.

It is to be noted, that his Excellence had encharged Biron to make ready the
battles, whilst that he being accompanied with the Dukes de Aumalle,
Longville, Cosse, Tauennes, Villars, Faye^te, Carnaullet, and many other,
mounted on an hill, for to be somewhat near, to judge of the countenance and
deliberation of the Protestants. But because he was counsayled not to go any
further, he retired. Then Tauannes (on whose judgment he reposed himself for
the conduct of his army) suppliantly desired him to let him alone in going
further, that he might be able to give unto him more certain advise. He having
ouerrun with his diligent eye the principal of the army Protestant, came to
find Monsieur and assured him of the good fortune that he should have, if it
would please him to give battle. But if (said he) we shall neglect it now,
another time the like will not be offered us, nor an occasion of so great
advantage. Let them march in the name of God with all diligence, without
breaking the order of the battles. The which advise was received of his
Excellence, giving God praise, and with very great cheerfulness (as his face
seemed to testify) and the enterprises that he took in hand did witness
afterward unto all those that did follow him.

The two armies were not so soon in a readiness, but that they discovered one
the other all in gross anon after eight of the clock on Monday morning. Then
the Canon of the battle Protestant began to play, shooting so right, that it
lost not one shoot. Those of the Catholics answered them soon enough with a
far greater noise, but with less dommage: for mostlye they shot too low, or
too high, and also the footmen, and the most part of the horsemen of the
Protestants, lay so under the defense of the plain in the little valleys
that were in that quarter, that of three shottes, the Catholics lost one or
two although they always shot thrice against once of the Protestants. The
artillery of the auantgarde came also at the same time to salute one another,
and interaunswere and debate who should vomit most blood, most slaughters,
and most mischiefs, doing equal deuoyre unto the ordinance of the battles.

Whilst that the great thunder made it self to be heard in all quarters,
many horsemen disbanded themselves out of their ranks as well of the one
party as the other, some for to skirmishe, other for to see the effect of the
Canon, and some for to vewe more better and nearely the site, and the form of
the Camp of their adversaries: yea, and there were also some that sought out
their kinsefolkes and friends, and talked together as well of the event of this
journey, as of the occasions that had moved them to follow that part which
they maintained: but the best advised would not depart from their ensigns,
both because they would not put themselves in the mercy of the Canon, who
taking from him the feet and head of his horse, would make him loose the
good hap to assiste so notable a battle, as also for that they considered,
that they had already enough to do for their parts, and that one ought not to
weary himself before the time of fight, and to tire his horse, as Vegece
mocketh pleasantly some Romans of his, who would come unto the fight quite out
of breath. Tauannes who had learned the commodity of all places of the field,
and the ways of all the quarters, told Monsieur that it was needful to make
the battles to retire a little on the left hand, as well to take the large
and aduantagious field, to the end to have greater ease and liberty to
fight, and to cut off the way from the Protestants, if they would retire
toward their conquests, as also for to save the troops from the fury of the
artillery, the which did marvelously endammage them.

The which gave occasion unto the Admiral to change the encamping of al his
troops, and to stand more on ye right hand upon the way to Moncontour, and
Eruaux, as it were to make a bar for the Catholics, if that they would
thrust in to pass further that way. Thereupon his Excellence commanded Duke
de Montpensier who led the auantgarde for to march, and the Marshall de
Cosse, who stood on the left side of the battalion of the Switzers, to make
the battle draw a little more on the left hand than it was. The which they
executed very readilye, and knew very well to choose a place for to advantage
their army. Yet though this commandment were received, they marched not
immediately: for it is to be presumed, that every Captain would then recognize
and encourage his men, and open unto them the occasions and means to fight
fortunatly. Moreover, every company was preached unto by their Preachers,
namely for the regard of the Protestants, after that the Princes of Navarre
and Conde, had adhorted them to do their deuoire, to consider the consequence
of such a journey, the foul ignomy or most renoumed reputation that they
should get by the event of such a battle, wherein lay those things that every
man of the^ did seek, that is to wit, their goods, their honor, their whole
state, their lives, and their consciences, which is of far greater price, and
therefore since by the well or ill doing in this journey, their life or death was
assured, they in sum prayed them to follow their captains, who would not
fail to lead the^ a very good way.

Then after that Tauennes (whom his Excellence had before sent for, to learn
when it was time for to go unto the charge) had reported unto him, that it was
very good time, and that he must presently give in, because the artillery of
the Protestants maruallously enda^maged the Catholics, and namely that of the
battle, which lay within an hundredth paces of the battallion of Monsieur, and
gave it a very shrewd check: and again, the artillery of the Catholics, by
reason of the place (as I have said) did but a little harm unto the
Protestants, for the causes before discovered. Moreover he told him how ye day
passed away, which might empeache the obteyning of an entiere victory: and in
deed the armies ^ad stood at a stay from seven of the clock in the morning
until three in the afternoon, attending which would difmarch first. Whilst
that the Canon thus played still as well on the one part as the other, his
Excellence commanded the Duke of Montpensier to go resolutely to the charge,
and he himself would also do the same in his quarter. The which was done as
soon as the artillery of the one and the other side was suddenly retired by
the sides, and every company (according to the order aforesaid) did put
themselves in pace, and at the same instant the Trumpets of the Protestants
having sounded Dedans, dedans, it is, it is, the army began to march, seeing the
Catholics now setting forward, for to go on to the encounter.

Upon this, the Duke of Montpensier commanded Martigues for to charge the
runners or Enfans perdus, and so to begin the game, and staying them at the
first. The which they did: for being joined with the Italians and certain
French troops, they marched as though they would have given upon the Enfans
perdus of the footomen of the Protestants, but they no sooner saw themselves
saluted by two or three hundredth harquebusiers, but that they turned very short
on the left hand, and changing their trot into a gallop, gave so fervently
upon Mouy and his regiment, that he being abandoned and forsaken by the two
Cornets of Reisters, that had been appointed to follow them, and his regiment
being broken, was forced to get him away, and to save the greatest part of his
men among the footmen, who being made mad with so piteous an accident, and
foreiudging a miserable end of so unhappy a beginning, lost their hearts, and
disbending themselves by little and little, in the end ran all away for the
best game. The Enfans perdus were the first, who by so doing helped much to
discourage the other, so that they almost altogether forsook the Lansquenets.
At the same time, the Duke of Guise, and la Valerie being followed by many
other companies, advanced themselves lustilye, and came a great trotte to
charge their parrie, who with the same pace hasted to attache them. At the
meeting, many Lances flewe into shiuers, many horses to the hu^sing one of the
other, ran together, iufinite Pistolets made many to fall backwarde, with
their heels higher than their heads, many horsemen were borne to the ground
that never spoke word after.

While that these troops fought with so great pertinacie, the Conte of Saint
F^^ra, Paul Sforza, and certain other Italians, encountered Dautricourt, the
Marquis of Renay, and their companies, who after they had set a broche the
Italian troops, should have followed Dautricourt. For this Gentleman thinking
that he had the victory in his hand, advanced forward so lustily, that
casting himself into the mids of the auantgarde, he saw himself enclosed
and assailed by a great number of horsemen, who after they had pressed him to
yield, and saw his pertinacie in fight, slew him in the field, and all that
had followed him. And passing further, gave upon the rest, who being dispersed
here and there without Captain, were not able to abide the impression of the
French men of arms, who bowing themselves upon the incitation of their
Lance, and being borne by strong horses, buried many under their bellies: yet
these encounters were not done without sending of many of the one part and the
other, for to take the measure of their tomb upon the duste of that field,
and namely of the Catholics, whom the harquebusiers that were on the side of
the Protestants, set off at all liberty, assuring themselves, that after they
had discharged, the horsemen would give the charge upon their parts, and in
the mean time they should have leisure enough to provide for their affairs.

Yet nevertheless for all this, the Admiral, who by reason of his great
practice in arms, the which the long course of his old years, and (which is
more) the diligent marking of so great and so diverse events as had run before
his eyes, as he followed the wars as well abroad as at home, could welneare
certainly judge what would be the event of the battle, counseled the Princes
to retire as covertly, and with as small a train as they could: but as in
adversity men have their eyes more stirring, and their spirits more lively to
epsy, and pry on all sides, the means and ways how to enfranchise
themselves from an ill chance that approaches them near, many horsemen
followed them, so that they saw more seruitors at their tails by one half,
than the ordinary train of their houses would bear, the which helped
nothing to encourage them that saw, or heard afterward of that retraite: the
which made them so much the more to suspect that some ill hap was near, as
the thing had been secret unto them. I leave to rake after these Villiaques,
who did abandon their ensigns, for to follow them that commanded them not,
and I will speak only of those that were most chafed for to fight. All these
fellows being empeached by rickling one another so near, could not see at
all the dismarches, and the cruel affronts of two thousand Reisters
Catholics, and of the companies that assisted the Admiral, as well Frenchmen
as Almaines.

When these battallions saw that they were nere to the encounters, the
Protestats caused their harquebusiers to auance, crying unto them that they
should not shoot but at the horses, but with all assurance. The which
although they did, and shot off at fifty pace, the foremost giving place unto
those that followed, yet they could not shoot off so soon, but that the
Reisters were already come to the charge. The foremost of whom directing their
ranges to run upon the French Protestants, who were on the side of their
Reisters, were courageously received and ouerrun at the first blow, as well
because the nature of the Frenchman is such, that if he once join, he will
still go farther, as also for that the harquebusiers had already well clered
and thinned the ranks of the Reisters, by slaying and hurting many before
hand, who were able to give no farther forward, than the place where they had
been so nearely touched. The Reisters Catholykes not marching together, nor
charging with one and the same trot, but being distributed by regiments, and
sustained by French horsemen, the one company of them attached the Admiral,
who was assisted by the Conte of Mansfelde, and the other charged the two
companies of men of arms of the Admiral, and de Acier, who were followed by
two or three Cornets of Reisters. These charges were hot and very furious for
all men an both sides, and much more cruel on the side of the Catholics, than
on the other, by means of the harquebusiers Protestants, who lively tasted the
Catholics. Some died in the field, other felt themselves so hurt, that they
were not able to go any further, neither had any strength to fight. And because
of the cry, At the horses fellows, at the horses: Many of the beasts were so
pricked to the quick, that they could never serve afterward.

When that these footmen had given every man his blow they found the horses of
the artillery who were retired into that quarter near unto them, I do
believe they were not slothful to use them, presaging (it may be) the
fearful and long flight which they were near unto. The rest provided, and
made the best shifte for themselves that they could. At that charge the
Admiral was hurt between the nose and the ball of the cheek, through the
fault of those companies that had been ordained for to cover him, and fight
before him, who because they had taken the charge sooner than they ought, he
found himself so intermedled among the Catholics, that if the Conte de
Mansfeld (retaking the charge, and with him four or five Cornettes of
Reisters) had not repulsed them, the Admiral had never got out, but had come
unto the courtesy of them that loved him little. This being done, the one and
the other retired a little for to rallye themselves under their ensigns, and
afterward to return to the encounter.

This first rencounter was mortal unto many Catholics, through the means
and occasions aforesaid, so that they seemed to leave the Confederates almost
in the possession of good fortune. For in doede some of them then advancing
themselves upon the Catholics, cried out, victory, victory as though she had
slipped out of the hands of his Excellence. But this cry profited the
Protestants nothing: for it seemed that the Catholics had no less assuced
themselves of their forces, than of the good hour that assisted them, as you
shall hear. Yet because they were seen to be put to flight, it made many
ensigns accompanied with a great number of Catholics to retire, whom the
Protestants rallying themselves under their Ensigns, thought to have charged,
if that a fresh r^^^ment that made as though they would charge the
Protestants their Reisters, (who had now rallyed themselves) had not caused
them to stay.

But because ye have your eyes so fast fixed on the slaughters of the
auantgardes, ye cannot see how the battle dismarcheth by the commandment of
his Excellence. Whose great felicity could not suffer so long rest, and
although he were uncertain of the success of his auantgarde which was now
come to hand strokes, yet he durst to leave his tranquillity, and abandon all
his whole state unto the greatness of his fortune, which had always until
that day, smyled full merrily upon him. Seeing then that he could not abide to
expecte until the footmen had begun the game, he made a sudden departure
from the right side under the conduct of the Duke de Aumalle, the Marquis of
Baden, and with all his Reisters, the which Marquis ran in so far before
the rest, that he was there slain, and many other, for companions of his
mortal charge. Yet this was a small matter: but Monsieur himself, whether his
nature hot and boiling in martial prowes, did solicit him to enter the
battle, or whether besire to lay the army of the Protestants on the
ground, pricked him thereunto: did no sooner see the Confederates buskle
themselves to fight, but that he marched full upon the discouert of the
artillery, the which had not ceased, neither did then cease to play, as well
in the Esquadron of Monsieur, as of other, and namely in that of the footmen,
and his Excellence advanced himself so lustilye upon the Protestants, that
the Switzers under Colonel Phiffer, and their General Mern, with the other
battallions, remained a great way behind him. Now seeing that such a Seigneur
went so fervently to the charge, the encounter may not be thought to be other
than furious. But (as I have showed before) he found an other order and medley
of men of war than he had thought. First and foremost his Excellence was
saluted by four score or an hundredth harquebusiers on horseback, that there
discovered themselves. Furthermore, when that the horsemen had assured
themselves that the harquebusiers had given a great check to his troop, and
that the Reisters had also done much more mischief, the Frenchmen did cast
themselves head, feet, and hands, as it were desperately into his Esquadron,
and breaking in even to the Cornet, made all them that had followed his
Excellence to forsake the place, for all the deuoyre, and all the force that
the Duke of Long ville, Tauannes, Carnauallet, Villars, and all those that had
followed and accompanied him could make, and all that ever they could do: in
sum, this charge was so terrible, that the most assured ensigns began now
to turn back again, as if they would demand succor of Mareschall de
Cosse, who had not yet departed one foot from the left side of the Switzers,
and had auaunced them forward apace, for to be in time as he himself was, for
to succor their fellows. And to say the truth, if he had not been, the
battle had been then ended. And one may truly note in him, that all his
enterprises, because they never were none of those hasty and lightly
advanced, were always valiantly and fortunately executed, as things maturely
deliberated, are always most sure in execution.

All in time Tauannes ran to the Switzers, and made them to come a trot to
give the charge, their Colonel Mern marching before them. The Mareschall de
Cosse, the young Brisac aduauncing forward, made the Protestants to stay
somewhat, who moderated their pace a little, that they might rallye themselves,
and charge those that came fresh. In fine the Conte Lodowick with his troops
as well French as Almaines, gave lustily upon the Mareschall de Cosse, Conte de
Mansfelde, Tauannes, and other, that flanked the left side of the Switzers: it
was very valiantly fought on the one side and the other, as well with blows of
Lances and Coutelas, as of Pistolettes. The impetuositie and fury of the
which Pistolets, does not permit our slaughter in fight to endure so long as it
did in ancient time. For then every man affronting his adversary, would not
depart out of the place, before that the happier man had slain his enemy, or
made him obedient to his will. But because we do assure our selves more in the
diuelrie of our Pistolets, than in valiant arms, after we have discharged our
Pistolet upon our enemy, as we run we do pass further, as the horse will,
either for to recharge, or to take the tucke. And it does most often happen
that the companies do find themselves so dispersed of ye enemies after the
first charge, they must tarry a long time to rallye themselves, expecting the
second encounter, as it here happened: for after they had been well martyred
with the first impression, they perceived that they were so put out of array,
that they must needs retire for to reunite themselves. But the Protestants
seeing themselves to be so small a number, and the Catholics to be refreshed
and strengthened to the purpose, as well by the companies of the Mareschaur of
the Camp, as by the Switzers, who were ready to give the charge, lost their
anger and hatred to recharge.

In the mean time, his Excellence had the leisure to be refreshed with an
horse, through the aid and mean of the Marquis of Villars and Biron, with the
troops of the Mareschalles (ordained for to rallye the dispersed) went all
against the Switzers, for to encourage them, and to make them march against
the Lansquenettes. Neither was it long, but that the Mareschall, the Conte de
Mansfelde, and his company being rallyed on the other side of the Switzers,
returned altogether to the charge. Then Biron with his companies (with whom
all that had fled, and other that had wandered from their Cornettes, had
joined and rallyed) encouraged the Switzers, and told them, that if they
would but follow him, he would overthrow the rest of the Protestants, the
greatest part of whom in deed retired as fast as they could. The rest being
joined with them of the auantgarde (who for the same occasion (not being able
to abide the shocke of the Duke de Montpensier) had gone unto them of the
battle for to rencounter, that they might retire in mass or plumpe, with as
little damage as could be) left unto his Excellence with the field of the
battle, the felicity and glory of this entire journey, being constrained
miserablye to abandon the Lansquenettes to the cruelty of the Switzers their
ancient enemies, who entering in, as it were at the breach, which the
French harquebusiers had made in their battallion, slew them all for the most
part, although that many of them with joined hands, and knees on the
ground, cried out, Bon papist, bon papist moy, I am a good Papist, I am a good
Papist. As in deed, no few of them were Catholics, by reason of the little
acception that such sort of people have, who will first give them
intertainement: yet at the length they being wearye rather of stryking, than of
killing, were in the end constrained to leave those occasions of sighing and
weeping unto other, who took them as it were into their service, for to serve
them afterward as it were their Custerels. Of four thousand, two hundredth or
thereaboutes escaped their bloudye hands, and almost seven hundredth other,
who being less armed, and better legged than the foremoste, and having the
knowledge to presage by the beginning of a sleete, the coming of so piteous a
storm, had fled out of the field, with the greatest part of the French
footmen, who (as I have said) had done the same long time before. Near three
thousand harquebusiers were aranged with these Lansquenets, who had all felt
the same fury of the victorious, if it had not been for certain French
Captains in chief, and Monsieur himself, who being a right Gentleman in
deed, contented himself with the honor and the happy end of the notablest
victory that ever was given unto him in France, and it may also happen, that
ever shall be afoorded him in any other country, commanding them to pardon
the Frenchmen. Yet nevertheless one thousand or twelve hundredth dyed there
for to enrich the plain of Cron, and to serve for an eternal mark of the
journey of Moncontour, the which the Protestants lost, as well through the fault
of the hearts of those that fled, as for the ill disposition and array of
their horsemen.

For the General being curiouslye careful to hide the small number of his
men, would stretch the^ forth in length like unto an hedge, for to give
appearance unto the Catholics that they were far mo than they were in in
deed, and by this means to have made the^ cold to encounter them, that the
journey nere at hand, might be passed over in peace, because he doubted that
he should not therein bear himself well with advantage, the which the
Catholics gained, being assured of his state there, because they had better
disposed their horses in gross battallions, who giving as it were desperately
through these hedges of the white Cassockes, ouerranne them, and put out of the
array the greatest part of them, notwithstanding all the hayle of the
harquebusse shot which they made to rain thick and threefolde upon them. And
otherwise the Reislers were not able to abide the impression of the French
horsemen, because they fought separated, contrary unto their natural and
ordinary fashion, so that they were in the end broken by the Catholics. The
form of fight in the manner of an hedge, is good for Frenchman against
Frenchman, but more proper to one that bears Lance, than unto a Pistoletter,
who we see do all charge together, and the hindermost do not cover nor hinder
the foremoste: and as this disposition was of no force that day, so let him
not use it any more hereafter. In sum, they lost very few of the horsemen,
both for the grace and favor that their spurs gained those that fled at
the very first (for to mark I believe their lodgings at Partenaye, and then at
Rochel, and Angoulesme, and farther too, if they had durst to have gone) and
also for the few charges that they made that remained and stood to it. Who
being united quicklye after the first and second charges, retired, the which
of truth was more honorable than the fight passed, as I shall show you in
another place. True it is, that the Catholics reallying themselves, made them
to remember the journey or battle of Spurs. But when one has done his
deuoire, the retraite in cases desperate, does carry no dishonor.

Such was the end of the battle, wherein Frenchmen, Almaines, Burgonions,
Italians, Switzers, Flemmings, and Lansquenets tried sufficiently the prowess
and dexterity of themselves and other, with leisure enough. Henry Champer now
with his Cornet of Englishmen was coming thitherwarde, but being arrived at
Niort, when the battle was fought, and having seen theyll hap of this
journey by she long train of the fleers, incorporated himself with the mass
of the escaped. The fight endured not above two hours.

Duke de Aumalle, and Biron, with the Mareschalles of the Camp, Torre, and
many other, pursued the chase, and Monsieur followed after them with the rest
of the army, being herin wisely and well counseled. For the General never
ought to trouble his person (in whom the good or ill hap of the whole army
does seem to be reposed) with the pursuit of them that flee: for as much as
the peril that may happen, is common unto him with the meanest soldier of
his troops. The pursuit was not long, because that the Protestants being all
joined together (as I have told you, and notably sustained by eight or nine
Cornets of Almaines, with the Conte Lodowicke and Mansfelde (to whom it is
natural to keep better order, whether it be in march, or in fight, than any
other nation that is) durst stay for the hotest of the pursuers: so that
afterward they went but a marching pace, for when the Catholics thought to
annoy them, suddenly this mass would turn head, and then they durst not to
run upon them. In this sort they marched even to Eruaux, (the Catholics
beginning to retire) and from thence to Partenay, where they arrived about ten
of the clock in the night, five hours after the discomfiture, and suddenly
held counsel with the Princes. About three or four hundredth horsemen of the
auantgard (without accounting their servants) passing forthright more near to
Moncontour, had also taken the way to Partenay, where at one time they
rencountred one another. The taking of this village served them to great
purpose. Captain Allarde had received charge from Monsieur, to go with as much
speed as he could possible the Monday after he had dined, for to take
Partenay, and to put two or three ensigns in it, as he that had always been
Captain thereof before: but the Admiral had at the same time dispatched
thitherwarde Aubouiniere, of Chaile in Poitou, for to take it: the which he did
with such diligence, that he arrived a little before Allarde.

The Princes and Protestants lost in this battle three thousand Lansquenets,
and fiftene hundredth Frenchmen, the number of the dead that were found,
seemed far greater: but the greatest part were Custerelles or servants: all
were buried by the commandment of his Excellence, and also all the villages,
farms, and hamlets thereabouts, were enjoined to bury those that were near
unto them. Of the horsemen near three hundredth were slain, and no fewer
horses were dead or hurt: for the Reisters for the most part did chiefly
shoot at the horses, knowing that if the horse lay on the ground, or
otherwise were not able to do his deuoyre, the horseman would come to reason.
Of men of name there was not any slain, but Tauegy de Bouchet, Escayer de
Puygreffier, which some do call Saint Eire in Poitou, one of the most ancient
and resolute men of war in France, who in fighting valiantly, was borne to
the ground, and slain in the field, as were Dautricourt, Biron, the brother
of the Catholic, and Saint Bonet, Ensign bearer of the Admirals company. La
Noue was taken prisoner, as also was de Acier, after that he had lustily
overthrown the Reisters that charged him. The Admiral was hurt with a
Pistolet between the nose and the left ball of his cheek, and his horse hurt.
Many other, namelye Reisters were wounded, who were afterward almost all saved
at Rochell. All the artile^rie was gotten, and their furniture. All the baggage
of the Reisters was spoiled, except their horses, whom their servants saved.
The baggage of the French men was saved, because it had been advanced upon the
way to Partenay and Niort.

Of the Catholics, few of the footmen were slain, and about five or six
hundredth horsemen, namely Reisters, and twice as many hurt: the most part of
whom died afterward of their wounds. The Conte Reingraffe the elder, the
Marquis of Baden, Cleremont of Dauphine, the old Reingraffe slain. The young
Reingraffe, the Earls of Issie and Santelle, Italians, the Duke of Guise,
Schomberg, Bassompierre, de Mailly, hurt and saved.

Thucidides who is reputed to be the truest writer of the ancientes, speaking
of the discomfiture of the Ambracians and their allies by the Athenians, does
not tell the number of the dead, because it seemed excessive unto all other,
but himself, who did not think that they exceeded a thousand men, searing
that he should be named a liar. In the like cause am I, who will not tell how
many Protestants were slain, for fear of bring controlled. Always when I
do take my pen in hand, I blushe to see how that some Catholics, who do
say that they were at the battle, and greatly busied in kylling, will find
it strange: considering (will other say) the report that was made unto the
King, to all the Potentates of Christendom, and to his Excellence himself.
Let them weygh that there came but six thousand Lansquenettes to the
Protestants. They will grant me this, that the long and paynefull voyage
which they made, the troublesome excursions, the importunate charges, and
other annoyances that the Duke de Aumalle brought unto them, did take a moitie
of a third of them out of the world, add there unto, that the rolls of
Strangers are never full. Will they deuye me, that after they were joined with
the Princes, dyed as many more at Saint Yrier, and afterward at Lusignen, and
the long siege of Poitiers, where all the Frenchmenne endured so many
calamities? And what of the rencounter of Saint Cler, where the Canon playde at
pleasure through those poor bodies that lay groueling biting the dust?
Moreover, this is very certain, that almost three hundredth were carried back
by the Catholics to Moncontour, and it is most true, that three hundredth were
afterward slain in Bruage and the Isles of Santongne (as I shall tell you)
besides them that wandered from the Ensigns, and served after the battle, or
were slain by the paisantes. The rest of the whole number will scarce amount
to the three hundredth of pay, who under the charge of Hector Reilen were
conducted home into their country by the Catholykes at the Kings
commaundement^, after that peace was made and published. Reckon these numbers,
and (it may be) you shall find that there were not so many slain as I do
say. Of the Frenchmenne, that two parts were saved by so shameful a flight,
you ought not to doubt: join thereunto the curtefie that Monsieur commanded
to be used unto the rest of the French men. To have fled, and to be slain in
fight, be two incompatible things, and then consider the retrayte of the
Reisters Protestants, of whom there died about an hundredth and fifty: If you
do not now believe me, I will say, that in your speech you devise as Clerks
of arms, or else do it of passion. Nor I will say farther (the which will
more disease you to digest) that the Catholics had at Moncontour, a loss of
more importance than the Protestants, who lost none but their footmen.

Monsieur pursuing the Protestants with speedy pace, rested not before that
the night took him, which was at Saint Generou upon la Tone, and after he was
lighted off from his horse, he gave thanks to God, for that he had vouchsafed
to bestow upon him so goodly, happy, and notable victory, to the profit and
contentment of the king his brother. After this victory, Monsieur recovered
all Poitou, when that the Protestants had dispersed their army to be
refreshed in Xantogne, Quercye, and Gascogne. But the next Summer they were in
the field again, and forced the king to make peace with them in August
following, being in the year 1570. granting them pardon, and also liberty of
their consciences.

The Battle of Lepanto, fought by sea upon the coast of Greece, betvveene the
navy of the Christian league, under the conduct of Don John de Austria, and the
Turkish fleet, governed by Haly Bassa, in Anno. 1572. Out of Peter de Bizari.
WHen that Selym the second, the Turk, grieuouslye molested the Islandes of
Cyprus and Candie, Philip the king of Spain, the seignorie of Venice, and Pius
the fifte Bishop of Rome, entered into a strong league against him, and in the
year 1^72. did set forth a mighty fleet in that quarrel, aided herein by
the Dukes of Fl^rence; Sauoy, and other Princes, and the knights of Malta, and
the City Genoa* This fleet consisted of two hundredth and eight galleyes, six
galeazes, sieve and twenty ships, forty Brigantines and Fragates, and five
and twenty thousand soldiers, Italians, Spaniardes, and Almaines, besides
two thousand gentlemen that served for piety and honor, without wages. This
mighty navy (the high Admiral whereof was Don John de Austria, base son of
the Emperor Charles the fifth, yet so that Mark Antonie de Colonna, and
Sebastian Venerio, the Admiralles of the Papes and Venetian nauies, should be
always called into counsel, and that done which should seem good unto the
greater part of them) launched out of the haven of Messina in Scicile in
August, to the uttermost of their power to endommage the Turk. The seventh of
October, they being before the Isles Cuzolari, in the Archipelago, had
intelligence that the Turkishe nanie of 333. galleyes, and such like vessels,
was in the gulf of Lepanto, and hasted directly unto our navy, and were not
far off. When that this was heard and known to be true, Don John impelled
through the surpassing valiance both of his own heart, and also of his
fellows and allies, and specially through the entreaty and persuasion of
Augustine Barbadico, the Viceadmirall or Prouiditor of the Venetian fleet,
incontinently commanded that flagge to be hanged forth which was the signal of
battle, and that the fleet might come together, he commanded one of the
greatest gunnes to be shot off. Then he went aboorde a long boat, taking with
him Jews of Cardona, and Soto his secretary, and glistering all in bright
armor, went about all the whole fleet with most joyful countenance, and
passing stoutnesse of courage, and gave charge that every man should follow
their ensigns, and keep their array, and then adhorted and desired the
Captains and soldiers, that they would fight valiantly and stoutlye, and
think that they carried that day the riches, honor, glory, liberty, faith,
and religion of their countries in their valiant hands. Wherefore they should
be ready, and fully bent to invade the Turks, as soon as the signal should
be given, and that if they vanquished, this day would bring perpetual
felicity unto them and theirs: but contrariwise if they should behave them
dishonourably and shamefully, and be vanquished, that then it would be a
beginning of everlasting shame, and of all calamities. With these and such like
words, the hearts of all men (although they were before of themselves
fiercelye enough incited) were more and more inflamed, and now every man
burnt in immesurable desire of fight. It can scarce be told for how fortunate
and happy an abodement it was taken, that every man as soon as they saw
him, began to applaude, and also to cry out victory, victory, and these
words did they oftentimes ever and anon repeat. Those things being speedilye
done, he returned again into the Idmirall galley almost at such time as the
two fleetes were within an arrows shot one of another. But because that
diverse of the galleyes seemed to be somewhat slack to take their place, Jews
Rechezenes straight way went out of the Admiral, and being rowed in a boat,
gave it in charge unto every galley, and then returned again unto the Prince.
The middle battle wherein were threescore and three galleys, did the three
high Admiralles guide, and Dom John kept in the mids: on whose right side
went the Popes Admiral galley, in whom was Mark Antonie de Colonna, the high
Admiral, and Pompey de Colonna, Romagasso, and Michael the Popes Nephewe, with
many other noblemen. But on his left was Venerio the Venetian Admiral, whom
many valiant and noble men accompanied, and a small distaunce from her
followed the Admiralles of Charino Maripetri, and John L^ureta^o, behind them
the Admiral of the Genouese, in the which the Prince of Parma was, and the
Admiral of the Duke of Sau^y, the Captain whereof was Ligny, a man renoumed
both for birth and martial knowledge, and in her was also the Prince of
Vrbine, and the wings of the myddle battle were backed on one side with the
Admiral of the Knights of Malta, whose Captain was Peter Iustiniano, a
forward and valiant man, and on the other with Lumolines Admiral, in whom
was Paul Iordane, a Gentleman of approved prowes. Whylest that Dom John does
chearefullye and diligently execute all things which do appertain unto his
charge, and does omit nothing that does belong unto a valiant and noble Prince:
the rest of his fellows, and the Captains of the galleyes did also by their
own authority command their soldiers to repair unto the ensigns, and
that no man should depart out of his place, and that every man should put
himself in a readiness for to fight. Moreover, every one of them adhorted
their soldiers, and did to their vttermoste declare unto them all things that
might inflame their hearts, and nothing was pretermitted by them, which did
appertain unto the duties of good Captains. In the mean time, every man
made his most hearty and suppliant prayers unto God for the good success of
the fight, and then took a short breakefast, and also the Mariners and rowers
being refreshed with meat and drink, and anon all of them, and every one of
them with prompt and valiant hearts made ready themselves for to fight. Two of
the galeazes went before the middle battle. John Andrew Doria Admiral of the
Genouese fleet had the leading of the right wing, wherein were threescore and
four galleyes, and also two of the galeazes went before him. Augustine
Barbadico was Captain of the left wing, with fifty three galleyes, and
likewise two of the Galeazes went before him. But Andrew Baciano Marquis of
Sancrace, and Admiral of the Neapolitan fleet, who had the leading of the
rerewarde, or the battle of succor, stood with his galleyes, who were in
number thirty eight, half a mile from the battelles. But that our men might
fight with happy event, it was wrought through the help and singular
providence of God, who made the wind which at the beginning did greatly
favor the enemies their navy, by little and little to fall, and anon there
followed such a calms, that the Turkishe vessels could scarce be stirred out
of their place, in so much that their ships were rowed forth, and in the
mean time more leisure and advantage was given unto our men to set their
array. The Admiral of the Turkishe fleet (Haly Bassa) had before this time
sent one Caracosse with a Brigantine to take a vewe of our navy, the which
he reported unto the Admiral to be far less than it was in deed, either
because he could not well see the galleyes of the left wing, by reason of his
speedy posting, or else, which is more likely, for the Islande that was behind
them. But two other that were sent after Caracosse, having vewed our fleet
more diligently, and curiously marked the kings flagges, returned speedilye,
and told that our navy was very strong, and very excellentlye well appointed
and prepared to fight, with their ensigns advanced. But as soon as he heard
this, he greatly marvelled, as he that had before fully persuaded himself,
and also the same had been told him by Caracosse, that our navy was far
less tha^ it was in deed, and therefore would our men go back again as
soon as ever they saw them coming, and seek their safety by shameful
flight, or else if that they were so foolish hardye as to fight, they would
receive a notable overthrow. He is also reported to have enquired whether that
those vessels which were placed in the front, were Venetian or Spanishe, and
when he was answered, that the one was intermired with the other, he was very
pensive, and had thought at the first that it scarce could have been by any
means possible. At the first he had thought to have wintered either in the
gulfes of Cataro, Corfu, or Cephalenia, but after that he had learned for a
certainty that our men had rigged forth a mighty navy, he returned
inco^tinently into Greece, where he commanded new bands of soldiers to be
pressed forth, and they being speedily embarked in his navy, the which was
also again new furnished with victualles and other necessary things, he
directed his course with the rest of the Lanizars and other ordinary soldiers
that he had before levied, toward Cuzzologri, which was almost midde way
between Lepanto and Patras, with intent to fight with our fleet, and in that
mind was he the more confirmed, for that he had understood by Caracosses
words, that his navy was far the greater. Wherefore at the first the Turks
began to rejoice, and promised themselves assured victory, and so great a
desire to fight had inflamed all of the^, that every man coueted to go before
his fellows, although it were commanded under pain of death that no man
should go before the Admiral galley. They were like unto a mighty thick
wood, and could scarce be restrained from fight, and when they saw our men
come forward to fight very valiantly and courageously, and every galley to
follow the ensigns according to the discipline of war, and in a very goodly
order, with the noses of their galleys directed against the enemies, they also
incontinently began to set their navy with great art and celeritie, and they
had so much the more conceived the victory in hope, because the wind did at
the beginning blow very commodiouslye for them, as we have said before. But
for that the beams of the sun which shined that day very bright, were full
in their eyes, they could not so aptly and commodiously order and set their
vessels in array. Partaw the General of the soldiers, and Haly the Admiral
of the fleet, which two did lead the middle battle, had appointed Mahomet
Bey to be Captain of the right wing, with fifty galleys, and with him were
Sirocke the President of Alexandria, Caurlaw, Asiscau, Dragan, Agadel, Bassa,
Vstregasa, and many other men of great mark. But Occhialy had charge of the
left wing, with almost fourscore and ten vessels, and there accompanied him
Caraiolo, and Arabey his sons, and many expert soldiers, and also many of
the Pirates: and they went directly against Doria: their wing seemed to be much
stronger than his, and also the galleys to be far mo in number, because that
Doria his galleys that were on the left hand not far from the main land,
could not at the first be seen. But the principal Chiefetaines themselves
(who were as ye have heard, Haly and Partaw) were guarded on both sides with
almost as many galleys. And of those noble men that accompanied them, these
were part, Agan the master of the Arsenall, Mustapha Celibi the Treasurer,
Treymontana, Amath Bey, with his brother, and Haly his son, Amath Aga, the
Captain of Teuthrama, Assis Caiga, the governor of Gallipoli, Caracosse,
Cambey the son of Barbarossa, Malamur, the Captain of Mitilene, Deli
Solomon, Gider the Captain of Scio, Cassembey the Lieutenaunt of the Rhodes,
Prouy Aga the Captain of Napoli, Giapar Cilibi President of Calaba, Dordagnan,
Dondomeney, Beribeuole, Osman, Reul, Agada, Ciasafer, Dram Raise, and many other
of mark, both for their riches and authority, and also for their prowes in
warrefare. Thus when they saw our men (the which in deed happen unto them
otherwise than they had expected) ready and courageous to fight, they
incontinentlye aranged their galleyes for the battle, being cast into the
form of a Croisant or half Moon, as they have of long time accustomed. The
Admiral of the Turks very seuerelye commanded all men, and every man in the
name of Selim for to fight without fear, and valiantly against their enemies
their navy. If that any man did forsake the battle, either for sloth,
fear, or any other cause, he and his vessel, and all that were with him
should be incontinently consumed with fire. In the mean time he commanded (as
our men did) that every man should repair incontinently unto his rank and
order, and keep it, ordeining a grievous pain for all them that should do
otherwise. Moreover, he assembling his men together, adhorted them to be
myndefull of their wonted prowes, through the which they had so often hitherto
put to flight this same enemy, and reduced into their memory all the noble
acts that they had done in former years against Charles the fifth, and his
son Philip during the reygne of Solomon. Moreover, he briefelye repeated all
that they had at sundry times done against the Venetians, and what they had
of late gotten by wars and arms, that is to wit: how they had augmented the
Turkishe dominions with the kingdom of Cyprus. Wherefore they ought to
remember, that they were also now to fight with those men whom they had so
often discomfited, and that they should make a way and entry, not only into
Italy, but also shortly unto the possession of all Europe, and therefore they
should fight valiantly, and assuredly trust that God and Mahomet, through
whose help their ancestors had subdued so many kingdoms and Provinces, and
had brought back from the vanquished enimye, so many renowned victories,
would also be with, and assiste them in this battle. These things and many
such like did he set before his soldiers, with an oration no less grave
than eloquent, that thereby his soldiers (although he saw them of their own
accord to be sharply inkindled to fight) might yet be through these
adhortations the more and more accensed. Now was all the day almost spente,
when that the nauies on both sides were made ready to fight. The ennimies
fleet was set in almost the same array that ours was. For the middle
battle came against our middle battle, and their wings against ours. Our six
great galleyes or Galeazes (as I have told you) went before, of whom two
stood before either wyng, as a most sure Bulwark, and the rest went before
the myddle battle. These great Galleyes charging the leaders of the Turkishe
battelles against them, did beat the ennemie on all sides with their
ordinance, and committed horrible slaughter. But although the Turks had
received many great losses by them, and saw that their orders and ranks
were scattered, yet they being passed by them, did with a certain marvelous
pertinacie and stoutness of heart, get them incontinentlye unto the
Ensigns. So anon the two fleetes joined together in battle, and the high
Admiral galleyes of both fleetes using the surpassing cheerfulness of the
Mariners and Rowers, ran together with so great force and violence, that
their beakes on both sides were strycken off. They fought valiantlye and
variablye for the space of an whole hour, the victory enclyning unto neither
part, fortune giving joyful hope of prosperous euente, now unto our men,
and then unto the adversaries. And now they began to fight no longer with
Arrows. Darts, and Gunnes, but encountered close together with their Swords.
But when our men had twyce boorded the Turkishe Admiral, and had gotten unto
the Maste, and seemed to be masters of her, they were twyce repulsed thence
(and not without a notable loss) by new succoure that ran thither. While
that these things are in doing, Bernardine de Cardona, seeing that Jews de
Figaroa the Captain of the stem of the high Admiral, had many of his
men wounded and slain, came speedilye to relieve and succoure him, with
Michael de Moncada, to whom also that charge had been enjoined. But whylest
that Bernardine fought valiantlye at the stem with his sword and target, he
being shot in with three pellets, fell down and dyed the next morning. And in
that place were also Peter Zaputha, Jews de Ferez, Pliege the father, Federick
de Benauides, Gusman, Philip de Rhodes, Ruide de Mendozza, John de S^to, and
Jews de Rochenes, who was sometime at the standard, and sometimes with Dom
John, and all these noble gentlemen fought against the enemy with great and
incredible valor. At length our men still urging with sharp sight, and having
gotten a favorable aspect of victory, did after an hour and an halfes fight
discomfite the middle battle, and boorded and took the Admiral galley, in
whom were about five hundredth of the noblemen slain, and mo taken and
wounded: the Admiral himself while that he encourages his men, he erecteth
those that do faint and be fearful, he confirms the courageous, he
extolleth to the heavens those that fight valiantly, and promises them great
rewards: finally (whilst that he executes no less the charge of an
excellent Chiefetaine, than of a stout soldier, is slain with a small shot
that hit him in the head, the which being streightway cut off from his neck,
was brought by a Spaniard unto Dom John, who as soon as he saw it, commanded
it to be set on ye point of a spear for a space, and held it aloft with his
own hand as it were a trophey, and to strike terror into the hearts of the
rest of his enemies, who fought yet very valiantly, and anon were all the
Turkish flagges pulled down, and one of the cross hanged out in their place.
But although that a principal galley of the enemies suddenly invaded the
Admiral, when that she had almost vanquished her enemies, yet she had the same
event that the rest had. While that the high Admirals do most fiercely
encounter each other, Partaw and Colonna encountered together, and every one of
Colonna his galleys with the Turkishe, some with two, and some with three, as
Colonna himself, and the Admiral of the Venetians had done; and equal almost
was the prowes of the soldiers on both sides. At the beginning of the
encounter, many were slain, but most on the enemies part, by reason that our
men had in every galley three hundredth skillful and very well practiced
harquebusiers, and on the other side the enimye had very few, although in
stead of them there were innumerable archers, and among them some on
horseback, who deadly wounded many of our men. But in the mean time the
Galleye slaves also brought no small help to the obteyning of the victory, by
hurling of Darts and stones upon the enemy. While that the chief Captains of
the fleetes encounter one the other with so bloody and cruel fight, all
vessels of both nauies do also in all parts furiously fight one against the
other, and Doria, and Occhiali run together. But here was the fight most
troublesome and hardest, because that Doria had joined with so subtle an
enemy, and an old beaten Captain, and one whom he saw did recule back,
that he might choose that which he judged would be most for his advantage.
This was a great impediment, that his counsels and intents could not be
known, nor all the galleyes brought forth at the first. But when they at
length, though late, came unto fight: Doria fought valiantly, and had with him
Octauian Ganzaga, Vincent Vitelli, and certain noble men of Spain, who with
the rest bestirred themselves not lasily. Whilst that this furious fight
continues, Jews de Rechezenes dealt with Don John, to go out of hand for to
succor the right wing, because he had seen and marked that many of the
enemies galleyes that had not yet begun to fight, made thither, and also that
sundry of Doria his galleyes were somewhat far off. When the Admiral was
come, there was a fierce and bloody fight committed. There were with Don John,
John Vasques, Coranade, Andrada, and Francis Doria, who fought all very
valiantly, and although that at the beginning few of the galleyes followed the
Admiral, yet they which had been appointed to guard her sides, did never
forsake her. But the Admiral of the Spanishe fleet chauncing to see a galley,
wherein were the sons of the Turkishe Admiral (whom they thinking to be
alive and well, diligently and carefully fought for here and there) made in
unto her, and they fought together with passing prowes, for in the Turkishe
galley were a great number of valiant men: and in the Spanishe were, the son of
the Constable of Castile, John Velasco, Alexander de Torelles, and many other
knights of Arragon. At that time also Peter Justinian the Admiral of the
fleet of the Knights of Malta, a man of very stout courage and great
valor. being assailed by three galleyes, fought so valiantlye, that he boorded
two of them, and had also almost boorded the third, when that other three
Turkishe galleys seeing the flagge of Saint John, did speedilye invade him on
all sides, and they being joined with the other three, slew almost all his men,
among whom were fifite Knights of the religion, who had with marvelous
prowes long time sustained the violent assault of their enemies. Insomuch that
all men thought she had been quite lost: when behold upon a sodeyne and not
without the instinct of God) two galleyes of his fellows (that had fought so
valiantly with other three of the ennimies, that they had taken almost all of
them) seeing Justinian his galley in great distress and danger, speedilye
hasted to help her, whom they delivered out of all danger, and found the
Adinirall yet alive (although he were shot in with three arrows) and still
fighting with unappalled heart, at the deck, with those few souldrours that
were left alive, being cast into a ring. In the mean time Occhiah very hardlye
pressed Doria his side on all parts with his galleyes, and had now taken ten
of our galleyes. While that they thus encounter with doubtful victory, the
array was broken in the adverse part, and certain small vessels fled out of
the battle, whom yet our men did not chase, for that it seemed to be no
matter of any great importance, but bent their strength directlye toward
that part which was most oppressed by the enemy. When Occhiali percepued
this, he leaving the galleyes which be had a little before taken,
incontinentlye made toward the middle battle: but when he saw that the
middle battle was discomfited, and that Don John was come thither with his
galley to help Doria, he incontinentlye began to think of flight. But our
men to interelude him, did take before hand a certain place through the
which they had thought be must needs have passed: but he to escape the
danger, directed his course close unto the shore, and there landed all the
men that were in his galleyes, and thus the greatest part of them were saved
by swimming. But if it had not chanced that the greater part of our Galley
slaves (from whom their fetters were that day taken, and liberty promised
them, if that they did their ducties lustilye and faithfullye) had not tarried
in those galleyes of the enemy, which had been taken in the battle, not one
Turk had escaped. But now many of them were saved by flighte. Don John,
Baciano, and Doria speedilye pursued Occhial: until that it was almost night.
But he fleeing away in the night time with Sails and Oars, accompanied with
sundry Galleyes, (for the number was then uncertain, some reporting more and
some fewer, but yet the common fame was thirtye) escaped in safety: neither
could it be then certainelye known what way he had taken. But in the mean
while in another quarter, Barbadico and Mahomet Bey fought together with
great ferocitie. And albeit that every one of our men did his duty, and
fought very valiantlye and couragiouslye, and specially the leader of the
battle, and also Antonye Canali, and Mark Quirini, the Lieutenauntes, yet
they had received great incommoditie, and doubtless had been in no small
danger, if Aluaro Baciano, that led the rerewarde, had not speedilye come
with succor. By his coming, the fight was far more sharplye renewed, and
they did charge the adverse part with such force and violence, that they
discomfited them: wherein they were also helped by a fortunate wind which
blewe with us, and carried the smoke of our ordinance upon the ennimye, and
did beat back theirs upon themselves, whereby their sight was much
dymmed and obscured, whereas our men saw them very playnelye and
perfectlye. In this conflicte and fight were many slain on both sides. But
the manne of most renoumed fame and courage, was Barbadico, who was shot
into the eye with an arrowe, as he fought very valiauntlye and lustilye, at
what time the prowes and manne hoode of the Venetian Lieutenants, although it
were often also seen at other times, yet then certes did most specially
appear. For when they saw that Barbadico was stricken in the eye with a very
grievous wound, and that he was so impeached by the immeasurable grief
thereof (although that he suppressed it with surpassing stoutness of heart)
that he could not any longer execute that which he had a little before done,
so stoutlye and excellently: they did so perform the duties of stout
Captains and soldiers, that nothing was wanting in them. But Barbadico died
that evening, and not without the sighing and sorrow of all good men. It is
said that before he died, he asked which part had the victory, and being
told that our men had gotten it, and that Selyms navy was part taken, and
part sunken, and burnt, he gave immortal thanks unto God therefore, and
immediately after departed most joyful out of this life unto the heavenly. I
cannot omit one notable act of Aluaro Baciano, that happened in this battle.
He seeing a mighty Admiral galley of the Turks to make in lustilye toward
our Admiral, laid her aboorde himself, and took her, but not without some
loss of his men, and his own target was shot in with three small pellets, and
as he fought valiantly with her, there came another ship fraught full of
noblemen of Naples for to help him. Furthermore, it chanced, that John de
Cardona the Admiral of the Sicilian fleet, and to whom this office was
enjoined in all this voyage to go before the fleet with eight galleys to scout
and learn the counsels and intents of the enemy, was entered a road with
four galleyes to execute his office a little before the time of the consticte:
but he returned in good time, even then when the two fleetes began to join in
battle, and coming unto his place which had been before assigned, he found
it very open, insomuch that he was forced to take it before fiftene of the
enemies galleys that approached. For when he noted how great detriment it
would bring, if that the enemy got in at that gappe, he by fighting with
great policy and celeritie, did foreshutte them from that entry, neither did
any one of them enter before that the Admiral came to succor Doria, through
whose and also other men's help, those galleys were taken with small labor.
There were in these fou^^ galleyes of Cardona about five hundredth Spaniardes,
of whom scarce fifty escaped unhurt, no nor any man that bare office. There
were slain in this battle on our side of all fortes, about eight thousand,
and almost so many hurt. Men of mark slain were these, John, and Bernardine
of the noble house of Cardona in Spai^e, Ke^gi^^^ and Horatis Orsini, noble
Romans. Of the Venerian nobility, Banedict^ S^peranzi, Catarino Malipetri,
Vincent Eu^riai, H^er^mi and Marino Contarini, John Lauredano, Andrew
Barbaedrica, Fra^ncis B^^o, Mark Antonie Lando, Antony Pasqualigi, and many
other of noble blood. Moreover, John Baptista, Benedi^t Cip^^^ (...) Cotonie
Cudem^nico, Cydon, James Trissini of Vicenza, Hier^ (...) ^^^^^zi, Andrewe
Calergi, and Malatesta of Rimini, who was wi^^^ Bar^^^i^^^. Of them that were
wounded, were John de Austri^^ with^^^ arrowe, but with a light wound: Paul
Forano with another arrowe, the Conte de San Fiora, with a pellet of a g^nne,
and Tro^l^ Sauello with the same, and Mark Molini, a Captain of the
soldiers of Malta. And also Thomas de M^dica, Martello Re^eri^, Biffoli,
Martelino Guicciardini, Spina, Mazzing^, Iuli^ Nal^^^, Guia^^uo; Magnali, John
Maria Pucoi, Tornaboni, Figliazi, Federick Marcello, and Berard^, all Gentlemen
and Knights of Florence. But a certain number of the enemies that were slain,
could scarce be known, because that very many of the^ were drouned, yet the
same is, that fistene thousand were slain, five thousand taken, and
innumerable hurt. Of them that were slain, these were the men of greatest name.
Haly Bassa the high Admiral of the fleet, Amath Bey the Captain of the
Ianizars, Assam Bey the son of Barbarossa, with his son Mehemet Bey the
Captain of Metileno, Gider F^y the Captainte of Scio, Capstan Bey the Captain
of the Rhodes, Prouis Aga the Captain of Mahemeda or Africa, Mustapha Scelubi
the high Treasurer, A stu Caiga, the Captain of Gallipoli, Tramontana the
Master of the Turks Admiral, Caracosse, and many other, to set down whose
names in this place it were too long a piece of work. Of prisoners, among
other were Malemet Bey, and Seyn Bey the Admirals sons, Malemet Bey the
Captain of Nigrepont, and Syroch Bey whose wife was also taken, a woman, (they
say) of passing beauty. The chief of them that escaped, were Parlaw,
Occl^al^, Murate, Rays with his son, and Genouese Aly. But Caraperis a famous
Pirate was gone before unto Cyprus with twenty galleyes and Brigantines, part
of those 333. that came from Constantinaple, and therefore be could not be at
this bloody battle. The vesseles of the Turks that escaped with Part (...)
and Oce^ial^, were afterward certainly known to be xxv. galleyes, and ten
Brigantines. Of our enemies their navy, Cirj galleys came into our men's power,
but forty were drowned, and of Brigantines and other sorts of vessels, lx.
were taken. But the Admiral galley which was taken among the rest, it is
reported, was a wonderful goodly and beautiful vessel, insomuch (...) there
is scarce any vessel in the whole Ocean, that ^^^ye iustily be compared unto
her for beauty and riches. The deck of this galley (as they have talde we
that saw her) is on both sides greater by three parts than others be, and is
made all of black Walnut tree, like unto Hebene wood, checkered, and wroughte
marvelous sayre with diverse colors, and hystories of all kinds. There be
also in her many counterfeytes ingraued and wrought in gold, with so cunning a
hand, that it can scarce be thought that any house in the world is more
magnificent and stately. The inner part and the chamber or cabban glistered in
every place with rich hangings wrought with gold twist, and diners sorts of
precious stones, and among them certain small counterfeytes wrought with
wonderful cunning. Moreover, there were also found great store of clothes and
apparel which were the Admirals, wrought with the needle, and adorned with
silver, and with so beautiful and rich workemanshippe, that hye great Lord
Selim himself could not put on more royal and rich roabes. But his rich
casket with the fire thousand pieces of gold in it, with a yearly revenue of
three hundredth Ducats was given unto a Greek, born in Macedonie, who slew the
Admiral, and he was also created knight by Don John: he had also given unto
him the burrell of the Turkishe standarde, the which after he was returned to
Venice (where he had long time before dwelt with his wife, and served the
common wealth about the Arsenall) he sold unto a goldsmith. Whereof when the
Senate had intelligence, they redeemed it of the Goldsmith, paying a Ducate for
every ounce, that it might be laid up among the rest of the tropheys and
spoils. It was all of silver and guilt, and that wonderful thick, and
ingraued round about with Turkishe letters. On the one side was engraven: God
does conduct and adorn the faithful. In worthy enterprises God does favor
Mahomet. On the other side: God has no other God, and Mahomet is his Prophet.
But to return unto the Christian navy: After that this renounted victory was
gotten, the Princes sat in counsel what was to be done, and at length after
nature consultation, Do^ John and Colonna determined to return unto Messina,
because they were not able to besiege any town (they being all well known to
be strongly appointed) before that their navy were newly furnished with a
fresh supplye of soldiers, and that could not be now done, for that the
winter was come upon them. But the V^netians repayring their navy, wanne a
Castle in Epyrus called Margarita, and also recovered the town of Soppoto,
the which the Turks had won this summer, and now they hearing of this great
overthrow, did fearfully forsake it at the approach of the Venetian fleet.

The Conclusion.
Nor thus much of the bloody battles of our age. Yet gen the read^rs. I would
you to understand that all the great battles fought in our diuelishe days,
are not here set down, because that the lively and faithful description of
diverse has not hen^ published in print, or at the least wise not came unto my
knowledge. As the battle fought between the ^olon^^e and Orsini, mentioned by
Iouius in the summari^ of bi^^ book, wherein the Orsine were overthrown. And
the battle at Swatzwald, where the Switzers vanquished the Almaines. whereof
Iouius makes mention in the summarie of his up book. And also the four ciull
battles between the Switzers, in the year one thousand, five hundredth, twenty
and nine. The two battles fought in the year 1^59, betwere Selius and Baiazzet
sons unto Soliman the great Turk. The overthrow given in the year one
thousand, five hundredth, sixty and seven, unto the Moscou^te by the Polonian,
where seven thousand Moscou^tes were slain, and taken prisones, and two
thousand drowned in the river of Dwy^da. And two conflictes by sea, in the
year one thousand, five hundredth, sixty and four, betwens the Dane and the
Swedan. And also one civil battle in Scotland, at the Long side, where the
Queen and her favorers were discomfited. And also sundry battles both by sea
and land, fought in base Germany in these late civil troubles, as in the
year one thousand, five hundredth seventy and two, the Lord Ienlis with
almost fire thousand Frenchmen going about to enter Mons in Henault, was
overthrown by Federicke son to the Duke of Alua, and almost all the French
men slain. As also the next year he defeated and took prisoner the Baron of
Batenburg, coming with an army well furnished, to relieve the besieged town
of Harlaw. And the dattell of Ma^icin in Clau^lande, where the power of Dewes
Earl of Nassow was defeated, and himself, with Christoph^^ the Palsag^^^^
son slain, by Sanchie Dauila the Castellan of Antwarpe. But on the water the
Duke of Medina Celi discomfited by the Guise before Flissingen, and sixtene of
his ships drowned, and four taken, being ships of infinite riches. And also
the Conte Bossis discomfited on the water in Holland by the said Genses, who
also put to flight at Terguse a fleet sent by Alua in the year one thousand,
fine hundredth, seventy and three. And the next year, one of four score sail
sent by the Commendador of Castile then Governor, under the conduct of Julian
de Romero, to victual Middleburg, of whom seuentene were lost. And perhaps
many other such like. As again, I have omitted diverse other, because I do
not ^eenie them worthy the name of pitched fielded or battles. As the foul
flight of the Venetian fleet under the conduct of Grimani, as so^e as ever
they attached fight with the Turkishe many, whereof Ionius writes in the
suminarie of his ^irt book. And the like of the Venetian army by land,
conducted by Balemie, at the first fight of Gascon of Feix. As also that
notorious incommeth bitle ^iflicted on Solima^^ the Turk, in his return out
of Persia in the year one thousand, five hundredth, thirty and five, when
that Delmeathes the Persian Captame did one most tempestuous night suddenly
invade his Camp with a power of light horsemen, and slew infinite Turks, and
rifled almost the whole camp, and returned back in safety. Nor that
shameful retire or flight of Andrew Doria, Admiral of the mighty navy of
the Emperor and Venetians, as soon as ever he had attached fight with a far
inferior power of Turkish galleys, in the year one thousand, five hundredth,
thirty and seven. Nor the discomfiture by ambushe of the power of Renee the
Prince of Orange, by Martin van Rossem, near unto Antwarpe, in the year one
thousand, five hundredth, forty and two. And the battle of Sulway moss
where the Scotts frantickly fled, feared with their own imagination, as
though the Duke of Norffolke who had lately roaded Scotland with a goodly
army, had been now returned again, when that they were fette upon by Thomas
bastard Daker, and Jack of Musg^aue with one hundredth men, and they had left
a stale on the hill, for to make their fearful foes believe it was another
power approaching. In the which conflict were taken, the Lord Maxwell the
General, with a great number of Earls and Lords. Nor that lamentable loss
in the year one thousand, five hundredth, and sixty, when that the Duke of
Medina Celi returning from the conquest of the Island of zerbi in the coast of
Africa, met with the innumerable Turkish floete, the fight whereof caused him
in continently to flee, without once striking stroke, leesing xxvij. galleys,
and a great number of hulkes laden with soldiers and victuals, and abandoning
six thousand valiant soldiers, whom he had left in garrison in the Isle,
to be murdered by the merciless Turks. These conflictes, and other of less
fame, I have willingly and wittingly omitted, because they deserve not the name
of battles: and also for that by the enarration of them, the like pleasure and
profit will not redound unto the reader. The which two things have specially
impelled me to collect this painful work.
