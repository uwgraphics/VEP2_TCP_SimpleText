Capystranus a Metrical Romance
O Mighty fader in heaven on hye
One god and persons three
That made both day and night
And after as it was thy will
Thyn own sone thou sent us till
In amayden to light
Sith the Jews that were wild
Hanged him that was so mylde
And to death him dyght
When he was deed the sothe to say
To life he rose on the third day
Thoroughe his own might
Then to hell he went anon
And took out souls many one
Out of that hold he hente
Maugre the fendes that were bold
He took the prisoners out of hold
With them to heaven he went
On his faders right hand he him set
That all should know withouten let
That he was omnypotente
And after wisdom he was sent
That all should keep his commandment
And for to believe in him verray
That is our savior
That borne was of that blyssed flower
That byght Mary I say
That shall us deem withouten mysse
Some to pain and some to bliss
At dredefull domes day
Tho that believe on him a right
To bliss they goue with aungelles bright
^^^ysse and Joy for aye
(...) Ihesu as thou bought us dear
Give them Joy this gest will here
And harken on a right
Some men loves to here tell
Of doughty knights that were fell
And some of ladies bright
And some miracles that are told
And some of venterous knights old
That for our lord did fight
As Charles did that noble king
That hethen down did bring
Thrughe the help of god almighty
He wanne fro the hethen hounds
The spear and nails of crystes wounds
And also the crown of thorn
And many a rich relyke mo
Mawgre of them he wanne also
And killed them even and morn
The turks and the paynyms bold
He felled down many a fold
Durst none stand him beforne
Charles began them so affraye
That the catyues might curse the day
And the time that they were borne

NOw Machamyte that turk untrue
To our lord Christ Ihesu
And to his law also
Many christian men slain has be
And wanne constantyne ye noble cite
With many towns mo
He brent and slew / and left none on life
Neither man / child / ne wife
To death he made them go
Young Innocents ye never did gylte
That false turk has them spylte
He played the king Pharao
All the streets of Constantyne
Ran blood reder than wine
That marvel was to se
There could no man his foot down set
I give you knowledge withonten let
But on a deed body
The christian men went to wrake
The chuches and our images they brake
That were made of stone and tree
The crucyfyxe of our savior
They kest it down with dishonor
And also our lady
The slew our priests at the mass
Gods men had no grace
They killed them down in every stead
Both priests and clerks they put to deed
Within gods holy place
The turks kene with shield and spear
Our priests before the hye aultere
They ran thrughe in a rage
Many began dye for crystes love
Aungelles their souls bare above
To bliss and much solace
Thus the turk the wicked quede
Christian people he put to deed
And left few upon live
The hethen cried with great dysyte
On mahounde and Macamyte
The turks men full ryue
There was uone that durst on Ihesu cry
But they were taken and slain in hye
Anon and that believe
The turk him self a cry did make
There should no man a prisoner take
God let them never thryue
Then the dogs ye byleued on mahounde
The christian people killed to the ground
No gold might be their mede
The Christian saw that they should dye
And on their masters laid hand quycly
And faught a well good speed
Every prisoner then on live
Killed of the turks four or five
To hell their souls yede
Or our prisoners after were take
Many a turk they made blake
There was no helm nor haubergyon
Plate or male nor good aucton
Their dyntes might refrain
Macamyte saw his men so dye
And loud on mahound ehe began cry
In heart he was not feign
Our christian neded no wepen crave
The streets lay full take who would have
To fight with men of main
Anon within a little throw
Five. M. turks on a row
In the streets lay slain
When Mychamyte that spyed
Out on mahounde he cried
And as a fend did yell
Our christian stood in full great doubt
As doughty men laid fast about
Upon the hounds of hell
Our christian men were then to few
For the turks came ever new
In sothe as I you tell
Our men hewed on hastily
And made turks loud to cry
The false down they fell
Thus countred with sarasyns kene
Till.lxxx. M. were laid be dene
In a little thought
Mychamyte was never so we
To se so few so many slo
His sorwe was not short
He cried Mahounde as he would braste
Our christian on Ihesu cried fast
That all the world wrought
Some escaped away with gods grace
On live maugre the turks face
But many than began dye
At the dystruccyon of Cyuys
Were not so many slain ywys
As were ou both parties
Alas saufe christian will of heaven
Our christian were made uneven
With a false company
For of the turks and sarasyns kene
An. C. were withouten wene
Against one of our meny
depiction of Turks and Christians doing battle during the seige of Belgrade

THe emperor of Constantyne
A doughty man at a time
The turk him took that hethen bound
And gave him many a grysly wound
I pray god give him grame
He bound him till the blood out braste
And badde him forsake Ihesu in haste
Or else thou shalt have shame
Have done anon / and him defye
And also his mother Marye
That thou call his dame
Valeryan answered and said nay
Thou shalt never se that day
That I shall him forsake
Turn the turk and all thy men
Or else in hell thou shalt brenne
Among the fendes black
Leave in Ihesu full of might
And that maiden that he in light
For christian men sake
Than the turk wexed evil a paid
Commanded his men at a brayed
Anon to make him naked
He had them beat him with scourges kene
And after bore out his eyes
With wymbles hot and reed
They plucked his heart by and by
And both his eeres on hy
They cut of his heed
With pynsons his teache they brake
Bad him anon his god forsake
Or should never ete breed
They saw in no wise that it would be
Anon they made a saw of tree
And sawed him to deed
Tho the turks with much pain
This doughty men have they slain
For Crystes sake I say
And so they did with many mo
The turks might curse the time also
That they there came that day
Of crystes people was many a part mart
There was no turk paid of his part
By the last end of the fraye
They had hell for their fight
They christian went to heaven bright
To bye in bliss for aye
Thus is constantyne ye noble cite won
Beten down with many a gonne
And christian people slain
There the turk with his meyne
Keped still that noble cite
Durst no man him with said
Forty mile round about
Durst no man by him route
Neither on hill ne plain
The turk kept the field many a day
Christian people in the countray
Of him were dredde Isayne
Where they might any christian get
I tell you now withouten doubt
They left there life to wedde
All suffered death for Crystes sake
That this turk might overtake
But thus they for him fled
Thereof herd a holy friar
The works of the fendes fere
And to Rome him spedde
Johan capystranus the friar hight
I dare say he was gods knight
An holy man was he
To the pope anon he wanne
Capystranus that holy man
And kneled upon his kne
He said fader for crystes lone of heaven
That made this world and days seven
Harken now to me
There is a turk I understand
That brennes and slees gods land
Great dole it is to se
The turk his purpose is
I let you were withouten mys
To win all hungree
Therefore fader put thy holy hand
And help to war gods land
His true vycar if thou be
He brenneth chirches in every place
Christian men gothe to death a pace
To behold is great pity
Now fader help with thy socoure
For Maryes love that sweet flower
Our hope is much in the
With two hundred this same day
To Grecuswyssyngburgh he took the way
This is no scorn
Many a thousand there shall dye
If he win that ryall city
All hungrye is forlorn
I am the messynger of Ihesus
Truly lord it will be thus
As I have said beforne
Therefore help with all thy might
For gods love for to fight
That was of Marye borne
Than the pope said anon
Good brother friar Ihon
As I understand
Thou prechest gods words wide
In the country on euecy side
In many a diverse land
Thou know many a noble man
Take a capytayne where thou can
Whyder that he be free or bond
And as I am gods bycar true
This false turk his rese shall rue
And thereto my holy hand
Now fader I thank the heartily
To chese a capytayne the bydde me
Certain without any mys
Now holy fader withouten layne
This shall be my capytayne
He said the pope ymys
A baner of crystes pyssyon
That man's soul did redempcyon
And brought them from pain to light
Holowe it with thy hand
The people may the better stand
That under it does fight
This shall be my capytayne
An other would I have feign
That is thy bull of leed
That all that under it does fight
For gods love most of might
Ever in any land
If it happen them to be slain
That their souls come never in pain
After that they be deed
The people said blyssed might thou be
A holy man I hold the
I will do after thy read
Anon ye baner was made and hallowed
The bull cealed and up folded
And the pardon of grace
Delivered it to the friar truly
The people blyssed him times three
And thus his leave he takes
Barefote he bare out of the town
The baner of crystes passyoune
Toward the turk he hastes
And preched gods law as he yede
And much people to him began speed
To get their souls solace
Great gold and silver was him given
And ever he delte it even
Tho people that with him yede
So certainly as I you say
All romayne for him did pray
And so it was great need
Such freres we have to few
Pray all we Christ Ihesu
To be his help and speed
For of this I find a fytte
Ferther and ye will sytte
Herkyn and take good head
THis friar went to Hungry
And many men with him truly
That for our lord did fight
To an university he took the way
The gretest in Hungrye I dare well say
Gottauntas it hight
Out of the university there went in fere
Six and twenty. M. with the friar
Of relygyous men full right
The most party was priests I say
Eueryche preued him that day
That he was gods knight
The friar with great devotion
Bare the baner of crystes passion
Among the people all
Dysplayed abroad great Joy to se
Men of diverse country
Fast to him began fall
Thus passed forth Capystranus
And met with the good earl Obedyanus
A captain pryncypall
Twenty thousand and mo
Among them was but knights two
And thus men does them call
Richard morpath a knight of England
And sir Johan Elacke I understand
That was a turk before
And now he is a curteys knight
I let you wete and a wight
And steadfast in our lore
Many a turk has grieved sore
Their lives they left behind
He has made them hop heedles
Many one withouten les
Where he might them find
There.xx. thousand met in fere
With Obedyauns and the friar
In helm and hauberke bright
To grecuswyssynburgh he took the way
There the turk at syege lay
With many a knight
Fourtene wekes the turk had been there
And put the christian to much fere
To him they had no might
Five. C. gonnes he let shote at ones
Brake down the walls with stones
The wild fire lemed light
To here it was great wonder
The noise of gonnes much like the thonder
That was a frefull dynne
The noise was herd many a mile
Obedyaunce the mean while
Entered the town within
At.vi of the clock the sothe to say
After noone on the Maudeleyne
And neither less ne mo
And Capystranus good friar Ihon
Assoyled our men euerychone
To battle or they did gone
And cried loud with voice clear
Let us fight for our soupere
In heaven is ready dyght
Our baner shall I bear to day
And to Ihesu fast shall pray
To speed us in our right
Anon they together met
Five. M. deed withouten let
In helm and hauberke bright
Obedianus that noble man
Slew them fast that served satan
Through christ their crowns had care
All that he with his faucon hit
There was no salve I let you wit
That ever might hele that sore
There was no turk that he with met
But he had such a buffet
That he grieved never christian man more
He was a doughty knight
The false he felled for gods right
I pray god well might he fare
Morpath and black Johan
That day killed turks many one
Certain withouten let
There was none so good armoure
That their dyntes might endure
Helm nor bright basynet
They hew upon the hethen on hye
They fire out of every side began fly
So boldly on they bette
Many a turk there was cast
Beten till the brains brast
Their masters there they met
Many a. M. of priests there was
The turks herd never such a mass
As they hard that day
Our priests te deum song
The hethen fast down they donge
Then pax was put away
There was scole masters of the best
Many of them were brought to rest
That would not lere their law
Thus our christian people did fight
From.v. of ye clock on Maudeleyne night
Till.x. on the other day
Then came ye turks with new battle
Clean clad in plate and male
A. C. thousand and mo
On dromydaryes began they ride
And killed our men on every side
Two. M. were there sloo
Our men to stand they had no main
But fled to the town anon
With wounds wide and bloo
Twenty thousand of our men
Were borne down at the bridge end
The turks were so through
Dromydaryes over them ran
And killed down both horse and man
In the field durst none abide
Obedianus had many a wound
Or he would flee the ground
For all the turks pride
Morpath and black Johan
Had wounds many one
That blody were and wide
To the town they fled on foot
They saw it was no better bote
Their stedes were slain that tide
The turks followed in to the town
And killed all before them down
Great doyll it was to see
In to the town the great turk wanne
And killed wife child and man
The Innocents thycke began dye
Johan Capystranus se that it was thus
And hent a curcyfyxe of christ Ihesus
Ran up till a toure on hye
The hallowed baner with him he bare
In the top of the toure he set it there
And cried full pytefully
He said lord god in heaven on hye
Where is become thyn old might
That men were wont to have
O my lord christ Ihesus
Why have thou forgoten us
Now help of the we crave
Look on thy people that do thus dye
Lord ones cast down thyn eye
And help thy men to save
Now lord send down thy much might
Against these fendes for to fight
That so thy people dyspray
Think lord how I have preched thy law
Gone barefote both in frost and snawe
To please the to thy pay
I have fasted and suffered disease
Prayed all only the to please
The psalms often I say
For all my seruyse I have done the
I ask no more to my fee
But help thy men to day
For and thou let them thus spyll
I am right in good will
For ever to forsake thy lay
Now mary maiden help me to day
Or else thy matyns shall I never say
Days of all my live
Ne no prayer that the shall please
But if thou help now our desease
Ne menye thy Joys five
A point is for thy maydenhede
That all this people suffers deed
Now help to stynte our strive
Now lady of thy men have pity
Pray for them to thy sone on hye
As thou art maiden and wife
O lord fader omnypotent
Think on ye miracle yt thou charles sent
That for the did fight
Thrughe his prayer and grace
The sone shone still three days space
And shone with beams bright
Pharao thou drowned in the sea
Tho that thou let go free
Away thou led them right
This day lord thou help thy men
Thou art also bygge now as thou was then
And of as much might
The friar loud on god cried
A long mile on every side
The people herd his voyse
Twenty. M. deed for to see
Within the twynclyn of an eye
To life they rose again
Echone a wepyn in hand hente
And freely began to fight
And field down fast their foes
The good earl Obedianus
Faught freely for our lord Ihesus
On every side spronge his lose
He drove the truke out of the town
The christian felled the false down
And drove them to the field again
Twenty. M. with them met
Orelles the turk withouten let
Surely had been slain
Than were they feign for to fight
Than ever was foul of day light
Certain withouten layne
NOw begins a new battle
I let you wit withouten fail
Of mighty men of main
Ychone hew on other with Ire
That all the field seemed fire
Also light as leme of thonder
Every man hurt other in have
And laid on basynettes to brains brast
And ever the false fell under
The blood ran all the field
Of doughty men under shield
To se it was great wonder
There was he wynge from the hals
The helmes and the hedes als
Rich knights were vnknytte
Many a turk withouten fail
Tombled top over tail
That never rose yet
So hard on helmes they hew
That there were turks but few
That in sadyll could sytte
There was no turk there
But he might tell of much care
I let you well wit
There was stycked many a stead
Great dromydaryes made blede
Tho they for faint fell
The christian men had quarelles good
They dredde nothing to shed their blood
When Ihesu did them call
They hewed on with swerdes kene
Of helmes with the hedes by deene
Tumbled as a ball
So delte they strokes on a brayde
That no turk held him apayde
The proudest of them all
There was hurtelynge in fere
Broken many a sharp spear
And drawn many a knyfe
Stedes sterted out of strife
And kest their masters in the way
Utterly believe
Many a hethen in their ghere
His follow began down bear
And to the earth him drive
The blood ran thrughe the breast
