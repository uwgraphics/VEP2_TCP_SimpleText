TO The Honor of him, to whom the Noble Fraternity of Drapers, his Worthy
Brothers have Consecrated their Loves, in costly Triumphs; the Right Honorable,
MARTIN LVMLEY, Lord Mayor of this Renowned City.
THy Descent Worthy, (Fortunes Early Grace)
Sprung of an Ancient, and most Generous Race
Mac'ht with a Virtuous Lady; justly may
Challenge the Honor of so Great a Day.
Faithfully devoted to the Worthiness of you Both, The. Middleton.

THE TRIVMPHS OF Integrity, or a Noble Solemnity through the City.
OF all Solemnities, by which the Happy inauguration of a Subject is
celebrated, I find none that transcends the State and Magnificence of that
Pomp prepared to receive his Majesty's Great Substitute into his Honorable
charge, (the City of London,) Dignified by the Title of the Kings Chamber
Royal, which that it may now appear no less hightned with Brotherly
Affection, Colt, Art, or Invention, then some other praeceeding Triumphs (by
which of late times, the Cities Honor has been more faithfully illustrated)
this takes it is fit occasion to present it self.

And first to specify the love of his Noble Fraternity after his Lordshippes
return from Westminster, having received some service upon the water, by a
proper and significant Maister-peece of Triumph, called the Imperial Canopy,
being the Ancient Arms of the Company, an Invention neither old, nor enforst,
the same Glorious and Apt Property, accompanied with four other Triumphall
Pegmes, are in their convenient Stages planted to honor his Lordships progress
through the City; the first for the land, attending his most wished ariuall in
Pauls-Church-yard, which bears the inscription of a Mount Royal, on which
Mount are placed certain Kings and great Commanders, which Ancient History
produces, that were originally sprung from Shepherds, and humble beginnings;
only the number of Six presented, some with Crowns, some with gilt Laurels,
holding in their hands silver Sheephookes, viz. Viriat, a prime Commander of
the Portugals, renowned amongst the Historians, especially the Romans, who in
battles of 14 years continuance, purchased many great and honorable
victories; Arsaces King of the Parthians, who ordained the first Kingdom that
ever was amongst them, and in the reverence of this Kings Name and memory, all
others His Successors were called Arsacides after his Name, as the Roman
Emperors took the Name of Caesar, for the love of Great Caesar Augustus; Also
Marcus Julius Lucinus, Bohemiaes Primislaus, the Emperor Pertinax, the Great
Victor Tamburlayne, Conqueror of Syria, Armenia, Babylon, Mesapotamia, Scythia,
Albania, etc. Many Honorable Worthies more I could produce; By their deserts
enobling their mean Originals. But for the better expression of the purpose in
Hand, a Speaker lends a voice to these followings words!

The Speech in the Mount Royal.
THey that with Glory-enflamde hearts; desire
To see Great Worth deseruingly aspire,
Let them draw near and fix a serious Eye,
On this Tryumphant Mount of Royaltye;
Here they shall find fair Virtue and her Name,
From low-obscure Beginnings raysde to Fame,
Like Light struck out of Darkness; the mean wombes
No more Eclipse brave Merit, then rich Toombes
Make the Soul happy; it is the Life, and Dying
Crowns both with Honors Sacred Satisfying;
And it is the Noblest Splendour upon Earth,
For man to add a Glory to his Birth
(All his Life's Race with honored Acts commixt)
Then to be Nobly-borne and there stand fixed;
As if 'twere Competent Virtue for whole Life
To be Begot a Lord; it is virtuous Strife
That makes the complete Christian; not high Place,
As true Submission is the State of Grace,
"The Path to Bliss, lies in the humblest Field,
"Who ever rise to Heaven that never kneeld,
Although the Roof has Supernatural Height,
Yet there is no Flesh can thither go upright:
All this is instanc'st only to commend,
The low condition whence these Kings descend;
I spare the David.
Prince of Prophets in this File,
And preserve him for a far Holier Style,
Who being King Anointed, did not scorn
To be a Shepherd after; these were borne
Shepherds, and rise to Kings, took their ascending
From the strong hand of Virtue, never ending
Where She begins to raise, until she place
Her Love sick Servants equal with her Grace;
And by this Days great Honor it appears
Sh' as much preuaylde amongst the Reverend years
Of these Grave Senators, chief of the rest
Her Favor has reflected most and best,
Upon that Son whom we of Honor call,
And may' t Successively reflect on all.
From this Mount Royal beautified with the Glory of deserving Aspirers,
descend we to the Modern use of this Ancient and Honorable Mystery, and there
we shall find the whole Livery of this most renowned and famous City, as upon
this Day, and at all Solemn meetings, furnished by it; it clothes the
Honorable Senators in their highest and richest Wearings, all Courts of
Justice, Magistrates, and Judges of the Land.

By this time his Lordship, and the Worthy Company being gracefully conducted
toward the little Conduit in Cheap, there another part of the Triumph waytes
his Honors happy approach, being a Chariot Artfully framde, and properly
garnished; And on the Conspicuous part thereof is plac'st the Register of all
Heroicke Acts and worthy Men, bearing the Title of Sacred Memory, who for the
greater Fame of this Honorable Fraternity presents the Neuer-dying Names of
many memorable and remarkable Worthies of this Ancient Society, such as were
the Famous for State and Government, Sir Henry Fitz-alwin Knight, who held the
Seat of Magistracy in this City twenty four years together, He sits figured
under the Person of Government: Sir John Norman, tho first Lord Mayor rowed in
Barge to Westminster with silver Oars at his own cost and charges; under ^he
person of Honor, the Valiant Sir Francis Drake, that rich Ornament to Memory,
(who in two years and ten months space did cast a girdle about the world)
under the person of Victory, Sir Simon Air, (who at his own cost built Leaden
Hall, a Granary for the Poor,) under the figure of Charity, Sir Richard
Champion, and Sir John Milborne, under the person of Munificenee or Bounty, Sir
Richard Hardell, and Sir John Poultney, the one in the seat of Magistracy six
years, the other four years together, under the figures of Justice, and
Piety, That Sir John being a Colledge-Founder, in the Parish of St. Lawrence
Poultney, by Candle-wick street; and fic de caeteris. This Chariot drawn by
two pellited Lions, being the proper Supporters of the Companies Arms, those
two upon the Lions presenting Power and Honor, the one in a little Streamer or
Banneret bearing the Lord Majors Arms, the other the Companies.

The Speech, in the Chariot.
I Am all Memory, and me thinks I see
Into the fardest Time, Act, Quality;
As clear as if 'twere now begun again,
The Natures, Dispositions, and the Men;
I find to Godnesse they bent all their powers,
Which very Name makes blushing Times of ours;
They heapt up Virtues, long before they were old,
This Age fits laughing upon Heaps of Gold,
We by great Buildings strive to raise our Names,
But they more truly wise built up their Fames,
Erected fair Examples, large and hie,
Patterns for us to build our Honors by;
For instance only Memory relates,
The Noblest of all City-Magistrates,
Famous Fitz-alwin, naming him alone,
I sum up twenty four Lord Majors in one,
For He by free election and consent
Filled all those years with virtuous Government;
Custom and Time requiring now but one,
How ought that year to be well dwelt upon,
It should appear an Abstract of that worth,
Which former Times in many years brought forth,
Through all the life of Man, this is the year,
Which many wish, and never can come near,
Think and give thanks; to whom this year does come,
The Greatest Subject's made in Christendom;
This is the year for whom some long preparde,
And others have their glorious Fortune sharde,
But serious in thanksgiving, it is a year,
To which all Virtues like the people here
Should throng and cleave together, for the Place
Is a fit Match for the whole Stock of Grace;
And as men gather wealth, against the Year comes,
So should they gather Goodness with their Sums,
For it is not shows, Pomp, nor a House of State
Curiously decked, that makes a Magistrate,
It Is his fair Noble soul, his Wisdom, Care,
His upright Iustnes to the Oath he swear
Gives him complete; when such a Man to me,
Spreads his Arms open, there my Palace be,
He Is both an Honor to the Day so grac'st,
And to his Brother-hoods love that sees him plac'st,
And in his fair Deportment there reuiues,
The Ancient Fame of all his Brothers Lives.
After this, for the full close of the Fore-noones Triumph, near St.
Lawrence-lane, his Lordship Receives an Entertainment from an unparalleled
Maister-peece of Art, called the Cristall Sanctuary, stilde by the name of the
Temple of Integrity, where her Immaculate self with all her glorious and
Sanctimonious Concomitants sit transparently seen through the Crystal; and
more to express the Invention, and the Art of the Engineer, as also for
Motion, Variet^, and the content of the Spectators, this Crystal Temple is
made to open in many parts, at fit and convenient Times, and upon occasion of
the Speech; the Columns or Pillars of this Cristall Sanctuary, are Gold, the
Battlements Silver, the whole Fabric for the Night Triumph adorned and
beautified with many Lights, dispersing their glorious Radiances on all sides
thorough the Cristall.

The Speech from the Sanctuary.
Have you a mind thick Multitude to see
A Virtue, near concerns Magistracy,
Here on my Temple throw your greedy eyes,
See me, and learn to know me, then y' are wise;
Look, and look through me, I no favor crave,
Nor keep I hid the Goodness you should have,
It Is all transparent what I think or do,
And with one look your Eye may pierce me through,
There Is no disguise, or hypocriticke veil,
(Used by adulterous Beauty set to sale)
Spread over my actions, for respect or fear,
Only a Cristall which approues me clear;
Would you desire my Name? Integrity,
One that is over what she seems to be,
So manifest, perspicuous, plain, and clear
You may even see my thoughts as they sit here,
I think upon fair Equity and Truth,
And there they sit crownde with eternal Youth,
I fix my Cogitations upon Love,
Peace, Meeknes, and those thoughts come from above,
The Temple of an upright Magistrate,
Is my fair Sanctuary, Throne, and State;
And as I dare Detractions euillest Eye,
Sore at the sight of Goodness, to epsy
Into my ways and actions, which lie open
To every censure, armed with a strong Hope:
So of Your part ought nothing to be done,
But what the envious Eye might look upon:
As Thou art Eminent, so must thy Acts
Be all Tralucent, and leave worthy Tracts
For future times to find, thy very Breast
Transparent, like this Place wherein I rest:
Vain doubtings; al thy Days have bin so clear
Never came Nobler Hope to fill a year.
At the close of this Speech, this Cristall Temple of Integrity with all her
caelestiall Concomitants, and the other parts of Triumph take leave of his
Lordship for that time, and rest from service til the great Feast be ended,
after which the whole Body of the Triumph attends upon his Honor, both toward
St. Paul's, and homeward, his Lordship accompanied with the Grave and Honorable
Senators of the City; amongst whom the two worthy Consulls, his Lordships
Graue-Assistants for the year, the worshipful and Generous, Mr. Raph Freeman,
and Mr. Thomas Moulson, Sheriffs and Aldermen, ought not to pass of my
respect unremembered; whose Bounty and Nobleness will prove best their own
Expressers.

Near the entrance of woodstreete, that part of Triumph being planted to which
the concluding Speech has chiefly reference, and the rest, about the Cross, I
thought fit in this place to give this it is full Illustration; It being an
Invention both glorious and proper to the Company, bearing the name of the
thrice Royal Canopie of State, being the honored Arms of this Fraternity, the
three Imperial Crowns cast into the Form and Bigness of a Triumphall
Pageant, with Cloud and Sunbeams, those Beams by Enginous Art made often to
mount and spread like a Golden and Glorious Canopy over the Deified persons that
are plac'st under it, which are eight in number, figuring the eight Beatitudes,
To improoue with conceit, Beati Pacifici, being the Kings word or Motto, is
set in fair great Letters, near the uppermost of the three Crowns; and as in
all great Edifices or Buildings, the Kings Arms is especially remembered, as a
Honor to the Building and Builder in the Frontispice: so is it comely and
requisite in these matters of Triumph framed for the Inauguration of his great
Substitute, the Lord Mayor of London, that some remembrance of Honor should
reflect upon his Majesty, by whose peaceful Government under Heaven we enjoy
the Solemnity!

The speech, having Reference to this Imperial Canopy, being the Drapers Arms.
THe Blessedness, Peace, Honor, and Renown,
This Kingdom does enjoy under the Crown,
Worn by that Royal Peacemaker, our King,
(So often preserude from Dangers menacing)
Makes this Arms, (glorious in it self) outgoe
All that Antiquity could ever show,
And thy Fraternity has striude to appear
In all their course, worthy the Arms they bear,
Thrice have They Crowned their Goodness this one Day
With Love, with Care, with Cost; by which they may
By their Deserts most justly these Arms claim,
Got once by Worth, now Trebly held by Fame:
Shall I bring Honor to a larger Field,
And show what Royal Business these Arms yield?
First the three Crowns affords a Divine scope,
Set for the Graces, Charity, Faith, and Hope;
Which Three the only safe Combiners be,
Of Kingdoms, Crowns, and every Company;
Likewise with just propriety they may stand
For those three Kingdoms swaide by the meek Hand
Of Blessed James; England, Scotland, Ireland,
The Cloud that swells beneath them, may imply
Some Envious Mist cast forth by Heresy,
Which through his happy Reign, and Heavens blessed will;
The sunbeams of the Gospel strikes through still;
More to assure it to Succeeding Men,
We have the Crown of Britains Hope again,
(Illustrious Charles our Prince,) which all will say,
Adds the chief Joy and Honor to this Day:
And as three Crowns, three Fruits of Brotherhood
By which all Loves Worth may be understood,
So threefold Honor makes the Royal Suit
In the King, Prince, and the Kings Substitute:
By the eight Beatitudes, Ye understand
The Fullness of all Blessings to this Land,
More chiefly to this City, whose safe Peace
Good Angels guard, and Goodmens prayers increase:
May all succeeding-Honor'd Brothers be,
With as much Love brought Home, as Thine brings Thee.
FOr all the Proper Adornments of Art and Workmanship in so short a Time, so
gracefully setting forth the Body of so Magnificent a Triumph, the praise
comes as a just due to the Exquisit Deseruings of Mr. Garret Crismas, whose
faithful performances still take the upper hand of his promises.

FINIS.
