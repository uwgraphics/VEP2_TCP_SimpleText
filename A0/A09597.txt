First propounded in Alphabeticall form, each proposition being seconded with
some solid reason.

teach you again, which be the first principles of the Oracles of God.

TO THE RIGHT Worshipful, the Mayor and the ^urats his Brethren: and to the
Communaltie of the Town and Port Limme of Feuersham in Kent. I.P. wishes the
foundation of saving knowledge, in this life, and the perfection thereof in the
life to come.
Right Worshipful and Beloved:
IT is a known truth, that in all Acts, there are certain principles or
grounds, upon which they rest, as upon a sure foundation. And in that regard,
all Students in any kind of literature, do in the first place settle
themselves upon that rest, conceiving it (and that rightly) to be the most
compendious way to attain knowledge, and the best art of memory to retain it.

This being an undeniable truth in the light of humane reason, is much more
preualent in Divine learning. See we not that the best Instructor does intimate
so much by his own brief method of teaching? for does he not conclude all
Moral duties in one short Decalogue, that is, as Moses speaks, in Ten
words? Have we not a perfect pattern of Religious devotion, given unto us of
our Lord, comprizing all the requisites of true prayer, in a brief form,
consisting but of six or seven petitions?

What else import all those titles in sacred Scripture, The form of knowledge.
Romans 2.20.
The pattern of wholesome words. 2 Timothy 1.13.
The first principles of the Oracles or word of God. The principles of the
doctrine of Christ, Heb. 5.12. Heb. 6.1.
or the word of the beginning of Christ, t^rmed by the Apostle, The laying of
the foundation* does he not there reduce all to six heads, viz. Repentance,
Faith, Baptism, Imposition of hands, Resurrection of the dead, and eternal
judgment?

Is there not a common Rule of Christian Religion, which we call the Apostles
Creed, according to which whosoever shape not their profession, we ^ffoord them
not so much as the name of Christianity? And though they profess it in word,
yet if they hold not the truth in the antique sense of it, do we not justly
tax them of unsoundness?

Look into the coure and practice of the Christian Church in all ages, ^
and w^ shall find that they did not give to babes in Christ, Heb. 5.13.14.
strong meat by and by: but did first feed them with the milk of
Catechisticall instruction.

Hence it is, that we read of the Catecumeni in the Primitive Church, that
they were held so long in the school of instruction, as it were in the
threshold of Christianity, lest they should enter the Sanctuary, and arrive at
the summitie or top of Christian prosession unseasoned; or being not well
grounded, might easily fall away from the truth, in those dangerous times of
trial.

It is greatly to be desired, that this course might be constantly continued,
both in the teacher and in the hearers, that the one may the better lead the
way, and as the Psalmist speaks, guide them with his own eye of knowledge.
Psalm. 32.8.
And that the other may the better follow their good guides with stayed
judgment, receiving the truth, not as the word of man, but as it is in deed
the word of God.

Let it be observed what advantage the common Adversary has gotten by their
petty Pamphlet, in this kind: who though they keep their blindfold followers
in so palpable darkness, that they neither suffer them to look into the
light of Gods word, nor so much as to understand their Liturgies, Mass^s,
Prayers, or other services in their public assemblies, yet they politikely
hold them in by this strong band, insinuating unto them, that resting upon the
implicit faith of what their Church believes, it is sufficient for their
salvation, that for faith, they can repeat their Credo: for devotion, that they
can turn their Beads, say the Paternoster, the Aue Maria, etc. for morality,
if they know ^he seven deadly sins, the eight beatitudes, the Comandements
of the Church, the works of mercy gh^stly and bodily, together with the
Decal^gue, provided always that they bawke the second Commandment, lest
thereby their abominable Idolatry should be detected.

Again, note we to our grief (if we have any feeling of the state of our
Church) what disparagement this unskillful, or at least incautious building must
needs be unto us, when our teachers do not with S. Paul as a wise
Master Builder, 1 Cor. 3.^0
lay the foundation: which did they respectively observe, both in their private
course of study, and public employments, neither should they themselves so
easily divert from the infallible rule of Divine truth in holy writ, and from
the sound doctrine and tenet of their dear mother, The Church of England: nor
prostitute the souls committed to their charge, to the daily seducement of
Romish Impostors, and insinuations of subtle Schismatics.

Great is the praise of our Christian Church of England herein, not only in
that it does propound Orthodox principles, whereunto it requires the unanimous
consent of all her Clergy; but does withal enjoin, that there be a constant
course of acquainting the people therewith, by way of Catechism.

And well did his most excellent Majesty King James of blessed memory, second
this good work, by his Royal charge given in special letters directed to the
Ministry of England, for the respective handling of the grounds of Religion
every Sunday in the afternoon.

Neither has our Princely and pious King Charles been herein wanting, as we
may see by his Royal and religious care in causing the articles of Religion to
be reprinted: besides other expressions both of his own constancy in the
truth, and desire that the discreet and painful ministry, teaching piety
toward God, and loyalty to their Sovereign, should bend their force against
the common enemy.

Amongst others, I have for my part endeavored in all sincerity of heart,
according to the measure of grace given unto me, to set forward the building of
Gods living Temple. And my labor herein (blessed be the name of him that
gives the success) has nor bin in vain.

I have b^ene a servant and labourer in the Lords vineyard by the space of 30.
years. Whereof I have arrived at the 24th. year amongst you. In all which
time my special care has been to ground you in the maine principles of
Christian Religion. Among other methods, which I have used, to allure you with
variety, this Alphabeticall form has been one. I have found it very
aeceptable unto you, and much desired that it might come into the light. And my
desire is, that you would accordingly accept it, as a second token of my love
and due respect unto you all.

For the warrant of this method, we have the express word of God: There are
all these Alphabeticall Psalms. viz. Ps. 25.34.37.111.112.119.145. Besides the
Lamentations of Jeremy, and the Catechism or Instruction, which Solomon's
mother taught him, her Lemuel. My only suit unto you is, that you would not let
this little book be a Curranto, or as an Almanacke for a year, but in your
families make daily and constant use of it, to the building you up to a perfect
house and Temple of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whose gracious protection
recommends you,

Your loving and ancient Pastor, John Phillips.

A
ACknowledge Pro. 3 6. 1 Chro. 28.9.
God as he has Deu. 29.29. To. 15.4.
revealed himself in his written word.

For no man can be saved without the knowledge Io. 17.3. 2 These. 1.8.
of God, neither can a man know God unto salvation 2 Timothy 3.15. Io. 5.39.
but by the Scriptures.

B
Believe in Deu. 6.4. Isa. 44.6.
one only God.

For to 1 Cor. 8.4.5.6. Ephesians. 4.5.6
us Christians there is but one God* and they that have many Gods, have no God
at all Ephesians. 2.12. 1 Co. 10.20
but the Devil. And to believe that there is one God, and not to believe in him
is no better then the Iam. 2.19
faith of Devils.

C
Conceive in this one God, 1 Io. 5.7.
three persons, the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost.

For so it has pleased God to Luk 3.21.22.
reveal himself from heaven: and Math. 28.
in this name every Christian is baptized: and it is the form 2 Cor. 13.14.
of Christian blessing.

D
DIstinguish the persons in the God head, but neither confound them, nor divide
the substance.

For the Father is of none, 1 Cor. 8.6 To. 11.36.
but of himself: the Son is Psalm. 22.7 Ioh. 1.14.
begotten of the Father: the holy Ghost Io. 15.26.
proceeds from them both. And every person Ephesians. 4.6. 1 Cor. 15.24. Io. 1.1. 1
Io. 5.20. Act. 5.3.4.
distinctly by himself is God: yet ar^ they not three Gods, but 1 Io. 5.7.
only one God, Io. 1.2. and 17.5. Genesis 1.2.
coeternall, Psalm. 2.6. 1 Cor. 12.4.5.6.11.
coequall.

E
Psalm 90.2. 1 Timothy ^.17.
Eternal, Ier. 23.22.24. Psalm 139 7.
infinite, Iam 1.17. Mal. 3.6
immutable, Col. 1.^5. Io. 4.24.
invisible, Ge. 17.1. Reu 15.3.
almighty, Ps. 147.5.
most wise, Isaiah. 6.3. 1 Pet. 1.15.
holy, Math 19.17. Psalm 145.9*
good, Psalm. 145.8.9. Iam. 5.11.
merciful, Due. 3 2.4. Psalm. 145.17.
and just, is this one God.

For thus God is Exodus 34.6.
pleased to describe himself unto us in his word: because otherwise no man 1 Timothy 6.16. Exodus 33.18. etc.
can see, or know the nature of God.

F
FRamed and Genesis 1.1. Act. 17.24. Col. 1.16.
made was the whole world, by Ps. 33.6. and 148.5.
the word of God, and that of Heb. 11.3
nothing, Genesis 1.31. Exo. 20.11
in six days, Genesis 1.31.
and all very good.

For nothing Ps. 100.3.
can make it self: neither Heb. 3.4.
can be without some cause: nor Ps. 5.4. Iam. 1.17.
can be evil, being made of God.

G
Pro. 15 3 Matthew. 10.29.30. Ps. 135.6.
Governed and Ps. 36.6. and 145.15.
preserved are all things by the providence of God.

For otherwise Job. 1.11. and 2.5. Mat. 8.3^.
Satan and wicked Io* 19.11. Act. 4 27.
men might do what they list: yea, and every Act. 1.7.25.28. Ps. 119.91, Deu.
8.3.
creature would perish in a moment.

H
HE, even this God alone Matthew* 4.10. Reu. 22.8.9.
is to be worshipped and Ps 50 15 Luke 1^.2.
called upon: and that only Io. 16.23 1 Timothy 2.5.
in the name of Christ, 1 Cor. 14.15.
with understanding, Deu. 12.3^. Mat. 15.9.
and as himself has commanded.

For thus Genesis 4.26. Ps. 2 4.5. Mat. 6.9. Phil. 4.6. Ephesians. 3.14. Io. 9.31. Io. 4
2^.13
ever did the true Church of God: and to worship and pray unto any other, Isa.
4^.8.
is to give Gods glory to a creature.

I
IN the beginning God made Genesis 1.27 and 5.2.
man, consisting Genesis 2 7 Mat. 10.28
of soul and body: the body of the Gen 39 and 18.27.
dust, in it self mortal, yet Gen 2.17. Rom 5.12.
possibly immortal, if man had not sinned: the soul of spiritual substance,
Eccl. 12.7. Matthew. 16.26.
immortal in it self: in both a Ps 8.4.5
most excellent creature, above all others, except the Angels.

For he was created in the image Gen 1.27.
or likeness of God: and had dominion and Genesis 1.26 28. Psalm. 8.6.
rule over all other creatures in the world.

K
Col. 9 8.10
KNnowledge, righteousness, Ephesians. 4.24
and true holiness are the chief things, wherein Or likeness. Gen 1.26. For
Christ only is the substanti^ll image of God. 1 Cor 4 4. Col. 1.15.
the image of God does consist.

For otherwise the word of God would not cal^ upon us to Ephesians. 4.2^. etc.
renew that image in Christ: and without these graces man had not been fit to
rule the creatures, P^. 49.20.
nor* et himself.

L
Learn, that man Ephesians. 4.^4.
has lost that image of God, wherein he was created, Romans 5.^8.19.
by the si^ne of Adam the first man, Genesis 2.16.17. and 3 17.
in eating the forbidden fruit.

For Adam having power Eccl. 7.29.
not to sin if he w^u^d, being seduced by Genesis 3.6.12. 1 Ti 2.14.
the woman, and the woman 2 Cor. 11.3 Genesis 3.1.
by the serpent, Reu. 12.9. and 20.2
which is the Devil, did Eccl. 7.29.
willingly yield to the temptation.

M
Mankind being To. 5.17 18.19.
tainted by Adams sin, is become most To. 7 24.
wretched and miserable, both in respect of sin and punishment.

For hereby all men are Ps. 51.5.
conceived and borne in sin, and are so 1 Io. 1 8.
corrupted with sin 1 These. 5.23.
both in soul and body, that they cannot 1 Cor. 2.14.
perceive, Gen 6.5.
think, To. 8.7.
will, Romans 3.13 14.
speak Ps 14.1.2.3.
or do any good thing: but are become Romans 6.16.17.
subject to sin, 2 Timothy 2.26.
Satan, the Ephesians. 2.3.
wrath Gal. 3.10
and curse of God, to To. 6.23.
death, and to 2 These 2.12.
eternal damnation.

N
NO means can free us from that damnable estate, but Act 4.12 Mat. 1.21.
only Jesus Christ, the Io. 3.16. 1 Io. 5.20.
eternal son of God.

For he being both To. 9.5.
God and 1 Timothy 2.5.
man, has Heb. 7.2. (...) and 10 14.
perfectly saved us: in that he took Heb 2.16 17.
our nature upon him, being Luke 1.35. Matt. 1 20.
conceived by the holy Ghost, Isa. 7 1^. Mat. 1 18.
borne of the Virgin Mary: lived in perfect Phil. 2.8 To 5.19.
obedience, to God: Isai. ^3.5. 1 Pet. 3 18. and 2 2 4. Gal. 3.13.
suffered the cursed death of the Cross: To. 4 2^. 1 Cor 15.3.4.
rose again the third day: ascended Ps. 68.18. Luke 4.51.
into heaven: Col. 3.1. To. 8.34. Act. 3.21.
sits at the right hand of God: and all for us.

O
Hab. 2.4. Gal. 2.2^ Romans 3 23. and 11.6.
ONly by faith, Io 1 11 12. Ephesians. 3.17
receiving Jesus Christ into the heart, every man that with a Ps ^1 17
contrite heart Ps. ^2 5.
confesses his sins to God, and truly Luk 1^.3
repents, To. 4.6.7
is pardoned all his sins, and so does stand justified before God.

For we can merit To. 4.2. Ps. 130.3.
nothing with God, our best works being Isa. 64.6. Lu 17.10.
imperfect. And the promise of God is ^ only made to them Gal. 3 22 Act 2.39.
that believe: being Act 1^ 48 Ephesians. 1.3.
elected of God before the world was.

P
PReaching of the word of God is the ordinary means to work Mat. 4.17 Act.
20.20
repentance and To. ^0.14.17.
faith.

For God I^* 1.17.
that gives all grace, and so 2 Timothy 2.25.
repentance and Ephesians. 2.8.
faith, works outwardly by Iam. 1 18
the word, as by an instrument, and inwardly by his 1 Cor. 12.3.11.
spirit.

Q
QValities of faith inseparable unto it, are these: to Ephesians 2.13.1^.
unite us to God in Christ. to To. 5.2 5. Heb. 1 1. To. 8.35.38.39.
assure us of Gods love in him: to Act. 15.8.9. 1 Timothy 1.5.
purify the heart: and to Gal 5.6,
work by love.

For until we believe, we Ephesians. 2 12
are without God, without Christ, and without hope: but when To 5.1. and 8.1.
once we believe, we have peace with God: and cannot but Io. 15.5. Tit. 2.14.
be fruitful in all good works.

R
REmember that faith, and so all other graces are increased and confirmed by
the hearing of the word of God Act. 1.41 42. 1 Pet. 2.2.
preached, as also by 2 Ti. 3.15.
reading, Ps^ 11.^. 97. etc.
meditation, Mal. 3 16 Heb. 3 13.
conference, Io. 7.17.
practice, Col. 1.9. Ps. 119 18.
prayer, and To. 4.11. 2 Pet. 3.21
Sacraments.

For as God requires of every Christian a daily 2 Pet. 3.18. Heb. 5.12.
increase of grace, so he has appointed these Ephesians 4.12 Deu. 31 11 Io 5.39.
Col. 3.16. Reu 1.3. Ios. 1.8. Psalm. 1.1. Heb. 10.23 24.25. Ps* 50.23. Mar. 7.7.
Pro. 2.3.5. Gen 17 10 To. 4 11.
means to that end.

S
SAcraments are outward visible Gen 17.10.11.
signs of the covenant and promise of God in Christ, Mat. 28.19. Luke 21.19
ordained by Christ himself; to Genesis 17.11. 1 Cor. 11.26.
signify, and to seal or To. 4.11.
confirm, and as instruments or means, to Ephesians. 5.26 Tit. 4.5. 1 Cor. 10.16.
convey saving grace to every Mar. 16.16. 1 Cor. 11.29.
true believer, and to be as badges or tokens of our Christian Act. 2.38 41.
profession. And they are in number only two, Io 19 34 1 Io. 5.6.
namely, Baptism and the Lords Supper.

For such helps our weak 1 Cor. 13.9.12.
faith does require: and these Mat. 28.19. and 26 27.
only has Christ ordained, and no more: being answerable to the two Sacraments
under the Law, that is, Circumcision and the Passover: and are alone in that
kind sufficient both for the beginning and continuing of sitting grace.

T
THe sacrament of Baptism is, when the persons baptized, professing Mar. 1.4.5.
repentance, and Act. 8.37
faith in Jesus Christ, and the Ge. 17.8. Act. 2 39.
children of such are by the Minister Mat. 28.19.20.
of the word washed with water, Mat 3.11
in the name of the Father, the son and the holy Ghost: being thereby
admitted into the communion 1 Cor 12.12.13.
of the body of Christ, which is the Church: assured of the Act. 22.16
remission of their sins: do 1 Pet. 3.21. Gen 17 10
vow and promise, and are by Baptism confirmed in grace, To. 4.11.
to believe in Jesus Christ, and to live no more in sin, but in newness of
life.

For Baptism is the sign of our regeneration, Io. 3.35. 1 Pet. 2.2.
or new birth: and therefore is once only to be received, as it is sufficient
to be once bor^e and yet the virtue of Baptism is Ephesians 5.26.27.
perpetual.

V
Understand that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, is when bread and wine Mat.
26.26.29.
representing the body 1 Cor. 11.24. Luke 22.19.20.
and blood of Christ, broken and shed for us, being by the Minister taken and
blessed, is broken and poured forth, and so delivered to all the faithful
pr^sent: Mar. 14.22 23.
and of them received, by eating the bread and drinking the wine, in 1 Cor 11
26.
remembrance of Christ's death, as also to 1 Cor. 10 16. Io 16.29.35.47 51.
communicate unto us the very body and blood of Christ spiritually by faith:
Gal. 3.1. Io. 20.27.
and so to confirm our faith in Christ and 1 Cor. 10.17.
love one to another.

For this Sacrament is the sign of our new life, Io. 6.55 57.58.
as Baptism is of our new birth. And therefore as we have need of often
nourishment, so we ought to receive 1 Cor. 11 26.
often, and that with due preparation. 1 Cor. 11.28.


W
WE must know and believe, that all men Heb 9.27 Ps. 89.48.
dying the Eccl. 12.7 Luk 16.22 23.
souls of the godly go immediately to heavenly joy, the wicked to hell
torments: and all of them shall Io. 11.24. 2 Timothy 4 8.
at the last day rise Io. 5.29 Reu 2^.12. Act. 24.15 1 Cor. 15.
again in their 2 Cor. 5.10. Job. 1^.26.
own bodies, by the Io. ^^ 28.
power of Christ, the godly to life Io. 5.2^.
eternal, the wicked to everlasting damnation.

For Christ came Hos. 13.14. 1 Cor. 15.54.
to destroy death for us: and is himself 1 Cor. 15 13.14.20.
risen from death, that we 1 These. 4 1^. 1 Cor. 15.21.22.
might rise with him: and if there were no resurrection, the preaching of the
word, 1 Cor. 15 14.
and our faith should be in vain.

X
EXCeeding glorious in it self, joyous to the godly, and fearful to the
wicked, shall be the day Act 17.31
of judgment: wherein Christ To. 2 16.
shall call to account, and judge all To 1.12
men, of all Eccl^. 2.1^.
things done in thi^ life, R^u. 20.1^.
according to the^r works.

For he shall come with glory Mat. 25.31. Act. 3.19. Iud. 1^.
in the clouds, accompanied with innumerable Angels: and sitting upon his
throne of Majesty, shall upon To. 2.12. Io. 12 48.
due trial of every man's works (the Reu. 20.12. Ps. 139 16 Job 20 27 To.
2.15. Reu. 20.2
books being opened) pronounce the sentence Mat. 25.^4.
of salvation to the Godly, and of damnation to the wicked.

Y
YOu that are wicked, shall by the power of the voice of Christ, Mat 25.41 46.
go away into Mat. 5.29 30. and 1^.28. Isa. 30.23
hell: being 2 Th^s 1.9
separated from God, Mat. 2^.41.
consorted with the Devils, Luke 15.24 and 13.28
deprived of all comfort, punished with unspeakable R^u 19.^. Mar. 9.44.
torments both in soul and body, Mar. 10.15. and 23.14.
according to your sins, and that 2 These. 1.9 Reu 20.10
eternally without case or end.

For it is just with God, 2 These. ^.6. Rom 2.5. Luke 16.25
so to punish the wicked, and that they who have lived here in the pleasures
of sin, should be recompensed with answerable torment.

Z
ZEalous godly men, the judgment being ended, shall immediately go Mat.
25:34.46.
with Christ into heaven, having in him immediate 1 These. 4.17.
communion with God, who shall be all in all 1 Cor. 15.28. Reu 21.22.23.
unto them: and so shall be freed from Reu. 21 4
; all evils, and possessed of all good things, as perfection 1 Cor. 13.12 1^.
of grace, brightness Col. 3.4. Mat 1^ 43

joy, in their several 1 Cor. 15.41. Dan. 12 3.
degrees, and that 1 Cor 29.
unspeakable and 1 Cor. 4.17.
everlasting.

For it stands with the certainty of Gods 2 Timothy 3.19. To 8.20.
election; with the Io. 3 16. Reu. 2 10.
truth of his promise; and with his 1 Cor. 6.2^. 1 Pet 1.1^.19.
justice for the merit of Christ, thus to To. ^.4.5.
reward the faithful: that so all their sorrows may be turned into Io. 1^ ^0

Q. How may it appear by the light of nature, that there is a God?

Proved by the light of nature.
A. It is manifest by these evidences. 1. Because in the very Heathen there is
the work of the conscience. 2. Because they have, by natural instinct, an
inclination to some kind of Religion. 3. In that they have the use of an Oath.
4. In that they make observation of GODS vengeance against sin.

Q. Prove that in the Heathen, there is the work of the conscience?

A. The Apostle does affirm so much, In the work of the conscience.
Romans 2.15. That the Gentiles show the work of the Law written in their
hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean
while accusing or excusing one another. This work of the conscience is a
manifest evidence, that there is a God, who is above the conscience: according
to that in 1 Ioh. 3.20. If our heart condemn us, God is greater th^n our
heart, and knows all things.

Q. Prove that the Heathen have natural inclination to Religion?

A. It is evident, By natural inclination to Religion.
not only by the word of God, but by experience in the most barbarous Nations,
who will rather worship an Idol, or the Devil himself, or any thing. yea, an
unknown God, then no God at al.

Q. How may that appear?

Instance thereof.
A. It is apparent by that appeal of S Paul to the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 12.2. Ye
know, says he, that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb Idols,
even as ye were led. And by that complaint against Israel, Psalm. 106.35 that
they were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works, and served their
Idols: yea they offered their Sons and Daughters unto Devils. Thus the men of
Lystra, Act. 14.11.13. were ready to sacrifice to Paul and Barnabas, saying,
The Gods are come down unto us, in the likeness of men. And Paul at Athens,
Act. 17.13. found an Altar, with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.

By the use of an oath.
Q. Prove that the heathen have the use of an oath?

A. Both experience and Scripture plainly teach it. For instance, we read:
that the heathen King, Abimelech, required an oath of Abraham, and performed
the like to him, Genesis 21.23. Swear unto me here by God, says he, etc.
again, verse 31. Abraham is said to call that place Beersheba, that is, The
well of the oath, because there they swore both of them; the like we read of
Abimelech and Isaac, Genesis 26.28. Now this conscience of an oath proves
evidently, that they were persuaded of a divine power, who is the Auenger of
all falsehood and perjury.

Q. Prove that the heathen are obseruant of Gods vengeance against sin?

A. We may see it in the example of the Philistims, By observation of Gods
vengeance
1 Samuel 5.7. who being smitten with Emrods, acknowledge^, that the hand of God
was sore upon them and upon D^g^n their God A^^i^e, Act. 28.4. when the
Barb^rians saw the ^iper hang on P^u^s hand, they said among themselves, No
doubt, this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet
vengeance suffers not to live. Thus the very heathen acknowledge ^^ God of
vengeance.

Proved by the light of grace.
Q. How prove you by the light of Grace, that there is a God?

A. It is evident in three respects. 1 In regard of the subject or matter of
the Scriptures. 2. In respect of the Majesty of God shining therein. 3. If we
consider the scope and drift of the Scriptures.

In regard of the matter of the Scriptures.
Q. How is it proved by the m^tter of the Scriptures?

A. In that the Scripture, the word of Gods grace does every where teach, not
only that God is, but also how we may know and serve the true God: as S. Paul
notes, Act. 17.23. whom, says he, Of the Majesty of God shining therein:
ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.

Q. How may it appear by the Majesty of God shining in the Scriptures?

A. In that the holy Scripture, written in so plain and familiar a style, yet
being read, opened, and applied is so express a Caracter or note of the Divine
Majesty, that it conuinceth the conscience of the Hearer, in so much, that as
it is said, 1 Cor. 14.25. The secrets of his heart are made manifest, and so
falling down on his face, he will worship God, and say plainly, that God is
in you indeed.

Q. How is it proved by the scope and drift of the Scriptures? Of the scope of
the Scriptures.


A. In that the Scripture directs us, to this very point, as one of the first
principles of Christian Religion; namely, that there is a God, Heb. 11.6. He
that comes to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of
them that diligently seek him.

Q How prove you, Proved by the works of God.
that there is a God, by his works?

Proved by the works of God.
A. It is manifest, by the work of Creation* by the work of providence, by the
work of Gods judgments, by his works of wonder; and of his foretelling
things to come.

Q. Prove it by the work of creation?

Of Creation.
A. It is written, Romans 1.20. The invisible things of him, that is, his eternal
power and Godhead are seen by the c^eation of the world, being considered in
his works, and Psalm. 19.1. The heavens declare the glory of God, and the
firmament shows his handy works.

Q. Prove it by the work of providence?

Of Pro^idence.
A. It is said, Act. 14.17. that he l^ft not himself without witness; in that
^e did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our
hearts with food and gladness, and ch^p. 17.27. that even the very heathen
should seek the Lord, if happily they might f^ele after him, and find him,
though he be not far from every one of us, for in him we live, and move, and
have our being.

Q. Prove it by Gods works of judgment?

A. The Psalmist expressly teaches this, Of Judgment.
Psalm. 9.16. The Lord is known by executing judgment: the wicked is sn^^ed in
the work of his own hand; and Psalm. 58.11. Men shall say, ve^il^ there is
fruit for the righteous: doubtless there is a God that judges the earth.

Q Prove it by Gods works of wonder?

A. By this argument the D^ity is inuincibly proved, Of wonder.
Psalm. 86.10. Thou art great, and do wondrous things thou art God alone, and
Psalm. 72.18. Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, which only does
wondrous things.

Q. Prove it by his foretelling things to come?

Of foretelling things to come.
A. Upon this ground, all Idols are proved to be in Gods, Isai. 41.21.23. Stand
to your cause, says the Lord; bring forth your strong reasons, etc. Show the
things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that you are Gods: and by
the same reason, the Deity of the true God is confirmed, Isai. 44.6.7. Thus
says the Lord, etc I am the first and I am the last, and besides me there is
no God. And who is like m^e, that shall call, and shall declare it, and set it
in order before me, since I appointed the ancient people? and what is at hand,
and what things are to come? let them show unto them.

Q. You have proved that God is, prove now that we ought to acknowledge God?

God ought to be acknowledged.
A. It is written, Prou. 3.6. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall
direct thy paths; and it was David's instruction, which he gave to his Son
Solomon upon his death bed, 1 Chro. 28.9 And thou Solomon my Son, know the
God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing
mind: for the Lord searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations
of thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be ^ound of the^: but if thou forsake
him, he will cast thee off for ever.

Q. Prove that we must acknowledge God, as he has revealed himself in his
written word?

A. It is written, As he is revealed in the word.
Deuteronomy. 29.29. The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but those things
which are revealed, belong unto us, and to our children for ever, that we may
do all the words of this law; and Romans 15.4. For whatsoever things were
written aforetime, were written for our learning, that we through patience and
comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope.

Q. Why can no man be saved without the knowledge of God?

Without knowledge no salvation.
A. Because our salvation consists in the knowledge of God, witness our
Savior, Ioh. 17.3. This is life eternal, that they know thee the only true
God, and Jesus Christ whom thou have s^nt. And the Apostle shows, that
without this knowledge, there is nothing to be looked for, but certain
damnation; 2 These. 1.8. The Lord Jesus, says he, shall be revealed from
Heaven, with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that
know not God.

Q. Why can we not know God unto salvation, No knowledge to salvation without
the word.
but by the Scriptures?

A. Because, as S. Paul teaches, 2 Timothy 3.15. The Holy Scriptures are able to
make us wise unto salvation. And Christ has commanded, Ioh. 5.39. Search the
Scriptures, for in them ye think to have eternal life, and they are they
which testify of me.

B Of faith in one God.
Q. Rehearse the letter B.

A. Believe in one only God.

For to us Christians there is but one God, and they that have many Gods, have
no God at all, but the Devil. And to believe that there is one God, but not to
believe in him, is no better then the faith of Devils.

There is but one God.
Q. Prove that there is but one God?

A. It is written, Duet. 6.4. Hear O Israel, The Lord our God is one Lord, and
Isai 44.6. Thus says the Lord, I am the first, and I am the last, and besides
me there is no God.

Q. Prove that to us Christians, there is but one God?

To us Christians.
A. It is written, 1 Cor. 8.4.5.6. We know that an Idol is nothing in the
world, and that there is none other God but one, for though there be that are
called Gods, etc. yet to us there is but one God, and Ephesians. 4.5.6. There is one
Lord, one faith, one Baptism, one God and Father of all.

Q* Prove that they that have many Gods, have no God at all but the Devil?

To have many Gods, is to have no God.
A. It will manifestly appear, if we compare two places of Scripture together;
the one is, Ephesians. 2.12. where the Apostle says, That being Gentiles or
Heathen, Due. 32.17.
they were at that time, Ps 106.37.38.
without God in the world: the other place is, 1 Cor. 10.20. where he says,
that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to Devils, and not
to God.

Q. What is it to believe in God? To believe in God, what?


A. To believe in God is not only to believe that there is a God: or, to
believe God, It is to trust in God.
and to give credit to him, by assenting to his word: but to put our whole
trust and confidence in him, as our God and Father.

Q. How may this appear to be true?

A. It is evident in that we find this to be the faith of the fathers in the
old Testament, Proof that it is to trust in God.
Psalm. 22.4. Our Fathers trusted in thee; they trusted, and thou did
deliver them: and David for his particular says, Psalm. 11.1. In the Lord put I
my trust, and Psalm. 25.2. O my God, I trust in thee, let me not be ashamed.
And in the new Testament the Apostles taught this faith, 1 Timothy 6.17. Charge
them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in
uncertain riches, but in the living God.

Q Prove that to believe one God, but not to believe in him, is but the faith
of devils? To believe God, but not in God, is the Devils says.


A. By this very thing, S. James does convince the hypocrites and counterfeit
Christians, Iam. 2.19. Thou beleeuest, that there is one God, thou do well:
the Devils also believe and tremble.

C Of the Trinity, or three persons in one God.
Q. Rehearse the Letter C.

A. Conceive in this one God, three persons, The Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost.

For so it has pleased God to reveal himself from heaven: and in thi^ name
every Christian is baptized: and it is the form of Christian blessing.

Q. Prove that we must conceive in one God, three persons.

Three persons in one God.
A. We are so taught, 1 Ioh. 5.7. There are three that bear witness in
heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one.

Q. Prove that God has so revealed himself from heaven?

So revealed from heaven.
A. The Evangelist notes so much, Luke 3.21.22. That Jesus being baptized and
praying, the heaven was opened: and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape
like a Dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my
beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased. Here is the Son baptized: the Holy
Ghost descending upon him: and the father speaking from Heaven.

Q. Prove that in this name every Christian is baptized?

So are all baptized.
A. It is the constant practice of the Church, according to the command of
Christ, Matthew. 28.19. Go ye, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
name of ^he Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

Q. Prove that this is the form of Christian blessing?

A. So we read, So blessed.
2 Cor. 13.14. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.

D Of the distinction of the persons in Trinity.
Q. Rehearse the letter D.

DIstinguish the persons in the Godhead, but neither confound them, nor divide
the substance.

For the Father is of none, but of himself; the Son is begotten of the Father,
the Holy Ghost proceeds from them both. And every person distinctly by
himself i^ God: yet are they not three Gods, but only one God, coeternall and
coequall.

Q. How may it appear that the persons are thus to be distinguished, and not
confounded?

Three persons distin^t, not confounded.
A. That they are to be distinguished, and not confounded so that the one is not
the other is manifest by diverse evidences grounded upon the word of God.
Evidence
The first whereof is, because they are expressly showed and said in Scripture,
to be in number three, and are there noted distinctly by their peculiar
denominations or names, as before is showed, both by revelation from heaven; by
the institution of baptism; and by the words of Ioh. 1.5.7. There are three
that bear witness in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghost.

Q. What is the second evidence, that the person^ are so distinguished and not
confounded?

A. The second evidence is grounded upon the incommunicable properties ascribed
distinctly to each person: Evidence.
as that the Father is of none, but of himself, begetting the Son. The Son
is begotten of the Father. The Holy Ghost preceedeth from them both. All which
may appear by these Scriptures, 1 Cor. 8.6 where S. Paul calls the first
person, the Father, of whom are all things; and Romans 11.36. he says, that of
him, and through him, and for him are all things, Psalm. 22.7. Thou art my
Son, this day have I begotten thee. Ioh. 1.14. Christ is said to be the
only begotten Son of the Father, and Ioh. 15.26. Christ says of the Holy
Ghost the third person, when the comforter shall come, whom I will send unto
you from the father, even the spirit of truth which proceeds of the Father*
he shall testify of me.

Q. What is the third evidence?

Evidence.
A. The third evidence is taken from the consideration of the distinct effects
or works attributed to each person: as, the work of Creation to the Father:
Redemption to the Son: Sanctification to the Holy Ghost. For though being
outward works, they be common to the whole Deity, yet in respect of personal
order, and of the manner of working, they are distinct: the Father working by
the Son, and by the holy Ghost; but the Son and the holy Ghost working from
the Father, as being the fountain of every action.

Q. What is the fourth evidence?

A. The fourth evidence to prove that the persons are distinct and not
confounded, Evidence.
is grounded upon certain terms, which do not^ personal difference; as Ioh.
1.1. the word was with God; and Ioh. 5.17. My Father works hitherto, and I
work. So of the holy Ghost it is said, Isai. 48.16. the Lord God, and his
spirit has sent me; and where it is said, 1. Cor. 12.6. that it is the same
GOD that works all in all; it is added, Psalm. 8. etc. by the spirit, and by
the same spirit, often repeated: which terms of difference were merely in
vains, if the persons were not distinct.

Q. Why must not the substance be divided?

A. We must not divide the substance, The substance not divided.
because the God head of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost is all one:
for we must conceive in the Deity another and another person, but not another
and another thing: that is, a diversity or distinction of persons, but not a
division of the divine nature: so the Father is God, the Son is God, and the
holy Ghost is God, yet they are not three Gods, but one God.

Q. Prove that every person distinctly by himself is God: and first that the
Father is God.

The Father is God.
A. It is written, Ephesians. 4.6. There is one God, and Father of all, who is above
all, and through all, and in you all; and 1 Cor. 15. 24. Christ is said to have
delivered up the Kingdom to God, even the Father.

Q. Prove that the Son is God?

The Son is God.
A. The Godhead of the Son is plentifully confirmed in Scripture. Saint John
speaking of our Savior Christ, Ioh. 1.1. says, In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; and 1 Ioh. 5.20. That the
Son of God Jesus Christ, is true God, and eternal life; and Ioh. 20.28. That
Thomas believing, answered and said unto Jesus, My Lord and my God.

Q. Prove that the Holy Ghost is God?

A. The God head of the Holy Ghost may appear, The holy Ghost in God.
amongst many evidences by that saying of Saint Peter to Ananias, Act. 5.3.4.
That, in that he did lie unto the Holy Ghost, he lied not unto men, but unto
God.

Again, the deity of the Holy Ghost, may be gathered out of Isa. 48.16. where
the Prophet says; And now the Lord God, and his holy spirit has sent me. And
Act. 13.2. where it is said, That as they ministered unto the Lord, and fasted,
the Holy Ghost said, separate me Barnabas and Saul, for the work whereunto I
have called them. So Act. 20.28. S. Paul tells the Elders of the Church, That
the holy Ghost had made them ouersee^s, to feed the Church of God. All which
could not be said of the holy Ghost, if he were not God.

Q. Prove that though there be three persons, yet they are but one God?

Yet not three Gods, but one God.
A. It is manifest that the three persons, are not three Gods, but only one God,
because there can be but one infinite, one eternal, one almighty, and so
consequently but one only God, as was proved before. And S. John does
expressly affirm, 1 Ioh. 5.7. these three are one.

Q. Prove that they are coeternall?

They are coeternall.
A. The Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost must of necessity be coeternall,
one as well as the other, that is, the Father eternal, the Son eternal, and
the holy Ghost eternal; because they do all subsist in one and the same
divine nature, and are all three, one and the same God. For the Sons
eternity see Ioh. 1.2. The same was in the beginning with God, all things were
made by him. And Ioh. 17.5. Now O Father, glorify thou me with thine own
self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. And the^
coeternity of the Holy Ghost with the Father and the Son is noted, in that
he joined with them in the creation of all things, Genesis 1.2. And the spirit of
God moved upon the face of the waters.

Q. Prove that they are coequall.

A. Being one and the same divine nature, They are coequall.
they must also needs be coequall. Of the Son it is said Phil. 2.6. That
being in the form of God, he thought it no robbery to be equal with God. So
again the disposing of spiritual gifts is equally attributed to the holy
Ghost, a^ well as to the Father and the Son, as being God coequall with them:
1 Cor. 12.4.5.6.11.

E Of the attributes or properties of God.
Q. Rehearse the Letter E.

A. Eternal, infinite, immutable, invisible, almighty: most wise, holy, good,
merciful, and just is this one God.

For thus God is pleased to describe himself unto us in his word: because
otherwise no man can see, or know the nature of God.

Q. Prove that God is eternal?

God is 1. eternal
A. That God is eternal, without beginning or ending, i^ evident, Psalm. 90.^.
Before the mountains were made, and before thou had formed the earth and the
world: even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God. And 1 Timothy 1.17. To
the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor, and
glory for ever and ever Amen.

Q. Prove that God is infinite?

A. That God is infinite, Infinite.
filling all places, and present every where, see Ier. 23.23.24. Am I a God at
hand, says the Lord, and not a God a far off? can any hide himself in
secret places, that I shall not see him says the Lord? do not I fill heaven
and earth, says the Lord? And Ps. 139.7. Whither shall I go from thy spirit?
or whither shall I flee from thy presence?

Q. Prove that God is immutable?

A. That God is immutable, Immu^table.
without change, see Iam. 1.17. where God is said to be the father of lights,
with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. And Mal. 3.6. I am
the Lord, I change not: therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.

Q. Prove that God is invisible?

Invisible
A. It is manifest by that has been said before, 1 Timothy 1.17. That as God is
eternal without beginning and immortal without end, so he is also invisible.
And Col. 1.15. Christ is called the Image of the invisible God. And Ioh. 4.24.
it is said, That God is a spirit, and therefore without bodily or visible
substance.

Q. Prove that God is almighty?

Almighty.
A. It is written Genesis 17.1. I am the Almighty God, walk before me and be thou
perfect. And Reu. 15.3. Reu. 4.8.
Great and marvelous are thy works Lord God almighty. Whereupon it is said,
Mark. 10.27. That with God all things are possible:

Q. Prove that God is most wise?

A. It is written, ps. 147.5. Most wise.
Great is our Lord and of great power, his understanding or his wisdom is
infinite. And 1 Timothy 1. 17. He is called The only wise God.

Q. Prove that God is most holy?

A. It is the voice of the Seraphims, Holy.
or Angels, Isa. 6.3. Le. 28.36.
Who cry one to another, saying Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hosts. And
Reu. 15.4. Who shall not fear (...) O Lord, and glorify thy name, for thou
only art Holy. Le 11 44. and 19.2.
And 1 P^t. 1.15. As he which has called you is holy, so be ye holy in all
manner of conversation.

Q. Prove that God is good?

A. That he is absolutely good in himself, Good.
our. Savior shows, Matthew. 19.17. when he says, There is none good but
one, that is God. And that he is good to his creatures, read Psalm. 145.9. where
it is said, That the Lord is good to all. And Matthew. 5. 45. He makes his Sun
to arise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and unjust.

Q. Prove that God is merciful?

Merciful.
A. It is written Iam. 5.11. That the Lord is very pitiful and merciful. And
Psalm. 145. 8.9. The Lord is gracious and full of compassion: slow to anger, and
of Great mercy, and his tender me^^y is over all his works. And Luke 6.36. Be
ye therefore merciful, as your father also is merciful.

Q. Prove that God is just?

Just*
A. It is said Deu. 32.4. That he is a God of truth and without iniquity; just
and righteous is he. Psalm. 145.17. The Lord is righteous in all his ways.
Psalm. 11.7. The righteous Lord loves righteousness. And therefore he is called
2 Timothy 4.8. The righteous Judge.

Q. Prove that God would be so described?

A. It is evident in his appearing to Moses, God would be so described.
Exodus 34.6. where it is said, That the Lord passed by before him, and
proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord, merciful and gracious, long suffering and
abundant in goodness and truth, reserving mercy for thousands, forgiving
iniquity, and transgression, and sin, and not making the wicked innocent, etc.

Q. Prove that God is so described because otherwise no man can see God.

A. It is written, Because none can see God.
Ioh. 2.18. No man has seen God at any time: And 1 Timothy 6.16. That God
dwells in light, which no man can approach unto, whom no man has seen nor
can see. And therefore this is rendered as the reason why God did so proclaim
himself to Moses, Exo. 33.18.19.20. Because no man can see the face of God and
live.

F Of the creation of the world.
Q. Rehearse the Letter F?

A. FRamed and made was the whole world, by the word of God, and that of
nothing, in six days, and all very good.

For nothing can make it self: neither can be without some cause: nor can be
evil, being made of God.

Q. Prove that God made the world?

A. It is written Genesis 1.1. God made the world.
In beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Act. 17.24. God made the
world and all things therein. And Col. 1.16. By him were all things created,
which are in heaven, and which are in earth, things visible and invisible.

Q. Prove that the world was made by the word of God?

A. So it is in the Psalm 33.6. By his word.
By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them, by
the breath of his mouth. And Psalm 148.5. He commanded, and they were created.
See this in the history of the creation, Genesis 1.6.

Q. Prove that God made all things of nothing?

A. It is said Hebrews 11.3. Of nothing.
Through faith we understand, that the worlds were framed by the word of God,
so that things which are seen, were not made of things which do appear.

Q. Prove that God made all things in six days?

In six days.
A. It is manifest in the story of the creation, Genesis 1.31. And is repeated in
the fourth commandment, Exodus 20.11. In six days the Lord made heaven and
earth, the sea, and all that in them is.

Q. Prove that God made all things very good?

All very good.
A. So God himself testifies, Genesis 1.31. And God saw every thing, that he had
made, and behold it was very good.

Q. Prove that nothing can make it self?

Nothing can make it self.
A. It is brought as a reason to prove that God made man, and so consequently
all other creatures, Psalm. 100.3. Know ye that the Lord he is God, it is he
that has made us, and not we our selves.

Q. Prove that nothing can be without some cause?

A. It is evident in the light of nature: Nor be without some cause.
and it is the reason of the Apostle to prove that God made all things. Heb.
3.4. for says he, Every house is builded of some man: but he that built all
things i^ God.

Q. Prove that nothing made of God can be evil?

A. It is manifest because (as is showed before) God is good, Nor be evil
being made of God.
yea goodness it self. And Psalm. 5.4. No evil can dwell with him. And
therefore he cannot be the author of evil, who is the fountain of all
goodness, as is proved Iam. 1.17. Every good gift, and every perfect gift is
from above, and comes down from the father of lights.

G Of Gods providence in governing and preserving all things.
Q. Rehearse the Letter G?

A. Governed and preserved are all things by the providence of God.

For otherwise Satan and wicked men might do what they list: yea, and every
creature would perish in a moment.

Q. Prove that all things are governed by the providence of God.

All governed by Gods providence.
A. It is written Pro. 15.3. The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding
the evil and the good. And Mat. 10.29.30 That one sparrow shall not fall on
the ground without your Father: but the very hayres of your head are all
numbered.

Q. Show some instances or examples of Gods providence, governing and ordering
all things?

A. It is evident by many examples in the word of God, Exampl^^ many.
that nothing does come to pass by fortune or chance, but that all things are
ordered by the will and providence of God: therefore it is said Ps. 135.6.
Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he, in heaven and in earth; in the sea
and in all deep places.

Q. Show some instance of things in heaven?

A. It is said Psalm. 29.3. In heaven.
The God of glory makes it to thunder. Psalm. 135 7. He causes the vapors to
ascend from the ends of the earth, he makes lightenings for the rain: he
brings the wind out of his trea^ures. Job. 37.6. He says to the snow be
thou upon the earth, likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his
power. Therefore it is said Psalm. 147.7.8. Sing unto the Lord with
thanksgiving, which covers the heaven with clouds, and prepares rain for
the earth.

Q. Give some example of Gods work in the sea?

A. It is written Isa. 51.15* I am the Lord, In the sea.
thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared. And Psalm. 107.23.24. They
that go down to the sea in ships, see the works of the Lord, and his wonders
in the deep. 25. For he commands and raises the stormy wind which lifts
up the waue^ thereof. And again ver. 29. He makes the storm a calm, so
that the waves thereof are still.

Q. Show some instances of Gods providence in ordering things upon the earth?

A. First all things both good and evil are ordered by Gods providence, In the
earth.
see Isa. 45.7. Instance
I form the light and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the
Lord do all these things. Job. 5.18. He makes the wound and binds it up:
he smites and his hands make whole. And 1 Samuel 2.6. The Lord kills and
makes alive: he brings down to the grave, and raises up.

Q. Give a second instance of Gods providence in things upon the earth?

A. Secondly it is said Dan. 2.21. Instance of things in earth.
That he changes the times and seasons: he remoueth Kings, and sets up
Kings. And Psalm. 75.7. God is the Judge, he puts down one, and sets up
another.

Q. Give a third instance of this providence?

A. Instance
Thirdly it is said Pro. 16.1. The preparations of the heart in man, and the
answer of the tongue is from the Lord. And ver. 9. A man's heart deuiseth his
way; but the Lord directs his steps. And Prou. 21.1. The Kings heart is in
the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of waters, he turns it whithersoeuer he
will.

Q. Give a fourth instance of this providence?

A. Fourthly, the providence of God does so order all things, Instance
that there is nothing so casual to us, but it is infallibly certain in the
decree of God. See Pro. 16.33. The lot is cast into the lap: but the whole
disposing thereof is of the Lord.

Q. Prove that all things are preserved by the providence of God?

All preserved by Gods providence.
A. It is written Psalm. 36.6. O Lord thou preseruest man and beast. And Psalm.
145.15. The eyes of all wait upon thee, and thou give them their meat in due
season. Psalm. 119.91. It is said of all Gods creatures: That they continue even
to this day, by thine ordinances: for all are thy servants.

Q. Prove that Satan cannot do what he list?

A. It is evident Job. 1.11. and 2.5. Satan cannot do what he list.
Because Satan could not touch Job, either in his substance, or his children,
or his person, without Gods permission. And Mat. 8.31. The devils could not
enter into the heard of swine, without the leave of Christ.

Q. Prove that wicked men cannot do what they list?

A. It is manifest in that Christ said to Pilate Ioh. 19.11. Wicked men cannot
do what they list.
Thou could have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from
above. And Act. 4.27. It is said, That Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the
Gentiles, and the people of Israel were gathered together, to do whatsoever
the hand and counsel of God determined before to be done.

Q. Prove that without Gods providence every creature would perish in a moment?

Without Gods providence all perish. Leu. 26.26 Eze. 4.16. and 5.16. Isa. 3.1.
and 14.13.
A. It is evident, Act. 17.25.28. in that it is said, That he gives to all,
life, breath and all things: and that in him we live, and move, and have our
being. And Deu. 8.3. Man lives not by bread only, but by every word that
proceeds out of the mouth of God.

H Of one God only to be worshipped with religious worship.
Q. Rehearse the letter H?

A. HE, even this God alone is to be worshipped and called upon: and that only
in the name of Christ, with understanding, and as him self has commanded.

For thus ever did the true Church of God: and to worship and pray unto any
other, is to give Gods glory to a creature.

Q. Prove that God only is to be worshipped?

A. It is written Matthew. 4.10. God only is to be worshipped
Thou shall worship the Lord thy God, and him only shall thou serve. And Reu.
22.8.9. S. John says, I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel:
but he said unto me, See thou do it not: for I am they fellow servant, and of
thy brethren the Prophets, and of them which keep the words of this book:
Worship God.

Q. Prove that God only is to be called upon?

He only is to be called upon.
A. God himself says Ps. 50.15. Call upon me, in the day of trouble; I will
deliver thee, and thou shall glorify me. And Luke 11.2. Our Savior teaching
the most perfect form of prayer, says. When ye pray, say, Our Father which
art in Heaven, etc.

Q. Prove that we are to call upon God, only in the name of Christ?

Only in the name of Christ.
A. Christ himself says, Ioh. 1^.22. Verily, verily, I say unto you,
whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. And 1 Timothy 2.5. There is one God, and one mediator between God and man, the man
Christ Jesus. Therefore he is called, Heb. 12.24. The mediator of the new
Testament.

Q. Prove that we must worship, and pray to God with understanding? With
understanding.


A. So says the Apostle in the name of every good Christian; 1 Cor. 14.15. I
will pray with the spirit, and will pray with understanding also: I will sing
with the spirit, and will si^g with understanding also. And our Savior shows
the reason, why we ought so to do, Ioh. 4.24. because, God is a spirit, and
they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.

Q. Prove that we must worship and call upon God only as himself has
commanded?

A. It is written, Only a^ he has commanded.
Deu. 12.32. What thing soever I command you, observe to do it, thou shall not
add thereto, nor diminish from it. And Isa. 29.13. God complains, that their
fear toward him, is taught by the precept of men. And Christ says Matthew.
15.9. In vain they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.

Q. Prove that the true Church did ever thus worship, and pray unto God only.

A. It will manifestly appear, if we take a view of all ages from the
beginning of the world; So it was in all ages.
both before the Law; under the Law; and after the Law, under the Gospel, in
the time of Christ and his Apostles.

Q. Prove that before the Law, God only was worshipped and called upon?

Before the Law.
A. The sacred history of Gods word from the first man Adam unto Moses, does
manifestly prove it. And it is expressly said, Genesis 4.26. at the restitution
and reformation of Religion, formerly corrupted by the posterity of Cain* That
then men began to call upon the name of the Lord.

Q. Prove that under the Law God only was worshipped and called upon?

Under the Law.
A. The truth of this may evidently appear, in that by the Law all religious
service and sacrifice was offered unto God only. And it is said Psalm. 22.4.5.
Our fathers trusted in thee, they trusted, and thou did deliver them, they
called upon thee and were delivered, they trusted in thee, and were not
confounded.

Q. Prove that after the Law in the time of the Gospel, God only was
worshipped and prayed unto?

A. It is evident in that Christ did so teach;
After the law.
the Apostles did both so preach and practice. Again, a good Christian is
styled or said to be, A worshipper of God, or one that calls on the name of
the Lord. And such are called the true worshippers.

Q. Prove that Christ did so teach?


A. That our Savior Christ did so teach and maintain, Christ did so teach.
may appear evidently, both by his combat with Satan Mat. 4.10. where he
proves by the Scriptures, that religious worship and service is to be done
unto God only. And Matthew. 6.9. teaching his Disciples, and in them us, to
pray, he says, After this manner therefore pray ye, Our father which art in
heaven, etc.


Q. Prove the Apostles did both so teach and practice? ^he Apostles did so
preach and practice.


A. That the Apostles did so teach, see Phil. 4.6. Be nothing ca^efull, but in
all things let your requ^sts be showed unto God in prayer and supplication,
with giui^g of thanks. And that they did so practice, and that all the
^aithfull did the like, accordin^ to their doctrine and example, is manifest by
all the forms of prayer recorded in the New Testament; and specially by that
of the Apostle, Ephesians. 3.14. I bow my k^e^s unto the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ etc.


Q. Prove that a good Christian is styled a worshipper of God?

A. It is evident in that speech of the blind man cured by Christ, A
worshipper of God is the title of a Christian.
Io. 9.31. Ye know, says he, that God hears not sinners: but if any man be
a worshipper of God, and does his will, him hears he. Where we see, he
calls a good Christian or godly man, a worshipper of God. And 2. Tim. 2.19.
In stead of saying, let every Christian, S. Paul says, Let every one that
calls on the name of Christ, depart from iniquity.

Q Prove that such as worship God only, are the true worshippers?

A. That such as worship and call upon God only,
The worshipper of God only, is the true worshipper.
are the true worshippers, may be gathered by the words of Christ to the woman
of Samaria, Io. 4.22.23. Ye worship, says he, ye know not what; we know what
we worship, etc. But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers
shall worship the father in spirit and in truth: for the father seeks such
to worship him.

Q. How prove you, that to worship or pray unto any other, is to give Gods
glory to a creature?

Otherwise Gods glory is given to a creature.
A. Because the praise of hearing all prayer, of all creatures, belongs to
God, see Psalm. 65.1.2. Praise wayteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee
shall the vow be performed. O thou that hear prayer, unto thee shall all
flesh come. And Isa. 42.8. I am the Lord, that is my name, and my glory will I
not give to another, neither my praise to graven Images.

I Of man in his first creation.
Q. Rehearse the letter I?

A. IN the beginning God made Man, consisting of soul and body: the body of
the dust, in it self mortal, yet possibly immortal, if man had not sinned:
the soul of spiritual substance, immortal in its self: in both a most
excellent creature, above all others, except the Angels.

For he was created in the image or likeness of God, and had dominion and
rule over all other creatures in the world.

Q. What is to be understood by the word Man?

Man, what it signifies
A. By the word Man is meant both sexes, man and woman; as we may see Genesis 1.27.
and 5.2. where God being said to make man, it is added immediately, male and
female created he them and blessed them, and called their name Adam, or Man, in
the day when they were created.

Q. Why did God at the beginning make one man and one woman?

Why God made one man and one woman.
A. God made one man and one woman, not only for propagation, as it is Genesis
1.28. Be fruitful and multiply, and replenith the earth; but also that by
making only one man and one woman, he might establish holy marriage, and
lawful procreation of children. Which our Savior proves, Matthew. 19.4.5. Have
you not read, says he, that he which made them at the beginning, made them
male and female? And thence concludes, that two shall be one flesh. The like
is in Mal. 2.15. And did not he make one? yet had he abundance of spirit: and
wherefore one? because he sought a godly seed.

Q. Prove that man does consist of soul and body?

A. That man does consist of these two parts, Man consists of soul and body,
soul and body, is evident in the story of the creation, Genesis 2.7. as also by
many instances else where in the word of God: as for example. Matthew. 10.28.
Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but
rather fear him* which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. 1 Cor.
6.20. Glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are Gods, And 1.
These. 5.23. I pray God your whole spirit, and soul, and body be preserved
blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Q. Prove that God made the body of the dust?

The body is of the dust.
A. It is written, Genesis 2.7. That the Lord God formed man of the dust of the
ground. 1 Cor. 15.47.
and 3.9. Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shall return. This made Abraham
confess with great humility, Genesis 18.27. I am but dust and ashes. And it is
alleged by David as an argument of Gods pity, Psalm. 103.13.14. Like as a
father pitieth his children, to the Lord pitieth them that fear him. For he
knows our frame: he remembers that we are dust.

Q. What is the difference between the creation of man and woman?

The difference of man and woman's creation.
A. The difference is this; First the man was made before the woman, to note his
authority and her subjection: as Saint Paul reasons, 1 Timothy 2.13. For says
he, Adam was first formed, then Eve. As also to show the near affinity
between man and man: seeing, as it is Acts 17.26. God has made of one blood
all nations of men, for to dwell on the face of the earth.

Q. What is the second difference?

A. Secondly man was made of the dust primarily, A second difference.
the woman secondarily; in that she was taken out of him, who was made of the
dust: for she was made of the rib of Adam. Genesis 2 22. Not of the head, nor of
the foot: to show, that God would neither have her a ruler nor a servant to her
husband, but a companion, as she is called, Mal. 2.14. Again it was a type of
the Church, the life and salvation whereof issued by water and blood, Io. 19.34.
out of the side of Christ, as the woman received her being out of the side of
the man.

Q. Prove that the body of man was made possibly immortal?

A. The body of man was in its self mortal, Man body possibly immo^tall.
yet by the appointment of God, were it not for sin, had been possibly
immortal. For God gave unto man possibility not to sin, and so consequently
not to die; as may be gathered by his general threatening, Genes. 2.17. The day
thou eatest thereof, ( that is, of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil)
thou shall surely die. And by the special sentence of bodily death, Genesis 3.29.
Dust thou art, and unto dust shall thou return. So To. 5.12. it is said, by
one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin. And To. 6.23, The
wages of sin is death.

Q. Prove that the soul is of spiritual substance, immortal in its self?

The soul is immortal.
A. That the soul of man^s of spiritual substance, immortal in its self by
nature, existing as well out of the body, as in the body, and giung life to the
body, it is evident both in the creation, Genesis 2.7. where it is said, That God
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.
As also by the parting of soul and body in death, Eccles. 12.7. Then shall the
dust return to the earth as it was; and the spirit shall return to God, who
gave it. Else Christ could not have said of the Patriarchs deceased, Matthew.
22.32. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. And Matthew. 16.26.
What shall it profit a man, though he should win the whole world, if he
lose his own soul?

Q. Prove that man was made a most excellent creature, above all others, excep^
the Angels?

A. That, Man a most excelent creature.
next to the Angels, man excelled all other creatures in the world, see Psalm.
8.4.5. What is man that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that
thou visitest him? for thou have made him a little lower then the Angels, and
have crowned him with glory and honor.

Q. Prove that man was created in the image of God?

Created in the image of God.
A. That God made man in his own image and liknesse, is specially noted in the
creation, more then onee, as it is written, Genesis 1.26. God said, Let us make
man in our image, after our likeness. And verse 27. So God created man in his
own image, in the image of God created he him: male and female created he
them.

Q. Prove that man had dominion and rule over all other creatures?

Had rule over all creatures.
A. It is granted to man in his first creation, Genesis 1.26.28. To have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over the foul of the air, and over every living
thing that moves upon the earth. And the grant is humbly acknowledged, Psalm.
8.6. Thou made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands: thou have
put all things under his feet*

K Of the image of God, wherein man was created.
Q. Rehearse the Letter K?

A. KNowledge, righteousness, and true holiness are the chief things wherein
the image of God does consist.

For otherwise the word of God would not call upon us to renew this image in
Christ: and without these graces man had not been fit to rule the creatures
nor yet himself.

Q. Prove that the image of God does consist in knowledge?

The image of God consists in knowledge
A. The Apostle notes so much Col. 3.9.10. where speaking of the Christians
renewed estate i^ Christ, he says, Ye have put of the old man with his deeds;
and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge, after the Image of
him that created him.

Q. Prove that it does also consist in righteousness and true holiness?

Also in righteousness and holiness.
A. That the image of God in man does not only consist in knowledge, but also
in justice and in sanctity or holiness, may appear by that of Saint Paul to
the Ephesians, 4.24. Put on the new man, which after God is created in
righteousness and true holiness.

Q. How is man said to be thus made in the image of God?

A. Man is said to be thus made in the image of God,
Not in substance, bu^ in s^mblance.
not that he is the very stamp and representation of the Deity; for the
infinite and invisible God cannot be resembled in the person of a sinite
creature: but in respect of some kind of similitude or likeness^; therefore
when God said, Genesis 1 ^6,
Let us make man in our image, it is added, after or according to our
likeness: the later words expounding the former. For this is the peculiar
privilege of Christ Jesus the eternal son of God, who alone is so called, 2
Cor 4.4. The image of God. And Col. 1.15. The image of the invisible God. And
Heb. 1.3. The brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person:
because he is one and the same God eternal with his father.


Q. Does the image of God consist only in knowledge, righteousness, and
holiness?

Knowledge, righteousness, and holiness are not the only image of God. But in
the whole man, sovereignty.
A. Knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness are the chief, but not the
only image or resemblance of God in man: for in that God made man ruler over
all creatures in earth, man does therein represent the soueraignety of God, who
is Lord of all things. Again, besides those gifts of true knowledge,
righteousness, and holiness, God gave unto man diverse excellent
representations of the deity both in his soul and body.


Q. What other resemblances of God are there in the soul of man?

In the soul wisdom.
A. In the soul of man (besides those heavenly graces of divine knowledge,
righteousness, and holiness) God gave man excellent wisdom, and
understanding, whereby he did know the nature and property of all things: as
may appear in that Adam was able to give to every creature a name according to
the nature of it. Genesis 2.19. where it is said, That God brought them unto Adam,
to see what he would call them: and whatsouer Adam called every living
creature, that was the name thereof.

Q.
Is there any resemblance of God in the substance of man's soul?

A. The very essence and substance of man's soul does in some respects bear
the image or likeness of God: In the very substance of the soul inuisibility,
immortality.
as namely, in that the soul of man is a spiritual nature, invisible and
immortal. Again the soul, being only one, is endned with diverse properties,
as understanding, S. Augustine: Unity and Trinity.
memory, will: which after a sort* do shadow out and resemble the unity of the
Godhead and the trinity of persons.

Q. Is there any part of the image of God, in the body of man?


A. The whole man both soul and body, In the body Gods image shines.
was made in the image of God: as may appear by these evidences. First, God
says, Gen: 1.26. Let us make man (not the soul only, or the body only) in
our image. Secondly, sin being the contrary to Gods image, is seated not
only in the soul but also in the body. Romans 6.12. Thirdly, the renewing of
Gods image, which is our sanctification, is as well in the body as in the
soul, see Romans 12.1. 1 These. 5.23. Fourthly, God forbidding murder, does use
this reason, Genesis 9.6. For in the image of God has he made man.

Q. How is the image of God in the body of man?


Not in the shape or parts, but otherwise.
A. The image of God is not said to be in the body as it is a body, or in
respect of the shape, and parts, or limbs* for God is an infinite spirit,
incorporaell, and invisible; but in these respects. 1. As the body united to
the soul, in which the image of God, does chiefly consist, d^^h constitute
the whole man. 2. As the body like a microcosme or little world does express
in every part, the wonderful work of the Creator. 3. As those excellent
graces of wisdom, sanctity, and justice principally seated in the soul, do
express themselves in the body, and ( as Solomon speaks) Make the face to
shine: according as we see the light of a candle shine through the lantern.

Q. Prove that the word of God does call upon us to renew this image in Christ.

A. That the word of does call upon us to renew this image of God, The word of
God calls on us to renew it.
consisting in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, and so consequently
proving that herein the image of God does chiefly stand, see Ephesians.
4.22.23.24. where the Apostle says by way of exhortation, That ye put off
concerning the former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt, according to
the deceitful lusts. And be renewed in the spirit of your mind. And that ye
put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true
holiness.

Q. Prove that without these graces man was not fit to rule the creatures, nor
yet himself?

Without it man not fit to rule.
A. It is evident, in that man having lost these graces, is said to become like
the very brute beast, as it is Psalm. 49.20. Man that is in honor, and
understands not, is like the beasts that perish.

L Of the fall of man and loss of Gods image, by reason of Adams sin.
Q. Rehearse the letter L?

A. Learn, that man has lost that image of God wherein he was created, by
the sin of Adam the first man, in eating the forbidden fruit.

For Adam having power not to sin if he would, being seduced by the woman,
and the woman by the serpent which is the Devil, did willingly yield to the
temptation.

Q. Show how and in what respect man has lost the image of God?

Image of God how far ^ost.
A. Man has lost the image of God, not in respect of the substance of soul and
body, which do yet remain the same, 2 Cor. 11.7
which essentially they were in their first creation: nor in regard of the
faculties of reason; will and affection, without which we were not men, but
brute creatures.

But the image of God which man has chiefly lost, is that conformi^y to the
will of God, consisting in the true knowle^ge of God, in righteousness and
holiness.

Q. Prove that this heavenly knowledge, righteousness and holiness is the
image which man has lost?

O^^ly in respect of knowledge, righteousness and holiness.
A. It is manifest, by that exhortation of the Apostle, Ephesians. 4.24. where we
are exhorted to renew that image wherein man was created after God in
righteousness and true holiness. Which exhortation were needless, if man had
not lost this image: and if this were not the image of God, which man has lost.

Q. Prove that this image of God was lost by Adams sin?

A. It is evident in that the Scripture speaking of Adam, And that by Adams
sin.
says, Romans 5.12. That by one man sin entered into the world. And verse 18.
By the offense of one, the fault came on all men to condemnation. And verse 19.
By one man's disobedience many were made sinners.

Q. Prove that it was by eating the forbidden fruit.

A. It is apparent in the history: In eating the forbidden fruit.
partly by the charge, which God gave unto Adam, Gen: 2.16.17. The Lord God
commanded the man saying, Thou shall eat freely of every tree of the garden.
But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shall not eat of it.
Partly by the threatening, in the words immediately following, For in the day
that thou eatest thereof thou shall die the death. Partly by the sentence of
curse denounced against man after he had sinned, Genesis 3.17.

Q. Prove that Adam had power not to sin if he would?

Having power not to sin.
A. It is manifest in that God made man so excellent a creature. Whereupon it is
said, Eccles. 7.29. That God made man righteous and vp^^ght. Neither could it
have ^ood with the justice of God, to require that of man which he was not able
to perform, or to punish him, having by his creation no power to obey.

Q. Prove that Adam was seduced by the woman?

Was seduced by the woman.
A. It is so written, Genesis 3.6. That the woman gave also unto her husband with
her, and he did eat. It was Adams excuse, verse 12. The woman which thou gave
to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. And it is alleged to
humble that sex, 1 Timothy 2.14. That Adam was not deceived, but the woman being
deceived, was in the transgression.

Q. Prove that the woman was deceived by the Serpent.

A. It is said by the Apostle, She by the Serpent.
2 Cor. 11.3. That the Serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty. And the story
Genesis 3.1. does show the manner how it was done.

Q. Prove that, that Serpent was the Devil?

A. That the Serpent was the Devil, That Serpent was the Devil.
or rather the Devil in the Serpent, see Reu. 12.9. where it is said, That the
great Dragon was cast out, that old Serpent, called the Devil and Satan, which
deceives the whole world, And Chap. 20.2. The Dragon, that old Serpent, which
is the Devil and Satan.

Q. Prove that Adam did willingly yield to the temptation?

Man did willingly yeed.
A. The history does show it, by expressing Adams own confession and excuse,
before cited. And Eccles. 7.29. where it is said, That God has made man
upright, it is presently added, but they have sought out many inventions.

M Of the miserable estate of all mankind through Adams fall.
Q. Rehearse the Letter M.

A. Mankind being tainted by Adams sin, is become most wretched and
miserable, both in respect of sin and punishment.

For hereby all men are conceived and borne in sin, and are so corrupted with
sin both in soul and body, that they cannot perceive, think, will, speak
or do any good thing: but are become subject to sin, Satan, the wrath and
curse of God, to death, and to eternal damnation.

Q. Prove that all mankind is tainted by Adams sin?

A. It is manifest that the tainture of Adams sin has seized upon all his
posterity, All tainted by Adams fall.
inasmuch as all mankind does stand guilty thereof before God, see To. 5.12.
where the Apostle says, That by one man's sin, death passed upon all men, for
that all have sinned, or in whom all have sinned. Again verse 17. by one man's
offense, death reigned by one. verse 18. By the offense of one, judgment came
upon all men to condemnation. For verse 19, By one man's disobedience many were
made sinners.

Q. What is the reason of this guiltiness?

As guilty of his sin.
A. The reason why all men are guilty of Adams sin, is because Adam being as
it were the root, out of which all mankind does spring, did receive whatsoever
good he had by creation, not only for himself, but also for his posterity,
and so again lost all, as well for them, as for himself. In regard whereof,
all men are truly said to sin in Adam, as Leui is said to have paid tithes
in Abraham, because being of the posterity of Abraham, he was then in the
loins of Abraham his father. Heb. 7.9.10.

Q. Prove that mankind is becom^ most wretched and miserable?

A. The wretched and miserable estate of all mankind, Are become most
miserable.
may appear by that lamentable outcry of the Apostle, Romans 7.24. O wretched
man that I am: who shall deliver me from the body of this death?

Q. Prove that all men are conceived and borne in sin?

A. It is evident by the confession of David, Conceived and borne in sin.
Psalm. 51.5. Behold, I was borne in iniquity, and in sin has my mother
conceived me. And it is said, Ioh. 3.6. That which is borne of the flesh is
flesh: and that which is borne of the spirit is spirit.

Q. How then could Christ be free from sin, seeing he was true man? Christ
only excepted.


A. Christ Jesus was true man, descended of Adam as we are, Luke 3.23.38. Heb.
in all things like unto us, but yet sin excepted. For he was not a m^ere man,
but was also God, and again as he was man, he was not so by natural
generation, as we are, but by the supernatural work and power of the holy.
Ghost was conceived in the womb of the virgin Mary. Luk 1.34.35. Mat. 1.20.


Q. Prove that all men are corrupted with sin?

All corupted with sin.
A. It is written, Romans 3.9. That all both Jews and Gentiles are under sin. 1
Kings 8.46. There is no man that sins not. And 1 Ioh. 1.8. If we say we have
no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us. And this
corruption of sin is not by example or by imitation only, or merely of some
evil custom, but by propagation and natural generation, all men being
conceived and borne in sin, as is showed before.

Q. Prove that all are corrupted both in soul and body?

A. It is evident by the Apostles prayer, Both in soul and body.
1 These. 5.23. The very God of peace sanctify you throughout: and I pray God
that your whole spirit and soul and body may be kept blameless unto the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. For, what need he to pray for the
sanctification of the whole man both soul and body, if all and every part were
not corrupted?

Q. Prove that man by nature cannot perceive any good thing?

A. The Apostle does expressly avouch so much in 1 Cor. 2.14. Cannot perceive
any good thing.
That the natural man perceives not the things of the spirit of God: for they
are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are
spiritually discerned. And 2 Cor. 4.4. he says, That the God of this world
has blinded the minds of the infidels, that the light of the glorious Gospel
of Christ, which is the image of God, should not shine unto them.

Q. Prove that man by nature cannot think a good thought? Nor think a good
thought.


A. It is written, Genesis 6.5. God saw that the wickedness of man was great in
the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only
evil continually. Therefore the Apostle takes it for granted, 2 Cor. 3.5.
That we are not sufficient of our selves to think any thing as of our selves:
but our sufficiency is of God.

Q. Prove that man cannot will, desire, or effect any good thing by nature?

Nor will any good thing.
A. It is manifest, in that it is said, Romans 8.7. That the wisdom of the flesh
is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither in deed
can be. Whereupon it is inferred, verse 8. So then they that are in the flesh
cannot please God. Therefore it is that the Apostle says, Phil. 2.13. It is
God which works in you, both to will and to do of his good pleasure.

Q. Prove that man cannot by nature speak any good thing?

A. Saint Paul notes so much speaking of all men in the corruption of nature,
Nor speak any good.
Romans 3.13.14. Their throat, says he, is an open sepulcher, with their tongues
they have used deceit, the poison of Aspes is under their lips. Whose mouth is
full of cursing and bitterness.

Q. Prove that man cannot do any good thing by nature?

A. It is evident by that which we read in Psalm. 14.1.2.3. where it is said,
Nor do any good.
They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that does
good. The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if
there were any that did understand and seek God. They are all gone aside, they
are altogether become filthy: there is none that does good, no not one. Which
tex^ the Apostle cites, Romans 3.10. to prove that all men are under sin.

Q. Prove that hereupon all men are subject to sin?

But is subject to sin as a slave.
A. That all men are subject i^ sin, as very servants, or slaves, is plainly
proved by the Apostle* Romans 6.16.17. Know ye not that to whom ye yield your
selves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey: whether of sin
unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? But God be thanked that ye
were the servants (...) sin: but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of
doctrine which was delivered you. And our Savior says, Ioh, 8.34. Whosoever
commits sin, is the servant of sin. For as it is in 2 Pet. 2.19. Of
whosoever a man is overcome, even unto the same is he in b^ndage.

Q. Prove that man is, by nature co^rupted, become subject to Satan?

A. It is evident in that Satan is called, Als^ to S^tan.
Ephesians. 2.2. The spirit that work th^in the children o^ disobedience. And 2 Timothy 2 26. it is said, That they may recover themselves out of the snare of the
Devil, Who are taken captive by him at his will. Again, 2 Cor. 4.4. he is
called, The God of this world, that has blinded the minds of them which
believe not.

Q. Prove that man is by nature subject to the wrath of God?

A. The Apostle says, To the wrath of God.
Ephesians. 2.3. That we all were by nature the children of wrath, as well as
others. And Ioh. 3.36. it is said, That he that believes not the Son, shall
not see life: but the wrath of God abides on him.

Q. Prove that man is by sin subject to the curse of God?

To the curse of God in (...) whole life.
A The curse was pronounced upon Adams first sin, Genesis 3.17. It was repeated
against the breach of the Law of God, Deuteronomy. 28.15. Mal. 2.2. And is noted by
the Apostle, Gal. 3.10. Cursed is every one that continues not in all things
which are written in the book of the Law to do them. Under this burden of the
curse upon man for sin, every creature is said to groan. Romans 8.22.

Q. Prove that all men are subject to death, by reason of sin?

To death.
A. So says the Apostle, Romans 5.12. By one man sin entered into the world, and
death by sin: and so death passed upon all men, for that all men have sinned.
And Romans 6.23. The wages of sin is death.

Q. Prove that all men are subject to eternal damnation for sin?

A. It is manifest by that which is said, To eternal damnation.
2 These. 1.8.9. That they that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of
our Lord Jesus Christ shall be punished with everlasting destruction, from the
presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power. And 2 These. 2.12. That
all they might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in
unrighteousness.

N Of man his deliverance by Christonely.
Q. Rehearse the letter N?

A. NO means can free us from that damnable estate, but only Jesus Christ,
the eternal son of God.

For he being both God and man, has perfectly saved us: in that he took our
nature upon him, being conceived by the holy Ghost, borne of the Virgin Mary:
lived in perfect obedience, to God: suffered the cursed death of the Cross:
rose again the third day: ascended into heaven: sits at the right hand of
God: and all for us.

Q. Prove that we are saved only by Jesus Christ?

A. So we read, Man saved only by Christ.
Acts 4.12. Neither is there salvation i^ any other: for among men there is
given none other name under heaven, whereby we must be saved. And Ma^th. 1.21.
the Angel says, Thou shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people
from their sins.

Q. Prove that Jesus Christ is the eternal son^e of G^d?

A. It is written, He is the Son of God.
Ioh. 3.16. G^d so loved the world, that he gave his only b^gotten son^e, that
who^^euer believes on him, should not perish, but have e^erlasting life. A^^ 1
Ioh. 5.20. We know that the Son of God is come, etc. that is the true God and
eternal life. And Romans 1.4. That he was declared mightily to be the Son of
God.

Q. Prove that Jesus Christ is both God and man?

He is both God and man.
A. That he is God is manifest Isa. 9.6. where he is called The mighty God. And
Romans 9.5. God over all, blessed for ever. And it is said, Ioh 1.1. In the
beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God.

That he is also mvn, is proved, 1 Timothy 2.5. where he is called, The man
Christ Jesus. And 3.16. God manifested in the flesh. And Ioh. 1.14. The word
was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw the glory thereof, as the glory
of the only begotten son of the father full of grace and truth.

Q. Prove that Christ has perfectly saved us?

A. So it is expressly written, He has perfectly saved us.
Heb. 7.25. That he is able perfectly to save them that come unto God by him.
And Heb. 10.14. That by one offering he has perfected for ever them that are
sanctified: And thereupon is inferred verse, 18. That where remission of sins
is, there is no more sacrifice for sin.

Q. Prove that Jesus Christ therefore took our nature upon him.

A. That he did assume or take unto his Godhead the nature of man, By taking
our nature
is evident, Heb. 2.16.17. For verily, says the Apostle, he took not on him
the nature of Angels, but he took on him the seed of Abraham. Wherefore in all
things it behooued him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a
merciful and faithful high Priest in things pertaining to God, to make
reconciliation for the sins of the people.

Q. Was it of necessity that Christ should become man?

Which was of necessity.
A. It was by Gods decree necessary that Christ should take unto his deity the
nature of man, that without it man's redemption could not be procured, for these
reasons. 1. He must be man, that he might be fit to suffer death for us, in
regard that his Godhead being immutable, could not suffer, and being immortal
could not die. 2. Heb. 2.14.
It was requisite that the same nature that had offended should satisfy the
justice of God. 3. He must also be God, that he might be able to overcome.
See all this in that one text, Heb. 2.14.

Q. Prove that Jesus Christ was conceived by the holy Ghost.

He was conceived by the holy Ghost.
A. It is the voice of the Angel to Mary, Luke 1.35. The holy Ghost shall come
upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall ouershadow thee: therefore also
that holy thing which shall be borne of thee, shall be called the son of
God. And to Joseph he said, Matthew. 1.20. Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy
wise, for that which is conceived in her, is of the holy Ghost.

Q. Prove that he was borne of the virgin Mary?

A. It was so prophesied, Borne of the virgin.
Isa. 7.14* Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a s^nne and shall call his
name Emmanuel. It was effected* Math 1.^8. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on
this wise; When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph (before they came
together) she was found with child of the holy Ghost. And it was proclaimed by
the Angel, Ioh. 2.11. Unto you is borne this day in the city of David a
Savior, which is Christ the Lord.

Q. Prove that Christ lived in perfect obedience to God.

Lived in perfect obedience.
A. It is written, Phil. 2.8. That he humbled himself and became obedient unto
the death, even unto the death of the cross. Heb. 7.26. For such an high
Priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners,
and made higher then the heavens. For, says the Apostle, Romans 5.19. as by one
man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many
be made righteous. Therefore Christ says, Ioh. 17.19. For their sakes
sanctify I my self, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.

Q. Prove that Christ did suffer for us?

He suffered.
A. It is written, Isa. 53.5. He was wounded for our transgressions, he was
bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and
with his stripes we are healed.

Q. Prove that he suffered death for us?

A. It is written, He died.
1 Pet. 3.18. For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the
unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but
quickened by the spirit.

Q. Prove that he suffered the cursed death of the cross?

A. So it is in the story of his passion, On the cross.
Matthew. 27.38. And it is said, 1 Pet. 2.24. That he his own self bare our
sins in his own body on the tree, that we being dead to sins, should live
unto righteousness, And Gal. 3.13. Christ has redeemed us from the curse of
the Law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that
hangs on tree.

Q. Prove that he did rise again the third day for us?

He rose again.
A. It is written, Romans 4.25. Who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised
again for our justification. And 1 Cor. 15.3.4. That Christ died for our
sins, and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day,
according to the Scriptures.

Q. Prove that he ascended into heaven for us?

He ascended into heaven.
A. It was so prophesied, Psalm. 68.18. Thou have ascended on high: thou have led
captivity captive: thou have received gifts for men. And it was performed, Luke
24.51. And it came to pass while he blessed them, he was parted from them,
and carried up into heaven.

Q. Prove that Christ sits at the right hand of God for us? He sits (...)


A. It is written, Col. 3.1. If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those
things which are above, where Christ sits at the right hand of God. And Romans
8.34. it is said, That Christ is at the right hand of God, and makes
intercession for us. And Acts 3.21. Whom the heavens must receive, until the
time of restitution of all things.

O Of our receiving Christ, with all his benefits, to salvation, by faith only.
Q. Rehearse the Letter O?

A. ONly by faith, receiving Jesus Christ into the heart, every man that with
contrite heart confesses his sins to God, and truly repents, is pardoned
all his sins, and so does stand justified before God.

For we can merit nothing with God, our best works being imperfect. And the
promise of God is only made to them that believe: being elected of God before
the world was.

Q. How, and in what sense are we said to be justified by faith?

How we are justified by faith.
A. We are said to be justified by says, not for the dignity and merit of it:
not as it is an inward and inherent quality or virtue: not because it has
charity adjoined unto it, and works by love: nor because it receives any
force or power from charity to justify* but because, by faith, as by a hand or
instrument we receive Christ, by whom we are justified.

Q. Prove that we are justified only by faith?

A. That we are justified by faith only, That we are justified by faith only.
may appear by these evidences following, whereof the first is, Instance.
In that justification and acceptance of a man with God unto eternal life, is
positiuely and absolutely ascribed in Scripture unto faith. This is the very
argument of the Apostle, alleged to the same purpose out of the Prophet
Habakuk, 2.4. The just shall live by faith. And he expresses it in his own
person, as an instance of the state of every good Christian, Gal. 2.20. I live,
says he, by the says of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for
me.

Q. What is the second instance, that we are justified by faith only?

Instance
A. Secondly, the Scriptures do expressly exclude all works in us, touching the
point of justification, by manifest exclusive notes or terms; being
equivalent with the exclusive particle only, or alone. As for example. Gal.
2.16. Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law, but by the
faith of Jesus Christ. And Romans 3.28. Therefore we conclude, that a man is
justified by faith, without the deeds of the Law. And verse 24. Being justified
freely by his grace.

Q. What is the third instance of justification by faith only?

Instance
A. Thirdly, there is a manifest opposition noted in Scripture between grace
and works: so that if justification be freely by grace, then it cannot be of
works at all. See Romans 11.6. If by grace, then it is no more of works:
otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more
grace: otherwise work is no more work. And Romans 4.4. To him that works is
the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that works not, but
believes on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for
righteousness.

Q. What is the fourth instance of justification by faith only?

A. Fourthly, Instance
They that sought righteousness not by faith only, but by the works of the
Law, are said, for that very cause not to have attained righteousness. See
Romans 9.31.32. But Israel which followed after the law of righteousness, has
not attained to the law of righteousness. Wherefore? because they sought it
not by faith, but as it is were by the works of the Law. And Chap. 10.3. For
they being ignorant of Gods righteousness, and going about to establish their
own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of
God. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness, to every one that
believes. Therefore Paul though he was blameless before men, touching the
righteousness which is in the law, yet he counted all but dung, that he might
be found in Christ by faith. Phil. 3.6.9.

Q. What is the fifth instance of justification by faith only?

Instance
A. Fifthly, The brazen Serpent was a type of Christ, now as when the Israelites
were stung by the fiery serpents, Leu. 21.9.
they were preserved alive only by looking upon the Serpent of brass: so when
we are ^^^eng to death by sin, there is nothing required of us for the cure
of our souls, but only that we fix the eye of our faith upon Christ. See
this very proportion observed by Christ himself, Ioh. 3.14.15. As Moses lift
up the Serpent in the wilderness, so must the son of man be lifted up, that
whosoever believes in him, should not perish, but have eternal life.

Q. What is the sixth instance of justification by faith only?

A. Sixthly, Instance
there are many graces accompanying salvation in a Christian soul, as faith,
hope, charity, wisdom, patience, humility, the fear of God, repentance, and
the like; and every grace has some excellent use: but of all these, none is
sit as a spiritual hand to receive and apply Christ and his righteousness to
the justification of a sinner, but faith only.

Q. In what sense then are we said to be justified by faith only?

A. Not that faith is solitary or alone, How we are justified by faith only.
without other graces: for it is said, Gal. 5.6. to work by love. And 1 Timothy
1.5. That charity does proceed out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience,
and of faith unfeigned, as the fountain of all other graces. But as the eye is
not alone, but there are with it many other members and parts of the body, and
yet the faculty of seeing is only in the eye: so faith, though it be not
alone, yet it only has power to apprehend Christ to justification.

Q. Prove that by faith we receive Jesus Christ into the heart?

By faith we receive Christ.
A. That by faith we receive Jesus Christ, may be gathered out of those words
of the Evangelist, Ioh. 1.11.12. He came unto his own, and his own received
him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
sons of God, even to them that believe on his name Where we see that to
receive Christ and to believe in him is all one. Again, that we receive Christ
into the heart or soul, as the fittest receptacle, is evident by the Apostles
prayer, Ephesians. 3.16.17. That ye may, says he, be strengthened by his spirit
in the in ward man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.

Q. Prove that a contrite heart is required?

A. It is written, A contrite heart is requisite.
Psalm. 51 17. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a
contrite heart O God thou will not despise. And Joel 2.13. Rend your heart, and
not your garments and turn to the Lord your God.

Q. Prove that confession of sins to God is required?

A. There is an absolute necessity of confessing our sins to God, So is
confession to God.
if ever we will obtain pardon: Therefore it is conditioned, 1 Ioh. 1.9. That
if we confess our sins, he is faithful, and just to forgive us our sins*
And we may see the experience of it, Psalm. 32.5. I said I will confess my
transgressions unto the Lord, and thou forgauest the iniquity of my sin. As
for confession to man it is only respective or conditional, as namely, in
case of wrong done by one man to another see Iam. 5.16. confess your faults
one to another, and pray one for another: or in regard of some public hurt or
scandal to the whole Church, as in the example of Achan, Josh. 7.19.20. and
the like.

Q. Prove that true repentance is required?

Specially true conversion.
A. True R^pentance, which is not only a contrition or sorrow for sin, and a
confession of it, but also a conversion of the whole man, with the whole heart,
unto God, from all his sins, is specially necessary for the obtaining of
pardon; this is intended in Math. 3.2. Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at
hand, and Luke 13.3. Except ye amend your lives, ye shall all likewise perish,
and Act. 11.18. It is said, that they glorified God, saying, then has God also
to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.

Q. Prove that our justification consists in the pardon of sins?

A. It is so written, Justification is in the pardon of sins.
Romans 4 6.7. Even as David declares the blessedness of the man, unto whom God
imputes righteousness without works: saying, Blessed are they, whose
iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to
whom the Lord imputes not sin.

Q. Prove that we can merit nothing with God?

A. The Apostle proves it, We can merit nothing with God.
by the example of the father of the faithful, Romans 4.2. If Abraham were
justified by works, he has wherein to rejoice, but not with God: for what
says the Scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for
righteousness, Psalm. 130.3. If thou Lord should mark iniquities, O Lord,
who shall stand? and Psalm. 143.2. Enter not into judgment with thy servant,
for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.

Q. Prove that our best works are imperfect?

Our best works are imperfect.
A. It is the confession of the Prophet, Isa. 64.6. But we are all as an
unclean thing, and all our righteousness are as filthy rags, and Luke 17.10.
When ye have done all those things which are commanded you, say, we are
unprofitable servants.

Q. Prou^ that the promise is made only to them that believe?

The promise is only to believers.
A. It is written, Gal. 3.22. that the Scripture has concluded all under sin,
that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that
believe, and Act. 2.39. for the promise is unto you, and to your children, and
to all that are a far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call.

Q. Prove that they were elected of God, before the world was?

A. That the ground of our justification, Elected before the world was.
and salvation by Christ through faith, does stand in Gods free election, and
therefore cannot be attained by any merit of our own, is manifest, Act. 13.48.
where it is said, that as many as were ordained to eternal life, believed. And
Ephesians. 1.3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has
blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly things in Christ,
according as he has chosen us in him, before the foundation of the world.

P Of the preaching of the word, the ordinary means of faith.
Q. Rehearse the letter P?

A PReaching of the word of God is the ordinary means to work repentance and
faith.

For God that gives all grace, and so repentance and faith, works outwardly
by the word, as by an instrument, and inwardly by his spirit.

Q. Prove that Preaching of the Word is the ordinary means to work
repentance? Preaching the means of repentance.


A. It is evident, in that repentance was the subject matter of Christ's
Preaching, Matthew. 4.17. Jesus began to Preach, and to say, Repent, for the
kingdom of heaven is at hand, and in that S. Paul says, Act. 17.30. speaking
of the preaching of the Gospel, that God now commands all men every where to
repent; and Act. 20.20. I kept back nothing that was profitable, but have
showed you and taught you publicly, and from house to house, both to the
Jews, and also to the Gentiles, the repentance toward God, and faith toward
our Lord Jesus Christ,

Q. Prove that Preaching of the Word is the means of says?

A. So we read, Preaching the means of faith.
Romans 10.14. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
and how shall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? and how shall
they hear without a Preacher, and verse 17. so then faith comes by hearing,
and hearing by the word of God,

Q. Prove that God gives all grace?

God the giver of all grace.
A. It is written, Iam. 1.17. Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from
above, and comes down from the father of lights. And 2 Pet. 1.3. according
as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain to life and
godliness, through the knowledge of him, that has called us to glory and
virtue.

Q. Prove that God gives repentance?

The giver of repentance.
A. We may learn so much by S. Paul his exhortation to Timothy, 2 Timothy 2.25.
where he advises him, to instruct with meekness, those that oppose
themselves, proving if God at any time will give them repentance, that they may
know the truth. And it is said, Act. 5.31. that God has lift up Jesus Christ
with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to
Israel, and forgiveness of sins.

Q. Prove that God gives faith?

A. It is expressly affirmed, The giver of faith.
Ephesians. 2.8. For by grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of your
selves, it is the gift of God. And Phil. 1.29. For unto you it is given for
Christ, that not only you should believe in him, but also suffer for his sake.

Q. Prove that God works by the Word, as by an instrument.

A. That the word of God is the outward means, God works by the Word.
which God does use as an organe or instrument, is manifest, Iam. 1.18. Of his
own will begat he us, with the word of truth, that we should be as the first
fruits of his creatures. And 1 Pet. 1.23. Being borne anew not of mortal seed,
but of immortal by the word of God; and verse 25. This is the word which is
preached among you.

Q. Prove that God works inwardly by his spirit.

God works by his spirit.
A. It is evident by these arguments. First, it was so prophesied and foretold,
Joel 2.28. And it shall come to pass afterward, Argument.
that I will power out my spirit upon all flesh, and Zach. 12.10. I will power
upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of
grace and of supplication, and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced.

Q. What is the second argument to prove that God works inwardly by his
spirit?

Argument.
A. Secondly, The prophecy was accomplished and effected accordingly, as the
Apostle Peter notes, Acts 2.16. This, says he, is that which was spoken by
the Prophet Joel. And at his Sermon, Acts 10.44. It is said, That while Peter
yet spoke these words, the holy Ghost fell on them all which heard the word.

Q. What is the third argument to prove that God works inwardly by his spirit?

A. Thirdly, Argument.
it is evident that all spiritual gifts are wrought by the spirit, as it is in
1 Cor. 12.11. All these, says the Apostle, works that one and the self same
spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will. Insomuch as the outward
means without this inward work of Gods spirit is of no force. Whereupon it is
that Paul says, 1 Cor 3.6.7. I have planted, Apollo watered, but God gave the
increase. So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that
waters: but God that gives the increase.

Q. What is the fourth argument to prove that God works inwardly by his
spirit?

Argument.
A. Fourthly, God acknowledges none for his, that have not his spirit working
in them. See 1 Cor. 3.16. Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that
the spirit of God dwells in you. And Romans 8.9. If any man have not the spirit
of Christ, he is none of his. This is so evident a truth, that the Apostle
doubts not to affirm, that no man can so much as say that Jesus is the Lord,
but by the holy Ghost. 1 Cor. 12.3.

Q Of the inseparable properties of faith.
Q. Rehearse the letter Q?

A. QValities of faith inseparable unto it, are these: to unite us to God in
Christ: to assure us of Gods love in him: to purify the heart: and to work by
love.

For until we believe, we are without God, without Christ, and without hope:
but when once we believe, we have peace with God: and cannot but be fruitful
in all good works.

Q. Prove that it is the property of faith, to unite us to God in Christ?

Properties of faith.
A. This quality or property of faith, namely to unite us unto God in Christ, To
unite us to God.
is expressly noted by the Apostle, Ephesians. 2.13. But now in Christ Jesus, ye who
sometimes were far off, are made nigh by the bl^od of Christ. And verse 19.
Now therefore ye are no more strangers, and forreiners, but fellow Citizens
with the Saints, and of the household of God.

Q. Prove that it is the quality of faith to assure us of Gods love in Christ?

To assure us of Gods love
A. It is manifest in that it is said, Romans 5.2. That by Christ we have access
by faith into the grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of
God. And verse 5. Hope makes not ashamed, because the love of God is shed
abroad in our hearts, by the holy Ghost which is given unto us. Therefore faith
is thus described, Heb* 11.1. Faith is the substance, or ground, and assurance
of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen.

Q. Show it yet more fully and plainly?

A. It may appear more fully and evidently by that confident acclamation,
Showed more plainly.
and protestation of the Apos^le in the behalf of every Christian, Romans 8.35.
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? and verse 38.39. For I am
persuaded, that neither death nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor
powers, nor things present, nor things to com^, nor height, nor depth, nor any
other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in
Christ Jesus our Lord.

Q. Prove that it is the property of faith to purify the heart?

To purify the heart.
A. The Apostle Peter, speaking of the calling of the Gentiles, says, Act.
15.8.9. That God which knows the hearts, bear them witness, giving them the
holy Ghost, even as he did unto us. And put no difference between us and them,
purifying their hearts by faith, and 1 Timothy 1.5. it is said, That the end of
the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and
of says unfeigned: where we see that uniting us to Christ, is the cause of the
purity of the heart.

Q. Prove that it is the property of faith to work by love!

A. It is observed as a special property o^ faith by the Apostle, To wo^^ by
^^ue.
Gal. 5.6. where having said, that we through the spirit, wait for the hope of
righteous^esse, by faith; h^e presently adds these words, for, says he, In
Jesus Christ, neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but
faith which works by love, therein noting faith to be the proper efficient
cause of love, and love to be the proper effect of faith.

Q. Prove that till we believe, we are without God, without Christ, without
hope?

A We may see the truth of this by the Apostles description of the state of the
Ephesians before their conversion, Till we believe, we are without God,
Christ, hope.
Ephesians. 2.12. At that time, says he^ ye were without Christ, being aliens from
the Commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having
no hope, and without God in the world

Q. Prove that when once we believe, we have peace with God?

A. It is so written, But once believing, we have peace.
Romans 5.1. that being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our
Lord Jesus Christ, and chap. 8.1. There is therefore now no condemnation to
them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the
spirit.

Q. Prove that once believing, we cannot but be fruitful in all good works.

Believers are fruitful.
A. That when once we believe, we cannot but be fruitful, our Savior himself
teaches by the similitude of the Vine, whereunto he does resemble himself,
and the believers, that are in him by faith, to the branches, Ioh. 15.5. I am
the Vine, ye are the branches. He that abides in me, and I in him, the same
^ringeth forth (...) without me ye (...) thing, and the Apo(...) 2.14. That
Christ (...)se for us, that he (...) from all ini(...)rifie unto himself
(...)ople, zealous of (...).

R Of the means of increasing faith and all other graces.
Q. Rehearse the Letter R.

A. REmember that says, and so all other graces are increased and confirmed by
the hearing of the word of God preached, as also by reading, meditation,
conference, practice, prayer, and Sacraments.

For as God requires of every Christian a daily increase of grace, so he has
appointed these means to that end.

Q* Prove in general, that says and all other graces are increased and
confirmed by these means?

Faith and all other graces how increased.
A. So much may be gathered in general by the words of the E^angelist, Act.
2.41.42. where speaking of those that were converted to the faith, he says,
Then they that gladly received his word, were baptized, and they continued in
the Apostles doctrine, and fellowship, and breaking of bread and prayers;
noting thereby how being converted, they did continue, and were increased and
confirmed in the state of grace by those means.

Q. More particularly prove that Preaching is a means to increase and confirm
grace?

Particularly, 1 By preaching.
A. It is manifest, in that the Apostle Peter speaking of the word preached,
says, 1 Pet. 2.2. As newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word of
GOD, that ye may grow thereby; and Act. 14.21.2^. it is said, that Paul and
Barnabas returned, etc. confirming the Disciples hearts, and exhorting them to
continue in the faith, and 1 Cor. 14.3. He that prophecieth (that is,
preaches and expounds the word) speaks unto me^, ^o edification, and
exhortation, and comfort.

Q. Prove that reading is a means to increase and confirm faith, and all
other graces?

A. Therefore it is, By Reading.
that in 1 Timothy 4.13. Paul exhorts Timothy to give attendance to reading, as
well as to exhortation and to doctrine, and 2 Timothy 3.15. commends him, that
he had known the holy Scriptures of a child, which are able to make him wise
unto salvation, and Romans 15.4. he says, that whatsoever things were written
aforetime, were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort
of the Scriptures might have hope.

Q. Prove that meditation is a means to increase and confirm in us the saving
graces of God.

By meditation.
A. It is evident in the example of David, Psalm. 119.97. O how love I thy law!
It is my meditation all the day. And to show what increase and confirmation of
heavenly grace he received by this his religious exercise of meditation; he
adds immediately, verse 98. That it made him wiser then his enemies, verse
99. That he had more understanding then all his teachers, And verse 100. That
he did understand more then the ancients.

Q. Prove that conference is a means to increase and confirm grace?

By conference.
A. Thus the godly, meeting together, strengthened one another, Mal. 3.16. where
it is said, that, Then they that feared the Lord, spoke often one to another,
and the Lord harkened and heard it, and a Book of remembrance was written
before him, for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his Name. To
this end are those frequent exhortations in Scripture, as in 1 These. 5.11.
Comfort your selves together, and edify one another, even as also you do. And
Heb. 3.13. Heb. 10.23 24.25.
Exhort one another daily, while it is called To day, lest any of you be
hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.

Q. Prove that practice is a means to increase and confirm grace?

A. Therefore it is that David says, By practice.
Psalm. 119.100. I understand more then the ancients, because I kept thy
precepts: hereupon our Savior affirms, Ioh. 7.17. That if any man will do
his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God or no. Now we
know, that to be able to discern of doctrine, is a note of great increase and
strength of grace. Nay our Savior places the happiness of knowledge in
practice; see Ioh. 13.17. If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.

Q. Prove that prayer is a means to increase faith and all other graces?

By prayer.
A. Prayer is the Conduit pipe to convey Gods graces unto us, therefore Luke
17.5. The Apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith; and David prays,
Psalm. 119.18. Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy
law. And Paul, Col. 1.9. Ceased not to pray to God for them, that they might be
fulfilled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual
understanding, and increasing in the knowledge of God, strengthened with all
might, etc.

Q. Prove that the Sacr^ment are means to increase and confirm grace?

A. It is manifest in that they are called signs to signify, By Sacraments,
and seals to confirm: as circumcision is called, Romans 4.11. the sign of
circumcision, and the seal of the righteousness of faith. And 1 Pet. 3.21.
Baptism is called the figure that now saves us, because it signifies, and
seals or confirms our salvation by Christ.

Q. Prove that God require^h of every Christian a daily increase of grace?

A. It is written, God requires increase.
2 Pet. 3.18. Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ. And Heb. 5.12. They are reproved, that when as concerning the time,
they ought to be teachers, yet they had need again to be taught the first
principles of the word of God. And Chap. 6.1. they are exhorted to go on unto
perfection.

Q. Prove that God has appointed these means to that end: and first the
preaching of the word?

Means to that end appointed 1. Preaching.
A. It is evident that the ministry of the word was therefore ordained, Ephesians.
4.12. For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the ministry, for the
edifying of the body of Christ: Till we all come into the unity of the faith,
and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure
of the age of the fullness of Christ: That we henceforth, be no more
children, wavering and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the
sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive:
But following the truth in love, in all things grow up into him, which is the
head, even Christ.

Q. Prove that God has appointed reading to that end: and first public
reading?

A. God so commanded, Reading
Deuteronomy. 31 11. Public.
When all Isra^l come to appear before the Lord thy God, in the place which
he shall choose, thou shall read this Law before all Israel, in their hearing.
And verse 12. Gather the people together, men, women, and children, and the
stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may
learn, and fear the Lord your God, and observe to do all the words of this
Law.

Q. Prove that God appointed reading privately in the family?

A. It is written, Private.
Deuteronomy. 6.6.7. These words which I command thee this day, shall be in thine
heart, and thou shall rehearse them continually unto thy children, and shall
talk of them, when thou tarriest in thy house, and as thou walk by the way,
and when thou lie down, and when thou risest up.

Q. Prove that God appointed reading solitarily, every one by himself, first
in the old Testament?

Soli^arily.
A. It is manifest, Deuteronomy. 17.19. in that even the King himself is commanded to
read in the Law of God all the days of his life, In the old Testament.
that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, and to keep all the words of
this Law. And to Ioshuah, the like charge is given, Josh. 1.8. This book of
the Law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shall meditate therein day
and night, that thou may observe to do according to all that is written
therein: for then thou shall make thy way prosperous, and then thou shall have
good success.

Q. Prove that God appointed reading solitarily every one by himself, in the
new Testament?

A. It is the express c^mmandement of Christ, In the new Testament.
John 5.39. Se^rch the Scriptures, for in them ye think to have eternal
life, and they are they which testify of me* And Col. 3.16. Let the word of
God dwell in you richly, in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another,
etc. And Acts 17.11. The Bereans are commended, in that they received the word
with all readiness of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether those
things were so. And of the book of the Revelation, which is the hardest to be
understood of all the rest, it is said, Reu. 1.3. Blessed is he that reads,
and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which
are written therein.

Q. Prove that God appointed meditation to that end?

A. It is evident in that charge Meditation.
before mentioned, which the Lord gave unto Ioshuah, namely, that he should
meditate in the book of the Law day and night, Ios. 1.8. And it is prop^u^ded,
as the way to happiness, Psalm. 1. Blessed is the man that has not walked in
the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in
the seat of the scornful, but his delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in
his law does he meditate day and night.

Q. Prove that conference was appointed to that end?

Conference.
A. Therefore it is, that they are commanded, Deuteronomy 6.7. To talk of the word of
God, in the house, in the way, lying down, and rising up; and therefore the
Apostle having said, Heb. 10.23. Let us keep the profession of our hope
without wavering, adds immediately the means appointed of God to that end,
verse 24.25. And let us consider one another* to provoke unto love, and to good
works, not forsaking the assembling of our selves together, as the manner of
some is, but exhorting one another.

Q. Prove that practice is appointed to that end?

A. Therefore our Savior requires the condition of practice, Practice
of every man that will be able to judge of truth and error, and to withstand
seducers, see Ioh. 7.17. and the Apostle directs, Heb. 5.14. that through
long custom (which stands in experience and practice) men have their wits
exercised, to discern both good and ^uill, and the Lord himself says, Psalm.
50.23. To him that orders hi^ conversation aright, will I show the salvation
of God.

Q. Prove that God appointed prayer to that end?

A. It is included in the general Prayer.
promise, Math. 7.7. Ask, and it shall be given you, and verse 8, for
whosoever asks, receives. Again, ^ro. 2.3 4.5. If thou criest after
knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding: Then shall thou
understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.

Q. Prove that God appointed Sacraments to that end?

Sacraments.
A. That Sacraments were ordained for our confirmation, see Gen* 17.10.
concerning circumcision, which is therefore called the Covenant, because it did
sign, seal and confirm the covenant, as the Apostle notes, Romans 4.11. The
like is said of the Passover, Exodus 13.9. So unto us Christians. Baptism was
to that end ord^ined, Math. 28.19. and the Lords Supper, Luk 22.19.

S Of Sacraments in general.
Q. Rehearse the Letter S?

A. SAcraments are outward visible signs of the covenant and promise of God in
Christ, ordained by Christ himself; to signify, and to seal or confirm, and
(as instruments or means) to convey saving grace to every true believer, and
to be as badges or tokens of our Christian profession. And they are in number
only two, namely, Baptism and the Lords Supper.

For such helps our weak faith does require: and these only has Christ
ordained, and no more: being answerable to the two Sacraments under the Law,
that is, Circumcision and the Passover: and are alone in that kind sufficient
both for the beginning and continuing of saving grace.

Q. Prove that Sacraments are signs of the covenant?

Sacraments are signs of the covenant.
A. That Sacraments are signs of the covenant and promise of God, is manifest
in Circumcision, which is called the Covenant, because it was the sign of the
covenant; confer Genesis 17.10. with verse 11. This is my covenant, Genesis 17 7.
which ye shall keep between me and you, and thy seed after thee. Again,
see Act. 2.38. where the Apostle Peter exhorting them to be baptized in the
Name of Jesus Christ, alleges this reason, for, says he, the promise is made
to you and to your children, etc. Thereby intimating, that to whomsoever the
covenant does belong, to them belongs the sign and seal of the covenant,
which is baptism.

Q. Prove that the Sacraments are ordained by Christ?

A. The Lord God is the sole and only author of all Sacraments* God is the
only author of Sacraments.
for as it is only in his power, to make the covenant, and to confer grace:
so he only has authority to ordain and appoint the signs and seals of the
couenan^ of grace. Thus did he both enter the covenant with Abraham and his
seed for ever, Genesis 17.7. and also appoint the sign of Circumcision, verse
10.11. The like he did concerning the Passover. Exodus 12. and 13. In the same
manner, our Savior Christ being eternal God with his Father, did institute
Baptism, Matthew. 28 19. Go teach all nations, baptizing them, etc. And the
Lords Supper, Luke 22.19. Do this in remembrance of me. Whereupon Saint Paul
says, 1 Cor. 11.23. I have received of the Lord, that which I also have
delivered unto you.

Q. To what end or use were the Sacraments ordained?

A. The end or use of Sacraments is diverse: The end or use of Sacraments.
First, Sacraments are ordained to signify, show and represent unto us the
grace offered in the covenant, To signify.
In which respect they are called signs, because they are as it were tokens
and resemblances of Gods grace and favor toward us. So circumcision is called
the sign of circumcision, To. 4.11. and the sign of the covenant, Genesis 17.11.
Baptism is said to be the figure, that now saves us. Again of the
celebration of the Passover, the Lord says, Exodus 12.14. This day shall be
to you a remembrance. And of the Lords Supper, Christ says, Do this in
remembrance, Luke 22.19. And the Apostle 1 Cor. 11.26. Ye show the Lords death
till he come.

Q. What is the second end or use of Sacraments?

A. Secondly, To s^a^e or confirm.
Sacraments are appointed of God to seal or confirm the in^a^^ible certainty
of his covenant of grace in Christ made with his Church, that thereby the
faithful may more firmly believe, and rest upon it by faith: as civil
contracts are ratified, and made authenticke by their seals annexed. Therefore
it is, that the sign of circumcision is by the Ap^stle, Romans 4.11. c^ll^d, The
seal of the righteousness of faith.

Q. What is the third end or use of Sacraments?

A. Thirdly, To convey grace.
Sacraments are ordained to be as instruments or means to convey grace to
every true believer, which is evident for Baptism, in that Christ is said,
Ephesians. 5.26. to sanctify and cleanse his Church, with the washing of water, by
the word. And Tit. 3.5. God is said to save us by the washing of regeneration,
and renewing of the holy Ghost And for the Lords Supper, see 1 Cor. 10.16.
where the Apostle calls the cup of blessing, the communion of the blood of
Christ, and the bread, the communion of the body of Christ, because in the
right use of these outward elements, the faith full do communicate with Christ
himself, and all his benefits.

Q. Prove that grace is conuayed, not to all receivers, but only to every true
believer?

But to the faithful only.
A. That grace is not conuayed to every one that is partaker of the outward
elements, but only to the faithful, is manifest in that our Savior Christ,
Mark. 16.16. does not say simply, He that is baptized, but He that believes
and is baptized, shall be saved. And Saint Peter, Acts 8.21.23. said of Simon
Magus (notwithstanding that he was baptized) That his heart was not right in
the sight of God, but that he was in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond
of iniquity. And the Apostle says, 1 Cor. 11.29. That the unworthy receiver,
eats and drinks his own damnation.

Q. What is the fourth end or use of Sacraments?

A. Fourthly, To be a^ badges of our profession.
Sacraments are appointed to be as badges or tokens of our profession, that
thereby the true worshippers of God, and their religion, might be discerned
from the false and counterfeit. Thus Circumcision and the Passover did
distinguish the Jews from all other nations. Hereupon it is, that those that
were not of the Jews religion, who were then the only true Church and people
of God, were termed in disgrace, So to the Jews.
the uncircumcised, see 1 Samuel 17.26.36. This uncircumcised Philistine. And
Isa. 52.1. The uncircumcised and unclean. And of the Passover it is said,
Exodus 12.48. No uncircumcised person shall ^at thereof. As being also peculiar
to the Church.

Q. Prove that our Sacraments are badg^s to us Christians.

So to us Christians
A. It is manifest, in that whosoever will become a Christian, is exhorted,
Acts 2.38. to be baptiz^d in the name of Jesus Christ: as the ^^dge and token
of his entrance ^o his Christian profession. And therefore the Eurac^ becoming
a Christian, and knowing the Sacrament of baptism to be the badge of Christian
religion, desired to be partaker of it. Acts 8.36. See, here is water, says
he, what does let me to be baptized? And as baptism is the badge of our
entrance, so is the Lords Supper of our continuance. Therefore both together
are made effectual signs of our conjunction with Christ in one body, 1 Cor.
12.13. and 10.17. Hereupon the Sacraments in their right use, do not only
distinguish Christians from Heathen, but also the true Christian from the
counterfeit.

Q. Prove that there are only two Sacraments?

A. That the Sacraments of the new Testament are only two, There are only two
Sacraments.
properly so called, that is to say, Baptism, and the Lords Supper, may
plainly appear, By the institution and practice of Christ.
not only by the institution, there being no mention made of any more but these
two, Matthew. 28.19. and Luke 22.19. but also in that our Savior Christ, whom it
behooued to fulfill all righteousness in performing every good duty, both
legal and Evangelical, did only communicate in these two, as Sacraments of
the covenant of grace, see Mat. 3.13.14.15. and 26.26.

Q. How else may it appear that there are only two?

By the water and blood out of his side.
A. It is mystically showed by the water and blood which issued out of the side
of Christ at his death, Ioh. 19.34. Whereunto Saint John alluding, says, 1 Io.
5.6. This is that Jesus Christ that came by water and blood, not by water only,
but by water and blood. By Saint Paul's allusion.
Again, the Apostle noting how the Fathers before the coming of Christ were
united unto him, as well as we Christians since his coming, alludeth to these
two Sacraments, as the only symboles or signs of that union. 1 Cor. 10.2.3.4.
They were all, says he, baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and
did all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the same spiritual
drink.

Our weakness requires Sacraments.
Q. Prove that our weak faith does require such helps?

A. If we were altogether spiritual, and in a state of perfection, we should
need no such helps, as these outward elements: but the soul being compassed
about with this flesh of ours and seeing nothing, but as it were out of a
prison, in an obscure manner; we are constrained to use these supports of our
weakness, as old and weak sights use spectacles. Thus much the Apostle
intimates, 1 Cor. 13.9.12. That because we do but know in part, we now see
therefore through a glass darkely.

Q. Is not the word of God sufficient without these outward signs?

A. We read, The Word is not sufficient to us.
Heb. 6.17. That God, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of
promise the stablenesse of his counsel, bound himself by an oath, that by two
immutable things, wherein it is impossible that God should lie, we might have
strong consolation. In which wo^ds we may plainly see, that the word and
promise of God, (specially being confirmed by oath) is in it self most
sufficient; yet seeing it has pleased God, to add the Sacraments to the word,
it is an evident argument, that our infirmity does stand in need of such
helps, beside the word.

Q. Prove that Christ has ordained th^se two Sacraments only, and no more.

Christ ordained only two Sacraments.
A. That Christ never ordained any more Sacraments, as signs and seals of the
covenant of grace, but only Baptism, and the Lords Supper, is most evident,
in that concerning these outward elements of water, bread and wine only, and
^one other, he solemnly pro^^^^ted these words of institution, M^th. 28.1^.
Go, t^ach all Na^ions, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the holy Ghost; And the like of the Lords Supper, Math. 26.26.27.
etc. Again, concerning the administration of these only, did our Savior
Christ give order to the Apostles, and in them to all the Ministers of the
Gospel, to the end of the world: whereupon the Apostolic and primitive Church
observed only these two Sacraments, Act. 2.38.42.

Q. What then are we to think of those other five Sacraments, used in the
Romish Church?

A. Those five, The other five are no Sacraments.
commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation, Penance, Orders,
Matrimony, and Extreme Unction, are not to be accounted for Sacraments of the
Gospel in as much as they want those things that should give them the true
nature, life, and being of Sacraments, that is, Why no Sacraments.
the institution of Christ; the outward and visible signs, that all Sacraments
have, and the end and use of Sacraments; namely, to signify, seal, and
confirm the covenant of grace, to all the faithful, unto the coming of
Christ.

Q. Show particularly why they are no Sacraments?

Particularly,
A. Confirmation is no Sacrament, because it has no outward visible sign
ordained by Christ to any such end, Confirmation is no Sacrament.
as Sacraments are appointed unto; only thus it came in use among Christians,
Act. 8.14.15.17.
immediately after the time of the Apostles. The extraordinary gifts of the
Holy Ghost, Hieron. aduers. Luciferia^os cap. 4. An nes^^s etiam ecclesiarum
^^nc esse morem, etc.
conferred by the laying on of the hands of the Apostles being ceased: there
was in imitation thereof, a custom taken up in the Christian Churches* that
they that had been baptized, and had learned the Catechism, were by the
laying on of hands and prayers of the Bishops, commended unto God for the
confirmation and increase of the ordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost in them.

Q. Why is Penance no Sacrament?

Penance is no Sacrament.
A. Penance is no Sacrament, not only because it has no visible sign, nor
institution of Christ to be such: but for that it is only a religious exercise
of another kind, as prayer, meditation, examination of the conscience, and the
like are: It may be without a Priest or Minister, which a Sacrament cannot be.
all which, as well as penance or penitence are to be renewed every day, and
may be, without any presence or ministerial assistance of a Priest, or
Minister: though it be good sometimes to use the help, counsel and
ministerial power of such.

Q. Why is Order no Sacrament?

A. Order is no Sacrament, Order is no Sacrament.
not only because it has nothing in it, to give it the nature of a Sacrament:
but for this special reason, because it does only concern the orders,
degrees, and offices Ecclesiastical; and so is peculiar only to the
Ministry: whereas Sacraments are common to the whole Church and people of God.

Q. Prove that Matrimony is no Sacrament? Matrimony is no Sacrament.


A. Matrimony is no Sacrament, because all Christian Sacraments are peculiar
only to the Christian Church, as badges and tokens of it, to distinguish it
from all other societies. But Matrimony was instituted of God in Paradise,
before the f^ll of man; and that not as a Sacramental sign, but to serve for
the honest and lawful propagation of mankind. And was, is, and ever shall be
common, both to Jews and Gentiles, Christians and Heathen of all Nations.

Q. Prove that Extreme Unction is no Sacraments?

Extreme Unction is no Sacrament.
A. Extreme Unction, which is the annoynting of the sick with oil, is also no
Sacrament, because the places of Scripture alleged for this purpose, do
warrant no such thing: for the anointing spoken of there, is merely
miraculous, and was only for that time, when miracles were wrought for the
confirming of the doctrine of the Gospel, at the first planting of it. And the
and or use of that anointing was far different from this in the Romish
Church; for that was for the recovery of the sick, this is only used, when
they are thought to be past recovery, see Mark. 6.13. I^m. 5.14.

Q. Show that our two Saments are answerable to the two Sacraments under the
Law?

A. It is apparent by this, Our Sacraments answerable to the legal.
in that as circumcision was the Sacrament of their entrance into covenant with
God: so Baptism is to us. And as the Passover was the Sacrament of their
preservation: so the Lords Supper is the Sacrament of our confirmation and
continuance in the state of grace and salvation.

Q. Prove that these two Sacraments are alone sufficient?

A. That they are alone sufficient for the beginning and continuing of saving
grace, They are alone sufficient.
it is manifest, in that there being no other grace but beginning and
continuing grace: and Baptism serving for the one, and the Lords Supper for
the other, that there need no more Sacraments but these.

T Of the Sacrament of Baptism.
Q. Rehearse the letter T?

A. THe Sacrament of Baptism is, when the persons baptized, professing
repentance, and faith in Jesus Christ, and the children of such are by the
Minister of the word washed with water, in the name of the Father, the Son,
and the holy Ghost: being thereby admitted into the communion of the body of
Christ, which is the Church: assured of the remission of their sins: do vow
and promise, and are by Baptism confirmed in grace, to believe in Jesus
Christ, and to live no more in sin, but in newness of life.

For Baptism is the sign of our regeneration, or new birth: and therefore is
once only to be received, as it is sufficient to be once borne, and yet the
virtue of Baptism is perpetual.

Q. Prove that the persons baptized must profess their repentance. Baptism
requires


A. Those that are of years of discretion ought to profess their repentance,
Profession of repentance.
before they be admitted into the Church by Baptism^. Therefore John Baptist
is said Mark. 1 45. to preach the Baptism of repentance. And it i^ added
further, that they were all baptized of him, confessing their sin* So the
Apostle Peter dire^ted those that were to become Christians, Act. 2.38. Repent,
says he, and be baptiz^d every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ.

Q. Prove that the baptized must profess faith in Christ?

Profession of faith.
A. This the profession of faith in Christ is also required of such, may appear
by the answer of Philip to the Eunuch, desiring to be baptized, Act. 8.37. If,
says he, thou believed with all thy heart, thou may. And in the example of
the ^alour, Act 16.31.33.34. who was by Paul and Silas directed to believe, and
believing was baptized with all his house. And it is said, Act. 8.12. That when
they believed, they were baptized both men and women.

Q Prove that the children of such are to be baptized?

A. The parents, Ch^ldren are t^ b^ b^ptized.
or at least one of them, believing and being baptiz^d, their children are al^o
to be baptized. Therefore the Apostle says, 1 Cor 7.14. that such children are
holy. The reason is, because 1. they are within the couen^nt. see Genesis 17.7.
God is the God of Ab^aham and h^s ^^^d. And it is said, Acts 2.39. The prom^se
is made to you and to your ch^ldren. 2. Baptism is to us Christians, as
circumcision was to the Jews: and therefore as their children were
circumcised, so ours are to be baptized. For otherwise Christian children were
in worse condition then the children of the Jews.

Q. What is the outward element in Baptism? The outward element is water.


A. The outward element or sign in Baptism is, and ought to be water, and
only water; and that natural, common, pure and clean water. Therefore we
read, Matthew. 3.6 that John baptized in the river Jordan. And Ioh. 3.23. that he
was baptizing in Enon, near to Salim, because there was much wa^er there, And
speaking of his Baptism, Matthew. 3.11. he says, I baptize you with water. And
Acts 8.36. The Eunuch traveling upon the way, said to Philip, See here is
water, what does let me to be baptized?

Q. What is the action or ceremony used about water?

The action is washing.
A. The action is washing, which is done either by dipping the parties baptized
into the water, or by sprinkling the water upon them. So the Apostle alluding
to Baptism, says, Heb. 10.23. Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. And ^. Cor. 6.11. but ye are
washed, but ye are sanctified. The same allusion is in 1 Pet. 1.2. where it is
said, that they were elect through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience,
and sprinkling of the blood of Christ.

Q. What is the inward grace signified by the washing with water?

A. The inward grace represented unto us by the washing with water in Baptism,
The inward grace, what.
is the spiritual washing away of our sins by the blood of Christ through
faith. Therefore it is said, 1 Io. 17. The blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us
from all sin.

Q. What is the form of words to be used in Baptism?

A. The form of words ought to be according to the institution of Christ, The
form of words* what.
as it is in Matthew. 28.19. Baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the holy Ghost. Which words do intimate thus much, namely, that
the party baptized is received into the favor of God: and into the service and
worship of this only true God: who is one in essence, and three in person, the
Trinity in unity, and unity in Trinity.

Q. Who are to administer the Sacrament of Baptism?

Who must administer Baptism.
A. They only are to administer Baptism, to whom the commission is granted,
that is, the Apostles and their successors, the Pastors and Ministers of the
Church is the end of the world. See the commission, Matthew. 28.19.20. where our
Saui^ur Christ having said, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth,
does upon the ground of that authority, presently add these words, containing
the tenor of the commission. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing
them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost.
Teaching them to observe all things, whatsoever I have commanded you. And ^^e,
I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.

Q. What is the end or use of Baptism?

A. The maine end and use of Baptism may be reduced to these few h^ads. The
end or use of Baptism.
First, by Baptism we are admitted into the communion of the body of Christ,
End.
which is the Church, or congregation and company of Gods faithful people; and
thereby become partakers of Christ and all his benefits to our eternal
salvation. Therefore the Apostle says, Gal. 3.27. As many of you ^s have been
baptiz^d into Christ, have put on Christ. And 1 Cor. 12.12.13. As the body is
one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, which is one,
though they be many, yet are but one body even so is Christ. For by o^e spirit
are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Grecians, whether we
be bond or free.

Q. What is the second end or use of Baptism?

End.
A. Secondly, by Baptism we are assured of the pardon of our sins. Whereupon
it is that Peter said unto them, Acts 2.38. Amend your lives and be baptized
every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins. And
therefore Ananias said unto Saul, Act. 22.16. Arise and be baptized, and wash
away thy sins, in calling on the name of the Lord.

Q. What is the third end or use of Baptism?

End.
A. Thirdly, in Baptism we vow, covenant, and promise our says and obedience
to God. So the Lord said of circumcision, Genesis 17.10. This is my covenant,
which ye shall keep between me and you. And of Baptism it is said, 1 Pet.
3.21. that it is not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the
answer of a good conscience toward God. Therefore as was showed before, when
any were to be baptized they professed their faith and repentance, and took
the Sacrament upon it, as thereby vowing, and couenanting so much with God.

Q. What is the fourth end of Baptism?

A. Fourthly we are by Baptism confirmed in grace, End.
both to believe in Jesus Christ, as also to live no more in sin, but in
newness of life for that which is said of circumcision Romans 4 11. that it was
the scale of the righteousness of faith, is true also of Baptism tovs
Christians: it being to us as circumcision was to the Jews. And for
regeneration, see Rom, 6.3.4. Know ye not, says Paul, that all we which have
been baptized into Jesus Christ, have been baptized into his death, we are
buried then with him, by Baptism into his death that like as Christ was raised
up from the dead, by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in
newness of life.

Q. Prove that Baptism is the sign of our new birth?

Baptism is the sign of regeneration.
A. That Baptism is the sign of our regeneration or new birth: and therefore
is but once to be received* as it is sufficient to be once borne, is evident in
that our Savior alluding unto Baptism, Ioh. 3.3.5. says, Except a man be
borne again of water and if the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
God: where we see, that Christians in their Baptism are resembled to children
newborn, and therefore are fuly called, 1 Pet. 2.2. newborn babes.

Q. Prove that the virtue of Baptism is perpetual? The virtue (...) it is
perpetu^ll.


A. The Apostle intimates so much, Ephesians. 5.26.27. where he says. That Christ
gave himself but his Church, that he might sa^ctifi^^^, and clea^se i^ by the
washing of water through the word* that he might make it unto* himself a
glorious Church, not having spot or wrinckle, or any such thing* but that it
should be holy* and without blame: now we know, that this perfection is not
attained in the very act of Baptism, but is then only begun, and after daily
increased to the end of our life. And the Apostle refers our death of sin,
and n^wnesse of life, which is daily to be exercised of us, Romans 6.3.4.
unto the virtue of Baptism.

V Of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.
Q. Rehearse the letter V?

A. Understand that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, is when bread and wine
representing the body and blood of Christ, broken and shed for us, being by the
Minister taken and blessed, is broken and poured forth, and so delivered to all
the faithful present: and of them received, by eating the bread and drinking
the wine, in remembrance of Christ's death, as also to communicate unto us the
very body and blood of Christ spiritually by faith: and so to confirm our
faith in Christ and love one to another.

For this Sacrament is the sign of our new life, as Baptism is of our new
birth. And therefore as we have need of often nourishment, so we ought to
receive often, and that with due preparation.

Q. Why is this Sacrament called the Lords Supper?

A. This Sacrament is called the Lords Supper for these reasons: The Lords
Supper why so called.
First a Supper, partly in regard of the time when it was instituted and
celebrated: which was in the evening, before the day wherein Christ was
crucified: partly in respect of the thing it self, because it is a Sacred
Feast or Banquet, appointed of God, not for the body, but for the soul. And it
is called The Lords Supper, both in regard of the Author, who is the Lord Jesus
himself: as also in respect of the end, which was in remembrance of him.

Q. What is the outward sign in the Lords Supper?

The outward sign is Bread and Wine.
A. The outward sign in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, does consist of two
elements, that is, Bread and Wine; for so our Savior did institute, not one
only, but both: to show, that in him we have perfect nourishment unto
eternal life: and the better to express the giving up of his Body, and the
shedding of his Blood for us, which either the Bread alone, or the Wine alone,
could not present unto us in so lively manner. Again, it is answerable to the
type, Genesis 14.18. that as Melchisedech, so Christ should nourish and refresh
his Church with Bread and Wine.

The thing signified is the Body and Blood of Christ Crucified.
Q. What is the thing siguified by the Bread and Wine?

A. The thing signified is the Body and Blood of Christ broken and shed for us:
this we may see by the first institution, Luke 22.19.20. This is my Body, which
is given for you. This cup is the New Testament in my blood, which is shed for
you; again, 1 Cor. 11.24. This is my Body which is broken for you, etc. and
verse 26. As often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do show the
Lords death till he come. So the Sacrament is not simply the representation of
Christ's Body and Blood contained in it, but of his dead and crucified body, and
of his blend out of the body, shed upon the Cross.

Q. Who is to administer this Sacrament?

A. This Sacrament as well as Baptism, Who is to administer the Sacrament.
is to be administered only by the Ministers of Christ, who are therefore
called, 1 Cor. 4.1. the Stewards or disposers of the mysteries of God; as we
may see by the institution of Christ himself, Math. 26.26.27. and the
repetition of it by the Apostle, 1 Cor. 11.23. where is showed, what is to be
done both by the Minister, and by the people.

Q. What is to be done by the Minister?

The action of the Minister.
A. The action o^ the Minister is fourfold: 1. To take the Bread and Wine
into his hand, signifying how God did take and set apart his Son to be our
Redeemer. 2. To consecrate or bless them: Ioh. 3.16.
noting how God did in the fullness of time, consecrate and send forth his
Son, to work our redemption. 3. To break the Bread, and 6.27.
and pour out the Wine, representing the breaking of the Body, and the
shedding of the Blood of Christ for us. 4. To distribute the Bread and Wine,
signifying how God does offer his Son to all, and effectually give him to the
faithful, to be their Savior.

Q. What is to be done by the people? The action of the people.


A. There is a double action to be performed by the people, that do
communicate: the first is, to take the Bread and Wine into the hand, Ioh. 1.22.
signifying, their apprehension or laying hold on Christ by faith. The second
is, the eating of the Bread, and drinking of the Wine, representing their
special application of Christ, and all his benefits, by faith for their
spiritual nourishment unto salvation. 1 Cor. 10.16.


Q. What is the end or use of this Sacrament? The end or use of this Sacrament.


A. The end or use, for which this Sacrament of the Lords Supper was ordained,
was first for the perpetual retaining of the memory of Christ's death. For
remembrance of, Christ's death.
So it is commanded, Luke 22.19. Do this in remembrance of me, and 1 Cor.
11.26. the Apostle says, A^ often as you shall eat this Bread, and drink this
Cup, ye show tho Lords death, till he come.

Q. What is the second end or use of this Sacrament? For Communion with Christ.


A. Secondly, it was appointed as an instrument or means to communicate unto
us, the very body and blood of Christ spiritually by faith; therefore it is,
that the Apostle says, 1 Cor. 10.16. The cup of blessing which we bless, is
it not the communion of the blood of Christ? the Bread which we break, is it
not the communion of the body of Christ? And this is that feeding upon Christ,
that eating of his flesh, and drinking of his blood, spoken of, Ioh.
6.29.35.47.51. etc. namely, when by believing, we are made partakers of him,
which is done in this Sacrament, in a special manner.

Q. What is the third end or use of this Sacrament?

For confirmation of our faith and love.
A. Thirdly, the Lords Supper was ordained for the confirmation of our faith in
Christ, and love one to another. For when in the Sacrament, together with the
word which we hear, Jesus Christ is evidently set forth before our eyes, and
as it were crucified among us, and in our sight, as Paul speaks, Gal. 3.1.
insomuch, How our faith in Christ.
that the Sacrament, which is called the visible word, does seem to speak
unto us, as Christ did to Thomas, Ioh. 20.27. Come see and feel my wounds, and
be not faithless, but believing: How can it but greatly nourish and strengthen
our faith in the Lord Jesus, who has thus suffered for us.

Q. How does the Sacrament confirm our love?

A. Again, How our love one to another
when in the Sacrament we consider, that there are many grains in one bread,
and many grapes in one wine, representing unto us, as it is in 1 Cor. 10. 17.
How we being many, are one bread and one body, for we are all partakers of that
one bread. How is it possible, but that we should be thereby nourished and
confirmed in the dearest love and affection one Christian to another? and out
of that ground of love, be ready to do all the good we can, as being members
of the same body, whereof Christ is the head, 1 Cor. 12.12.13.

Q. How is the Lords Supper the Sacrament of our new life?

A. As Baptism is the Sacrament of our new birth, It is the sign of our new
life.
because by it we are regenerate and borne again, Ioh. 3.3. So the Lords
Supper is the Sacrament or sign of our new life, because by it our souls are
continually nourished, in feeding upon Christ by faith, as bodily food does
nourish the body. Therefore it is, that our Savior says, Ioh. 6.55. My flesh
is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed: that is, spiritual meat, and
spiritual drink, as it is, 1 Cor. 10.3.4. Yea, such as does nourish unto
eternal life, not as Manna, which was but bodily and mortal food, Ioh.
6.57.58.

Q. Prove that we must receive often? It is often to be received.


A. The Sacrament of the Lords Supper, being to our souls, as bodily food is
to our bodies, reason it self does teach, that it is to be received often, as
our bodies stand in need of often nourishment. Besides, our Savior Christ in
the first institution of this Sacrament, did manifestly express his intention
for the frequent use of it, in that he did apoint it to be done for the
continual remembrance of his death till his second coming. Whereupon Saint
Paul, who delivered nothing to the Church, but what he received of the Lord,
says, As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the
Lords death till he come. 1 Cor. 11.26.

Q. Prove that it ought to be received with due preparation?

A. That we ought to receive this Sacrament with due preparation, With due
preparation.
the Apostle teaches, 1 Cor. 11.28. Where he gives this strait charge, and
does second it with diverse forcible reasons, Let a man examine himself, and so
let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. But if there were no such
special charge, yet the serious consideration of so sacred a mystery, should
stir up all men to a religious and reverent estimation of it: specially
recounting, with what sanctified preparation the Jews did celebrate their
Passover, which was to them as this is to us: but yet far inferior both in
excellency and use, to our Sacrament.

W Of the state of all men dying, in respect of the soul: and of the
resurrection of the body.
Q. Rehearse the letter W?

A. WE must know and believe, that all men dying the souls of the godly go
immediately to heavenly joy, the wicked to hell torments: and all of them shall
at the last day rise again in their own bodies, by the power of Christ, the
godly to life eternal, the wicked to everlasting damnation.

For Christ came to destroy death for us: and is himself risen from death,
that we might rise with him: and if there were no resurrection, the preaching
of the word, and our faith should be in vain.

Q. What shall become of all men, after they have lived here in this world for
a time?

All men must die.
A. All men, of what degree, state, and condition soever, yea, as well the godly
as the wicked, must depart this life, by death, which is the separation of the
soul from the body. For sin has brought this evil upon all mankind, as is
showed before out of Romans 5.12. Whereupon, in the just judgment of God, it is
appointed unto men that they shall once die, and after that comes the
judgment, Heb. 9.27. And thence is that challenge, Psalm. 89.48. What man
lives, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of
the grave?

Q. How is it that the godly die, seeing death is a curse, and a punishment of
sin, which to them is pardoned?

A. Death is not to the godly a curse, Death to the godly is a blessing.
but a blessing, it is not a punishment, but a benefit, and an advantage
through the death of Christ, 1 Cor. 3.21 22. Phil. 1.21. 1 Cor. 15.55.56.
by whom the sting of death is so taken away, that it cannot hurt them. Yet the
godly must die, for diverse causes. 1 That there may be an end of all their
sorrows, 1 These. 4.13.14.
labors and miseries which they endure in this world: in which respect death
is called a sleep and rest. Reu. 14.13.
2 That they may be freed from sin, and so fitted for heaven: Romans 6.7. 1
Cor. 19.30.
because flesh and blood corrupted, cannot inherit the kingdom of God. 3 That
by death as by a gate, 1 Cor. 15.^6.
or way they may pass into life. As the corn that is sown is not quickened
except it die.

Q. What shall become of the Souls of men when they die.

The soul goes immediately to heaven or hell.
A. When man, who is dust, shall return to the earth as it was: Then, says
Solomon, Eccles. 12.7. the spirit shall return unto God who gave it. That is,
to Gods disposing, either to joy or torment. This our Savior teaches, Ioh. 5,
24. He that hears my word, and believes in him that sent me, has
everlasting life, and shall not come into damnation, but has passed from death
unto life. And as it is said before, Reu. 14.13. They rest from their labors.
Example hereof we may see in the death of the Richman and Lazarus, Luke
16.22.23. the one went immediately to heavenly joy, the other to hall torments.

Q. What shall become of the bodies of men when they die. The bodies of all
shall rise again.


A. The bodies of men when they are dead whether they lie in their graves, or
be in the sea, or wheresoever, shall rise again to life. So our Savior
teaches, Ioh. 5.29. That all that are in the graves shall come soorth. And in
the Reu. 20.12. it is said, I saw the dead small and great stand before God.
And verse 13^ The sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death, and hell or
grave delivered up the dead which were in them. It was Saint Paul's faith and
assured hope, see Acts 24.15. That the resurrection of the dead shall be both
of just and unjust. And he does prove it at large in 1 Cor. So that he cannot
be a good Christian that believes not this article of the Christian faith.

Q. When shall the dead rise again?

A. The time when the dead shall rise again, At the last day.
shall be at the last day, that is, at the end of the world, when Christ shall
come to judgment. This Martha did acknowledge concerning her brother Lazarus,
Ioh. 11.24. I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last
day. With the comfort of that day Christ incourageth to do good to the poor.
Luke 14.14. And herewith the Apostle does both comfort himself that had now
almost run his race, and finished his course, and encourage others to do the
like. Because there is laid up a crown of righteousness, which the Lord the
righteous judge shall give at that day. 2 Timothy 4.8.

Q. With what bodies shall the dead rise?

Every one with his own body.
A. All shall rise with their own bodies, that as the Apostle speaks, 2 Cor.
5.10. Every man may receive the things which are done in his body, according to
that he has done, whether it be good or evil. In this was Job confident, and
comforted himself with in his affliction, Job 19.26.27. Though after my
skin, worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: Whom I shall
see for my self, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another.

Q. By what power shall the dead be raised?

A. The dead shall rise again by the power of Christ, By the power of Christ.
at the hearing of his voice, and sound of the last trumpet. See Ioh. 5.28. The
hour shall come, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his
voice: and they shall come sorth etc. Again, 1 Cor. 15.52. In a moment, in the
twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall blow, and the
dead shall be raised up, etc.

Q. To what end is the resurrection of the dead? The end is to life or death
eternal.


A. The end of the resurrection is that the whole man both soul and body may
be presented before the tribunal of Christ; the godly to receive the joyful
sentence of life, as the reward of their piety: the wicked to hear the
doleful doom of death and condemnation, as the recompense of their sin. So
says our Savior, Ioh. 5.29. That they that have done good shall rise unto the
resurrection of life, and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of
damnation.

Q. Prove that Christ came to destroy death?

Christ came to destroy death.
Q. That Christ came to destroy death without which victory there could be no
resurrection, it was prophesied, Hos. 13.14. I will redeem them from the power
of the grave, I will deliver them from death. O death I will be thy death: O
grave I will be thy destruction. And the Apostle alleging this prophecy, does
triumphantly praise God for it, 1 Cor. 15.54. etc. Death is swallowed up in
victory, O death where is thy sting? O grave where is thy victory? etc. But
thanks be to God, which has given us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

Q. Prove that Christ is risen from death?

A. The Apostle does inuincibly prove it by many arguments in 1 Cor. 15.13*14.
etc. concluding verse 20. in this manner, Christ is himself risen.
But now, says he, is Christ risen from the dead, and was made the first
fruits of them that sleep. For as he reasons there, If there be no
resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen. But seeing he is risen, and
that for us, it follows nececessarily, that there must needs be a
resurrection.

Q. Prove that Christ is risen that we might rise with him?

A. It is said, That we might rise with him.
1 These. 4.14. If we believe that Jesus is dead and ^is risen, even so them
which sleeepe in Jesus, will God bring with him, and 1 Cor. 15.21.22. for since
by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead: for as in
Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive; therefore it is, that
he is called the first fruits of them that sleep.

Q. Prove that if there be no resurrection, then the preaching of the Word, and
our faith is in vain?

If no resurrection, preaching and faith is vain.
A. It is the Apostles argument, to prove the resurrection, 1 Cor. 15.14. that
if there be no resurrection, and so consequently Christ is not risen, then
says he, our preaching is vain, and your faith is also vain, and we are
found also false witnesses of God; and verse 19. If in this life only we have
hope in Christ, we are of all men the most miserable.

X Of the day of Judgment.
Q. Rehearse the Letter X.

A. EXCeeding glorious in itself, joyous to the godly, and fearful to the
wicked, shall be the day of judgment: wherein Jesus Christ shall call to
account, and judge all men, for all things done in this life, according to
their works.

For he shall come with glory in the clouds, accompanied with innumerable
Angels: and fitting upon his throne of Majesty, shall upon due trial of every
man's works (the books being opened) pronounce the sentence of salvation to
the Godly, and of damnation to the wicked.

Q. Prove that there shall be a day of judgment?

A day of judgment shall be.
A. It is written, Act. 17.31: That God has appointed a day, in the which he
will judge the world in righteousness; and Solomon tells vain young men,
Eccles. 11.9. that they must know, that for all these things God will bring
them to judgment;, yea, it is a main Article of our Creed, and reason does
teach, that seeing the godly live here in much affliction, the wicked in great
pleasure, there must needs be a day of judgment, to right all.

Q. When shall that day of judgment be?

The time is only known to God.
A. The day of judgment is not known to any creature in heaven or earth, but
to God only; see Math. 24.36. But of that day and hour knows no man, no nor
the Angels of heaven, but my Father only; and Mark* 13.32. is added, neither
the Son himself, that is, in respect of his humane nature, or as he is here in
this world in the state of humiliation; or to reveal it to us, whom it does
not concern to know it; as is said, Act. 1.7. It is not for you to know the
times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power: yet there
are signs foretold whereby we kn^w the approaching of this day of Judgment.

Q. What are the signs foreshewing the day of judgment? The signs what?


A. The signs are chiefly these; Mark. 13.10. Math. 24.14.
2. The preaching of the Gospel through the whole world. 2. Great calamities,
persecutions, troubles, Math. 24: 6.7.9.10.
wars, famine, pestilence, and the like. 3. A general apostasy or falling
away, and departing from the faith and purity of religion. 2 These. 2.3 1 Timothy
4.1.
4. The coming and revealing of Antichrist, the head of that Apostasy, who
shall take upon him, 2 These. 2.3.4.8. 1 Ioh. 2.18.
to be the head of the Church, by sitting as God in the Temple of God, above

Why the time is concealed.
Q. Why is the day of judgment concealed from men?

A. That day and hour is hidden and unknown to men, 1 These. 5.2.3.
and shall therefore be as the coming of a Thief in the night, or as the
travail of a woman with child: to the end that we should wait and watch
every day and hour, and be prepared for the Lords coming, see Math. 24.42.
Watch therefore, for you know not what hour your Lord comes, and verse 44.
Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son
of man does come, and Mark. 13.37. And what I say unto you, I say unto all,
Watch.

Q. Why is the day of judgment so long deferred?

A. The Lord does defer the day of judgment for diverse, The day why deferred.
causes: 1. that he might show his patience toward us, 2 Pet. 3.9*
in giving so large a time of repentance. Math. 24.22.
2. That all the elect, both of Jews and Gentiles, might be gathered together,
Romans 11.26.
their number complete, and so all Israel may be saved. R^u. 6 11 I^m. 5.7
3. That he might try and exercise the patience of the faithful, who suffer so
much at the hands of wicked men for the truth. Romans 2 1.4.5.
4. That the ungodly, and impenitent, abusing the patience and long suffering
of God, which leads to repentance, might be left without excuse, and be the
more severely punished.

Q. Who shall be the Judge?

The Judge is Christ.
A. He shall be the judge, who is our Savior, even the Lord Jesus Christ, see
Act. 17.3 1. where it is said, That God will judge the world by that man whom
he has appointed, and Romans 2.16. In the day when God shall judge the secrets
of men by Jesus Christ; for, says he, Ioh. 5.22. The Father has committed all
judgment to his Sonn^ yet at the day of judgment, The godly (...) ^ssistant.
the godly shall also be as judges, in assisting and consenting to the
judgment of Christ; Math. 19.28.
therefore the Apostle, says, 1 Cor. 6.2. Do you not know, that the Saints
shall judge the world?

Q. Who are they that shall be judged?

A. All men, All men must be judged.
of what condition soever, that have been, are, or shall be from the beginning
to the end of the world, must come to judgment: so we read, 2 Cor. 5.10. That
we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, and Romans 14.12. So
then every one of us shall give account of himself to God; for the Apostle had
said before, verse 10. We shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
And this must be, that as the wicked have joined in sin with the Apostate
Angels, that is, the Devils: so they may be conjoined with them in judgment;
who are reserved in chains of darkness, unto the judgment of that great
day, 2 Pet. 2.4. Iud. 6. then shall Antichrist, as a chief head of all
impiety, receive the doom of his eternal destruction, 2 These. 2.8.

Q. Of what things shall all men be judged?

A. Every man shall be judged of all things done in this life, Of all things.
both good and evil; the good shall be approved, the evil condemned, so it
is said, Eccl. 12.14. That God shall bring every work into judgment, with
every secret thing, whether it be good or evil, and 2 Cor. 5.10. That every
one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done,
whether it be good or bad.

Q. How, and how far shall men be judged, for their evil works?

Committed, as thoughts, words, wo^kes.
A. All men, that in this present life, before their departure hence by death,
have not laid hol^ on Christ and his merits by faith, for the satisfaction of
Gods justice, but dye in their sins and impenitencie, shall give account to
God for every sinful thought, word and work. 1. For every thought though
secret and hid from men: therefore it is not only said, that God will bring
every work to judgment, Eccl. 12.14*
but withal, every secret thing, and Romans 2.16. In that day, God shall judge
the secrets of men. 2. For every word, yea every idle word, that men shall
speak, they shall give account thereof at the day of judgment, Math. 12.36.
3. For every act or deed committed much more: as before is showed, that God
will bring every work to judgment, and every one shall receive the things
done in his body.

Q. Shall men give account for the omission or neglect of good?

A. Men shall not only account, Omitted
and be judged for the evil which they have committed, but also for the Good
which they have omitted and neglected, for God has commanded, Psalm. 34.14.
Depart from evil, and do good, and Isai. 1.16. Cease to do evil, and learn
to do well. Therefore the accusation of the wicked, at the day of judgment, is
thus propounded, Math. 25.42. I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat: I was
thirsty and ye gave me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in:
naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. For
this cause John Baptist, for the avoiding of the wrath to come, directs,
Matthew. 3.8. to bring forth fruits meet for repentance: because, every tree
which brings not forth good fruit, is hewn down and cast into the fire:
though it brings not forth evil fruit.

Q. Why must judgment be given according to works?

According to their works.
A. That every one shall be judged according to his works, Gods word is plain
every where, 2 Cor. 5.10. Every one shall receive according to that he has
done. So it was revealed to Saint John, Reu. 20.12.13. That they were judged
every man according to their works. The reason is, because works are the
fruits of faith, by which it is discerned, as the tree by the fruit* And
therefore it is said according to works, not for the merit of them, unless it
be the works of sin, which do worthily merit damnation. Again the trial
by works, is the fittest way to convince hypocrites.

Q. Show that the coming of Christ shall be glorious?

A. That Jesus Christ shall appear in great glory, Christ's coming shall be
glorious.
at the day of judgment, whether we respect the manner of his coming, with
the attendance of such a multitude of Angels; or his sitting in majesty upon
his tribunal seat, we may see Matthew. 25.31. where it is said briefly, That
when the son of man comes in his glory, and all the Angels with him, then
shall he sit up on the throne of his glory.

Q. Why shall it be joyous to the godly?

Joyous to the godly.
A. Christ's coming to judgment cannot but he most joyous and comfortable to
the faithful, partly because he that comes thus gloriously to be their
judge, is their Savior; partly for that they shall then receive their full
redemption and reward of their piety: and on the contrary, shall behold all
their enemies vanquished, and trod under their feet. Therefore does the spirit
of God every where comfort the godly with the consideration of this day: and
therefore that day is called the time of refreshing, Acts 3.19.

Q. Why shall it be fearful to the wicked?

Fearful to the wicked
A. It cannot but be most fearful to all wicked men, to behold the Lord Jesus
come to judgment, in such glorious manner, whom they have so pierced with
their sins, Reu. 1.7. the rather in regard that he shall come in flaming fire
to take vengeance on them, Psalm. 50,
2 These. 1.8. and to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are
ungodly of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and of
all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him, Jude 15.

Q. What shall be the form or manner of the last judgment?

A. The form and manner of the last judgment is not to be expressed: The
manner of the last judgment.
only the word of God for our better understanding, does set it forth by a
similitude or resemblance of an earthly judge; showing the manner of disposing
the persons conuented; the order of trial and evidence: together with the
sentence of the judge: and the execution thereof.

Q. How will he dispose of all men at the bar of judgment?

The disposing of all men.
A. First the disposing of all men conuented at that bar, is noted by the
Evangelist, Math. 25.32. Before him shall be gathered all nations, and he
shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd separateth the sheep from
the goats: and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on
the left.

Q. What is intended by setting some on the right hand, and some on the left
hand.

On the right or left hand, why?
A. The intention and meaning is, that at the day of judgment, the godly, who
like sheep have heard the voice of Christ their shepherd, Io. 10.27.
and have led an innocent life in this world, shall then be advanced: 1 These.
4.17.
and the wicked, who have here expressed the nature of filthy goats, Luke
23.30 Reu. 6.16.
by satisfying their ungodly lusts, shall then be dejected. And that whereas
in this life they were mingled together, Eccles. 34.18. etc, Matthew. 13.29.30.
and did many ways annoy the flock of Christ: then at that day there shall be
a perfect separation, to the joy of the godly and terror of the wicked.

Q. How shall the trial be?

A. The trial shall be according to the rule appointed of God for that end.
The order of the trial
Which is partly the law of nature: partly the law written, both moral and
Evangelical: as we may see by the Scriptures following. Romans 2.12 As many as
have sinned without law, shall perish without law: and as many as have sinned
in the law, shall be judged by the law. The reason is, verse 15. Because they
have the law written in their hearts. Ioh. 12.48. He that rejects me, and
receiueh not my words, has one that judges him: the word that I have spoken,
the same shall judge him in the last day.

Q What shall be the evidence?

The evidence is certain books.
A. The evidence is said in the word of God to be certain books. This John was
showed in a vision, Reu. 20.12. I saw, says he, the dead, both great and
small stand before God, and the books were opened, and the dead were judged of
those things which were written in the books. Which is not to be understood
properly, that there shall be material books, but by way of similitude or
resemblance, because all things are as certain and manifest to God, and shall
then be as plainly laid open before Angels and men, as if they were recorded
in a book or register.

Q. What are these books?

The books are
A. There are four sorts of books, which shall then be opened, for the
discovery of all the actions of men. That is, Of Gods providence.
The book of Gods providence, whereof the Psalmist speaks in Psalm. 139.16.
In thy book were all things written. Of the creatures.
The book of the creatures, spoken of in Ioh. 20.27. The heaven shall reveal
his iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against him. Of the conscience
The book of the conscience, of which see Romans 2 15.16. Their conscience
bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing or excusing one another: in the day
when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ. The book of life.
The book of life, Reu. 20.12. which is the decree of Gods election, wherein
whosoever is not found written, is cast into the lake of fire, verse 15.

Q. What shall be the sentence?

A. The sentence shall be twofold: of salvation, and of condemnation, Matthew.
25.34. Then shall the King say to them on his right hand, Come ye blessed of
my father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
world. And verse 41. then shall he say also unto them on his left hand, Depart
from me ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
Angels.

Y Of the execution of the sentence of damnation.
Q. Rehearse the letter Y?

A. YOu that are wicked, shall by the power of the voice of Christ, go away
into hell: being separated from God, consorted with the Devils, deprived of all
comfort, punished with unspeakable torments both in soul and body, according
to your sins, and that eternally without ease or end.

For it is just with God, so to punish the wicked, and that they who have lived
here in the pleasures of sin, should be recompensed with answe^able torment.

Q. Prove that there is a place of torment called Hell?

A. That there is a Hell, There is a Hell.
or place of torment, so called, the word of God does witness every where, we
read Math. 5.22. of the danger of hell fire, Math 18.9 Luke 12.5.
so verse 29.30. of the whole body cast into hell fire, so Math. 10.28. Fear
him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell, so Math. 23.33. How
can ye escape the damnation of hell? This hell the Prophet resembles by
Topheth, which is in the valley of Hinnon, where the Israelites offered up
their children in fire to the Idol Molech; 2 Kin. 23, 10*
see in Isa. 30.33. the description of it. Topheth is ordained of old; yea, for
the King it is prepared, he has made it deep and large: the pile thereof is
fire and much wood, the breath of the Lord like a stream of brimstone, does
kindle ^t.

Q. Where is the place of Hell?

A. The situation or local being, and place of hell, Where it is.
cannot for any thing we read in Scripture, be certainly determined; only
this in general is certain, and out of all question; that Hell is in respect
of the Heaven of the Blessed, (called the third or highest heaven) an inferior
or lower place, exceeding far remote and distant from it; which may be
gathered, by that which we read of the damned rich man in Luke 16.23. That in
hell he lift up his eyes being in torments, and s^eth Abraham a far off, and
verse 26. it is said to him, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed.
But it is better for us, leaving all curiosity, to learn to avoid hell, then
by experience to find where it is; remembering that in Pro. 15.24. The way of
life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.

Q. Prove that the wicked shall by the power of Christ's voice go into hell?

A. The wicked, Christ's voice detrudeth the wicked into hell.
that here in this life, will not hear the voice of Christ, shall then be
constrained, will they, nill they, by the power of that voice, to go away into
hell, this is evident, Math. 25. if we confer together the 41. and 46.
verses, where we may see, that when Christ had said, Depart from me ye cursed,
into everlasting fire: it is added withal, And these shall go away into
everlasting punishment.

Q. Prove that the wicked shall then be separated from God?

They are separated from God.
A. They that in this life say unto God, Depart from us, for we desire not the
knowledge of thy ways: Job 21.14.
to them it shall be said at that day, Math. 7.23.
I never knew you: depart from me ye that work iniquity: Luke 13.27
for this must be one chief part of the punishment of the reprobate, to be
excluded out of the glorious presence of God, and of his Angels and Saints, so
we read, 2 These. 1.9. That they shall be punished with everlasting
perdition, from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.

Q. Prove that they shall be consorted with the devils?

They are consorted with the devils.
A. In this life, wicked men do prefer the devil before God; for, as our
Savior says, Ioh. 8.44. They are of their Father the devil, and the lusts of
their Father they will do: therefore as here they join with the devils in
sin, so there they shall be consorted with them in punishment, according to
the sentence and judgment given, Math. 25.41. Depart from me ye cursed, into
everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his Angels.

Q. Prove that they shall be deprived of all comfort?

A. That the wicked being in hell, They are deprived of all joy.
shall be destitute of all ease and comfort, we may see by the example of him,
Luke 16.24
who refusing to give one crumme of refreshing, could not receive so much as
one drop of comfort. And indeed, what comfort can there be, where there shall
be not^ing but weeping and wailing, and gnashing of teeth; when the wicked
shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the Prophets in the kingdom
of God, and themselves thrust out, Luke 13.28.

Q. Prove that they shall be punished with unspeakable torments?

A. The exceeding greatness of their torments, Their t^rmen^s intolerable.
Reu. 21.8.
may appear in that they are said to be in the lake that burns with fire and
brimstone, Isa. 66.24.
Reu. 19.20. where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched, Mark.
9.44. To be cast out into utter darkness, Math. 8.12. And into a furnace of
fire, Math. 13.42. Which epithets or terms, the spirit of God does use to note
how fearful and intolerable the pains of the damned shall be.

Q. Prove that their punishment shall be proportionable, and according to
their sin?

Their punishment proportionable to their sin.
A. The punishment of the damned reprobates, shall be proportioned according to
the quality, degree, and measure of their sins: they that have had the means
of grace and repentance, the word of God, and have neglected or contemned it*
shall be more severely punished, then they that never heard it; therefore it is
said, Math. 10.15. That it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha,
and Math. 11.22. for Tire and Sidon at the day of judgment, then for such.
Again, sins of knowledge shall be punished with more stripes, then sins of
ignorance, Luke 12.47.48. and hypocrites receive the greater damnation, Math.
23.14.

Q. Prove their torments shall be eternal without ease or end?

A. The torments of the wicked in hell, Eternal pain, easelesse, endless.
shall continue without ease or end, to all eternity, as the Salamander,
burning in the midst of the fire, and not consuming; therefore hell torment
is called, Math, 25.41.46. Everlasting fire, and everlasting punishment, and 2
These. 1, 9. everlasting destruction, and it is said, R^u. 20.10, That they
shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever. And it is agreeable to the
rule of justice, because the sin committed is against an infinite and
eternal Majesty.

Q. Prove that it is just with God, so to punish?

It is just with God.
A. The Apostle speaking of the day of judgment, 2 These. 1.6. says, it is a
just thing with God to recompense. And To. 2.5. that day is called, the day of
the declaration of the righteous judgment of God. Therefore it is said, Luke
16.25. Remember that thou in thy life time receiuedst thy pleasures, and
likewise Lazarus pains: Now therefore is he comforted and thou art tormented.
And hence it is that Christ says, Luke 6.25. Woe unto you that now laugh: for
ye shall mourn and weep.

Z Of the execution of the sentence of salvation.
Q. Rehearse the Letter Z?

A. ZEalous godly men, the judgment being ended shall immediately go with
Christ into heaven, having in him immediate communion with God, who shall be
all in all unto them: and so shall be freed from all evils, and possessed of
all good things, as perfection of grace, brightness of glory, and fullness of
joy, in their several degrees, and that unspeakable and everlasting.

For it stands with the certainty of Gods election; with the truth of his
promise; and with his justice for the merit of Christ, thus to reward the
faithful: that so all their sorrows may be turned into joy.

Q. Prove that the godly shall immediately go with Christ into heaven?

The godly go immediately to heaven.
A. It is the first part of the execution of the sentence of salvation: as we
may see Matthew. 25. if we confer verse 34. with 46. For when Christ had said,
Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, it is
added accordingly, that the righteous shall go into life eternal: as upon the
contrary sentence of damnation, the wicked are to go into everlasting pain;
and that immediately.

Q. Prove that they have immediate communion with God?

A. In this life the faithful behold God, They have immediate communion with
God.
and after a sort, enjoy his presence, by certain means, as the word,
Sacraments and the like: but in the life to come they shall have immediate
communion with him. Therefore it is said, 1 Cor. 13.12. Now we see through a
glass dark^ly: but then face to face; now I know in part, but then shall I
know even as also I am known. And 1 These. 4.17. that the faithful shall be
caught up together in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so shall
ever be with the Lord. According to the prayer of Christ, for the union and
communion of the faithful with God in him, axd through his mediation; Ioh.
17.21. That they may be all one, as thou O Father art in me, and I in thee:
that they also may be one in us.

Q. Prove that God shall be all in all unto them?

He shall be all in all unto them
A. The blessed estate of the godly shall be such in the Kingdom of heaven,
that they shall need no such means or helps as here in this world they cannot
be without: but having communion with God, and enjoying his presence, they
shall in him have supply of all: for he shall be all in all, that is, in stead
of all unto them. They are the express words of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 15.28.
that all things shall be subdued unto him, that God may be all in all. And
therefore in spiritual helps there shall be no want. Reu. 21.22. There is no
temple: for the Lord God almighty, and the Lamb are the temple of it. Again,
there shall be no want of temporal means, Reu. 22.5.
Reu. 21.23. no need of candle, Sun, or Moon, for the glory of God does
lighten it, and the Lamb is the light of it. There is the river of water of
life: there is the tree of life. Reu. 22.1.2.

Q. Prove that the godly shall be there freed from all evils?

A. Here in this world, They shall be freed from all evils.
the evils and afflictions that the faithful endure, are great and many: but
in the life to come, Psalm. 34.19
they shall be delivered out of them all: as it is said, Reu. 21.4. God shall
wipe away all tears from their eyes: and there shall be no more death,
neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the
former things are passed away.

Q. Prove that they shall be possessed of all good things?

A. The godly shall there enjoy whatsoever good thing may tend to their
happiness. Possessed of all good things.
So that whereas in this life the graces of God are imperfect in them, there
they shall have perfection of grace. Whereas here they are obscured, in so
much, that it does not appear what they are: in the life to come, they shall
have brightness of glory: and whereas in this world they are filled with
sorrows; there they shall possess all fullness of joy.

Q. How shall they have perfection of grace?

As, ^ perfection of grace.
A. First they shall have perfection of knowledge, see 1 Cor. 3.12. Now we see
as through a glass darkely; but then face to ^ace, now I know in part; but
then shall I know, even as I am known. Secondly they shall have perfection of
sanctity or holiness, see Ephesians. 5.26.27. where it is said, that Christ gave
himself for his Church, that he might sanctify and cleanse it, that he might
present it to him^selfe a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinckle, or a^y
such thing: but that it should be holy and without blem^sh. Which ^erf^ctio^
w^e kno^ cannot be ^^th^ life. Thirdly they shall have (...) slo^e: in which
respect love is for the continuance of it, preferred before faith and hope, 1
Cor. 13.13. Now abides faith, hope, and love, even these three, but the chief
of these is love.

Q. Show that the godly shall have brightness of glory?

A. Secondly they shall have brightness of glory. Brightness of glory.
The Apostle tells the faithful, Col. 3.4. Your life is hid with Christ in
God, when Christ which is our life shall appear, then shall ye also appear
with him in glory. Dan. 12.3. it is said, that they shall shine as the
brightness of the firmament, and as the Stars for ever and ever. And Matthew.
13.43. Then shall the just men shine as the Sun in the kingdom of their
father.

Q. In what part of man shall this glory be?

A. The whole man, Both in soul and body.
both soul and body shall be thus glorious in the life to come. The soul,
for it is said, Matthew. 22.30. that they shall be as the Angels of God in
heaven. In body, for the Apostle says, that Christ shall change our vile body,
that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working
whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself.

Q. Prove that the godly shall have fullness of joy?

Fullness of joy.
A. So much the Pasmist notes, speaking prophetically of Christ, and of
himself as the type, and so proportionally of all the faithful, Psalm. 16.11.
Thou will show me the path of life; in thy presence is fullness of joy, at thy
right hand there are pleasures for ever more.

Q. Prove there are degrees of glory?

Degrees of glory.
A. We may gather so much by the words of the Prophet, Dan. 12.3. They that are
wise, says he, shall shine as the brightness of the firmament: and they that
turn many to righteousne^^e as the Sta^res. And 1 Cor. 15.41. A^ on^ Star
differs from another in glory, so also is the resurrection of the dead.
Again we read, Luke 19.16. etc. that the servant, who with his Masters piece
of money, had gained ten pe^ces, was made rul^r over ten cities: and he that
had gained five, had authority given him over five. Thus the Lord does
proportion the reward according to the m^as^re and employment of his graces
given unto us. Therefore the Apostle says, 2 Cor. 9.6. He that sows
sparingly, shall reap sparingly: and he that sows bountifully shall reap
bountifully.

Q. Prove that this happiness of the godly is unspeakable?

A. It is said, Unspeakable happiness.
1 Pet. 1.8. that the faithful rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of
glory. And 1 Cor. 2.9. Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered
into the heart of man, the things that God has prepared for them that love him.

Q. Prove that this happiness is eternal?

Happiness eternal.
A. The Apostle affirms so much, 2 Cor. 4.17. in that he says, That our
light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us, a ^arre more
exceeding and eternal weight of glory, and 1 Pet. 1.4. it is called an
inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in
heaven for us, and therefore it is said, 2 Timothy 1.10. That our Savior Jesus
Christ has abolished death, and not only brought life, but immortality to
light.

Q. Prove that it stands with the certainty of Gods elect^on? It stands with
the certainty of election


A. The godly cannot fail of this their happiness, because it is grounded
upon Gods election, see 2 Timothy 2.19. The foundation of God stands sure,
having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his, and Romans 8.30. S. Paul
groundeth man's glorification upon Gods predestination and election: Whom God
did predestinate, them he also called; whom he called, them he also
justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.

Q. Prove that it stands with the truth of Gods promise?

A. Christ says of his sheep, With the truth of his promise.
Ioh. 10.28. I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, 1.
Io. 2.25. 2 Cor. 1.13.20.
neither shall any pluck them out of my hand, and Ioh. 3.16. That whoseuer
believes in him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life, and R^u. 2.10.
Be thou faithful unto the death, and I will give thee the crown of life.

Q. P^oue that it stands with the justice of God?

With the justice of God, for Christ.
A. It is manifest, that it stands with the justice of God for the merit of
Christ, in regard that he has purchased man's salvation by his death, 1 Cor.
6.20. and 7.23. Ye are bought with a price, and 1 Pet. 1.18.19. the price is
said to be, not silver and gold, but the precious blood of Christ; therefore it
is said, 1 Timothy 2.6. That Christ gave himself a ransom for all men.

Q. Prove that thus eternal life becomes the reward of the faithful?

It is the reward of the godly.
A. Eternal life becomes a reward to the faithful, and that of due debt in
respect of the merit of Christ, which is merely in him, and not in us: For God
has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made
the righteousness of God in him, 2 Cor. 5.21. But in respect of us, who can
merit nothing, because our worke^ ^re imperfect, it is a reward of favor, and
not of debt, as the Apostle reasons. Romans 4.4.5. To him that works, is the
reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt: but to him that works not, but
believes on him that justifies the v^godly, his faith is counted for
righteousness. Thus of the free grace and mercy of God, and for the merit of
Christ, every good work shall have a reward. Math. 5.12. and 6.4*6. and
10.41.42.

Q. Prove that then all the sorrows of the godly, shall be turned into joy?

A. So did Christ foretell his Disciples, So all sorrow is turned into joy.
and in them all goo^ Christians, Ioh. 16.20. Ye shall weep and lament, and the
world shall rejoice: and ye shall sorrow, but your sorrow shall be turned into
joy. And in that regard he pronounces the godly happy, Luke 6.21. Blessed are
ye that weep now, for ye shall laugh.

Q. To conclude, what do we owe unto God for so great a blessing?

The praise ^e given to God.
A We do owe, and are bound with the Apostle, Col. 1.12.13. To give thanks
unto the Father, who has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of
the Saints in light: who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and
has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.

And therefore we all with one heart say, as it is in Iud. 24.25. Now unto him*
that is able to keep us, that we fall not, and to present us faultlesse before
the presence of his glory with joy, that is, To God only wise, our Savior, be
glory and Majesty, and Dominion and Power, both now and for ever, Amen.

FINIS.
