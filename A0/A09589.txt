(...) In all the lands of crystyenie
Was none found so good as he
While he was young and Iolyfe*
Would sir Guy wedde no wife.
But when he began to elde
Wexed feeble and vnwelde
And took his leave of cheualry
And dwelled in England certainly
In that time king Edgar anon.
Sent after sir Guy full sone.
And sit Guy was true and wyce.
And known for a knight of price
He made him high steward of his land.
And what so ever he said it should stand.
He kept well England in his days
And set peace and stable lays
That no man was so hardy
To do another velany.
Upon a day thought sir Guy
That he would wedde some fair lady
And have between them some children fair.
That of their land might be their heir.
The king of Scotlonde in that tide.
Had a daughter of great pride.
The emperors brother of Almayne
Loved ^ha^ lady, as men said
But Guy wedded her god him save
And at her fader he did her crave
The king of scotlonde not for thy
Gave his daughter unto sir Guy
Against the will of his daughter bright
She had lever have had the other knight.
For he was young and bold.
And sir Guy was wexen old
Alas that ever he her to him chose
His own life for her to lose.
Sir Guy wedded that lady free.
And brought her home to his country
So long to bed he her led.
That a man child to gyder they had.
Beuys they called that child bold.
He was no more but seuyn year old.
When his fader was slain
With sir Mordure of almayne
That lady betought her upon a day*
And unto her self ganne she say
My lord is old and may not wyrche
All day he goth unto the church
What for breysynge and what for age.
He louech not with me for to rage
But had I take a young knight.
That had not ben brusyd in fight.
He would me love both day and night.
And make me all the mirth that he might
Truly it shall be thus no while.
I shall let sle him with sum gyle
After a messenger the lady send.
That before he was her friend
And said thou shall on my message.
Thy self alone without any page
With that thou hold it counceyll.
I shall the quyte for thy trauayll
Madame he said hold you still:
For I will do all at your will.
My lord the it sent sir mordure.
To night he commyth to thy bourt
This yet tell he said is lefe to me.
And tanke sir mordure of his gentre.
And say I am all at his will.
Erly and late land and still.
The messenger away then went
And told his lord as she had sent
Now will we of young Beuys tell
How woo he was and how him be fell.
Alas he said all for tene.
That I had not with my fader been
To have holpyn my fader in that stome
Against that fals^ ^heef sir mordure
To his mother he ran and said.
Why haste thou my fader betrayed:
I will be wrokyn of his bane.
Alas that ever thou were womane
And all false hores for thy sake
To the denyll of hell I them betake.
But one oath mother I the swear
if I may ever arms bear
I shall be venged with might and main
On them that has my fader slain
His mother his words understood.
And gave him a buffet upon the hode.
To the grou^^e he fell and that was harm
His master took him up by the arm
Men called his master sir Sabere
That child was to him left and dear
For Sabere was sir Guyes brother.
In England was not such an other.
Home with th child he went.
The lady after Sabyre sent.
Sabyre she said for well or for woe.
My sone beuye look that thou slo
For shall I never glad be
That day that I him see.
Sir Sabyre was not well apayde
But granted as the lady said.
Home he went full sorry in this wise.
He took for wyles and ^lewe a gryce
The rich chyldes clothes fair and good.
He them bespronge with the blood
Sir Sabere all for dread
Liothed the child in poor wede
And said beuys it behooves the to keep
Upon the field all my sheep
Till the spousage be brought to an end
And then will we unto wales wend.
There is an earl sybbe unto the
Thou shalt there dwell and with him be
When thou art wexen and arms may bear
And have strenght harneys to were
Than thou shalt claim thyn heritage.
And venge thy fader be thou of aege
And I shall help the than to fight
With dynte of sword to win thy right
Therefore my sheep forth thou dryne
That no man know thou be on live.
And forth he went with Sabyres sheep
To the field and sore began weep.
When beuys was on high upon the down.
He looked to ward south hampton
