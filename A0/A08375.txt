ESOPS EABLES Translated Grammatically, and also in propriety of our English
phrase; and, every way, in such sort as may be most profitable for the
Grammarschoole.

The use of it is according to the directions in the prefaces, and more fully
set down in Ludus Lit* or the Grammar-schoole.



LONDON. Printed by H. L. for Thomas Man. 1617.

To the Right Worshipful, Sir John Harper, Knight, all true prosperity.
RIght worshipful, I may not be forgetful of the love which you have showed
toward the furtherance of my endeavors, for the Grammar-schoole. Accept
therefore this small pledge of my thankful acknowledgement. Though it be
little in value and in the esteem of the most, yet the b^nefit of it will (I
trust) help to make amends, and further the perfecting of my desires. By the
right use hereof, may the little ones from their first years get much
profitable understanding and wisdom, yea such, as whereof they may have
worthy use, all their days, in what place soever they shall be employed; And
may moreover have every point and part of the learning in it, so imprinted in
their memories as they shall never forget them, but have them, as it were
lively before their faces: That so they may learn to embrace the virtues
therein taught and to flee the vices, to foresee dangers and how to avoid them,
to behave themselves wisely and discreetly in the whole course of their life.
As for example, to give a taste hereof; in the first fable of the cock
esteeming a barley corn above a precious stone, to see the foolishof men,
especially of children preferring play before learning, a little pleasure and
folly, before the most exellent and divine wisdom: to teach them to follow
after and to embrace learning and wisdom, even from their tender years, and
to be ashamed of misspending their precious time in play and idle vanities. So
in the second fable of the wolf and the lamb, to teach them to take heed all
their life long how they have to deal with or any way provoke cruel men, that
are too hard for them: Because they, when they list, can take any occasion to
prey upon them, or to do them a mischief, and that this is matter enough, If
they be not able to resist them. Thus likewise in the third fable of the mouse
and the frog, being at war together, about the regiment of the marish ground,
until the kite snatch them both away and devour them, to teach children in
all their time to beware of discord and dissension with others, especially
contention for superiority and preferment: Because such usually as will go to
wa^re, as it were, for every trifle, make themselves a prey to others,
especially to the common adversary. And but only to name the fourth, In the
Apologue of the dog swimming over the river, which through over much
greediness, chopping at the shadow of the flesh which he saw in the water,
lost the flesh it self which he carried in his chops, to teach children
always to take heed of too much greediness, and ever to keep a measure in
their desi^es, lest that by over much earnestness in seeking more than is
fit^e, they come to lose all and to repent when it is too late. Now beside this
sound wisdom, and besides all the other helps concerning the more certain,
easy, and speedy means of attaining the Latin tongue (as happy experience
has taught very many, who have given plentiful testimony hereunto; for
construing, pa^sing, making Latin, getting phrase and the like, by such
translations) they may learn hereby chiefly to make report of a fable, or of
any like narration, or history in good sort and fit words, which is no small
commendation to any whosoever. For the manner of effecting hereof, I have set
it down shortly in the Epistle to the Reader, and more fully in my
Grammar-schoole. And thus (that you may see my constant desire in creeping
forward by little and little, for perfo^ming my promise, in accomplishing my
service for the perpetual benefit of schools and of all posterity, by learning
still of all the learned to help the unlearned, and by propounding to all what
I have found by experience, that they may find the like and be partakers of al
my travels) have I presumed upon your love to present this little translation
unto you. Which you accepting accordingly I shall be more encouraged to strive
forward for perfecting of the whole, and to spend my last thoughts for the
common good. And thus with all thankful acknowledgement unto your self with
your worthy Lady and all yours I humbly take my leave, and rest

Your Worships in the Lord, I. Brinsley.

To the painful Schoolmaster.
FIrst, cause your scholar, by reading this translation, to tell you in every
fable what the matter of the fable is. Secondly, to what end and purpose it
was invented, what it is to teach, and what wisdom he can learn out of it.
Thirdly, how to make a good report of the fable, both in English and Latin,
especially in English. Fourthly and lastly, to make right use of it, for all
matters concerning Grammar, as for construing, parsing, making and proouing the
Latin; and so for reading forth of English into Latin, according to the
directions in my former translations, as namely* in Sententiae* Ca^o, Cord.
etc. And principally for observing the best phrases both English and Latin;
thus shall you receive your desire. Those things which are too harsh to be
uttered in English, word for word, according to the Latin phrase, I have
referred to the margent, with an Asteriske or little Star: and variety of
English phrase, I have set also in the margent, noted with a little r. But for
these I refer you to that which I have written in my former translations, and
in my Grammarschole. Vouchsafe me your better derection, in love; and what is
defective, I shall (God willing) labor to supply in the next edition.
