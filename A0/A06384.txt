The Constant Lover. Who his affection will not move, Though he live not where
he love.
To a Northern tune called, Shall the absence of my Mistress.


YOu loyal Lovers that are distant,
from your Sweet hearts many a mile,
Pray come help me at this instant,
in mirth to spend away the while,
In singing sweetly and compleately,
in commendation of my love,
Resolving ever to part never,
though I live not where I love.
My love she is fair and also virtuous,
God grant to me she may prove true.
Then there is naught but death shall part us,
and I Will never change her for a new,
And though the fates my fortunes hates,
and me from her do far remove,
Yet I do vow still to be true,
though etc.
My constancy shall never be falling,
whatsoever beside me here,
Of her virtue I Will be telling,
be my biding far or near,
And though blind fortune prove uncertain,
from her presence me to remove,
Yet I Will be constant every instant,
though etc.
Though our bodies thus are parted,
and asunder many a mile,
Yet I vow to be true hearted,
and be faithful all the while;
Though with mine eye I cannot spy,
for distance great my dearest Love,
My heart is with her altogether,
though etc.
When I sleep I do dream on her,
when I wake I take no rest,
But every moment think upon her,
she is so fixed in my breast,
And though far distance may be assistance,
from my mind her love to move,
Yet I will never our love disseuer,
though etc.
To think upon the amarous glances,
that have been betwixt us twain,
My constancy and love aduances,
though from her presence I remain,
And makes the tears with groans and fears,
from watery eyes and heart to move,
And sighing say both night and day,
alas I live etc.
The second part, to the same Tune,


I To her will be like Leander,
if Hero like she will prove to me,
For her sake through the would I Will wander,
no desperate danger I will flee,
And into the Seas with little ease,
the mountains great themselves shall move,
Ere says I break, let me never speak,
though etc.
Penelope shall be unconstant,
and Diana prove unchaste,
Venus to Vulcan shall be constant,
and Mars far from her shall be placed,
The blinded boy no more shall toy,
with Arrows keen lovers to move,
Ere false I be sweetheart to thee,
though etc.
The Birds shall leave their Airy region,
the fishes in the air shall fly,
All the world shall be at one religion,
all living things shall cease to dye,
Al things shall change to shapes most strange,
before that I disloyal prove,
Or any way my love decay,
though etc.
If you lines do come before her,
or do deigne to touch her hand,
Tell her that I do adore her,
above all Maidens in the land,
Remaining still at her good will,
and always to her loyal prove,
Tell death with dart do strike my heart,
though etc.
And tell my mistress that a Lover,
that loves perfect image bears,
As true as love it self do love her.
witness his far fetched sighs and tears,
Which forth he groans with bitter moanes,
and from his troubled breast he moves,
And day nor night takes no delight,
because etc.
So with my duty to her commended,
her loyal servant I Will be still.
Desiring I may be befriended,
with love again for my good will,
And with that she as true may be,
as I to her will constant prove,
And night and day I still will pray,
and wish I may live where I love

Fond Love why do thou dally: OR, The passionate Lovers Ditty, In praise of
his Love that's fair and witty.
To the tune of The mock Widow.


FOnd Love why do thou dally,
And mock my passions with thy disdain?
there is no bliss,
where coyness is,
Seek not thy pleasure in my pain:
But let the chaste torments of my desire,
Kindle in thee propitious fire:
So shall the pleasures of thy sweet embraces,
Conquer the grief of my former disgraces,
Then those storms past, shall mercy appear,
And thou of cruelty go quit and clear.
If not, thou art accused,
For being a lure of my grief and care,
for from thy sight,
comes my delight,
Thy frown only procures despair:
But in thy smiles there dwell eternal joys,
Which from my heart all floods of woes destroies,
Then be not thou obdurate unto me,
Seeing thou art my chief felicity:
Thou see how passionate I am for thee,
O then grant Love, forgetting cruelty.
Sweet love thou art my goddess.
To whom my heart I soly dedicate,
then morele send,
to me thy friend,
My sad grief to abreulate:
Then shall I praise thy goodly tresses,
Shining like gold as all the Gods confesses,
And eke the splendour of thy comely face,
Which does so well thy complete body grace,
As thou appear'st like Cynthia in her sphere,
Or like Apollo in the days bright chair.
The second part To the Same tune.
O how I am astonished,
To view the nature of my true love,
thy sweet face,
and comely grace,
World in an Angel envy move,
Thy eyes give luster these shadows ore-spread,
And thy sweet language would waken the dead,
The music of the spheeres is but a dull noise
When we shall hear thee, in thy sweetest voice,
Curious wondors within thee do shine,
Which do persuade me that thou art divine.
Juno the Queen of glory,
Cannot come near thee for thy virtuous grace:
thou art more fair,
in beauty rare,
And do deserve as well that place,
Wherein loves darling in her glory moves,
Thy hands far whiter then fair Venus Doves,
And thou thy self complete in each degree,
Upon thy forehead dwells rare Majesty:
Thou art indeed a lamye of heavenly wonder.
And for thy virtues keepst all creatures under.
All earthly joys and pleasures
Are to be had in thy society,
Lorina's name,
deserves true fame,
She is endued with piety,
Fairer she is by (...) then rocks of pearl.
love till this time nere saw a brauer Girl,
The Phoenix mate maked not a gayer show,
Nor yet the Lillies on the bank of Poe,
She is indeed the mirror of our age,
And with Jove's Queen may walk in equipage.
Wherefore should I dally then,
To court this glory, and to embrace,
even in thee,
all bliss I see,
Lively depainted in thy fare,
Come then lets dally, and to the wanton air,
Change loves delightments, so shall we declare
Our loves by our kisses, whist I nothing fearing
Breath my best wish, in my wished beauties hearing
Which when I have done thy captius I Will be,
Yet think I have a glorious liberty.
Come then, come my Lorina,
And yield that treasure, which who so knows,
knows a bliss,
by which he is
Eternally exempt from woes,
Should love himself envy at our best delight,
These joys we will enjoy still in enuies despite
Nay should his anger descend so upon me,
As my Lorina to ravish thee from me,
I Will fly in my fury as high as his sphere,
And snatch thee from his arms or perish there.
Come then let me enjoy thee

A New Ditty: Of a Lover, tossed hither and th there, That cannot speak his mind
when they are together.
To the Tune of, Hide Park.


ALas I am in love,
and cannot speak it,
My mind I dare not move,
nor nere can break it,
She does so far excel
all and each other,
My mind I cannot tell,
when we are together.
But I Will take heart to me,
I will reveal it,
I Will try her constancy,
I Will not conceal it,
But alas, but alas I do consider,
I cannot break my mind,
When etc.
Her loving looks and smiles,
has to bewitch't me,
Her virtue me beguiles,
she has inricht me,
She Is so fair, she is so rare,
her due to give her,
Makes me I cannot speak,
when etc.
Our often frequented jests,
are turned to earnest,
In 'thnight I cannot rest,
for loves severenesse,
It has turned, it has burned,
my heart for ever.
Alas I cannot speak,
when etc.
Like to the foolish Flies,
too long I have dallyed
With her bright glistering eyes,
my Fort she th sallied
That I have scorcht my wings,
and heart for ever,
Alas etc.
Her presence is my joy.

When I her face enjoy,
I am turned to gladness,
And with our compeny may last for ever.
but yet I etc.
The second part, to the same Tune


I Think she loves me well,
but I nere broke it,
I am sure I love her well,
though I nere spoke it,
And my love to her shall prove,
constant for ever,
Although etc.
Suppose she loves me not,
or loves another,
Too much yet care I not,
still I will love her,
And do vow to be true,
and faithful for ever,
Although etc.
I will do the best I can,
I Will strive to please her,
I will do any thing,
whereby to ease her.
Over Sea I will flee,
swim like Leander,
Before I Will loose her love,
through the world I Will wander.
And I Will do much more too,
if she will command it,
If 't be to lose my life,
I Will not gain stand it,
But alas, but alas,
I do consider,
I cannot speak my mind
when etc.
The more I strive to hide,
the more it shameth,
These pains I cannot bide,
my wits it lameth.
And if it hidden be,
will burn for ever,
Unless I speak my mind,
when etc.
I think twere good I tried,
and went to prove her,
And lay all fear aside,
stoutly to move her,
But when I am going to speak,
my tongue does quiver,
And will not break my mind,
when we are together.
