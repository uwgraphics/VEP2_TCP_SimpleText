An answer to a papystycall exhortacyon, pretendynge to avoid false doctrine,
under that color to maynteyne the same.

By there fruits shall ye know them.

Math. 7. EVerye pylde pedlar
Will be a medlar
Though there wits be drowsye
And there learning lowsye
There meters all mangye
Rash, rural, and grangye
Yet will they forward halte
As men mased in malte
These vile cannell rakers
Are now becumme makers
There poems out they dashe
With all there swyber swashe
There darnell and there chafe
There swylle and swynyshe draffe
Soche pype soche melodye
Soche bag soche beggerye.
Of pylde popyshe facyons
They strowe exhortacions
The people to infecte.
With the seeds of there sect
Pretendynge to dyffyne
Against the false doctrine
But soche dyrtye gear
Ded men never hear.
They teach not in meter
With Paul Johan and Peter
The world to edyfye
With gods word christenlye
But scripturs they deprave
As mad men that do rave
They dance with the devil
To magnysye there evil
They drysle forth a dram
As he that to Christ camme
To trappe him in a snare
Forsooth it is fond ware
Let christen men take heed
Unto there wicked sede
For they seek for to blind
The syllye simple mind,
The papystes title. An exhortacy on to avoid false doctrine.
The papyste. My mind can not perfughtelye endyre
Neither my pen can trewlye write
As my heart does desire.
The cause only is for lack of sight
In learning that is so perfyght and bright
Wherefore pardon of good me^ I required

The chrystiane. Your pen and your mind
Are both of one kind
And fyt for soche an heart
As owl in the night
Without gostly sight
Ye play a knauyshe part.
Attendite a falsie prophetis qui venisitad vos. Math. 7.

Of soche wolves beware
As lay forth a snare
Of outward holiness.
Queritis interficere homine^ q veritate^ locuius. John. 8.

For they do not else
But play the rebels
Against gods ryghteousnes.

The papyste. If any man else be grieved with this
Let them take it even as it is
And I pray God them to amend
I think with charity them to tell
As I find written in the gospel
To the law of God we should attends.

The chrystiane. Like a braynyshe dolte
Ye shote forth your bolte
As bold as bayarde blind
ye love the gospel
As the devil of hell
Here after we shall it find
Attendite popule meus legem meam. Psalm. 77

Attend to gods law
And to his word draw
All you that faithful be
Cauete a fermento Phariseorsi quid est hipo. Luc. 12.

The leven eschew
Of pharisees untrue
If ye love the veryte.

The papyste Some of late with them selves persuaded
Out of the shalowe so fair they waded
That they felt no ground.
They had thought us to have blinded
And of the truth us to have wynded
But now there deceytes be found.

The chrystiane. If people be ill
They shall be so still
For ought that ye bring here
Your doctrine is chafe
Your ryme dyrtye draffe
It is unsavory gere.
Linguis suis do lose agebant, iudica illos. Romans 3.

The language of lies
A false harlot tryes
To seek a wicked pray.
Sicut nouacula acutafecisti dolum. Psa. 51.

With colors to carpe
As a rasour sharp
To wype gods treuth away.

The papyste. Let no man be so styffe necked
To think him self so hyghly in lerning decked
Standing in his own conceyte.
For if thou or he be in the wrong
Thou nor he can not be so strong
But the devil for the has a beyte.

The chrystiane. Stand you where ye list
Ye are a papyst
In learning very basse
To cum for refuge
To soche a pylde judge
Is for to seek an ass.
Si lumen quod in te est tenebre sint. Math 6.

Your minds are so dark
Ye seek but the bark
And therein ye remain.
Velamen positum est super cor eorum. 2. cor. 3.

Ye hold fast the letter
And will have no better
The spyryt ye do dysdayne.

The papyste There were heretykes that never would cease
But from us to take unity and peace
So among us they did fight.
In there blyndenes so far gone they were
That of God they had no dought or fere.
All to destruction was there delyght.

The chrystiane. Is there one alive
Which can ye depryue
Of that ye never had*
Of strife and debate
Sedicion and hate
Your kind was ever glad.
Contritio and infelicitas in vijs eorum. Psalm. 9.

Ye labor and speak
To destroy and break
The vyneyarde of the lord
Vinea domini exercituum domus Israel est. Esa. 5.

Of the loss thereof
Ye make a but a scof
As Esaye does record.

The papyste. Christ wylleth us to take good head
Of these seducers for we had need
To^e the scripture and se.
From there folowers let us refrain
For small charity in them remain
As seems unto me.

The chrystiane. Your self is the sede
Of deceytfull wede
As your fruits does report
For less charity
In men can not be
Than in your popyshe sort.
Nemo vos seducatinan ibus verbis. Ephesians. 5.

The false craftye spies
Come in with there lies
All men of them beware
Venit hora, vt omnis qui interficit vos. Ioh. 16.

They have not there fylle
Till they slay and kylle
No innocents they spare.

The papyste. And a man against them write or speak
Some there be will him cruelly intrete
I maruele they are so bold
There was a thing made of late
Some had indignacion therate
And openly began to scolde.

The chrystiane. When we find ye bold
In your poperye old
Thereof we do ye tell
Your poets we touch
For shaking there pouche
And show whereof they smelle.
Imitantur illum, qui sunt ex part illius. Sap. 2.

They follow the devil
Which seek to do evil
And are upon his side.
Vos expatre diabolo estis, and opera. Ioha 8.

The proud papystes all
With the prestes of ball
Do take him for there gyde.

The papyste. But trewly it shall not a whyt sliylle
Let them babble even there fylle
It is so hot it may not abide.
For an heretyke will they defend
By the kings laws justly condemn
And say a christen man he dyed.

The chrystiane. Who are more bablars
And frautycke fablars
Than pratlynge papystes be?
We know none heretykes
Nor traiterous scysmatykes
But your affinite.
Nunquid potest homoigne^ absco^dere in sinue
The bosom has fire Prou. 6.

Of fleshly desire
Where spiritual fathers be*
Masculi relicto naturali vsu femine exarserunt. Romans 1.

With conscience aduste
They burn in there lust
And work much vanyte.

The papyste. Some be afraid his confession to show openly
In prynte the^ will not have it verily
The cause ones known.
To his part them selves somewhat bent
Now they fere they shall be shent
Soche gostlye seeds had they sown.

The chrystiane. Ye give dyrte for flynte
The thing is in prynte
That ye gruge at so sore
It is not unknown
What seeds ye have sown
In this realm here tofore.
Quod timetimpius, veniet supereum, Pro. 10.

That the wicked dought
Shall light on there snought
There church must have a fall.
Omnis plantatio quam non plantauit pate^* Math. 15

What God has not sown
Nor the gospel known
Shall be turned over all.

The papyste. Woe be to them that feign so outward
And be so pestylent enuyous inward
To a grave may I like them in deed.
That is without set full of goodly stones
Within full of stynkynge rotten bones
Look the gospel and tede.

The christian. Like these, ratte, and mouse
The poor wydowes house
Your bellyes does devour
Ye suck up the fat
For straynynge a gnatte
In your usurped pour.
Ve vobis, quia similes estis sepulcris de albatis. Mat. 23.

Who are the whyght graves
But soche romyshe knaves
And painted hypocrytes.
Audite verbum domini principes sodomoru^, Esa. 1.

As under pretense
Of chaste contynence
Do play the sodomytes.

The papyste. They that be full of iniquyte
Shall never com in christ's company
Except they do amend.
God commands those people to walk
That against men maliciouslye do talk
And with peace do contend.

The chrystiane. If Christ do refuse
All soche as abuse
The glory of his name
Ye chaplaynes of ball
Must needs have a fall
And come to utter shame
Discedite a me omnes q operamini iniquitate^. Math. 7

Ye lobbryshe lurkars
And idle workars
Hence fro me, says the lord
Frustra me colunt docentes doctrinas. Marc. 7.

Your own ways ye use
And my laws refuse
Like as your fruits record.

The papyste. Some heretylico of late as I think
Were loathe that there flesh should stynke
Above the earth or within
They looked ever and hoped for a day
But they were brent all three by the way
And taken in there own gynne.

The christian. Attraytours ye wynke
Natfelynge there stynke
So many as has been
For a day they wrought
When ye no less thought
Ye may know what I mean.
In insidijs suis capiuntur inique* etc* Pro. 10.

In your popyshe mask
The grande captain ask
Was trapped in his turn
Durum est tibi contra stimulum calcitra* act. 9.

Ye may se by this
What danger it is
Against gods *truth to spurn

The papyste. To speak of good works it were a shame
They loved not to hear of that name
But sola fides and none other
There tongues ran so much upon faith
But there hearts were far the^s as Crist says
There lyppes and hearts were far a sonder

The chrystiane. They never denied
Soche works as faith tried
But your apyshe fantasyes
Your tunges and your hearts
Pay neither good parts
In your lattyn memoryes.
Populus hic labijs me honorat cor eorum, Exe. 33.

Your labor of lyppes
Is so dry as chyppes
God does it not esteem.
Vostransgredimini mandatum dei propter Math. 15

Ye leave gods precepte
To have your own kept
Wherein ye do blaspheme.

The papyste. If thou wylt take the bible book
And upon saint James pystle look
There you shall I trow se
How faith is there trewly applied
And good works with him tied
Se how they do agree.

The chrystiane. Paul only of faith
Of works saint James says
God does us iustifye
Before God faith thanne
And works before manne
Concludes this controuersye.
Fides sine operibus mortua est, Iaco. ^2.

The works that you make
True faith do not wake
For why they are but chafe.
Nolite margaritas ponere ante porcos, Math. 7

Gods word does diffyne
That ye are but swyne
Yefede in s^oylle and draffe.

The papyste. If thou wylt a faithful christen man be
Look thou have faith, hope, and charity
And do thou good for ill
Let thy mouth and thy heart be without envy
That pleases God and the king let it please the
And his mind fulfill.

The chrystiane. All one are those three
And never dysgre
Where faith is roted fast
Our lord God and king
Ye have wayed nothing
In your old practyse past. Pro. 24

Time dominum filimi, and regem
My son of all thing
Fear God and thy king
Thus Solomon does say.
Achitophel contra David consilium dedit* 2. re. 17.

With achitophell
Ye papystes rebel
And all your kings betraye.

The papyste. To speak of holy bread and holy water
I intend not to meddle with that matter
But leave it as it is
Let us one for an other pray
With good hope as long as we may
That we may com to heuyns blys

The chrystiane. Old hooles do not cloute
Least ye be spyed out
But tarrye yet a time
Heuyn will not be got
With your psalms by note
Yt is to high to clyme.
Tu domine singulariter in speconstituistime, Psalm. 4.

All they hope in vain
That still do remain
In the dregs op popyshe laws.
Sapientia huius mundi stultitia est apud deum ^. cor. 3.

Live they never so long
There fryndes here among
They shall dye very dawes.

The papyste. To pray for them that this world has past
I think surely we may not be aghast
Look the scripture of I lie.
Read the Machabees softlye through out
And ye shall find it no doubt
If you your dylygencs do apply.

The chrystiane. Where Christ set no way.
For dead men to pray
It can not them avail
That the Machabees tell
Shall be no gospel
Where other scripturs fail.
Salubris est cogitatio pro defunctis exorate. 2. ma. ^2

To make any moan
For souls that are gone
It is unfaithfulness
Iustorum anime in manu dei sunt. ^api. 3.

For they feel no rod
In the hands of godde
But peace and quyetnes.

The papyste. I write not this intending to preche
Neither taking upon me any man to teache
My learning is not mete
But because under holy pretente
We should not hyde these heretykes offense
But tread it under our fete.

The christian. Ye utter soche trashe
And pylde haberdashe
As lay long in your mind
But look ye still hyde
All treason and pride
Of your old popyshe kind.
Noui^ dominus viam iustoru^, and iter impioru^. Psalm. 1.

All ways of the just
The lord has discuste
The prestes dwell in there dreams
Dereliquerunt fontem aque viue, and foderunt. Hie. 2.

In there donge they lie
Like boores in a stye
For mudde they leave the streams.

The papiste. They that think that barnes was holy
In there brains there is great folly
Judge other men what they can
Surely he was by him self alone
To contend with him duest not one
He was so proper a man.

The christian. As Paul does record
We are of the lord
To him we stand or fall
Take heed least ye swerue
For he does reserve
Right judgment for ye all
Abhominantur imp^ eos, qui in recta via sunt. Eccl. ^^

Ye wicked papystes
In your drowsye mystes
Abhor the simple sort
Quid nam est hoc? quae doctrina hec noua Marc. 1^

Ye do not regard
Gods word to be hard
But give it ill report.

The papyste. But if the devil were here and brent
Some would him pyteously lament
In there hearts they be so kind
His confession should be kept as treasure
And with some believed above measure
They are now so blind.

The christian. If they take his part
That scripture peruart
Stand you among his fryndes.
A dyrtye believe
To the blind ye give
To recreate there minds
Non est in ore eorum veritas, cor eorum van^^. Psalm. 5.

Your faith is so weak
No treuth can ye speak
But hate all godly ways
O pastor and idolum derelinquens gregem. Zach. 11

Ye rob christ's flock
And give them a mock
In all your iuglynge plays.

The papyste, All ill thoughts in our hearts let us eschew
And like true subjects to our prince co^tynue
We shall find it ease.
To his pleasure let us inclyne
And not against his acts to repyne
So God we shall please.

The chrystiane. The false fox that gawde
Does compass some frawde
By his false statterynge toys
Dyslemblars untrue
Many princes rewe
Among these worldly Joys
In cogitatione tua regi non detraha^ Eccl. 10.

Who does a king hate?
But papystes that prate
Against all godlynes
Sacerdotes beliscum suis co^cubinis in postura^. Dani. 14

Bellys dyrtye dyuynes
With there concubynes
Has wrought all fylthynes.

The papyste. There is not in the world so wide
Set this little land aside
That has so noble and gentle a king.
Wherefore let us all in one pray
Even to God both night and day
That long may he over vo be ^aygnynge.

The chrystiane. God save christen kings
From your practisynges
For myschef ye intend
Erom haters of treuth
Good seldom enseuth
Our prince the lord defend
Beatate* ra, cuius rex nobilis est. Eccl. 10.

Happy is that soil
Where christen men toil
Under a faithful king
Irritum fecistis pactum leui, propter quod* Mal. 2.

Where prestys do remain
And scripture dysdayne
It is an heavy thing.

Finis.
The appendyce or conclusyon.
NO bussarde so blind
But now sperueth his mind
Now comes hagge and tagge
And shakes out there bag
They turn out there trashe
And show there haberdashe
There pylde pedlarye
And scalde scullerye.
Our old romyshe ruste
Leapeth out of the duste
With a cankred face
All void of gods grace
Thinking ones again
In England to reyne
And be had in price
To maynteyne all vice.
Ser Johan now is bold
In yche place to scolde
Where men do not care
For pylde popyshe ware
He does them accuse
And say they refuse
The laws of the lord
Bringing false record
They have a new cast
The scripturs to wraste
And wrynge out of frame
To there utter shame
From treuth they do swerue
There purpose to serve
And care not for godde
Nor his ryghtfull rod.
Lord pity thy flock
Whom now the prestys mock
Stir up princes hearts
To stand on there parts
Least papystes have power
Thy lammes to deuowre
Whom upon the rood
Thou boutest with thy blood.
Amen.
God save the king.
