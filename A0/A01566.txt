LONDON Imprinted by William Hall for John Hedgets, 1612.

TO THE PEOPLE of REDBVRNE in the County of Hartford.
BRrethren, as heretofore I furnished you with a short Catechism: so now for
your further profiting in the means of your salvation, I have reuiewed the
same, and added to it a brief exposition of the ten Commandments, and of the
Articles of the Faith, and the Lords Prayer: hoping that as my care is to do
you good, so you will endeavor to profit by my labors: that as in mine old
age, my desire is to bring forth more fruits, as one planted in the house of
God: Psalm 92.13 14.
so I may see you to walk worthy of the Lord, and please him in all things,
being fruitful in all good works, Colos. 1.10
and increasing in the knowledge of God. And that when I shall examine you
before you come to the Lords Table, I may not find you so ignorant, as formerly
I found you, and your families: but that I may see the care you have had to
show your selves worthy of that favor which God has extended to you, by the
preaching of the Gospel hitherto: Heb. 13.17
that so I watching over your souls, as one that must give accounts unto God,
may do it with joy, and not with grief. And albeit that honorable Lady, the
Lady Anne Bacon be since departed this life, having finished her course, 2. Tim
4 7.
and fought that good fight, and kept the faith, and now rests with Christ;
yet you may acknowledge her Christian care to do you good, has taken effect
in some measure amongst you, in placing me over you, as your Pastor, by whose
painful labors you enjoy that which many want. And that when I am gone hence
to the Lord, as I attend daily the time of my dissolution: that worthy and
right Noble Gentleman Sir Frances Bacon her son may show the like care, in
placing over you a learned, godly, and painful Pastor, that may build you up
further till you grow to an holy Temple in the Lord. To whom with my continual
prayers for you, to keep you unspotted of this wicked world, I commit you all,
Redburn this 20. of March, 1611.

Your loving Pastor in Christ Jesus, RICHARD GAWTON.

concerning his Church.

Q. What are you taught to believe concerning God?

A. First, that there is but one true and eternal God, and that in the
Godhead, are three distinct persons, the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost.

Q What are you taught to believe concerning God the Father, the first person
in the Godhead?

A. First, that he is an immortal, and everlasting Spirit, John 4.24. 1. Tim.
1.17. who hy his only word created the Heavens and the Earth. Genesis 1.1. and
all things therein contained. Genesis 1.3. etc. to the 26. verse. And man after

vpholdeth, rules, and governs all things according to his will. Math.
6.26.28.32.

Q What are you taught to believe concerning the Son of God, the second
person in the Godhead?

A. I am taught to believe three things: First his Incarnation, by taking our
humane nature, he being conceived by the holy Ghost. Luke 1.35. in the womb
of the virgin Mary, having his name Jesus given him by the Angel, for that
he shall save his people from their sins. Math. 1 21. And Christ for that he
is the Messiah anointed of God to be our King, our Priest, and our Prophet.
Heb 1 1. and 2. and 3 who uniting our manhood to his glorious Godhead, is
become God and man in one person. John 14.10. Secondly, his humiliation to the
death of the Cross in our humane nature. Math. 27.24.25.26. etc. Mar. 15.15.
etc, Luke 23.24, etc. John 19.1. and 16.17.18. etc. Thirdly, his exaltation by

Luke 24 26 and sitting at the right hand of God the Father. Heb 12.2. having
all power given unto him both in heaven and earth. Math. 28.18. from whence we
are taught to believe that he shall come again at the last day Act. 1.11. in
glory to judge both those that then live, and those that have been taken away
by death since the beginning of the world. 1. These. 4.15.16.17.

Ioh. 14.26 and Sanctifyer of all the Elect. Romans 8.11.

Q What are you taught to believe concerning the Church?

A. I am taught three things. First, that God has a Church or company of
people, whom he has gathered to himself by the preaching of the Gospel
through all the world. John 17.6. and 20. and therefore is called Catholic or
Universal, and Holy; for that as God himself is holy, so holiness becomes
his house. 1. Pet 1 ^6. Secondly, that this Church is the Spouse of Christ, who
gave himself for it, that he might sanctify it, etc. Ephesians 5 25 26.27 And
thirdly, that in this Church there is a communion, or spiritual partaking of
all gifts and graces both of soul and body. 1 Cor. 12.4.5.6. And that only
the true members of this Church are assured of the forgiveness of their sins
by Christ. Act. 1.38. and that after their bodies be by death severed from
their souls, they shall rise again, John 5:28.29 and soul and body shall live

A. A lively feeling of our wants in the things we pray for. Rom 8.26. and
assurance by faith that God will hear our prayers, and grant our requests,
which we crave of him in the name of Christ agreeable to his Will. 1. John.
5.14 15.

Q. How shall we know what to pray for?

A. By that form of prayer which Christ has taught us in the Gospel. Mat 6 9
Luke 11.2.

Q. Rehearse the Lords Prayer.

A. Our Father which art in Heaven, etc.

Q. What does this form of prayer contain?

A. Three things. First, a Preface, Secondly, the Prayer it self in six
petitions, and thirdly, the conclusion of the Prayer.

Q. Which is the Preface?

A. Our Father which art in heaven.

Q What learn you in this Preface?

A. Three things. First, to pray to none but the only true God, the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ. Secondly, to assure us, that God is our merciful Father
in Christ, and therefore will hear our prayers, he being Almighty, and
therefore from heaven extending the tokens of his mercy to all that call upon
him in truth. Psalm. 115.3. Psalm. 135.6. Psalm. 145.18. And thirdly, I am to say
our Father, and not my Father alone, the better to assure me that God will
hear my prayers, since I pray as one that is a true member of his Church, as
all the rest of the same members pray for me, we all loving one another as
our selves. James 5.16.

Q. Which is the first Petition?

A. Hallowed be thy name.

Q. What desire we in this Petition?

A. First, that God will inlighten us with the knowledge of his holiness, and
secondly, as God is holy in himself, so he may be glorified of all men, as
the only fountain of all true holiness. And thirdly, that his power, wisdom,
goodness, mercy, justice and truth may be communicated to us, and all the rest
of his people, and that the fruits thereof may appear in our holy lives and
conuersations.

Q What is the second Petition?

A. Thy Kingdom come.

Q. What desire we in this Petition?

A. First, that God will set up his spiritual Kingdom in the hearts of us,
and all the Elect. Secondly, that we may show our selves Citizens of this
heavenly Kingdom, in being ruled and governed by his heavenly laws. And
thirdly, that he will protect his Church from all injuries, and overthrow all
the enemies thereof. And in the end glorify all his elect in his everlasting
Kingdom of glory.

Q. What is the third Petition?

A. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.

Q. What desire we in this Petition?

A. First that we and all the elect may have our wills conformed unto the will
of God, we renouncing our own corrupt affections and lusts, and being ready to
do our duties in our several callings, that so God may prosper the things we
take in hand according to his will. Secondly, albeit we cannot attain to
perform this as we should, that yet we set before us the holy Angels, and
labor to imitate them, that our imperfect obedience in this world may be
perfited in the world to come.

Q. Rehearse the fourth Petition?

A. Give us this day our daily bread.

Q. What desire we in this Petition?

A. As in the three first Petitions we asked things spiritual, and the setting
forth of Gods glory: So the other three Petitions concern our selves, and
therefore in this Petition, under the name of our daily bread, we ask all
things necessary for corporal food, and maintenance of our lives in this
world, and do cast off all mistrustfull care, and desire of worldly things,
depending on the providence of God, and his fatherly blessing of us in our
several vocations.

Q. Rehearse the fifth petition.

A. And forgive us our trespasses, etc.

Q. What desire we in this petition?

A. The free pardon and remission of all our sins, which otherwise might be
as a cloud between God and us, to hinder us from receiving any benefit at his
hands, Esa. 59.2. And it puts us in mind, that as we continually sin against
God, so we had need continually to ask pardon for our sins.

Q. Why is this added, as we forgive them that trespass against us?

A. To teach us, that we must be ready to forgive others, if we will have God
to forgive us. Mat. 6.14.

Q. Rehearse the sixth petition.

A. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

Q. What desire we in this petition?

A. That God will not permit us to be further tempted, either by the Devil or
wicked men, then he gives us strength to resist their wicked temptations.

Q. Rehearse the words of the conclusion of this Prayer.

A. For thine is the Kingdom, and the power, and the glory for ever.

Q. What learn you by this conclusion?

A. It serves for the confirmation of my Faith, that God both can and will
grant the things I have prayed for.

Q. Whereby is your faith so confirmed?

A For that first I believe, that God being our King, is both able and willing
to grant our requests. And secondly, for that it serves to extol and advance
the power and glory of God, in that he hears the humble petitions of his
Children, and grants their requests. Psalm. 32.8 Psalm. 65.2.

Q Why is this word Amen added?

A To show that we rest wholly upon God, as upon our merciful and loving
Father in Jesus Christ, and therefore doubt not, but he will do, as we have
prayed.

Q Having heard that the continual hearing of Gods word preached, prayer, and
the use of the Sacraments are the means to increase in us a lively faith: let
me hear now what you call Sacraments?

A Sacraments are outward Signs, ordained of God to be unto us as seals of
the inward and invisible graces he bestowed upon us for the confirming of our
faith in the assurance of our salvation by Christ. Genesis 17.11. Romans 4.11.

Q How many such Sacraments are there?

A Two: to wit, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord. 1. Cor. 10.1.2.3. Math.
28 19. 1. Cor. 11.23.24 25.26.

Q What is the outward Sign in Baptism?

Q What is the invisible grace signified?

A The washing of our sins, Act. 2.28 Reu. 1.5. Mat 3.11. And our ingrafting
into Christ. Romans 6.4. And our dying unto sin, and living unto
righteousness. Romans 6 5 and 11.

Q. Why are Infants baptized?

A. For that the covenant of eternal life, pertains not only to believing
Parents, but also to their seed. Genesis 17 7. 1 Cor. 7.14

Q Why is Baptism administered but once in our lives?

A For that our Regeneration, whereof Baptism is a seal, continues for ever.
Romans 6.9.10.11.

Q What is the outward Sign in the Lords Supper?

A Bread and Wine, put apart to that holy use. 1. Cor. 11.23 and 25.

Q What be the invisible graces thereby signified?

A Our spiritual nourishment by the body and blood of Christ. 1. Cor. 10.16.
John 6.53.54 55 56.

Q Why is the Supper of the Lord administered often?

A To put us in remembrance of the death and passion of Christ, and to assure
us, that the benefit thereof pertaines to us, Luke 22.19. 1. Cor. 11.24 and 26.

Q What is to be required of such as offer themselves to be partakers of the
Lords Supper?

A That they examine themselves what measure of knowledge they have in all the
principles of Christian Religion, 1 Cor. 11.28. and specially of the
Sacraments. 1. Cor. 10 15 16.

Q Is that knowledge sufficient?

A This will teach them, that without faith it is impossible to please God,
Heb. 11.6. and therefore that they come not without faith and the fruits
thereof, with an unfeigned repentance and charity. Phil. 1 9. and 11 1 Cor.
13.13. Matthew 5.25. Luke 15.8. Galat. 5 6.

Q Wherein stands true repentance?

A In two things: First an unfeigned sorrow and remorse of conscience for our
former sins, 2 Cor. 7.10 Psalm. 51.2.3. and 17. Secondly a true conversion and
turning to God, in an holy life and conversation. To. 6.19. Ephesians 4.22.23. Tit.
2.11.12

Q. Wherein stands charity?

A In two things: First to love God, who has loved us so dearly, as to give
his only son Christ to be our Savior and Redeemer. 2. Cor. 5.14 15. Gal.
5.22.23.

Q What is the second thing?

A To love all men unfeignedly, even our enemies, To. 12 10. and 20 and
therefore we are to cut off all occasions of discord and dissension, by
reconciling our selves to all such as we have offended, Mat 5 25. and 44 and
freely forgiving all those who any way offended us, even as God freely for
Christ's sake forgave us. Colos. 3.12.13.14.

Q What danger is there in coming unworthily to the table of the Lord?

A The unworthy receiver is guilty of the body and blood of Christ, and eats
and drinks his own damnation. 1. Cor 11.17. and 29.

Q What benefit has the worthy receiver?

A First his faith is confirmed, Romans 4.11. he is filled with joy in the holy
Ghost, A and 4.31. and 2 38. and gets new strength against sin and Satan.
Secondly he has peace of conscience, being assured of Gods fatherly love and
protection in this world, and of eternal glory after this life.

FINIS.
