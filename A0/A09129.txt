otherwise called Eustas, who was martyred for the Profession of Jesus Christ.

Gathered in English verse by John Partridge, in the year of our Lord. 1566.

JMPRINTED at London, by Henrye Denham, for Thomas Hacket: and are to be sold
at his Shop in Lumbarde streate.

To the worshipful Arthur Dwabene, Merchant venturer, his seruante and daily
orator John Partridge wishes increase of worship, by his worthy travail.
WHat time, right Worshipful, the most excellent Philosopher of ye world,
Democritus was demanded of a friend, what was the chiefeste best amongeste men
in all the world, verily (quoth he) a pacient man in misery. The other
replying, and demanding the cause of that his assertion, he answered and
said: either he is not in misery at all, or else armed most strongly and
surely against all adversities what so ever they be, that shall happen unto
him. By patience, says he, of a thousand euilles he is not at all any whit
molested. Anaxagoras the Philosopher, borne of a noble stock, and son to
Eubullus, who in Philosophy did exceed, says that he himself could find
nothing more excellent in war, than this one thing, that is, a Soldier to be
hardy, and also chiefly above all other things, the same to be like wise
trusty and pacient to endure travail, pain, and other kind of miseries that
shall happen or befall unto him in that conflicte of war in which he then is
conuersaunte. Alexander I mean the great, having made war against the
Persians and of the^ had made great slaughter, the king of Persia being of a
noble courage bold, stout, pacient and hardy, having taken a castle or hold
for his defense, and being in time brought in subjection to the Macedonians,
was demanded of Alexander in what point he saw himself not to be overcome,
to whom the King of Persia answered on this wise: Sir king, in no point at all
am I overcome. Alexander hering him say so, demanded if he had not lost both
friends, cu^tries, castles, towns, and all things else, yes verily (quoth he)
and yet am I not ouerco^e: for though they al be gone, yet can I with patience
bear the loss of the same. Oh great was the patience of this King, yet
verily nothing in comparison of his, whom I have taken to write upon.
Therefore I deeming nothing more fyt for a good nature than to set forth so
notable a fact of patience, as this was, have at the request of a special
friend of mine, drawn the same though rudely yet hoping not without some
profit, either of my self, or of some other. And because that to every castle,
town, city, work or workemanshippe, there belongs defense: and knowing
that defense can not be made without some one defender, I am so bold
(consydering mine own weakness) to dedicate this my simple work unto your
worship, that your wisdom may be the defense thereof against the rancorous
Zoilictes, which at all times from the beginning have been ready to breathe
the fylth of their cancred stomachs upon those most famous works of the
excellentest clearkes that ever were, whose books I am not worthy to bear,
knowing likewise that if those went not fre, mine can not. Therefore I hoping of
your worships defense, am boldened the more in prosecuting of the same. Thus
trusting to your goodness, I end, desiring God to maintain your estate, and
send you long life and good health, to his pleasure and your hearts desire.

Your humble servant, John Partridge.

To the Reader.
LEt patience increase by kind,
within thy doleful breast:
Let that sweet dame within thy bower,
have her abiding neast.
Consider, view and understand,
what liquor does descend:
Out of her wells, from perils great,
the same will thee defend.
The stinking band of foul despair,
thy state shall not molest:
Ne slaughter in thy gates shall not,
to strike be ready pressed.
For Socrates does plain declare,
no other good to be:
Than wrapped in woes and pinching cares,
a pacient one to see.
The^ saints have showed what patience is,
how precious in Gods sight:
In stories we may read and find,
how much they did delight,
For to be found in miseries,
in patience to dwell:
Whereof to us this story does
most plainly show and tell.
What patience had Job I find,
such patience is rare:
A thousand Martirs I with him,
may very well compare.
What was the patience of those,
whom flashing fiery flames:
Bereft of life, yet could it not,
at all extinct their fames.
For fame sor good desert does rest,
behind though they be gone:
Because we might pursue the like,
and often think thereupon.
Therefore let us pursue the same,
and then we shall be sure:
For to possess that glorious crown,
that lastes and shall endure,
After that earth, yea birds and beasts,
shall be consumed to naught:
Which crown to us O Lord do grant,
that with thy blood us bought.
The verdicte of the Book.
Learn here thou shall one God most his
To rule the heavens the earth and all:
The Sun, the Moon, the starry Sky,
Subject to be unto his call.
Of patience likewise read thou shall,
Which is a gift of all most pure:
Above the rest I thee ensure.
Gods providence here thou shall know,
His great good will I do declare:
His mighty force I plain do show,
Read on therefore and do not spare.
Though that my skill be very bare,
Yet fruit hereby well take you may:
If it to read you will essay.
In whom to put thy trust be bold,
In whom to joy here thou may see:
A treasure passing any gold,
Or precious stones what that they be.
The same I do declare to thee,
To read me therefore take some pain:
And that I count my authors gain.
Farewell my friends for for your sakes,
My author has abroad me sent:
I pass not for all crabbed crakes,
That Zoilus to make is bent.
For all for you my author meant,
When that in hand his pen he took:
And out this story first did look.
Patienter ferenda quae mutari non possunt

The noble History of Plasidas.
Sometime in Roman land there was,
a king of noble fame:
Who was full fair in martial feats,
and Trayan had to name.
Who under him of lusty Knights,
did keep a comely train:
And over them he poynted has,
one knight as Captain.
This knight to name had Plasidas,
one whom the king did love:
For martial feats that in this knight,
did shine the rest above.
A wife he had of glistering hew,
of shape both fair and trun:
Of loving mind, of gladsome heart,
and trusty unto him.
By her he had two children fair,
surmounting Phoebus bright:
Who for their manly courage stone,
compare with him they might.
The proverb old is verified,
upon these babies twain:
By splendent courage they assay,
their honors to maintain.
The father he before does strive,
to run a happy raze:
The manly children parent like,
do follow on apace.
And sekes for to obtain the crown,
of honor and of praise:
Which to atchicue the noble hearts,
endeavor still always.
They spend their time with joy and bless
their labor they employ:
According to their parents minds,
their hope and perfect joy.
Such books these babes did learn to read
as present time did give:
Which might their tender years trade by
in Mametrie to live.
Thus they in whom all tenderness,
of age did still remain:
Were taught the labor tedious,
of study to stustaine.
The parents eke employ their days,
good learning to attain:
And now and then they find pastime,
their griefs for to restrain.
Sometime on hunting he does ride;
sometime to Chesse they go:
Sometime great doutes they do decide,
that in the Realm might grow.
This was the use of Plasidas,
his mind to recreate:
This used eke his children dear,
O blessed happy fate.
The stormy winter days has left,
with misty clouds to swell:
And Phoebus bright appointed is,
more nearer us to dwell.
And Eolus no pleasure takes,
to dim the air with clouds:
And Phoebus now is quite deudide,
of fogges his beams that shrowdes.
Then does Aurora leave the bed
of Titan, and does bring:
Some joys to men, the wished day
beholding once to spring.
And trees and herbs with joyful heart,
do show their pleasant hew:
And Knights in Forests bend their force
the Bucke for to subdew.
Then Plasidas with comely train,
of knights of royal kind:
Do enter now the green Forestes,
a Bucke forth for to find.
At length he came where bucks great store,
did stand confusedly:
And each man now does bend him self,
his lusty Stead to try.
Now here and there the harmless Buck,
assayeth for to run:
And Plasidas at one fair Bucke,
to ride he has begone.
The other knights amongst the Buckes,
in fields abroad do raunge:
But Plasidas follows hard,
this Bucke and will not change.
At length in thickst of woods I say,
the Bucke does enter in:
And then more fiercely her to sew,
this knight does straight begin.
Till at the last the Bucke had took,
a Mountain huge and hye:
And there the huge and lofty Bucke,
Plasidas did discry.
But as he was addicted sore,
the Bucke with force to take:
The mighty God in Skies above,
his servant did him make.
And out from clouds he called to him,
his Idolles to detest:
Which by and by fell in a swoune,
and so he left the beast.
Then there he laid his sprangling corpse,
almost deuoyde of breath:
I am thy God then said the Lord,
which bought thee with my death.
My very blood does justify,
in me thou have thy life:
Go wend in have the Lord can say,
convert thy Heathen wife.
Thy children eke let them be taught,
one God to honor pure:
Then thou my kingdom shall possess,
hereof thou may be sure.
Where thou shall live eternally,
if thou this life detest:
And shall if thou fight manfully,
for aye with me be blessed.
Arise therefore go wend in have,
this life is but as grass:
To day full fair (her glistring hew,)
to morrow quite is past.
Those stocks and stones the which thou do
as Coddes adorn with praise:
Are in my sight Idolatrous,
therefore eschew those ways.
Arise I say and get thee hence,
make have thee to baptize:
And see thou do convert thy wife,
I say in any wise.
Apalled sore with fear and dread,
the Knight straight ways did say:
Have mercy Lord, and me forgive,
I hartly do thee pray.
Stand up thou knight then said the Lord,
thy sins remitted be:
Do thou not fear for Satan will,
thee plague with misery.
Then down he sat with stretched hands
to God he gave the praise:
And said, to thee that sittes on hye,
be honor due always.
That have vouchsafe this day to call,
thy servant gone astray:
Even as a sheep by fortune strayed,
out of the herd away.
I do confess thou only art,
my comfort and my trust:
And eke my God, and thy promise,
thou kepest true and lust.
No part thereof thou violatest,
thou art both God and man:
These stocks, these stones be Devils yil,
do us no good they can.
Thee therefore I do worship still,
thou made the world of naught:
And I the Image of thy grace,
that thou of earth have wrought.
I do confess my heavenly king,
that no good is in me:
But that the goodness which I have,
does all discende from thee.
Without thy grace and goodness, I
no day at all can say:
But that I should be overthrown,
and brought to deaths decay.
But thou O God art my defense,
my aid, my hope, and trust:
Thou art my king, my God, my Lord,
my savior true and just.
O Lord I know that Satan will,
with cares my soul molest:
But thou O Lord in patience,
defend my careful breast.
Let me with patience still abide,
thy gracious laysure good:
And grant also to me full hope,
in thy most precious blood.
That what so ever illes do hap,
unto thy servant here:
With willing mind the burden huge,
with patience I may bear.
Grant also that despair do not,
molest my quiet state:
Ne that I should in any wise,
incur thy heavy hate.
But give me Lord a mind always,
obedient for to be:
Unto thy hest, and to submit
my will always to thee.
So shall I be a most fit branch,
ingraffed in the tree:
Of living days, and at the last,
shall ever reign with thee.
To whom be praise eternally,
both now and ever more:
One only God though persons three,
as I have said before.
Then at the last this noble knight,
from Forest made return:
And thought within his hunting race,
no longer to soiourne.
But home he commes in posting wise,
The knights they after hye:
And some the chase will follow on,
the end thereof to try.
The mighty Buckes lie dead on launde.
the Palfrayes they do sweat:
And from their frothy mouths they breath
the inward partching heat.
Now here now there with lance in hand,
the marshall knights do run:
And at the last they have espied,
how Plasidas did come.
From out the groves so green which was
beset with many a tree:
With heavy chere much like unto,
a man in misery.
When they perceived well that he,
with sorrow was infect:
They mused much, yet of that hapte,
they nothing did suspect.
Then home they go and some do lade,
the pray that they have slain:
And other some for their repastes,
in Forcestes do remain.
At length Plasidas does ariue,
before his Castle gate:
His wife to welcome home her Love,
is ready sone thereat.
From gate to Hall they do ascend,
and there the bourdes be spread:
The sun is down, and time it is,
for men to go to bed.
The chamberlaynes the bed down lay,
and fire in chamber make:
And now Plasidas he is come,
his corporal rest to take.
When he in bed had layne a while,
great griefs he did sustain:
And se at length his mind to break,
he purposes certain.
At length his wife perceyning that,
no rest her Mate could find:
She did procure him for to show,
what dread was in his mind.
At length he said, oh loving mate,
the cause since thou would know:
Of these my cares so huge and fell,
to thee them I will show.
This day (quoth he) as I abroad
in Forest thick did run:
A mighty Burke his race to take,
before me has begun.
At whom I sued with all my might,
and force that I could make:
At length the Bucke for his defense,
the densid woods does take.
And there the Bucke I do pursue,
on lofty steed amain:
Till that the top of one great hill,
he seeks to attain.
And there from out the skies did break,
a voice like thunders cry:
For fear whereof almost my breath,
to Skies away did fly.
Quoth he I am thy very God,
ne made but being still:
Both heaven and earth, yea Skies and al
obeyes unto my will.
I made them all, and thee O man,
as Lord of earth to be:
The fish, the fowls, the birds, the beast,
shall all obey to thee.
And for the love which I thee bare,
my Image I thee made:
A living soul the life whereof,
away shall never fade.
Thus art thou now my Image pure,
and I thy Lord and king:
Thou art the sheep whom I do love,
above all earthly thing.
By this my love I did declare,
when thou wast utterly:
Condemned for thy wickedness,
eternally to dye.
I loved thee so that I did take,
a servant shape on me:
For to be slain even as a sheep,
at Sacrifice we see.
And thou unkind forgetting quite,
what I for thee have done:
Have made thee Gods, and of vile earth,
a God is now become.
Yet I because I tender thee,
And rewe thy heavy fall:
Uouchsafe again thee to the fold,
once more from sin to call.
Repent therefore and learn to know,
thy God, thy Lord, and King:
So shall thou with him eterne live,
where Angels holy sing.
Forsake thy Idolles and become,
a Christian now at last:
And I Will remitte and quite forgive,
thy wickedness forepaste.
Arise therefore go wend in have,
make speed for to convert:
Thy gentle wife, that honor she,
may me with all her heart.
O Lord (quoth I) if Satan do,
with care my corpse molest:
Be thou my aid, let patience still,
abide within my breast.
Do thou defend our sinful corpse,
O Lord we thee desire:
That by thy death unto the crown
of life we may asspire.
Then said the Lord with troubles great,
Satan shall thee anoye:
By fraud in friendship such as erst,
with thee were wont to toye.
And speak thee fair, with cap and knee,
at every word do make:
Now in thy fall and misery,
their flattering leaves shall take.
And not content with railing voice,
reproachful words to say:
But eke are bent to spoil thy Tent,
thy goods to bear away.
Which thou shall by my grace divine,
with patience bear thy loss:
And at the length when I see tune,
I Will take away this cross.
And will again in former state,
thee place with joy and bless:
With double fold, and shall again
possess thy lost richesse.
Then down I fell in swouning there,
and loud and shirle I cried:
Oh Lord thy servant will I be,
hap me what will betide.
These were the words when sacred tops,
of mountains great and tall:
He left, O Plasidas go home,
thy wife see that thou call.
Then said his wife, my loving Lord,
O Plasidas so true:
He is the God of heaven and earth,
that did appear to you.
For yester night as I did lie,
in bed with heavy mind:
Me thought before me one most fair,
in chamber I did find.
Appalled sore twixt fear and dread,
at length to me he spoke:
And said, O Theapis from sleep,
and brousinesse awake.
To morrow shall thy husband dear,
what I am well perceive:
I am thy Christ and went his way,
and thus he took his leave.
This for to show my loving Lord,
I durst no whit to thee:
Least happily thou might have thought,
in me some injury.
But now I know and well perceive,
that that was Christ in deed:
He is of God coequall mate,
and eke of David's seed.
To him therefore with thanks giving,
on Flutes and Pypes full shrill:
Our Sacrifices unto him,
on Aultars will we kill.
This is the Prophet which to us,
full long was prophesied:
This is the very son of him,
who Stars in Skies does guide.
Therefore my Lord if that thee please,
of baptism let us take:
The sacrament, and then let us,
our Country soil forsake.
Then said the knight, fair dame at hand,
does rest a clarke of fame:
A Minister of sacred rightes,
who Buno has to name.
A comely man, of faith most pure,
to him straight we will wend:
For rightes of Baptism to receive,
I verily do pretend.
Our children eke he baptize shall,
according unto right:
And thus to him they went in have,
in midst of the night.
And when they baptism had received,
as now the manner is:
Plasidas, Eustas had to name,
his wise is Theapis.
His children eke whom nature made,
of beauty passing fair:
Were tender ones, the one Agapite,
Theospite was the heir.
Thus baptism done unto their house,
again they do repair:
And there in peace a while they live,
both honestly and fair.
At length the sturdy boystrous blastes,
of Satan gins to rore:
Even as the water from a hill,
or as a mighty Bore.
Which of some wight received has,
a wound both huge and great:
Or as the flashing waves of floudes,
that craggie rocks does beat.
With hurling here and there her streams,
indeuoring for to wear:
The ragged banks which of their floudes,
the crabbyd rage does bear.
Much like unto a battle made,
a City for to get:
And munition with burning strokes,
to sack the walls is set.
And breach is made, and houses burn,
and soldiers now begin:
For joy of spoil, by vital breath
not for to set a pin.
Or else when as a Lion great,
does range with angry mood:
With hungry chawes amid the woods,
does seek to have his food.
And he that first within his sight,
appears that he may see:
With gasping mouth on him he runs,
devoured for to be.
So Satan now in roaring wise,
on Plasidas does run:
His sheep and cattle for to slay,
already has begun.
Then Plasidas to poverty,
is brought the ready way:
And eke when that his feigned friends,
perceived his decay,
They run his house to spoil and sack,
his goods they bear away:
Even those whom he had feasted erst,
before his great decay.
These pampered churles that sit all day,
at tables dayntie fed:
Who by all mischievous crabbed guiles,
with stinking heart is led.
Whom neither love ne hate can drive,
from out the Castle door:
They learned have so for to row,
with the Athenien oar.
I may such persons well compare,
unto a pype or tonne:
That has good wine to outward sight,
in which there is poison.
For they themselves so beautify,
their words in inward show:
But poison much is hyd therein,
as afterward we know.
Thus Plasidas from great renoume,
to poverty is brought:
And where he was a royal Knight,
now is he worse than naught.
Thus then when shame had ouertoke,
this worthy knight, then lo:
In midst of all the darkesome night,
from house and friends they go.
To water side, and there do wait,
when lofty ship shall glyde:
On foming seas, the wind is good,
for them on seas to ride.
They do inquire if any ship,
to country far will wend:
To whom the Master answer made,
that straight they did intend,
To hoyse their sails and to depart,
to Egypt in all have:
Agreed they are, they hoyse their sails,
to sail away at last.
The land they leave, into the deep,
they lance with wind at will:
The mighty ship the hollow waves,
at every surge does fill.
The night is gone and day is come,
wherein each thing does joy:
And here the lusty fish begin,
at painted pupe to toy.
With fetching frischoes here and there,
with spready finne in sea:
And seems who fastest should swim,
some wager for to lay.
They sailed have and now at length,
near Egypt they ariue:
The Master of the ship does like,
the beauty of the wife,
Of Plasidas, and does delight,
his wavering wanton mind:
With rolling in his diue lish brain,
the beauty of her kind.
She pleased has his lothfull eyes,
with beauties shining beams:
Fro whence sometime did issue out,
of tears abundant streams.
Then at the last when unto land,
they drew, and plain did see:
The touret tops, and knew full well,
how far from land they be.
The Master of the ship did say,
you passangers we see:
That nere to land our ship is come,
therefore now ready be.
For that you have your fraught to pay,
as due it is by right:
Come on sir boy, lance out this boat,
the town is here in sight.
The anchor then through flashing flood,
a way does may does make for hold:
And there to ride from dangers great,
the Master is full bold.
The Master and the Mariners guide,
the cock boat unto land:
Then he his freight for to receive,
he stretches forth his hand.
Yet naught at all from Plasidas,
might hap in any ways:
For all was gone, and naught was left,
before he took the seas.
Why Plasidas the Master said,
thy wife I Will have away:
If that thou will not out of hand,
my duty to me pay.
Then out of hand he took his wife,
Plasidas being on shore:
And said, ye friend thou shuldst have sought
thy frayght to pay before.
Therefore I say thy wife with me,
away from hence shall wend:
With whom Plasidas all in vain,
did labor and contend,
To keep her still, the Master straight,
his Mariners bad to bring:
Plasidas lo in midst of seas,
by furious force to fling.
So that his wife the Master he,
at will might then possess:
His wilfulness brought him his death,
in the end as I do guess,
Well Plasidas must needs depart,
whether he will or nay:
For money none at all he had,
as then, the frayght to pay.
But from the shoares of surging seas,
with heavy mind does wend:
And for to live in Egypt land,
he verily does intend.
With his two babes of tender years,
so fair in natures grace:
The one on fathers arms hanging,
does follow on a pace,
The other he does run before,
with every grass to play:
His father merry for to make,
all means he does assay.
At length where flashing streams of floods,
the shoares does clean divide:
They are arrived, and there they stand,
the manner to decide,
How for to pass those troublesome waves
for needs that way he must:
Unto the town, O Fortune thou
to good men never just,
Who erst a loft in chair of state,
was wont in peace to sit:
Is now in floudes of misery,
and thou not leaving it,
Do add more care unto his pain,
thy fashion it is so:
Because thou would that all men should
take thee for friend nor foe.
What mourning makes ye wight good lord
whom wife is borne fro:
And taking up his youngest son,
from doleful shoares does go.
To the other side where woods and trees,
on fertile ground does stand:
He is arrived, and there does set,
his tender child on land.
And entering now the rushing waves,
that soundes with noise so shrill:
He does approach the hollow waves,
in myddest thereof to fill.
When he in myddest was thereof,
there came a Woulfe and took:
The tender child who late before,
was borne over the brook,
And bare away, but God who made,
the heaven, the earth and all:
Did so provide that once no hurt,
unto it should befall.
He seeing then his child was gone,
with doleful mind he cride:
Oh wicked wretch and miser vile,
what shall of me betide?
And coming now to the other side,
his eldest son to catch:
A Lion huge from wood does come,
and the other up does snatch.
Which straight does trudge from thence away,
unto the wood again:
A heavy sight for Plasidas,
in this his doleful pain.
But Plasidas pore soul does strive,
his child to get again:
But he pore wretch of very truth,
labors all in vain.
When that he saw no help there was,
good Lord he does lament:
But mighty God the child to save,
has rescue ready sent.
The country men that were as then,
a plowing in the field:
The heard men eke that sheep did keep,
did stand and all beheld.
Where as a Lion huge did run,
and eke with him did bear:
A manly child, and looked as though,
in pieces he would tear.
Then out they sent their hungry dogs,
the Lion to overtake.
And so at length the Lion he,
the child did quite forsake.
The Woulfe likewise to bear the child,
already has begun:
Through mydst of the plow men there,
and they at him do run
With battes and staves, the pray he left,
and there the child they found:
A comely wight, no hurt he had,
But was both whole and sound.
The plowe men and the heard men both,
are joyous of this thing:
That chanced has, and to the town,
the children both they bring.
There they declare how that they took,
these tender babes of age:
From beasts full fierce, and how they brought
them home to their village.
These men they were both of one town,
and set the babes to schole:
To learn such things as after they,
thereby their life might rule.
Now leave we here a while and stay,
and let us further hear:
Of Plasidas how he does range,
in doleful heavy cheer.
He passed is the watrie streams,
of that unhappy shore:
With sobbes and tears his cares and smart,
increases more and more.
And then at last upon the ground,
prostrate on face he lies:
Have mercy Lord on me vile wretch,
continually he cries.
Thou god that made both heaven and earth,
the sea and eke each thing:
Which all the winds from out their caves,
and hollow rocks do bring.
That made the world and eke each beast,
that lives now therein:
Who make pore, and eke do cause,
of pore to rise a King.
Who made the Sea, the fish, the foul,
that flies under the Skies:
Who rules the very jaws of beasts,
in whom all force now lies.
Who placed first the heavenly throne,
of thy Gothead divine:
Who eke has made within the world,
both hours, days and time.
Thou that did make the firmament,
with Stars shining so bright:
Thou that for day did make the Sun,
men's steps to guide aright.
Thou that have made the planets seven,
in spheres to run their race:
Thou that next to the crooked Moon,
the burning flame do place.
And next to it a vacant place,
where air does all abound:
The water eke which compass does,
the heavy massiue ground.
That have to man such power given,
thy noble works to know:
And yet on him of thy good grace,
do daily more bestow.
Grant unto me thy servant here,
one spark of thy good grace:
That in this land I may now find,
some joyful resting place.
Even I that wretch who is deuoyde,
of wife and children twain:
Give patience Lord, to me pore wretch,
though languished in pain.
Have mercy on my children dear,
where so their corpse shall lie:
Have mercy on their parent eke,
who lives in misery.
This said, unto the town he goes,
and ceasseth not to weep:
For children twain, at last he comes,
in midst of the streate.
And there the men of that same town,
do Plasidas desire:
To keep their sheep, and so he should,
of them receive his hire.
Agreed they are, and Plasidas,
his sheep full well does know:
And now forthwith unto the fields,
his sheep and he do go.
Now leave we hear of Plasidas,
in shepheardes weed for gain:
Sometime he was a noble Lord,
but now more pore certain.
But now we forth will show the mean,
how God did all provide:
For mother and the children eke,
as it may well be spide
In end, for lo, the fatal wretch,
has his reward with gain:
His great desire was once the cause,
why that his corpse was slain.
For when on lofty roaring waves,
he was with wind at will:
He then in have would straight assay,
his lust for to fulfill.
But as he would by force of arms,
have wrought the deedely act:
The mighty God with death repayde,
this his purposed fact.
And there in ship all dead he lies,
whose lust did cause his woe:
The mariners lament this case,
and eke to land they go.
With her, on shore to set, and eke
more victuals for to buy:
When wind is fair to cuntry soil,
again that they may hye.
And much they praise her constancy,
her beauty and her grace:
Her faithfulness unto her Love,
in this her heavy case.
The Lord they praise and honor him,
with all their might they have:
That so of his benignity,
his blessed flock can save.
Then when to shore their boat was come,
she there her leave does take:
And willingly not with them any
longer soiorne to make.
Does wend unto a town thereby,
intending there to live:
Until that God shall see his time,
her from her cares to meue.
Thus fiftene years all desolate,
she lives in widows ray:
Her honest life not one there is,
in all that town that may
Distaine. And lo it so befell,
since Plasidas was gone:
That enemies the Roman land,
do vex and war upon.
At whom the King envying sore,
does war on them begin:
But all in vain his travel was,
he lost, and naught could win.
Then of his Knight good Plasidas
to think he does begin:
And wishing always that he were,
in Roman land with him.
At length the King does send abroad,
through many a place and town:
His lusty Knights in have to seek,
Plasidas of renown.
And bring him home to Roman land.
where erst he was the Knight:
That did most harm unto his fees,
by mortal dint of fight.
And who that finds the same in end,
the king would honor give:
With riches eke in honor great,
all days of life to live.
Within the army of the King,
two Knights there were certain:
Who ever under Plasidas,
in wars did much remain.
They into Egypt land do go,
some news for to hear tell:
Of Plasidas, and lo they chance,
in streate where he does dwell.
And Plasidas from field does come,
as they were entered in:
Then to inquire of Plasidas,
the Knights do now begin.
If that he knew not one, within
that town that had to name:
Plasidas, who of chivalry,
did bear away the fame.
He answered them, and said forsooth,
no such man I do know:
But yet he does the Knights desire,
unto his house to go.
And take such things as he poor soul,
unto them then might give:
Which might their weary faynting lims,
from weariness relieve.
With whom they went with all their hearts
and their repastes did take:
With such small cheer as he good man,
at that time could them make.
But when he did reuolue in mind,
the state that he was in:
Sometime with them, good Lord therefore,
to weep he does begin.
Then went he out from chamber where,
the Knights did then remain:
To wash his face, and afterward,
return to them again.
But whilst he was from them a time,
they thought that it was he:
Whom they appointed were to seek,
and so agreed they be,
At his return for to demand,
some license and some leave:
To see a wound which sometime he,
in battle did receive.
At length he commes, and they to him,
with gentle words do speak:
Good sir said they, much like thou art,
to him whom we do seek.
Therefore of thee we do desire,
this one thing for to look
Upon thy head, for such a wound,
that he in battle took.
They then beheld the wound, and knew,
full well that it was he:
No tongue can then express their joy,
fulfilled so they be.
With stretched arms they him embrace,
desiring him to tell:
Where that his children are become,
and where his wife does dwell.
Then answered he and said his sons,
were refte of vital breath:
And as he thought, his wife likewise,
tasted of cruel death.
And how the Master had his wife,
unto the Knights he told:
And how by force of arms from him,
his wife he did with hold.
This done, in have throughout the land,
report does blow this thing:
The neighbors then do have unto,
Plasidas pore lodging.
With maruelling, much like unto
a swarm of bees they go:
About the house and there the knights,
their message forth do show.
And then they ray sir Plasidas,
with vestementes of price:
Then from their seats to walk a while,
the lusty Knights arise.
In have they leave that joyful soil,
and homewarde do they wend:
They are arrived in Roman land,
ere fyftene days were end.
The Emperor then when that he heard,
that Eustas was at hand:
Does joy that God has sent this Knight,
again unto his land.
Now Trayan he does ride in have,
Plasidas for to meet:
And joyful Trayan Plasidas,
his loving friend does greet,
Then Trayan with Plasidas,
unto his court does go:
With great frequent of people that,
behind them did follow.
When he came there, of al his happes,
he does declare and tell:
Of all the woes and miseries,
that unto him befell.
Now his wife was taken him fro,
how children both were slain:
And how himself now fyftene years,
did live in doleful pain.
From thence they go to banketting,
to revels and to play:
In dancing and in minstrelsie,
they spend that lucky day.
And Plasidas is made I say,
Lieutenant of the band:
And all the ordering of the wars,
is put into his hand.
He then before him calls the Knights,
and does their number take:
Intending up an army great,
in have forthwith to make.
And does command that straight,
each town to him should send:
Two lusty men with Plasidas,
unto the wars to wend.
It happened so that that same town,
two soldiers forth must make:
Which from the Lion and the Woulfe,
those tender babes did take.
At length the towns men do agree,
that both these children should:
Go with the Knight with willing minds
and hearts, even so they would.
The country men these soldiers twain,
did bring unto the Knight:
Their manners and their comely shape,
did much his mind delight.
Wherefore with first at table he,
has placed the same to be:
Because in them such nobleness,
of manners he did see.
The day is come, to battle they,
must wend even out of hand:
And now they must the great assault,
of cruel foes withstand.
The battayles great on either part,
the flames do reach the Sky:
The roaring sound of Canons shot,
the force of walls does try.
The Knights with lance in hand I say,
do pearce throughout the throng:
The soldier does assay to lay,
his enemy all along.
The battle stands in doubt of truth,
which side shall other beat:
Here martch they on amayne and there,
they blow again retreat.
Here all along on ground they lie,
and here from tourets hie:
The deadly shaft through misley clouds,
aloft in Skies do fly.
And here in flesh it lights full deep,
and gives a deadly wound:
And in an other part there is,
a thousand brought to ground.
Here fights Plasidas full hard,
in midst of all the throng:
And here the children parent like,
slay enemies along.
They forward do retire in have,
and men before do lack:
And Plasidas assayles his foes,
behind upon their back.
The wings that were the aid and help,
of foot men, go their way:
The battayles lost, all through defacde,
of keeping their array.
The wings are fled, and battle must
by footmen stand a while:
The battayls great, but at the length,
they are brought to exile.
The enemies fly from field amain,
and Romans follow still:
Upon the chase, for they did mind,
their cruel foes to kill.
Retreat is blown, and home again,
to camp the soldiers hie:
That willing were, either their foes,
or they in chase to die.
The town is made full strong and sure,
with rampires for shot:
And eke each side of all the town,
with munition is hot.
The scaling lathers down to throw,
they have their iron staves:
They have their hatchets for to cut,
in sunder all their raues.
Some stand with stings from far to strike,
the Roman armies great:
Some stand with bills those that assault,
with furious force to beat:
The pike men they on walls do stand,
their town for to defend:
And some from tower with bow in hand,
the graygoose wing do send.
The laborers do mende the walls,
with gonshot all to shake:
The towns men all within the town,
do seek defense to make.
And sluises al are opened,
to stop the enemies way:
Least that to scale their walls by night,
the enemy do assay.
The night is come, and it does part
the armies for that time:
The watch man he aloft in tower,
begins for to clime.
The ward at gate is kept all night,
the soldiers stand in ray:
That when the onset shall be given,
resist their foes they may.
The night is gone, and break of day,
begins to draw nie:
By which the watch man in the tower,
the army may diserie.
And see from far how Plasidas,
does order all his band:
How that he tells them the way,
their foes for to withstand.
He does declare, as he can deem,
what number that they be:
And does epsy if any troop,
of horse men he may see.
That does aproch unto the town,
for to increase their fear:
Plasidas sent horse men forth,
to range both here and there.
To see if that they enter would,
from town, and would descend:
In open field by force of arms,
their city to defend.
But they within did keep themselves,
in order for to fight:
Then had the day quite drone away,
the loathsome mystes of night.
And Plasidas his comely train,
unto the walls does bring:
The which the watch man well perceived,
and al arm out does ring.
To walls they go both tagge and ragge,
their City to defend:
And every man his business,
does duly now intend.
The pushing pikes stand next the walls,
their enemies down to fling:
The stelly boys the heavy earth,
on shoulders thither bring.
The sun from depth of Occean sea,
did scarce himself areare:
When as the Roman army did,
before the town appear.
And then the gonnes the way do make,
through walls of stone and brick:
And eke the flames of fires do,
the tops of houses lick.
The Romans, they bring to the walls,
their scaling lathers hie:
With iron hooks, unto the tops
of houses for to tie.
Now all the walls of Romans stout,
is filled to the end:
And more and more continually,
upon the walls ascend.
The town is won, and Plasidas
in midst thereof is set:
And all their labor is as now,
the spoil thereof to get.
The town to dust is quite consumde,
and burnt with scorching fire:
The trumpets sound triumphantly,
to cause their men retire.
Then after when the town is won,
and all was brought to ground:
A resting place for all his band,
there in a town he found.
In which his wife did dwell, and kept
a house for hostage there:
To whom her sons for harbor then,
unto her do repair,
Not knowing what she was, in deed,
they there their restes do take:
And for their noble victories,
great joy they often do make.
At last the younger does desire,
the elder for to tell:
His young estate, and what to him,
in childehode often befell.
Whose talk the silly mother often,
did listen much to know:
Some news by warriers stoutly done,
and afterward might show.
The same unto her friends that list,
often times of wars to talk:
Therefore full often I say she does,
before the chamber walk.
At last the eldest said, good friend,
I do remember well:
How that my father ruled the Knights,
of Rome that did excel.
And eke a Lady fair I had,
to mother well I know:
Two children eke they had full fair,
I well remember so.
My younger brother was full fair,
surmounting in degree:
All other men, so rich he was,
with gifts of dame beauty.
Long did they live in joy and bliss,
within that land I know:
But yet by night he took a ship,
and from that land did go.
Unto a country not far thence,
the name I do not know:
The ship is come unto the port,
and then to land we go.
My mother she behind was left,
but how I can not say:
But as I judge, the Master he,
my mother there did stay.
And then from thence we did depart,
unto a town thereby:
With heavy mind, until he came,
unto a great ferry.
And there he set me down on ground,
and over straight he bore:
His younger son over the flood,
unto the other shore.
And entering now the flood again,
me thither for to fetch:
A cruel Woulfe my brother young,
up in his mouth does catch.
And wendes his way unto the wood,
my brother loud does cry:
My father still he striued hard,
again to me to hie.
But out alas, a Lion huge.
came from the wood amain:
And snaccht up me, and to the wood
he did return again.
But when the Lion great and tall,
the heard men they do see:
Their dogs they set upon the beast,
and so they saved me.
The younger said, my brother dear,
even as I heard it told:
The plowmen took me from a Woulfe,
which had me in his hold.
By that thou saydst, conjecture I,
thy brother that I am:
Lo happy day they both do say,
that unto wars we came.
The joy that they do make forsooth,
no tongue can it express:
No heart can think, no eye has seen,
such blessed ioyfulnesse.
The mother then has heard their talk,
and ponder it well does she:
And does reuolue within her mind,
if that her babes they be.
Then unto Plasidas she goes,
and does desire him sone:
That he would let her go with him,
for she was borne at Rome.
And as to him these words she spoke,
in sounding she often fell:
And cried at length, O Plasidas,
I know thee very well.
I am thy wife pore Theopis,
which taken was thee fro:
In midst of floudes, when thou from ship,
unto the land did go.
The mighty God of heaven and earth,
for thee has kept me clean:
The Master he for his deserte,
up darte of death is slain.
Then Plasidas does well perceive,
his wife, his love and make:
His heart, his life, and unto him,
in arms he does her take.
What joy was there I can not tell,
my fingers weary be:
To write the same, my eyes like that,
in world did never see.
The wife the husband does embrace,
the man the wife likewise:
The joy to show, the tears do gushe,
like streams from out their eyes.
And in their joy, the wife demaundes,
where that her children be:
Then he did say, my loving wife,
their deaths my self did see.
Two cruel beasts with foming mouths,
our children both has slain:
Then said his wife be of good cheer,
alive they both remain.
For lo, the God which unto us,
this joyful meeting gave:
By his good grace and power divine,
did both our children save.
Then him she told how soldiers twain,
their infancy did show:
And straight he sent for those young men,
the truth of them to know.
The children both unto him come,
and each of them does tell:
His infancy, by which he knows,
they be his sons full well,
He then does kiss and eke embrace,
those tender babes of his:
The army then for news hereof,
in heart right joyful is.
They spend those days in joy and bliss,
and after do intend:
To Roman land triumphantly,
his host and he to wend.
But whilst in wars he did abide,
good Trayan was dead:
And Adrian in the Empire,
succeeded in his stead.
Who in all mischieues did abound,
as stories us do tell:
For persecuting of the truth,
he did the rest excel.
When Plasidas to Rome was come,
and did a time soiourne:
Then Adrian did him command,
his Idols to adourne.
For that the Romans did possess,
so great a victory:
But Plasidas would not so do,
he plainly did deny,
That they were Gods, and unto him,
they naught at all could give:
He said by Christ, in Christ it was,
that he in world did live.
Then Adrian commanded that,
devoured they should be:
Of a Lion in Church, whereas
his Gods the fact might see.
And so it was as he command,
performed eke and done:
The Lion he most joyfully,
unto their feet does come.
And there does lie much like a dog,
cum caude that does play:
And from their feet no man ywis,
can get the beast away.
But there he lies and merry makes,
he does no hhurt at all:
Then Adrian does straight command,
his men them forth to call,
And does command that they be put,
in Ox of brass to die:
But naught they care, in Jesus Christ
they had their trust wholly.
The Ox with flame is through hot,
and they are put therein:
And joyfully in Christ they all,
to sing do then begin.
Thus ended they their mortal race,
their file was at an end:
That we may so endure good Lord,
to us thy mercy send.
John Partridge.

FINIS.
