TO THE HONOR OF HIM, to whom the Noble Fraternity of Drapers, his Worthy
Brothers have Consecrated their loves in Magnificent Tryumphs, the Right
Honorable CUTHBERT HACKEY Lord Major of the City of LONDON.
THE Cities choice, thy Companies free love,
This Days unlooked for Triumph, all three prove,
The Happiness of thy life to be most great;
Add to these, Justice, and thou art Complete.
At your Lordships Command, Thomas Middleton.

The Triumphs of Health and Prosperity.
IF you should search all Chronicles, Histories, Records, in what Language or
Letter soever; if the Inquisitiue Man should waste the dear Treasure of his
Time and Ey-sight, He shall conclude his life only with this certainety, that
there is no Subject upon earth received into the place of his Government with
the like State and Magnificence, as is his Majesty's great Substitute into his
Honorable charge the City of London, bearing the Inscription of the Chamber
Royal: which that it may now appear to the world no less illustrated with
brotherly Affection then former Tryumphall times have been partakers of, this
takes delight to present it self.

And first to enter the worthy love of his honorable Society, for his Lordships
return from Westminster, having received some service by water, by the
Triumphant Chariot of Honor, the first that attends his Lordships most wished
Arrival, bears the Title of the Beautiful Hill, or Fragrant Garden, with
flowery banks, near to which, Lambs and Sheep are a grazing, this platform
so cast into a Hill, is adorned and garnisht with all variety of Odoriferous
flowers, on the top Archt with an Artificial and curious Rain bow, which both
shows the Antiquity of colors, the diversity and Nobleness, and how much the
more glorious and highly to be esteemed, they being presented in that blessed
Covenant of Mercy, the Bow in the Clouds, the work it self incompast with all
various fruits, and bears the name of the most pleasant garden of England
(the Noble City of London) the flowers intimating the sweet odors of their
Virtue and Goodnesses, and the fruits of their works of Justice and Charity,
which have been both Honorable Brothers, and bounteous benefactors of this
ancient Fraternity, who are presented in (...) device following, under the
types and figures of their Virtues in their life time, which made them famous
then, and memorable for ever, and since we are yet amongst the woolly Creatures
that graze on the Beauty of this beautiful platform, come we to the modern
use of this Noble mystery of Ancient Drapery, and we shall find the whole
Livery of this renowned and famous City furnished by it, it clothes the
honorable Senators in their highest and chiefest wearing, all Courts of
Justice, Magistrates and Judges of the Land. But for the better expression of
the purpose in hand, a Speaker gives life to these following words.

The Speech in the Hill where the Rainbow appears.
A Cloud of grief has showrde upon the face
Of this sad City, and usurped the place
Of Joy and Cheerfulness, wearing the form,
Of a long black Eclipse in a rough storm,
With flowers of Tears this garden was oreflowne,
Till mercy was like the blessed Rainbow shown.
Behold what figure now the City bears,
Like Iems vnvalued, her best joys she wears;
Glad as a faithful Hand-mayde to obey,
And wait upon the Honor of this Day;
Fixed in the Kings great Substitute, Delight,
Triumph, and Pomp had almost lost their right:
The Garden springs again, the Violet Beds,
The lofty Flowers bear up their fragrant heads;
Fruit ouer-lade their Trees, Barnes crack with store,
And yet how much the Heavens wept before:
Threatening a second mourning, who so dull,
But must acknowledge Mercy was at full.
In these two mighty blessings; what is required?
That which in conscience ought to be desired;
Care and Uprightness in the Magistrates place,
And in all men Obedience, Truth and Grace.
After this awaites his Lordships approach, a Maister-peece of Triumph, called
the Sanctuary of Prosperity, on the Top Arch of which hangs the Golden Fleece,
which raises the worthy memory of that most famous and renowned Brother of this
Company, Sir Francis Drake, who in two years and ten months did incompasse
the whole world, deserving an eminent remembrance in this Sanctuary, who never
returned to his Country without the Golden Fleece of Honor and Victory. The
four fair Corinthian Columns or Pillars, imply the four principal Virtues,
Wisdom, Justice, Fortitude, Temperance, the especial vpholders of Kingdoms,
Cities and Honorable Societies.

The Speech in the Sanctuary upon the Fleece.
IF Jason with the noble hopes of Greece,
Who did from Colchis fetch the Golden Fleece,
Deserve a Story of immortal fame,
That both the As^aes celebrate his name,
What Honor, Celebration and Renown,
In Virtues right, ought justly to be shown,
To the fair memory of Sir Francis Drake;
Englands true Jason, who did boldly make
So many rare Adventures, which were held
For worth, unmatched, danger, unparalleled,
Never returning to his Countries Eye,
Without the Golden Fleece of Victory.
The World's a Sea, and every Magistrate
Takes a years Voyage, when he takes this state,
Nor on these Seas, are there less dangers found,
Then those, on which the bold Adventurer's bound:
For Rocks, gulfes, quick sands, here is (...) spite,
Envy, Detraction of all Noble Right*
Vessels of Honor, those do threaten more,
Th^^ any Ruin between Sea and Shore.
Sail then by th'Compasse of a Virtuous name,
And spite of Spites, thou bringst the Fleece of fame.
Passing from this, and more to encourage the Noble endeauours of the
Magistrate, his Lordship and the worthy Company, is gracefully Conducted toward
the Chariot of Honor, on the most Eminent seat thereof is Government
Illustrated, it being the proper Virtue by which we raise the noble memory of
Sir Henry Fitz*Alwin, who held the Seat of Magistracy in this City twenty
four years together, a most renowned Brother of this Company: In like manner,
the Worthy Sir John Norman first rowed in Barge to Westminster with silver
Oars, under the person of Munificence: Sir Simon Air that built Leaden Hall,
a Granary for the poor, under the Type of Piety, Et sic de caeteris. This
Chariot drawn by two Golden pellited Lions, being the proper Supporters of
the Companies Arms, those two that have their Seats upon the Lions,
presenting Power and Honor, the one in a little Streamer or Banneret, bearing
the arms of the present Lord Major; the other the late, the truly Generous
and Worthy, Sir Allen Cotton Knight, a bounteous and a Noble Housekeeper, one
that has spent the year of his Magistracy, to the great Honor of the City,
and by the swee^^esse of his Disposition, and the uprightness of his Justice
and Government, has raised up a fair lasting Memory to himself and his
Posterity for ever; at whose happy Inauguration, though Triumph was not then in
season, (Deaths Pageants being only advanc'st upon the shoulders of men,) His
Noble deservings were not thereby any way ecllipsed.

Est Uirtus sibi Marmor, et Integritate Triumphat.

The Speech of Government.
With just propriety dos this City stand,
As fixed by fate, in the middle of the Land,
It has as in the body the Hearts place,
Fit for her works of Piety and Grace:
The Head her Sovereign, unto whom she sends
All duties that just service comprehends;
The Eyes may be compared (at wisdoms rate)
To the illustrious Counselors of State,
Set in that Orb of Royalty, to give light
To noble actions, Stars of truth and right:
The Lips, the Reverend Clergy, Judges, all
That pronounce Laws Divine, or Temporal;
The Arms to the defensive part of men,
So I descend unto the Heart again:
The place where now you are, witness the love,
True Brother-hoods cost and Triumph, all which move
In this most grave Solemnity, and in this
The Cities general love abstracted is:
And as the Heart in it is meridian seat,
Is stil*d the Fountain of the bodies heat:
The first thing receives life, the last that dies,
Those properties experience well applies
To this most loyal City, that has been
In former ages as in these times seen;
The Fountain of Affection, Duty, Zeal,
And taught all Cities through the Common weal,
The first that receives quickening life and spirit,
From the Kings grace, which still she strives to inherit
And like the Heart will be the last that dies,
In any duty toward good supplies:
What can express affections nobler fruit,
Both to the King, and You, his Substitute.
At the close of this Speech, this Chariot of Honor, and Sanctuary of
Prosperity, with all her graceful Concomitants, and the two other parts of
Triumph, take leave of his Lordship for that time, and rest from service till
the great Feast at Guild hall be ended, after which the whole Fabric of the
Triumph attends upon his Honor, both toward Saint Paul's and homeward, his
Lordship accompanied with the grave and Honorable Senators of the City,
amongst whom the two worthy Shrieffes, his Lordships Grave Assistants for the
year, the Worshipful and generous Master Richard Fen, and Master Edward
Brumfield ought not to pass of my respect unremembered, whose bounty and
Nobleness for the year, will no doubt, give the best expression to their own
Worthiness. Between the Cross and the entrance of Woodstreet, that part of
Triumph being planted, being the Fragrant Garden of England, with the Rainbow
to which the concluding Speech has chiefly reference, there takes its farewell
of his ^Lordship, accompanied with the Fountain (...) Virtue, being the fourth
part of the Triumph.

The last Speech.
MErcies fair Object, the Caelestiall Bow,
As in the morning it began to show,
It closes up this great Tryumphall day,
And by example shows the Year, the Way,
Which if Power worthily, and rightly spend,
It must with Mercy both begin and end;
It is a year that crowns the life of man,
Brings him to Peace with Honor and what can
Be more desired, it is virtues harvest time,
When Gravity and Judgments in their prime,
To speak more happily, it is a time given
To treasure up good Actions fit for Heaven,
To a Brother hood of Honor thou art fixed
That has stood long fair in just Virtues eye;
For within twelve years space, thou art the Sixth,
That has bin Lord Major of this Company:
This is no usual grace, being now the last,
Close the Work Nobly up, that what is past,
And known to be good in the former Five:
May in thy present Care be kept alive;
Then is thy Brotherhood for their Love and Cost,
Requited amply; but thy own Soul most.
Health and a happy Peace fill all thy days,
When thy Year ends, may then begin thy praise.
FOR the Fabric or Structure of the whole Triumph, in so short a time, so
gracefully performed, the Commendation of that, the Industry of Master Garret
Chrismas may justly Challenge, a man not only excellent in his Art, but
faithful in his Undertakings.

FINIS.
