The Maidens complaint of her Loves inconstancy.
Showing it forth in every degree,
She being left as one forlorn,
With sorrows she her self to adorn,
And seems for to lament and mourn.
To a delicate new tune.



YOu maids and wives and women kind,
Give ear, and you shall hear my minds,
Wherein I Will show you most perfectly,
A false young man's inconstancy.
For which I sigh, and sob, and weep,
To see false men no faith can keep.
I love where I have cause to hate,
Such is my foolish fickle state,
My time I spend in grief and woe,
Which sure will be mine overthrow.
I sigh, and sob, and then do weep,
For that false men no faith can keep.
My Love to me does prove untrue,
And seems to bid me now adue,
O hateful wretch, and most unkind.
To bear so false and wicked mind.
It makes me sigh, and sob, and weep,
To see false men no faith can keep.
He Is fled and gone, for which I grieve,
I with no maiden him believe,
For he with tempting speeches will
Seek others now for to beguile.
That they with me may sigh and weep,
And say that men no faith can keep.
Shall I be bound that may be free,
Shall I lode them that love not me?
Why should I thus seem to complain?
I see I cannot him obtain.
Which makes me sob, and sigh, and weep
To see that men no faith can keep.
O shall I weep, or shall I sing?
I know not which will fit mourning:
If that I weep it will breed me pain,
If that I sing 'twill ease my brain.
Therefore I Will sigh, and sob, and weep,
To see false men no faith can keep,
The Iewel's last, the thief is fled,
And I lie wounded in my bed:
If to repent I should begin,
They Will say 'twas I that let him in.
Therefore I Will sigh, and sob, and weep,
To see false men no faith can keep.
My minds to him was always true,
For which I now have cause to rue,
Would I had never seen his face,
Nor trod the paths of Cupids race.
For now I sigh, and sob, and weep,
To see false men no faith can keep.
The second part; To the same turn.


What hap has any he or she,
That can but live at liberty
And not be troubled as I am,
As by my song you understand,
It makes me sigh, and sob, and weep,
To see false men no faith can keep.
I cannot take my quiet rest,
To think on him that I loved best:
Sometimes when I do think to sleep,
Then thought of him makes me to Weep.
I cannot choose but sigh, and sob,
To think of him that does me rob.
It Is true indeed he robs me,
Of my content and liberty:
My heart can now no comfort finds,
To think on him that probes unkind.
I cannot choose but sigh, and weep,
To see false men no faith can keep.
My head does ache, my eyes are sore,
And I can find no help therefore:
My body's fainte and I am weak,
My tongue is tied I cannot speak:
Yet still I sigh and sob, and weep,
To see that men no faith can keep.
My days are short my life's not long.
I cannot will declare my wrong.
Yet in some part, I here do show,
That you the cause hereof may know,
Wherefore I sigh and sob and weep,
To see that men no faith can keep.
His tempting eyes, and smiling looks,
Now seem to me like bayted hooks,
Which are but laid for to betray
The fish that is greedy of his prey.
Therefore I sob, and sigh, and weep;
To see that men no faith can keep.
When first with me he came in place,
He did me with his arms embrace,
He kissed me on it, and swore that he
Would never have no one but me.
Yet now he makes me sob, and weep;
To see that men no faith can keep.
With words most fair he did entreat,
Until my favor he did get:
But him uncertain I do find,
And changing like the wavering wind.
Which makes me sigh, and sob, and weep,
To see that men no faith can keep.
He vowed to bear a faithful mind,
But he is otherwise inclind:
He now does seem as strange to me,
I cannot have his company.
Which makes me sob, and sigh, and weep,
To see that men no faith can keep,
Thus seems my love to do me wrong,
Wherefore I Will here conclude my song:
I Will never trust false men no more,
Nor do as I have done before.
For which I sigh, and sob, and weep,
To see that men no faith can keep.
