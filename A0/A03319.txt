Prohemye
Great thankynges lawde and honor we merytoryously ben bound to yield and
offer unto writers of hystoryes / which gretely have prouffyted our mortal
life / that show unto the reders and herers by the ensamples of things passyd
/ what thing is to be desired / And what is to be eschewed / For those things
which our progenytours by the taste of bytternes and experyment of great
Ieopardyes have enseygned / admonested and informed us excluded fro such
peryllys / to know what is prouffytable to our life / and acceptable / and
what is vnprouffytable and to be refused / He is / and ever has been reputed
the wysest / which by the experyence of adverse fortune has byholden and seen
the noble Cytees / manners / and variau^t condycions of the people of many
diverse Regyons / For in him is presupposed the lore of wisdom and polycye /
by the experyment of Ieopardyes and peryllys which have grown of folly in
diverse parties and contrayes / yet he is more fortunat / and may be reputed as
wise / if he give attendaunce without tastynge of the storms of aduersyte
that may by the redyng of historyes conteynyng diverse customs Condycyons /
laws and / Acts of sundry nations come unto the knowleche of and
understanding of the same wysedom and polycye / In which hystoryes so wreton
in large and aourned volumes / he sitting in his chamber or study / may read
/ know and understand the polytyke and noble acts of all the world as of
one Cite / And the conflyctes / errors. Troubles / and vexacions done in the
said universal world / In such wise as he had been and seen them. in the
propre places where as they were done / For certain it is a greet beneurte
unto a man that can be reformed by other and strange men's hurtes and scathes
/ And by the same to know / what is requysyte and prouffytable for his life /
And eschew such errors and Inconuenytys / by which other men have been hurt
and lost their felycyte / Therefore the cou^seylles of Ancient and white heeryd
men / in whom old age has engendryd wisdom / ben gretely preysed of younger
men / And yet hystoryes so much more excelle them / As the dyuturnyte or
length of time Includes moo ensamples of things and laudable acts. than
thage of one man may suffyse to see / Historyes ought not only to be Iuged
most proffytable to young men / which by the lecture / redyng and
understanding make them semblable and equale to men of greter age / and to old
men / to whom long life has mynystred experymentes of diverse things / but
also thystoryes able and make right pryuate men digne and worthy to have the
governance of Em^yte^ ^ noble Royammes / historyes moeue and withdraw
Emperors and kings fro vycious tyranny / Fro vecordyous slouthe / unto
tryumphe and vyctorye in puyssaunt bataylles / Historyes also have moeued right
noble knights to deserve eternal laud which follows them for their
vyctoryous merytes / And cause them more valyantly to enter in Ieopardyes of
batayles for the defense and tuicion of their country / and publyke well /
hystorye also affrayeth cruel tyrauntys for dread of Infamye and shame Infynyte
/ by cause of the detestable acts of such cruel persons ben oftymes plantyd
and regystred in Cronykes unto their perpetuel obprobrye and dyuulgacion of
their Infamye / As thactes of new and such other / Truly many of hye and
couragyous men of great empryse / desyryng their fame to be perpetuelly
conseruyd by lyberal monumentis / which ben the permanente records of every
vyrtuouse and noble Act / have builded and edefyed ryall and noble Cytees /
And for the conseruacion of the well publycke have mynystred and establysshed
dyscrete and prouffytable laws / And thus the pryncipal laud / and cause of
delectable and amyable things / in which man's felycyte stondeth and rests
ought and may well be attributed to hystoryes / which word historye may be
descryued thus / Historye is a perpetuel conseruatryce of thoos things / that
have be done before this present time / and also a cotydyan witness of
bienfayttes of malefaytes / great Acts / and tryumphal vyctoryes of all manner
people. And also if the terryble feyned Fables of Poets have much styred and
moeued men to pity / and conseruynge of Justice / How much more is to be
supposed / that Historye assertryce of veryte / and as mother of all
philosophye / moeuynge our manners to virtue / reformeth and reconcyleth ner
hand all thoos men / which through the Infyrmyte of our mortal nature has
led the most part of their life in Ocyosyte and myspended their time passed
right soon out of Remembrance / Of which life and death is egal oblyuyon /

The fruytes of virtue ben Inmortall / Specially wh^nne they ben wrapped in the
benefyce of hystoryes /

Then it must follow / that it is most fair to men Mortalle to suffer
labors and pain / for glory and fame Inmortalle / Hercules when he lived
suffryd greet labors and peryllys wylfully puttyng him self in many terryble
and ferdful ieop^rdyes to obtain of all people the benefaytes of Inmortal laud
and renommee / We read of other noble men / sum lords and sum other of
lower astates reputed as gods in diverse regyons / the whose famous acts /
and excellent virtues only hystorye has preseruyd fro perysshyng in eternal
memory / Other monymentes distributed in diverse chaunges / enduren but for a
short time or season / But the virtue of historye dyffused and spr^dd by the
universal world has time / which consumes all other things as
conseruatryce and kepar of her work /

Ferthermore eloquence is so precious and noble / that al most no thing can
be founden more precious than it / By Eloquence the greeks ben preferryd in
contynu^l honor to fore the rude barbares / Orators and learned clerks in
like wise excelle vnl^rn^d and brutyssh people / Sith this eloquence is such
that causes men emonge them self sum texcelle other / after the qualyte of
the virtue and eloquence by seyn to be of val^w / For sum we Judge to be good
men digne of laud / which show to us the way of virtue / and other have
taken another way for tenflamm^ more the courages of men by fables of poesye /
than to prouffy^e And by the laws and Institutes more to punysshe than to
teache So that of these things the vtylyte is myxt with harm / For sum
sothly techyth to lie / But historye representynge the things like unto the
words / enbraceth al vtylyte and prouff^^^ It shows honest / and makes
vices detestable / It enhaunce^h noble men and depresseth wicked men and fools
/ Also things that historye deseryueth by experyence / much prouffyten unto a
ryghtful lif / Then sith historye is so precious and also prouffytable / I
have delybered to write two books notable / retenyng in them many noble
historyes / as the lives / miracles / passions and death of diverse holy saints which shall be comprysed by thayde and suffraunce of almighty god in
one of them / which is named legenda aurea / that is the golden legende / And
that other book is named polycronycon / in which book ben comprised briefly
many wonderful historyees / First the descripcion of the universal world / as
w^l in length as in bread with the diuisio^s of countries roya^mes and empyres
/ the noble cytees / hye mou^tayns famous ryuers / merueylles and wondres / and
also the historial ^ctes and wonderful deeds sith the first making of heaven and
earth unto the beginning of the regne of king edward the fourth / and unto the
year of our lord M / CCCClx. As by thayde of almighty god shall follow al a
long / after the composynge and gaderynge of dan Ranulph monk of chestre
first auctour of this book / and afterward englisshed by one Treuisa vycarye
of barkley / which at request of one Sir thomas lord barkley translated this
said book / the bible and bartylmew de proprietatibus reru^ out of latin in to
englyssh / And now at this time symply emprynted and set in form by me
William Caxton and a little embelysshed fro tholde making / and also have added
such stories as I could find fro the end that the said Ranulph fynysshed his
book which was the year of our lord.M.CCClvij unto the year of the same MCCCClx
/ which ben an honderd and three year / which work I have finysshed under the
noble protection of my most dr^d naturel and sovereign lord and most christian
king / king Edward the fourth / humbly besechyng his most noble grace to
pardone me if any thing be said therynne of Ignorance / or other wise than it
ought to be^ And also requyryng al other to amend where as there is defaute /
Wherein he or they may deserve thank and merit / And I shall pray for them that
so do / For I knowleche mine Ignorance and also symplenes / And if there be
thing that may plese or prouffite any man / I am glad that I have achieued it /
And following this my prohemye I shall set a table shortly towchyd of the most
part of this book / And where the said Auctor has all his work in seven
books / I have set that which I have added to after a part. and have
marked it the last book / and have made chapytres acordyng to the other work
/ Of which accomplysshyng / I thank Almighty God To whom be given Honor /
laud / and glory / in secula seculorum Amen /

Deo gracias

spoken with diverse tongues / In such wise that diverse men be strange (...)
other and understood not others speech / Speech is not known but if it be
learned common lernyng of speech is by hering^ and so always he that is deef is
always dombe for he may not here speech for to / learn / So men of fer countrees
and lands that have diverse speches / yef neither of hem have learned others
langage / nether of hem wot what other meneth / though they mete and have great
need of informacion and of loor of talkyng and of speech be the need never so
great neither of hem understands others speech no more than / gaglinge of
gees For Iangle that one never so fast that other is never the wyser though he
shrewe him instead of good morow^ This is a great meschyef. that folo^eth now
mankind / But god of his mercy and grace has ordained double remedy / One is
that sum man lerneth and knows many diverse speches / And so between
strange men of the which neither understands others speche^ Such a man may
be mean an^ tell either what other wole mene^ That other remedy is that one
langage is learned. used. and known in many nations and lands. And so latin is
learned known and used specially on this half greece in all the nations and
lands of Europe / Therefore clerks of her godnes and curtosye make and written
their books in latyn^ For her writing and books should be understand in
diverse nations and lands And so Ranulphus monk of C^estre wrote in latin his
books. of Cronykes that descryueth the world about in length and in bre^de /
And makes mention and mind of doings and deeds of meruaylles and of wondres^
and rekeneth the years to his last days / fro the first making of heaven and of
earth And so therinne is great and noble Informacion and loore to hem that can
therinne read and understand Therefore I would have these books of Cronykes /
translated out of Latin in to English for the moo men should hem understand
and have thereof con^yng Informacion and loore The Clerk These books of
Cronykes ben written in latin / And latin is used and understood on this half
greece in all the nations and lands of Europa And comynly English. is not so
wide understand used ne known And thenglysshe transl^cion should noman
understand but Englyssh men allone / Then how should the moo men understand
the Cronykes though they were translated out ^f latin that is so / wide used
and known / in to English that is not (...) and known but of englyssh men
allone The lord This question and doubt is easy to assaylle For if these
cronykes were translated out of latin in to Englyssh / then by that so many
the moo men should understand hem / as understand English and no latin The
clerk Ye cunne speak read and understand latin. then it needs not to have
such an englyssh translacion The lord. I deny this argument For though I can
speak read and understand latyn^ there is much latin in these books of
Cronykes that I can not understand / nether thou without studyeng auisement
and lokyng of other books. Also though it were not nedeful for me / it is
nedeful for other men that understand no latin The clerk Men that understand
no latin may learn and understand The lord Not all For sum may not for
other manner business / Sum for elde Sum for defaute of wit Sum for
defaute of catell other of friends to find hem to scole / And sum for other
diverse defautes and lettes The Clerk Hit needs not that all such know the
Cronykes / The lord Speak not to straytly of thing that needs For straytly to
speak of thing that needs / only thing that is and may not faylle needs to
be. And so it needs that God be / for god is and may not faylle / And so for
to speak noman needs for to know the cronykes / ffor it might and may be that
noman hem knoweth^ Otherwise to speak of thing that nedeth^ somewhat needs for
to sustain or to have other things thereby / And so mete and drink needs for
keeping and susteynaunce of life. And so for to speak no man needs for to know
the cronykes^ But in the thyrdd manner to speak of thing that needs / all
that is prouffytable needs / and so for to speak all men need to know the
Cronykes Tle clerk Then they that understand no latin may axe and be
informed and y taught of hem that understand latin The lord Thou spekest
wonderly for the lewd man wot not what he should axe / and namely of loore of
deeds that come never in his mind ner wot of whom comynly he should axe / Also
not all men that understand latin have such books te^forme leude men also some
connen not and sum may not have while / and so it needs to have an english
translacion The clerk The latin is both good and fair / therefore it needs not
to have an englyssh translacion The lord This reason is worthy to be plunged in
a pludde and led in powder of lewdnes and of shame / It might well be that thou
make only in myrthe and in game. The Clerk The reason must stand but it be
assoylled^ The lord A bleere eyed man but he were al blind of wytt might see
the Solucion of this reason / And though he were blind he might grope the
solucion / But if his feelyng him faylled^ For if this reason were ought worth
/ by such manner arguyng me might preue that the three score and ten
Interpretours and aquila Symachus Theodocion and Origenes were lewdly occupied
when they translated holy writ out of hebrewe in to grue and also that saint
Iherome was lewdly occupied when he translated holy writ out of hebrewe in
to latin / For the Ebrewe is both good. and fair and y writ by Inspyracion
of the holy ghost And all these for her translacions ben hyely preysed of al
holy church Then the forsayde lewd reason is worthy to be powdred^ leyed a
water and y soused Also holy writ in latin is boothe good and fair / And yet
for to make a sermon of holy writ al in latin to men that can English and
no latin / it were a lewd deed / for they be never the wyser / For the latin
but it be told hem in English what it is to mean / And it may not be^ told
in englyssh what the latin is to mean without translacion out of latin in to
English / Then it needs to have an english translacion / and for to keep
it in mind that it be not foryeten it* is better that such a translacion be
made and written. than said and not written / and so this foresaid lewd reason
should meue no^an that has any wit to leave the making of English
translacion The Clerk A greeet dele of these books stondeth much by holy
writ. by holy doctors and by philosophye^ then these books should not be
translated in to English The lord It is wonder that thou make so febel
arguments and have goon so long to scole / Aristotle's books and other books
also of logyk and of philosophye were translated out of grue in to latin /
Also at prayeng of king Charles Johan Scot translated denis books out of
grue in to latin. and then^e out of latin in to ffrensshe. then what has
English trespaced that it might not be translated in to English Also king
Alurede that founded the university of Oxenford translated the best laws in to
English tongue / And a greet dele of the Sawter out of latin in to English /
And caused wyrefrith bishop of wyrcetre to translate saint gregoryes books.
the dialogues out of latin in to Saxons Also Cedmon of whythy was enspyred of
the holy ghost and made wonder Poysyes in englisshe nyghe of all the stories
of holy writ Also the holy man beda translated saint John's gospel out of
latin in to Englisshe Also thou wotest where the Apocalips is written in the
walls and roof of a chapel both in latin and in Frensshe Also the gospel and
prophecye and the right feyth of holy church must be taught and prechd to
Englisshe men that conne no latin Then the gospel and prophecye and the right
feyth of holy Church must be told hem in english / and that is not don but
by Englissh tra^lsaco^n for such englissh prechyng is very tra^slaco^n / and
such englisshe prechyng is good and needful. then englissh tra^slacion is
good and needful. The clerk / if a translacion were made that might be
amended in any point / Sum men it would blame The lord / If men blame that is
not worthy to be blamed / then they ben to blame / Clerks know well ynowgh
that no sinful man does so well that it ne might do better. ne make so good a
translacion that he ne might be better^ Therefore Origenes made two translacions
/ And Jerome translated thryes the sawter / I desire not translacion of these
the best that might be for that were an idle desire for any man that is now
alive / But I would have a skylfull translacion that might be know and
vnderstonden The Clerk Whether is you lever have a translacion of these
Cro^ykrs in Ryme or in prose The lord In prose For communly prose is moore
clear than ryme. more easy and more plain to know and understand The Clerk
Then god gran^ce us grace grathly to gynne / wit and wisdom wisely to
worche Might and mind of right menynge to make. translacion trusty and true.
Plesyng to the Trynyte three persons and one god in mageste^ that ever was and
ever shall be and made heaven and earth and light for to shine / And departed
light and derknes. And callid light day and derknes night / and so was made
euetyde and morrow tide one day / that had no morowtyde The second day he made
the firmament between waters And departed waters that were under the
firmamente^ fro the wat^^s that were above the firmamente: And called the
firmament heaven / the third day he gadred watres that been under the firmamente
in to one pl^ace and made the earth vnheled^ and named the gadryng of waters
Sees and dry earth land / And made trees and gras The fourth day he made
son and Moan and st^rres / and set hem in the firmament of heuene there for
to shine and to be tokenes and signs to depart times and years night and day
The fyfthe day he^ made fowls and birds in thayer and fysshes in the Water
The sixth day he made beestes of the land and man of the earth and put hem in
paradys for he should wyrche and won therinne / But man brake gods heste
and fylle in to sin and was put out of paradys in to woe and sorrow worthy to
be dampened to the pain of hell without any end / But the holy Trynyte had
mercy of man / And the fader sent the sone / And the holy ghost a light on a
maid. And the sone took fflesshe and blood of that blysful maid and deyde on
the Rode to save mankind / and aroos the third day glorious and blysful. and
taught his disciplis / and ascended in to heaven when it was time / And shall
come at day of dome and deem quycke and deed / Then all tho that been
writon in the book of life shall wend with him in to the bliss of heaven. and
ben there in body and soul / and see and know his godhede and manhede in
Joy without any ende^

I pray you / who should know Emperors wonders of the Philosophers or else
follow thappostles^ But their noble deeds and their wonder works were not
wreton in hystoryes and so kept in mind / who should know lucillum but
Seneca in^ his Epistles had written his deeds / writing of Poets is more

Then special lords that knew mine entente / And had desire to know greet
men's deeds prayed me bysyly / that I should also write the famous hystoryes^
and acounte the years from the beginning of the world unto our time / Tho
took I heed that this matier as Labo^^ntus Dedalus house has many halkes and

matiere is large / Writers therinne ben many and greet / For the fullness
thereof men ben al sad and take the less heed and lightly would find fawte
on this simple werke^ And as enemies whette their tongues and bend their brows
/ Of such men speaks Gregorius Nazauzenus that wole lightly blame defawtes of
other men / And not follow so lightly goodness. All this I had in mind And
also I knew mine own pouerte and shamed and dredde after so noble spekars that
sowned as trompes to put forth my barayne speech hoose and snochyng as who

leese up the eres after his Ryp men / He said noman shall wrath the^ ^ And to
his rypmen he said / If she will with you Ripe / forbede you her not / And
her for to leese or gleyne noman shall let. The Poet also Mantuanus Marro
Virgilius says eth libro decimo / And Oracins as says Hugucio Pisanus in
dininaciouibus suis Capitulo peruiso When Enemies despised Oracius and bare him
on hand that he had taken sum of Homeres versis^ and meddled among his and

Poet Satiricus I fare as a whestone that makes iron sharp and kene. Item

ANd for as much as this Cronyke conteyneth berynges and deeds of many times /
therefore I clepe it Policronicon that is the Cronyke of many times / In the
which werk by the ensample of the first wercher that wrought all his works
in six days and / rested in the seventh. For his doing is our doctrine. This
work I depart and dele in seven books / The first book descryueth places
contreyes and lands and all the wide world The other six books by the nombre
of the six ages that conteyneth beryng and deeds from the beginning of the
world unto our time Netheles in the first book of this work as who descryueth
general common and special / mappa mu^di is portrayed and peynted therinne^
which is the cloth that the shappe of the wide world is painted Inn Then in
his chyef parties the world is deled And for this story is trauaylled by cause
of brytayne every prouynce and land is descryued until we come to brytayne
last of all as most special And therein ben contained fyften chapytres
nedeful to the knouleche of the Ilonde of Brytayne as though it were an
Inbryngynge to gretter knowleche in other books that follows / that who that
may not come to fulle knowleche of the full storye may by such forledynge have
liking to leave shrewdnes and sin The second book auentureth for to tell
beryng and deeds with destripcion of the less world And for the ages of the
world be not al euene and of beryng and of deeds and eueery book is even and
conteynth like Therefore the second book conteyneth the berynge and deeds of
the four ages fro the making of our formest fader to thebrennyng of the
temple of the Jews. The thyrdde book from the transmygracion of the pepole to
the coming of Criste / The fourth fro Criste to the coming of the saxones /
The fyfthe from the Saxones to the danes / The sixth from the danes to the
Normans / The seventh from the Normans to our time that is under the regne of
king Edward the thyrdde after the conquest / And so by the prophecy of ysaye
this great story is departed in seven stremes so that both hosed and shooed
gods people may pass thereby

and in all these very acountyng of years. The first of these shall be

wreton / Touching the second take heed of two estates / One fro the beginning
of the world to Criste^ and that is called the state of mysgoyng. The second
state fro Criste to the worlds end. And that is named the state of grace and
of mercy / For the thyrdde take heed of three times / One to fore the law
wreton^ the second in the time of law wreton^ And the thyrdde under the new
law of Criste of which law is under grace and mercy / ffor the fourth take heed that sometime there were four pryncipal Kingdoms / that is to wete of the
assyryens / Perces / Greeks and Romans / Netheles touching the course of the
world and the process of holy writ the first Kingdom was under our
forfaders fro Adam to Moses. The second fro moses to saul. The thyrdde under
kings fro Saul to Zorobabel / The fourth under Bisshoppes fro Zorobabel to
Criste / For the fyfthe take heed of five manners of living / The first was in
the first age under the law of kind common to all men. the second in the
second age was the living of mysbyleuyd men / when mawmetrye began in Nynus
time king of Nynyue. the thyrdde in the thyrdde age under the law wreton /
when circu^sico^n and law departed the children of israel fro laws and
mysbyleued men / The fourth living of Christian men bigan under Criste. when
bileue and grace of Sacrament hallowed her self. The fyfte living of Sarasyns
began under macho mete as it shall be said in the fyfte book / and after the
time of heraclius the emperor openly showed / ffor the sixthe take heed of sex
ages / One is fro Adam to Noe. The second fro Noe to Abraham / The thyrdde fro
Abrahain to David / The fourth fro david to the transmygracion that was when
Israhel was brought in to thraldom of Babilone / The fyfthe fro the
transmygracion to Crist. The sixthe fro Crist to the worlds end / And here

merueylles that byfelle in her beginning / as the first age began fro the

Circumsicion. The fourth fro the beginning of kings / the fyfte from the

Gouernyng of meyne and of household / Getyng of blifful mede^ In the which
blaseth and shyneth rewardyng of good men and punysshyng of evil men / For the

the Jews in tretys^ and couenauntes have a year vsual^ And begins in
Ianyuer^ In devotion and sacryfyce they have a year lawful and begins in
march / Also they have a year of apperyng that they use in Calculyng and in
Cronyke / And begins in May when they passed out of Egypt. Also the
greeks in three manner wise acount^n their years First for Joy of the vyctorye
they acounte her years fro the taking of Troy. Afterward they acounte her by
olympiades that been the times of their Ioustes and tournementes / But after
that they reigned they acounted their yere^ by her regnyng in this manner Anno
Regni Grecorum quinto vel tercio tali vel tali sicut patet in libro Machabeorum
/ when the Romans waxed in her flowers they acounted her years fro the
buyldyng of the Cite ab vrbe condita^ But Christian men fro the Incarnacion of
Criste acou^ten her years / But when me comes to that place men must take heed / that the Calculyng of denis that england and F^aunce folowen has less
by xxij year than the calculyng of Iherome that follows the Gospel / willelmus
Malmesburyensis bbro.4^ de pont says that marianus scotus. and the monk
prysoned in maguncia a town of almayn about the year of grace a / M / three
score / and / xvj. looked bysyly in books and acounted and fond that dyonisyus
exiguus acordeth not with the gospel in acountyng of yeres^ ffor this Scot
marianus acou^ted all the years from the beginning of the world and put to
xxii year that lacked of denis acountes. And wrote a great cronyke and an huge
/ the which book Robert bishop of herforde deflored. and that for it is that
the common Cronikes that foloweden denis faylled al daye^ ffor I^erome in
translatyng the cronyke of Eusebij say^h that years lack between Cristes
passion and vaspasianus tyme^ And also.xij. years lack about decius cezars
time as it is showed in the / vj^ age / This error bifalleth for days and
months were vnrekened that kings reigned over full years. Also days and
months that voyded between two kings were forgoten. wherefore in this book I
shall mark as I may how and what years such defawtes fylle / So that I shall
hyghte the margyns by the hedes of the historyes sum wych double and sum

De prouyncijs orbis / Et primo de Paradiso. Capitulum decimum
FOr the knowleche of erthly paradyse / three points must be known / wherefore
three questions must be axed^ the first question axeth if any such place is on
earth / The second axeth whytherward^ and where is paradyse in earth. the
third axeth what country and place is paradyse in erthe^ ffor the first four
manner witnessis we have that paradyse is in earth / ffyrst stories that lykened
Sodom er it were ouertourned to paradyse^ The second witness is of hem that
assayed^ wrote and said that they had seen that place / The thyrdde wytnes /
ben the four Ryuers that rennen out of paradise. ffor the heed of thylke
ryuers ben not founden in see ne in ffresshe water ner in land that men dwell
Inn though Kings of Egypt and many other trauaylled well often and sought there
after. Therefore Ysid ^xiij. eth^ says that Iherom took head that other
understanding byhoueth of the Ryuers of paradyse than Auctours written. Also
Basilius in exam^ron / ysid eth^ libro xiiij. and Josephus libro primo sayen
that waters falling of the highest hylle of paradyse maken a great ponde / and
out of that ponde / as it were a well the four Ryuers spryngen / Petrus
capitulo 14 / Of the which four Ryuers the first is physon / And is to menyng
full wexynge of plente / That River physon passes in to Inde and draws with
him golden grauel^ Phison has another name^ and is called ganges of a King of
Inde. which was named Gangarius. But Ganges is to say. Felawship and
Company. For it receives t^n great Ryuers that rennen thereto / The second is
called / Gyon and Nylus also. And goth about Ethiopia and Egypt The thyrdde
is Tygris / And as Josephus says dyglath also that is to say sharp. ffor it
is swyfte as Tygris which is a right swyft beeste. And Tygris passes toward
Assyria that land / Ysidorus libro tercis decimo^ The most certain Auctour
Salustius says that there comes a well out of Cerannes the hills of Armenye
and spryngeth out of the foot of the hylle that is called Cancasus. And that
well is the heed of tweyne Ryuers^ of Tygris and of Eufrates. the which two
Ryuers sometime ben^ departed a sonder and sometime medlid to gyders. and of^e
time they ben swolowed in to the earth / And after spryngen up again. And long
after goon about. Mesopotonya that land / and dounward in to the reed Se^e.
R. And though men read in books that Nylus comes out of Paradyse / Yet sum
men affermen and say that Nylus spryngeth in the weste side of the land of
Ethiopia not fe^ fro the hylle that is named Athlas / And gooth about Ethiopia
and dounward by Egypt / Seche the proprete of Nylus in the Chapter Egiptus^
The fourth witness and proof that such a place is in Earth that is called
Paradyse^ is old Fame and long durynge^ ffor men shall bileue old fame that is
not withseyde^ But Fame of Paradyse has endured without gaynsayeng six
thousand year and more. For fro the beginning of the world unto our days it
has endured. And Fame that is false endures not so long. ffor it falls out
of mind or is dispreuyd by Sothnes known / Of the second question that Axeth
in which side of the world and in what place paradyse should be^ Though that
short wytted men and lytil of assaye say that paradyse is long sayllyng out
of the earth that men dwell Inn^^ And also departed from the earth. and is as
high as the moon / it is not to be bileued^ ffor nature and reason both
withsaye it / ffor if paradys were departed atwynne fro the earth that men
dwell Inne^ ne water ne eyer might bear such a burden / also the fuyer
occupyeth all the myddel space between thayer and the moon / then paradyse
is not there^ ffor then nothing might live therinne / also if paradyse were
so hyghe^ sometime it should take a way the light and make eclypse of the moon.
but of such an eclypse herd we never Also if paradyse were so high and
departed a sonder from every land and earth. how should the four Ryuers that
spryngen out of paradyse pass by the air and the wide see and come in to
lands that men dwell Inn / And if men say that paradyse is so high that in
one place it contynueth to the earth that men dwell June / Then the earth is
enlong and not round al about as wise men descryuen hit^ but that may not
stonde^ For it is know by experyence and assaye that in every eclypse of the moon the earth makes a round shield / Therefore the earth with all his parties
must needs be rounde^ And so wise men conclude that paradyse is in the
vttermest ends of the eest. and that it is a great country of the earth no
less than Inde or Egypt / and a large place and couenable for all mankind to
dwell Inne^ if mankind had not sinned. Of the thyrdde that axeth of paradyse
what manner place it should be. ysid says / libro 14 / ca / 3o. / that this name
paradis y turned out of grue in to latin is as much to say as an orchard but
paradise in ebrew is called ede^ that is to say lykynge^ The which tweyne y
put to gyder makes an Orchard of lykyng.R. no wonder^ ffor in that place is
all thing that acordeth to lyf^ Ysid libro quarto decimo / There is health for
the eyer is attemperat neither to hot ne to cold so that nothing that lives
may deye therinne. that withnessith Enok and hely that yet ben there a lyue^
Johannes damascenus that place has fair weder and myrthe / ffor it was the

paradyse Though sum men say that paradyse is high as the moon / that is not
soth in words and in deed but that speech is saved by an excusacion of spekyng

De palacijs Rome
THere were many palayces ryal and noble y build in Rome in worship of
Emperors and of other noble men also Among the which the grettest and most
palace of all was in the myddel of the cite in toke^ of one principalite of
all the world wide / Also the palace of pees^ therein Romulus did do set his
own image of gold and said / hit shall never fall til a maid bear a child /
And that image fylle when Criste was born / Dioclisians palace has pylers as
high an a stone cast / and so great about that an c men al a year worchyng
should uneath hew one of thylk pylers. Also there was a palace of sixty
emperours^ and yet stondeth a part thereof. that al Rome may not destroy / De
templis There as pantheon the temple of all mawmetrye was is now a church of
all halowen And by cause our lady is after Criste is chyef and holiest of all
mankind / that church has the name of our lady. and is called sancta maria
rotunda that is the round church of our lady. And has in bread the space of /
ij / C^lx^ foot / Fast by that temple is an Arche of Marble. And that is the
Arche of Augustus Cesars victoryes and great deeds / In that Arche ben all his
great Acts descryued There is also Scipions Arche^ he overcome hauibal. At
saint steven in piscina was the temple olouitreum that was made of cristal and
of gold. there was Astronomye y graven and y peynted with sterres and signs of
heuene saint sebastian destroyed that temple^ Also the capitol was arrayed with
glass and with gold as it were the myrour of all the world about / There the
consuls and senators governed and rewlid all the world as much as was in her
power / And there was Iupyters temple. And in that temple was Iupyters image of
fyn gold syttyng in a trone. R Here takehedr that only three temples were in
Rome that had flamynes. that were bisshops to serve / falls gods and mametrye
and highte flamynes as it were filamynes of filo that is a threde that they
bond about her heed. when they might not in the holy day suffer on her
pylyons and her cappes for hete / In Iupyters temple served fflamen dialis that
is the day bisshop^ For Iupyter was cleped diespyter / that is the fader of the
day. Also in Mars temple was flamen Marcialis / that is mars bishop And in
Romulus temple was Flamen quyrinalis that is quirinus bisshop^ For Romulus was
called quyrinus also De domibus In rome was an hows y made well nyghe al of gold
and lefette ^ with precious stones / Men said that / that hows was worth well
nygh the thyrdde part of of all the world / In that hows every land and prouynce
had an image y set by Nigromancie. Eueryche of thylke images bare his own
lands name wreton an on his breast. And a cokerbelle of silver honged about
his neck. So that if any land rebelled or aroose against Rome / Anon the Image
of that land turned his bak toward the image of Rome and the belle about his
neck should ring / And the priests that kept that hows / eueryche by his
course. warned the princes of that doing / there was also an horsman of bras on
high on the coppe of that house and meued also with a spear in his hond^ and
turned the point of his spear toward that land that would so arryse^ And so
the Romans might lightly come upon their enemies unware In that hows also was
a fire that no man might quench. And men axed of the crafts man that made it^
how long it should endure^ And he answered and fayde hit should endure for
evermore unto. that a maid had born a child / and the same night that Criste
was born that^ hows fylle down. and the fire was quenchyd that same night and
time Also beaneus appollo that man closed a confeccion of brymsto^n and of blak
salt in a vessel of brass. and set it a fire with a candel that he had
halewed in his manere^ and made there a bath with bathyng places that al way
were hoote / There was also in an hows an image of iron. and was named
Bellefrontes image / which weyed fyftene M pound with his horse that he sat on
And henge in the air with no post ne piler bynethe under set / ne hold
with cheyne above but adamante stones that were in the vawte and in^ the Arches
about drowhe even the iron eueryche to his side so that the iron image might
not dounward ne upward ne toward neither side but henge always even a mydde / De
Artificijs. There is a^ place in Rome in Eraclea and is called theatrum^ that
is a place to stand or sytte Inn / for to look well about / there in is
wonderly graven cabans and dens. diverse outgoynges benches and seges al
aboute^ and is hoole and sound al on marbel stone^ and this werk is set vppn
vj crabbes y hewe^ of hard marbelst one In that place may noman so pryuely
speak. ne to him self ne to another man / But all that he says be herd al
about / Fast by Augustus Cezars palace is awalle made of burnt tile / And
stretches dounward out of the high hills by the yate port asmaria. that
wall is made upon great Arches and huge that wall stretches a days Journey
from Rome in a great conduyte vpan that wall the watres and stremes of the
wells of the montaynes rennen in to Rome^ And then it is departed in dyuse
conduytes and pipes of bras. and so ran sometime in to every palace of Rome /
For the water of tiber is hoolsom and good for horse / And vnhelsome and evil
for men / therefore the old Romans made fresshe water come out of four parts
of the cite by weyes craftily made / and thereof men might take all that they
would while the comins of rome were in her flowers. By that wall is the bath.
that bianeus made of the which bath was spoken to fore. In Albisterio a place
that hight mutatorium Cezaris were made white stoles for emperors / Also there
was a candelstyk made of a stone that higthe Albeston. when it was ones yteyned
and set a fire and y set without there could noman quench it with no craft
that men could deuyse / R In this manner it might be that the geant pallas
about the year of our lord a thousand and fourty^ that yer was found in Rome
a geants body buried hool and sound / the space of his wound was four foot
long and an half^ The length of his body passed the heygthe of the walls.
at his heed was y found a lantern brennyng always that noman could quench
with blast ne with water ne with other craft / unto the time that there was
made a lytil hoole under the light / bynethe that the air might enter. Men
seyen that Turnus slowghe this geant Pallas when eneas fought for lauina that
was Eneas wife. This / geantes epytaphium is this the writing of mind of him
that lay there was this Pallas euanders sone lies here^ him turnus the knight
with his spear slowhe in his manner De statuis et signis There was at Rome a
bulle^ of bras in the shap of Jupiter ouercast and shape to men that looked
thereon. That bulle seemed lowhyng and startelyng^ There was also the image of
venns al naked in the same manner as venus shewde her self to that man Paris
sometime of troy / and was so craftily made that in the mouth and lips that
were as white as any snow seemed fresshe blood and new. there is also at Rome a
wonder copped pyler and is Romulus Piler. that pyler pylgryms and palmers that
fast can^ lie call hit saint Peter's corn hupple and sayen that when nero
the emperor had rauisshed it hit turned in to an hylle of stone. as great as it
was before of corn / Emonge all pilers Julius cezars pyler is most wonderful
/ and has in heyghte two honderd and fyfty foot. In the coppe thereof in a
round thing of bras ben Julius cezars bones and ashes / Of that pyler and
arche ben verses y. made that been thus to menynge and namely of the ouermest
stone / if the stone is one. tell what craft brought him upon. And if they be
many stones. tell where they ioynen at ones^ This arche and pyler is y founded
and set upon four lions / pylgryms full of lesynges / call this arche and
pyler saint Peter's nelde and lie and say that thylk man is clean of sin that
may crepe under that stone^ there ben also in Rome two great horses of marbel
stone / For in Tiberius time two young philosophers praxitellus and Fibia /
come to Rome and yeden al naked. And when the emperor axed him why and wherefore
they went so naked / they answered. and said. For we have forsaken al thing.
And for all thing is to us naked and bare and openly known. ye sir Emperor and
all that thou spekest in counseyl and pryuete we know at best / Treuisa the
first point of this doing and answer techeth that who that forsakes / al
thing forsakes his clothes^ And so it follows that they that been well clothed
and goth about and beggeth and gadreth money and corn and catel of other men
forsakes not al thing R The Emperor assayde and fond soth all that they said.
and at her owen prayer / made in mind of hem two great horses of marbel^ there
is another sign and token before the popes palace an horse of bras and a man
sittyng thereon And holds this righthonde as though he spoke to the people and
holds his bridle in his lift hand and has a cucko between his horse heeres.
And a seek dwerf under his feet Pilgrims clepen that man. Theodoricus And the
comyns call him Constantinus / But Clerks of^ the court call him Marcus and
quintus cursius also^ this sign stood sometime to fore in piters awlter^ In
the Capitoyl upon the four pilers of bras / but saint gregory threw down horse
and man and set him to fore the popes palace / They that call him marcus tell
this reason and skylle There was a dwarf of the kynred of mesenis his craft was
Nygromancie when he had subdewed kings that dwelled nygh him and made him
subgette to him. Then he went to Rome to war with the Romans / And with
his crafte^ he bynam the romans power* and might for to smite. and biseged hem
long time y closed within the cite / This dwerf went every day tofore the
soune rysyng in to the field for to do his craft: when the romans had espied
that manner doing of the dwarf they spak to marcus a noble knight and bihighte
him lordship of the Cite. and a Memorial in mind for evermore if be would
deffende^ hem and save the Cite / then^e Marcus made an hool through the wall
longer it were day for to abide his craft to cache this dwerf^ And when it was
time the cucko sange and warned him / of the day Then marcus raised to. and
by cause he myghtnot hitte the dwerf with wepen he caught him with his hand /
and bare him in to the cite / And for dread lest he should help him self with
his craft if he might speak. he threw him under the horse feet / And the horse
alto trade him / And herfore that / image was made in remembrance of this deed
/ They that call that image and sign quintus cursius tell this skylle and
reason / there was sometime in the myddel of Rome a great clyfte or hoole in the
earth out of that hool come smook and brymstone and slew many men^ then
Quintus cursius took counseyl of phoebus and armed hym^ and entered in to the
hool^ then anon fleygh a cuckou out of the hool^ and then the earth closed
to gyder and so the hool was stopped. Another sign is colloseus image that is
called also the image of the son or of Rome / There is great wonder how it
might be yoten or arered / the image is so great the length thereof is six
score foot and six. this image was sometime in the ybond herodius fyften foot
heygher than the heyghest place in rome. this image bare in his right hand a
spear al round y shape as the world^ And in his lift hond a swerd that
bytokeneth might of batayll^ in token that it is less maystrye to win and to
conquer than it is to keep and to save that / that is conquered and won. this
image was of bras but it was so ryally ouergylt that it shone in derknes and
yaf great bemes of light^ Also it meued about with the son in such a manner
that always his face was toward the son. All the Romans that come thereby
worshipped that image in token of subjection and of thraldom Saint gregory
destroyed that image with fire ffor he might not destroy it with strength /
Of that image is only y left the heed and the right hond holdyng the spear /
that is the Roundenes and the likeness of the world. For of all that image left
no more vnbrente that heed and that hand ben now to fore the popes palace upon
/ ij / pylers of marble^ and wo^derly by craft of milting that bras was y yoten
/ that the here seems soft to a man's sight. and the mouth as though it
were spekyng Polier / ^^bro secundo / For to highte the noblete of this Cite
the Romans made a woman's image in bras^ that image h^ld in (...) hand a spear
the shape of the wide world / And when the image was full made him seemed that
the legs were to feeble for to bear such an image. hit was so great and so

and that right selde / therefore the holsomnes and health of that land and the
clennes out of venyme. is worth all the boost and richesse of trees of herbs
of spycerye / of rich clothes and of precious stones of the eeste lands / The
cause of the health and holsomnes of that land is the attemperat hete and

land of worms and of venomous beestes^ But it is more probable and more
skillful that this land was from the beginning always without such wormes^ For
venomous beestes and worms dyen there anon if men bring hem theder out of

English men seyn that gurmundus wan Irlond and made thylke dyches / and make

they ben born out in to the next land and deye there / There is another ylond
in Irlond that no woman therein may bear a childe^ but yet she may conceive Also
there is an Ilond in which no deed body may roten In vltonia that is vlster is
an Ilond in a lake wonderly departed in tweyne / In that one party is great
disturbaunce and discomfort of Fendes / And in that other party great lykyng
and comfort of holy Angels^ there is also saint patriks purgatory that was
showed at his prayers to conferme his prechyng and his lore^ when he preached to
mysbyleued of sorrow and of pain that evil men should suffer for her wicked
works / And of joy and bliss that good men shall resseyue for her holy deeds.
He tells that who that suffers the pains of that purgatorye^ if it be
enjoyed him for penance. he shall never suffer the pains of helle-but he dye
finally without repentance of sin / as the ensample is set more fulle at
this chapytres end Treuisa / But truly noman may be saved. but if he be very
repentaunt what sommeuer penance he do / And every man that is very

well / who that wassheth him with the water of that well he shall wexe hoar on
his heed / there is another well in vltonia. who someuer is wesshen therein he
shall never wexe hoar afterward / There is a well in mownstre or momonia / if.
any man touch that well anon shall fall great rain in all the prouynce / And
that rain shall never cesse / til a priest that is a clean maid singe a mass
in a chapel fast by and bless the water and with milk of a Cow that is of

manner At glyndalcan about the Oratorye of saint keywyn withges berith apples
as it were apple trees and ben more holsom than sauery / that holy saint
brought forth these apples by prayers for to heel his child that was seek There
is a lake in vlster and much fyssh therein which is.xxx mile in length and xv
in brede^ the River ban renneth out of that lake in to the north Occean And
men say that this lake began in this manner / there were men in that country
that were. of evil living / coeuntes cum brutis / And there was a well in
that land in great reverence of old. time and always couerd^ and if it were
left vncouerd the well would rise and drown all the land: and so it happed
that a woman went to that well for to fetch water And hied her fast to her
child that wept in the cradbe and left the well vncouerd / than the well
sprang so fast that it drowned the woman and her child and made all the country
a lake and ffyssheponde^ for to preue that this is soth it is a great argument
that when the weder is clear / Fysshers of that water see in the ground under

In the northsyde of Irlond in the country of Ossiriens. every seven year at

exyled and forshappen in to lykenes of wolves and abide out seven year / And
at the end of seven year / if they live they come home again and take again
their own shappe / And then shall other tweyne goo forth in their stead and so
forshapen for other seven year / there is a lake in this land if a pool of tree
be pyght and stycked therein that part of the shaft or pool that is in therthe

there is a lake that torneth hasell in to asshe and asshe in to hasell if it be

and the water there shall wexe bitter and stynke / And he that did the wrong
shall not asterte without wreche and meschyef but if be do amends / R As
touching patriks purgatorye^ ye shall understand that the second s^int patrike
that was abbot and not bishop while he preached in Irlonde labored and studied
for to torn thylke wicked men that lived as beestes out of her evil life for
dread of pains of helle^ And for to conferme hem in good life / And they said
they would not torn but sum of them might know somewhat of the great pains /
and also of bliss that he spak of Then saint Patrik prayed to god almighty
therefore / And our lord ihesu crist appierid to saint patrik and took him a
staf / and ladde him in to a wild place and showed him there a Round pytte
that was derke within and said / that if a man were very repentaunt and stable
of bileue and went in to this pytte and walked therinne a day and a night he
should see the sorrows and the pains of evil men and the joy and bliss of
good men / Then crist vanyssyhed out of patriks sight / And saint patrik
arered and bylded there a chirche^ and put therein chanons Reguler^ and closed
the pytte about with a walle^ and is now in the church yerd at est end of

went in and came out again in patriks tyme^ And told of pains and joy that

HCre Graldus makes mind that as men of this nation ben more angry than other
men and more hasty for to take wreche whiles they ben alive. So seyntes and
halowes of this land ben more wrecheful than sayn^es of other lands / Clerks
of this land ben chaste and sayen many prayers and don great abstynence a day
and drynketh al night. So that it is acounted for a miracle / that lecherye
regneth not there as wine regneth^ And they that been evil of them ben worst of
all other / so good men among them though they be but few ben good at best
/ Prelates of that country ben full slow in correction of trespaas and besym
contemplacion and not in prechyng of gods worde^ Therefore it is that all the
saints of that land. ben confessors and no martyr emonge them and no wonder.
For all the prelates of this land ben chosen out of abbayes in to the
clerg^e / And don as monks sholde^ what Clerks and prelates should do is to
them vnknowen^ therefore when it was put ayenste the bishop of Cassil how it
might be that so many saints ben in Irlond and never a martyr among hem all
sith that the men ben so shreud and so angry / and the prelates so recheles and
slow in correction of trespaas / the bishop answered frowardly ynowgh and
said our men ben shrewd and angry ynowgh to hem self. but to gods servants
they ^eye never hand / but do to hem great reverence and worship^ But
English men come in to this land that can make martres and were wont to use
that craft / R The bishop said so by cause that king harry the second was tho
new comen in to Irlond fresshly after the marterdom of saint thomas of
Counterbury / Gir^ in this land in wales and in scotland ben belles and staves
with crooked heedes and other such things for relyquyes in great reverence and
worship / So that men of this land dreden more for to swear upon any of thylke
belles and gold staves than upon the gospel^ The chyef of all such relyquyes

For to have in mind

And then preyse the land and well
Then I shall write with my pe^ne
All the manners of the men

For camber brutes sone
Was prince and there did wone
Then wallia was to mean /
For gwalaes the queen
King ebrancus child

And of that lord gwalon

And put to / l^ i^ a

And though this land
Be much less than england
As good glebe is one as other
In the daughter as in the mother
Of the commodytees of the land of wales
Though that land be luyte.
It is full of corn and of fruit
And has great plente ywys
Of flesh and eke of fysshe
Of beestes tame and wild
Of horse sheep oxen mylde
Good land for all seeds /
For corn gras and herbs yt spredes
There ben wodes and medes /
Herbs and flowers there spredes
There ben rivers and wells
Valeys and also hills
Valeys bring forth flood
And hills metals good
Cool grows under land
And gras above at hand
There lyme is copious
And slattes for hows.
Honey and milk white /
There is deynte and not lyte
Of braket methe and ale
Is great plente in that vale
And all that needs to the live
That land brings forth ryue.
But of great riches to be draw
And close many in short saw
Hit is a corner small
As though god first of al

To be selere of al hele
Wales is deled by /
A water that heet twy /
Northwales from the southe /
Twy delith in places full couth.
The southe heet demecia
And the other venedocia /
The first shoteth and arowes beres.
that other deleth al with speres.
In wales how it be
Were sometime courts three
At carmarthyn was that one
And that other was in moan
The third was in powysy
In pengwern yt now is shrousbury
There were bisshops seven
And now ben four euen^
Under saxons al at hand
Sometime under pinces of yt la^d
Of manner and rites of the walssmen
The manner living of yt londe^
Is well diverse from england
In mete and drynk and clothyng
And many other doing /
They be clothed wonder well
In a shirt and in a mantel
A crisp breche well fayn
Both in wind and in rain.
In this clothyng they be bold
Though the weder be right cold
Without shetes always
Evermore in this array
They goo fight pleye and lepe
Stand sit lie and sleep
Without surcot goun cote and kirtell.
Without iope^ tabard cloc or bell /
without lace and chaplet yt her lappes
Without hode hatte or cappes^
Thus araid goon ye segges
And always with bare legs
They keep none other going /
Though they mete with ye king
With arowes and short speres
They fight with them yt he^ deres
They fight better if they neden
When they go tha^ wha^ they ride^
Instead of castle and tour
They take wode and mareis for so /
When they see it is to do cour /
In fyghtyng they wol be a go^
Gildas seyth they ben varyable
In pees and not stable
If men axe why it be
It is wonder for to see
Though men put out of land
To put out other would fond
But al for nout at this stand
For all many wodes be^ at gro^de
And upon the sea among
Ben castles builded strong
The men may dure long un ete
And love well comune mete
They can ete and ben mury /
Without great cury.
They ete breed cold and hoot
Of barley and of ote
Broad cakes round and thynne
As well seems so great kynne
Selde they ete breed of wheet
And selde they done ones ete
They have gruel to potage
And lekes kind to companage /
Also butter milk and chese
Y shape enlong and corner wese
Such messes they ete snel
And that makes he^ drynk well
Methe and ale that has might
Thereon they spend day and night
Ever the redder is the wyn.
They hold it the more fyn
When they drink at ale
They tell many a lewd tale
or when drink is an ho^dling
They ben full of Iangling /
At mete and after eke
Her solace is salt and leke
The husbond in his wise
Tells that a great prise /
to give a caudron with gruele
To hem that sitten on his mele
He deleth his mete at mele
And yeueth every man his dele.
And all the ouerpluse
He keeps to his own use /
Therefore they have woo
And mishappes also
They ete hoote samon always /
All though phisik say nay
Her howses ben low with all
And made of yerdes small
Not as in citres nyhe /
But fer a sonder and not to hihe
When al is eten at home /
Then to her neighbors will they
and ete what they may find and see /
And then torn home a ye. rome
The life is idle that they ledes
In bre^ning sleping and such deeds
Walsshmen use with her myght^
to wesshe their ghestes fret a nyt
If he wessh her feet al and somme^
Then they know yt they be well
They live so esily in a rowte
That selde they bear purs about
At her breche out and home come
They hong their money and comb /
It is wonder they be so hende
And hate crak at nether ende^
And without any core^
Make their wardroppe at door
They have in great mangery /
harp tabour and pipe for mi^stralcie
They bear corpse with sorrow gret^
and blow loud horns of gheet
They praise fast troyan blood
For thereof come al her broad /
Neyh kyn they will be
Though they passen an ^C / degree /
above other me^ they will he^ dit
and worship prestes with her myt
As angels of heaven right
they worshipe servants of god.
Often giled was this brood
And yerned batayl al for wode
For merlins prophecy almyt
And often for sortelegye.
Best in manners of britons.

they tille^ gardins field and dounes
And draw hem to god tounes
They ride armed as wole god
And goo y hosed and y shood
And sitten fair at her mele
And sleep in beds fair and fele^
So they seem now in mind
More englissh than walssh kind
If men axe why they now do so
More than they woonte to do /
They lyuen in more pees
Because of their riches
For their catel should slake
If they used often wrake
Dread of loss of her good
Make them now stylle of mode

they be nygh to the alyens that speak straungely And also by cause that the
kings of england abide and dwell more in the south countreye than in the
north country. The cause why they abide more in the south country than in the

more cruel and more vnesy. The myddel men ben somdele parteners with both /
Also they use hem to glotony more than other men and ben more cestlew in mete
and clothyng / me supposes that they took that vice of king hardekunt that

also these men ben spedeful on horse and a foot. able and ready to all manner
deeds of arms And ben wont to have vyctorye and maystrye in every fight where
no tr^son is walkyng. And ben curious and can well tell deeds and woundres that
they have seen. Also they goo in diverse lands uneath ben any men rycher in
her owen land / or more gracious in fer and in strange lands / They can
better win and get new than keep her owen heritage Therefore it is that they
be spradde so wide and wene that every land is their own. The men ben able to
al manner sleyght and wit But to fore the deed blondryng and hasty And more
wise after the deed And leueth of lightly what they have begone Pol / li / 6.
Therefore Eugenius the pope said that Englyssmen were able to do what ever
they would / and to be set and put to fore all other / ne were that light

but in her own country So englyssmen^ mow not be overcome in strange lands
but in her owen country they be lightly overcome R These men despysen her own

A knight as a duke / A duke as a kynge^ yet sum goo about and like to al

Sardanapali ye must understand hem as the poets feyned of hem / Argus was an
herd and kept beestes. he had an honderd eyes / and argus was also a ship a
shipman and a chapman And so Argus might see before and behind and on every
side Therefore he that is wise and ware and can see that he be not deceived may
be called argus^ And so the Cronyke seyth in plurel numero that Englyssmen ben
Argy / that is to say they see about where as wynnyng is / That other word
tantali the poet feyned that tantalus slow his own sone^ wherefore he is
dampened to perpetuel penaunce^ And he stands always in water up to the neither
lyppe. And has always Ripe apples and noble fruit hangyng down to the over
lyppe / but the fruit ner the water may not come within his mouth^ he is so
hold and stands between mete and drynk and may neither ete ne drynke^ and is
ever an hongred and a thyrst that woe is him a lyue^ by this manner lyknes of
tantalus they that do right naught / there as much thing is to do in every
side ben called tantali / It seems that it is to say in trauayl they be
tantali / For they do right naught thereto / the thyrdde word is dedali. take heed that dedalus was a subtyl and a slye man / And therefore by lykenes they
that been subtyl and slye ben called dedali / the fourth word is Sardanapali Ye
shall understand that Sardanapalus was king of assyryens and was full unchaste
and used him to lie softe^ And by a manner of lykenes of him they that live
unchastly ben y cleped Sardanapaly R But among all English men meddled to
gyders is so great chaungyng and dyuersyte of clothyng and of array and so many
manner and diverse shappes that well nyghe is there any man known by his

AFter that places and countrees be rekened and descryued of the world wide.
the order of the tale of the storye axeth that beryng and deeds of the world be
also descriued^ But every thing is for somewhat. and that is more^ Treuisa /
Here this auctoryte of the philosophre is to mean. that al thing that is
reasonable and kyndly ordained for another thing / as a mean for to come thereto
and for to save / It is ordeynyng for better thing and more noble than is that
thing that is so ordeynyng. therefore / eeryng^ and sowyng and dongyng of land^
is ordained for to have good corn / And good corn is better than all the other
deel Also medycyne is ordained for heel / and hele is better than the medycyne
/ Also mete and drynk and other things be ordained for the life / And the life
is better and more noble than the mete and drynk. and al other things that be
so ordained for the life R Than sith that the more world is made for the less
as holy write seyth / The more shall serve the lasse^ and now the more world is
descryued in our foresawes in the first book. than is it skillful somdele to
descryue the less world also. from the beginning of his forne dedes^ that it
might be know what manner thing it is. and how great / that is so little / and
does so greet deeds. in the more world that is so great and so huge / And
also the worcher and the maker of al things that has with him shaply resons
of al manner things. when he had made the more world than he made the less /
And thaugh he made him lord of the great world. yet he prynted on him the
likeness of the great world for a man and the world be like in three things /
In length and bread in kyndly disposicion and virtues worchyng

And first though the length of a man's body that is from the soole of the
foot to the top of the heede^ be such six as the bread that is from the one
side of the ribs to the other side and ten so much as the depnesse that is
from the rigge to the womb Netheles Before libro / vij / ca / 18 / seith that
as much space as is bitwene cinct. that is the point that is in the firmament
even ayenste him in the other side of the earth so much is out of the eest in
to the west and so it is in the body of a man that as much as is from the
soole of the foot to the top of the heed / so much is between his twey
longest fyngres ends and he stretche out his arms and hands a brood Also
Before the right capo 17. Seyth that the stature and the mesure of a child
when he is three year old is even half his mesure and his stature that he shall
have when he is of age. if he live so long / the second as we see in the world
so we see in a man / that (...) members and the parties helps and stands
eueryche other in ste^e and byne^meth his woo^ For the over lymmes governs
and yeueth. the neither lymmes bears and serves / the myddle receives and
deleth about the other lymmes / And in the either world if a limme is out of
his own place and entrede to another place / than in his own / anon is great
distourbaunce made as when the air is enclosed within the earth / than therth
quaketh / and when within the clouds than is greet thondryng Also in the body
of a man when the lymmes be writhed out of her own places / or if the humors
be apayrede. than is ache sickness and sorrow Also when the lymmes be well
arrayed and as they should be in shappe color and hew manner quantite
gretenesse and smalnesse meuyng and place than has the man good pees and
quyete and is in good hele and rest The contrary falls and the lymmes be
evil and not ryghtly arrayed / Therefore Plato yafe his dome and said such
ordenaunces and disposicion and shap as a man has in his kyndly members and
lymmes^ such kyndly manners and deeds he foloweth^ also as it is in the parties
of the great world that they be so ordained. and y set that the highest of
the neither kind touch the lowest of the high kynde^ As oystres and
shelfysshe that be as it were lowest in beestes kind passes / but litil the
perfection of life of trees and herbs. For they may not meeue hem but as c^lpes
of the Sea waggeth with the water else they cleuen to the earth / and may
neither see ne here / taste ne smelle but only feel / when they be towched And
the last of the earth touchethe lowest of the water^ And the over most of the
water touches the lowest of the eyer and so upward by degrees anon to the
ouermost heaven Also the highest in bodyly kind that may be cleped skylfully
man's body kyndly and parfytly disposed arecheth to the lowest of the next
ouerkynde that is man's soul that holds the lowest degree of spyrytes and
of goostes that have knowledge and vnderstandyng^ And therefore it is cleped
Oryson as it were the next narche in kind between bodyly and goostly thynges^
By the soul me gooth up from the lowest kind by degrees of knowleche and of
connyng anon to the ouermost knowleche and understanding And when the soul is
all cleene without erthly liking it recheth otherwhyle to holy spirits that
be nothing bodily also man has somewhat common with things that be parties of
the great world ffor gregory in an Omely says that a man has being with stones
living with trees / and herbs / felyng with beestes knowledge and understanding
with angelis. Also in me^nes body seems earth in flesh and boones / water in
blood and in other humors / eyer in the longes: fire in the heart: and is
called homo in latin and antropos in grue. and is as it were a tree turned vpso
dou^ and has an heed with here as it were a root and has arms and thyes as
it were bows Touching the third likeness that is virtuous worchynge we see as
gregory says in an Omelye of the aduent that the world was at beginning
thryuyng and strong for to bring forth childer as it were in youth / and was
full of heel and so fressh and grene and by great riches it was fatt / but now
it is abated with eld and as it were driven toward the death with often and many
diseases: So in a man's youth the body is thryuyng the breast is strong the
nolle is bold / the arms be full / But in his elde the stature boweth and
croketh and stonpeth a down / the bold nolle abateth the breast is driven often
with many sighs and soore^ the breath shorteth and in all the body might and
strength abateth And though there were none other sickness in old men for the
more dele ^^le is sickness Also as we see that in the more world be two
contrary moeuynges / One is kyndely^ by the which the planettes and nether
welkens meoue out of the west in to the est. That other is violent by the
which they be y rauesshed ayeinwarde with the moeuynge of the ouermooste welken
or firmamente out of the Eeste in to the weste So it fares in a man that the
flesh coueyteth ayenste the spyryte ^ and the spyryte against the flesh

For the nether knowleches and wits fight ayenste the reason And yet a man
has common worchyng and suffryng like to many other parties of the more world
For he is slow and heavy as the earth / and fleteth away as the water and
withdraws suddenly as the eyer / and heteth as the ffyre* changes as the moon / Fyghteth and sleeth as mars / coueteth as Marcurius: goth out of kind
as Jupiter / And is cruel as Saturnus Also before libro septimo^ capitulo
tricio Seyth that as the utter parties of the greet world wellith and spryngeth
full of miracles wonders and meruaylles as in Inde / Ethiopia blew men land and
in Affryca So in mankind kind has slyly and craftily made wonderful works
and mirth / for first in a man's face there ben t^n lym^es other few moo.
there is so great diursyte that among many thousand men uneath is one found in
face like to another. In affryca be many that have wi^chyng tongues so that
things that they preyse they shende and slay with her praisynges / so that
trees that they preysen waxen dry and childer deye So in triuallis and in
Iliricis be men that slay with her sight what they behold and look on long
namely and they be grieved / and wroth while they look so and bihold^ and these
have in either eye twey blackes Also among us varro says kind has y gendred
and brought forth venym in sum men's eyes so that none evil is found. that
there nys somewhat lyche y found in mankind. So sum parties of a man's body
be forbyson and bodyng of wondres so pirrus king of Epyrothes had a great too
in his right foot / the touching of that too was a good medecyne against venym /
And that too might not be burnt with the other bodye^ when the other parties
of his body was burnt So Auctours tell also Plius li 7 ca^e 7 seyth that
sum men be geten and born with gendryng stones clenyng to gyders as it were
al one / Sum be borne with one bone al hool instead of teth and that boon is
harder and sharper than any man's toth / So prusi king of Bithimia had a
son that had abo^n in his mouth instead of his other teth / one boon al hool
and that boon was so hard / that when the other dele of the body was brent
that boon might not brenne also Ibid ca. 18. So^me men live and eueryche of hem
has the boones of his body cleuyng to gyders as it were all one bone all
hoole and without mary: these men be never a thirst also they sweet never more^
Treuisa So^me men tell some man in irland has one boon al hoole in oo side instead of al his ribs: and Tom hayward of barkley has in the moold of his
head polle and forheed but one boon al hool therefore he may well suffer great
strokes above on his heed without hurt: Also plius l: 7: c: 21 seith that some
men had in all the body senewes even straight thwert over and cross wise and
^assing wonderful in strength: some may dure to run without werinesse some be
passing clear of fight: as a knight that highte Strabo stood in a waytes
place and saw the nauyes and ships of puny that were from him an honderd
five and thirtty miles: Also plius li. 11: capitulo: 44: seyth That tiberius
Cezar saw more clearly in derknesse than in light so that when he waked in
the night he might see al thing clerly about / Also plius li 7 c 27^ Sum were
wonder mighty of mind as cyrus king of perse that to all the knights of his
host yaf certain names R And seneca / p. li / declamacionum seyth of him self
that he was so mighty of mind that he rehearsed two thousand names arewe by
heart in the same order as they were said. and that he rehearsed moo than two
honderd versus / that other men had yeuen and began at / last / and rehearsed
anon to the first withouten any faylle / Also he says that Cineas pirrus
messager king of Epirotes. this Cineas the second day that he came to Rome he
salewed and grette the Senators and spoke to eueryche of the people about him
by his own name^ Another says that Cineas had made a great making of poesye.
For he rehearsed it at first heryng more swiftly than he that had made it.
Also plius / li 7 / c. 27. Seith that som^e were noble and wise of wit as
Julius cezar that was wont to read and write what men seyde with a good
auisement al attones / Also he used to write quaires and endite lettres and
write pistles al attones

Also plius li bro 7 c 18 / seith that sum men have more strength in the
right side and sum have more in the lift side^ and some be like strong in
either side^ Also men be heuyer than women and deed men's bodies be heuyer
than quyck and slepynge than wakyng heuier also^ Of the careynes of deed men
renneth foul moisture and humors and they ligge upright / and of the careynes
of deed women / if they leg neuelyng and dounright as thaugh kind spared
shame Also li. 7. ca 17 we read that oo man lough that day that he was born and
put away a man's hand that groped and handled him also c. 20 / Me speaks /
of some me^ that never lough of some that weep never. of some that spytte never of
some that bok balked never / Treuisa Rogger bag was a full old man at wotto^
under egg in gloucestreshire he spytte never he coughed never Also seneca vbi
pius c 4 And as^ it is among other beestes so it is in mankind that sometime
one of mankind is both man and woman and such is cleped hermofrodyta and was
sometime cleped androginus and in englyssh is called a scrette and accounted
among meruaylles and wondres but now among us it is deynte / for it is selde
seen Also we have y seen and herd that sum change wonderly her shape / For
we saw in affryca a maid the same day that she should have been wedded
transformed and turned in to a man and anon forthwith berded and membred and
lymmed as a man and wedded a wife with in a short time after Also saint austinus
de c / d / libro tercio / c / / 29 touches that agellus / li^ atticar^co
noccm^ Seyth that women be sometime turned in to men it is no magel tale but it
is soth as the lettres be written / therefore agellus seyth that in a Cite called
Smyrna He saw a maid turned in to a man / the same day that she should have been wedded / Also such one was brought to Rome to the Senators in time of
lasciuius crassus and cassius longinus consuls of Rome and by heste of
dyuynours that tok^ head of weder and of chittryng of birds it was born into a
wild yland. Also titus lyuius speaks of hens that were turned in to cokkes /
And auicenna libro / 8 / de animalibus speaks of an hen that had overcome a
cok in fightyng / and after the fightyng and the victory she rered up the
tail as a cok^ and had anon a spore growyng on the leg and a crest on the
head as it were a cok / Also capitulo ^5^ Trogus seith that in egypt be ^vij^
children born at one birthen / and thies days if two twynnes be borne it is
selde that the mother and the first child live long after the birth and namely
if the one be a knauechild and that other a mayde^ Also^ cao.^ 12. And sometime
a woman conceyueth twey children and is but a lytil time bitwene and so the
childer be afterward borne one after another and be parfihte ynowgh / as it was
of hercules and his brother hispycle / And so it ferde or happend of that woman
that bare two childer^ one like to her husbonde / and that other to the
co^pyner / and of that woman that in the vij / month after her birth in the
second month after she bare twey Children / sum women bear always. maid
children and some always knave children and some always chau^gen and beren sometime
a maid child and sometime a man child some be barayne / and conceive of no man
and some co^ceyue of so^me me^ and of some me^ co^ceyueth not. Also / ca / 13 /
So^me bear children like to hem self and some like to the fader and sum like
to no man. sum bear daughters like to the faders and sum like to hem self
Sum bear childer like to her forfaders Ensample is Nyceus the noble peyntour
at by sancm^ that was borne of a fair mother and went out of kind and had one
hand as a blew man Hugo capitulo malo^ Me says that woman's kind is such /
that she conceyueth children like to things that they see peynted and shape
for the worchyng of the soul while the body is in geetyng of a child se^deth
inward likeness and shape that she sees without and rauess^th the images thereof
as it were to his disposicion / and so they vsen in spain for to bring fair
horses and gentel and hold hem before the mares and in her sight while they
conceive / and they use also to peynt fair culuers or downs in places there
culuers were wont to dwell / And quintilianus defends and excuses a woman
that was accused of spousebreche for she had born ablue man^ And he leyed for
her that such an image was peynted in her bedchambre when she conceived that
child. and ypocras wrote of a woman that should be dampened to the death for she
had borne a fair child that was not like to her self / ne to the fader / but
ypocras made men assaye / And it was found that such an image was peynted in
the fader and mother hedcha^bre / while that child was conceived / and so the
mother was saved. Plius^ li 7 / c / 13. There for in a man be many diuersitees
for swyftnesse of thought and chaungyng of wit in the concepcion emprynteth
in many diverse likeness and shappes^ In other beestes wit is as it were not
chaungeable therefore among hem all the broad is like to the same kind

When belus was deed his son nynus for to have sum comfort of his sorrow made
an image of his fader and he did that image so great worship and reverence that
he spared al evil doers that fled to that image by ensample of this doing many
men made images to her lyef friends. And so by ensample of belus mawmett come

Syrophanes of Egypt had an image of his son that was deed That image he
cleped ydolum that is likeness and shappe for likeness of sorrow when he had
made that image in mind of his son that image was gretely worshipped of his
servants / It was refute and socoure to mysdoers as he had y ordeygned

And while he sought help and remedy of sorrow / he found seed and
spryngyng of well more sorrow / for the old error in worship of mawmettes began
to sprede Netheles the same manner doing was. not ordained and comfermed of al

book called Philosophus says: that Poets by cause of wynnyng and of favor
peynted reasons science and might that were granted to the use of living in
many manner shappes: and yaf to eueryche a propre name And so connyng of tillyng

Augustinus de ciuitate dei libro secundo capitulo vndecimo The poet with his
lyppe speaks of three manner of gods: For sum they clepe gods as mars and
Jupiter / Sum half gods as hercules and Romulus: And sum virtuous men
that men trowed that had somewhat of godhed as hector and achilles Of mametrye

Frigius dares in his book of the battle of Troy seyth that Jason that wan the

and petrus damianus a co^nyng man of letture confermed the manner doing by

that fendes may naught do but at gods suffrance and so they may make no

they change likeness and shap of things that God made and wrought^ So that
the fantasye of a man that changes in thought and in metyng of dreams by
diverse manner things and takes the likeness of bodies with a wonder swyftnesse
though no body be presente^ when the wits of the body be absente and let of
their worchynge and the image and lykenes that is in thought and in fantasy is
as it were emprynted in the likeness of so^me be and semyth to other me^nes

seems in metyng of sweuenes and so him may seem that he bears berthens and
charges But and they be very berthens and charges fendes bear hem that men
may be so begyled For one presta^cius told that such an hap befelle his

awoke and told as it were a sweuen how him was bifalle for him thought that he
was made an horse and bare corn among other beestes to knights that were at

THe fyth age of the world began from the transmygracion of the Jews and the
brennyng of the temple that was done the^ xj / year of sedechias / Therefore who
that wol reken seventy year of the prysonnyng and bondage of Jews from this.xj
/ year of sedechias as Eusebius did by auctoryte of Zacharye. the prophet /
than he shall end this seventy year in the second year of darius Itapsis sonne^

unto the first year of cirus but redyly to acompt the seue^ty years that enden
in the third year or in the last year of cirus be proprely the years of
taking and bondage of the Jews / but the years that end in the second year of
darius be proprely the years of the full transmygracion and of the destroyng of
the temple / Petrus 154 / The men of Judah drad the face of nabugodonosor for
the death of godolyas whom they had slain. therefore they went with their
children and cataill in to egypt and Ieremias went with them against her will
And for he prophesied always that they that went in to egypt at that time should
be destroyed / therefore they ston^d him to death the fourth year of that
transmygracio^^ Netheles the egypcians worshipped the prophet and buried him
besides the buriels of kings / for he had with his prayers driven away the
eddres and cocadrilles from the egypcia^s / Treuisa A cocadrille is a four

Than it follows in the story / Also the prophet yaf a toke^ to the kings of
egypt that her manmettes sholde^ fall when a maid had born a child^ therefore
the priests of misbileuid me^ ordained hem an image of a maid with a child
and worshipped it in a piuey place within the te^ple^ Also this Ieremias knew
that the temple should be destroyed and took the shrine of the testament with all
that was therein and made it through his prayers be swalowed in to a stone bitwen
ye hills of wilderness where moises and aaron be^ buried / and he marked the
stone with his finger and wrote therein gods own name / and from that time
hidderto and to the worlds end the stone is hid with a cloud / so that the

Afterward the people of Rome might not ne would not suffer the stryf of the

AFter this Alysaunder took the clothyng and the dyademe of the king of pers

not seem that all one he trespassed in that doyng^ he. bade his friends also
use long clothes of gold / Also he deled the times and stempnes of the nyghtes
among company of strompettes and put to noble mete and drynk lest fasting
destroyed lechery he highted his meels with diverse plays and had no mind
that great Richesse is lost by such manner doing and not get ne won.
Therefore men began to have indygnacion of him for he forsook the usage and the
manners of his forfaders / He let knights wedde women that were taken
prysonners / for they should take and suffer more easily the trauaylle of
chiualrye and think the less of their own country / he held that macedonia
should be strenger / if young knights come after old faders and used deeds of
knights with in the bounds of their own birth / And should be the more stal
worth afterward if they pyght her tents as it were in her own cradels / Also
Alysaunder ordained fedyng for children hers^ and armor for the yonglynges
hire and wages for the faders / and if the faders dyed the sons should receive
the wages of the faders and so her childhode should be as it were knyghthode and
cheualrye / than when the parties were chased Alysaunder way cruel among his
own men and hated most if any of his men with said him of any manner dede^
There he slough one permenion an old man that was next the king and permenyons
son phil^ta also / for they told him that he ouertourned and destroyed the
manners and the vsages of the countray and of his fornfaders Than Alysaunder
drad lest tidings of that deed should come in to macedonia. he made it as he
would send sum of his friends in to macedonia to. tell there tidings of the
vyctoryes and of the great deeds that he had do and bade that men should write
lettres all that would tidings send and made the messagers bring him the
lettres pryuately for he would know al men's will that would lettres send
owther for he would reward hem that were true owther send hem that were falls
in to far lands Pol^ Alysander was often dronken and than he was cruel among
his meyny / And so it happed on a time that he yaue dome against one the

for me used to appele from the less to the more. the tyrant that was wine
drunk turned in to more wodenesse and said from whom and to whom appellyst
thou / I appelle said he from Alysaunder the drunk to alysaunder the sober /

cato were he never so well l^t^red and so glorious / First for his friends
counseylled him the c^ntrary that were wise men and kind Also for that he
counseylled his son not for to do so but he counseylled him rather to live
under Julius caesar the victor. The third skyle for he slough him self by envy
for he would not suffer and see Julius wealth and his joy / And so it seems
that cato slough him self by vnstydfastnesse and folly / for he would not suffer
anguyssh and disease and not by honneste to void and escape foul manner of
doing Here take heed of many catons that were in Rome among the Romans / one
was cato questor / he brought ennius the poet out of tarent in to Rome

seventh day before Apryl when Criste suffryd death that holds and approves
loore of greet men Auctoryte of holy Church. and certain essaye of

the heart of the earth three days and three nyghtes / but not all fulle and
hoole three days and three nyghtes / For Criste lay in his graue^ but forty

to acounte the first day of four and twenty hours with the night that was to
the ffrydaye that criste deyd ynne. And crist lay in his grave holy all the
second day and in the first party of the thyrdde day And so saint austyn
says that yche of these three days had his night So that the night passed a

the end of xlij year of augustus the saturday at night that than folowyd the
day the xiiij year of age of mary ye vij / day before ianiuere crist was born at
bethlem. and than the viij day after he was circumcided in a sunday / the xij
day after the birth was the epyphany and fell in a friday the vj day of
Ianiuere than come the kings and worshipped crist and after that xl days
after the natiuite in a thursday the second day of feuerere crist was presented
in the temple inmind thereof is candelmasse day / After that by warnyng of the
Angel that warned joseph in his sleep he fled in to egypt with his mother And
Joseph was there six year unto herodes death Herodes cast for to slay all the
children by cause of crist. for he would be seker of him among other When
Criste entered in to egypt the mawmettes overthrew and fille down R Than to the
seventh day before apryll that was the friday in the which criste was conceived
to the night of the sunday in which crist was borne / were to honderd days
three score and sixtene the which nombre of days makes nine months of the moon and six days / So that every month be of thyrtty days as men acounted
in old time These nine months and six days ben assigned to women that goth
with child as yet were ten months though not all women goo with child to
this sixte day / As yet was sothe of saint Johan baptiste and of saint mary
that had one day less than crist in the mother womb R And for of the coming
to gyders of years of criste and of kings the begynnyngys and the ends ben
uncertain and full often fall great doutes in acountynge of years. And also of
the years of our lord / what year he was baptysed^ what year crist suffered death
Auctors speken dyuersly / therefore for to put away al manner doubt take heed by
bedas loore libro de temporibus. that the Romans before numa pompilius time
bygan the year in march as the hebrews don But from numaes time that put two
months to the year Ianyuere and feueryere / the Romans bygynne the year in
the beginning of Ianyuere / Holy church in the west lands folowith them in
the common calendar and in the year that is most used

But the greeks that brought up olimpias begynnen the year from the shortest
day of the winter But the hebrews beginne^ the year in march when the day and
the night ben like long / for that time the world was first made But the
Egypcians bygynnen the year from heruest Men of the eeste lands as Arabes and
caldeis begynnen the year after the gadrynge of wine and corn and of fruit
when the tethenges ben brought in to the temple in the beginning of october
when the day and the night ben y like long in heruest time as yet seems
^zechielis vision theer he speaks of the fourth month and the fyfthe day of
the month among them october was the first month and Ianyuere the fourth R
/ It is said that diverse men have diverse beginning of years and yet over
that comes diverse years by some hap that there falls and begins in
diverse times of the year that we most use as yet is of years of kingis that
begynnen to regne in diverse time of the year that we most use yet we acounte
the years of our lord in twey manner wise / other by his birth or by his age.
And also while crist was born in the end of the year that we use by the son
/ he had of the first year of his birth but seven days from the natyuy^e to
years day But the first year of his age of twelve months by his course from
the five and twenty day of december to the same day twelve months is
fulfilled the second year of his birth And so in the first year of his age he
fulfilled almost two year of his birth / And the second year of his birth is
the first year of his age therefore yet is that the years of the birth of our
lord by the course of the son be nygh four and thyrtty year and an half and
the years of his age nyghe three and thyrtty year and an half and he was
baptized in his / xxx / year of age and the xxxj year of his birth for to
acounte that year with the last party that was almoost an half year It is
sothe that criste prechid four year and specially three year and an half by the
Gospel of saint Iohan^ And so crist suffered death in the xxxiij year of his age
and in the xxxiiij year of his birth R Than in the two and forty year of
Octauianus in the which year crist was born bygan in march and ends in
march Therefore that year bygan in the thirdde year of Olimpias nine score and
fourten and ends in the fourth year of the same olimpias in the month of
march And for the wisdom of our lord ordained his birth there the greeks
begynnen the year with the olimpias / therefore the years of our lord bygynne
and end with ^he Olimpias But the years of kings and of Emperors begin and
end certainly but right selde^ therefore it is hard to acounte them with
olimpias owther with years of our lord for they begin often in one year of
the olimpias and end in another Than the kingdom of Augustus is acounted in
march And crist begins his first year of his birth in the end of augustus
two and forty year / than the xlij year of Augustus bigynneth in the first
year of the age of criste and the xliij year of Augustus in the second of the
age of crist and is xliiij year in the thyrdde and so forth

Aristobolus For there were three herodes of great name for her evil dedes^ take heed that the first was herodes Ascolemta / And had that name of the cite
Ascalon for he fulbylte that cite. And in this herodes time Criste was born and
the children were s^ayne The second hete herodes Antipas and was the first
herodes son In his time Johan baptist was byheded and Crist suffered death The

FRom the fyften year of tiberius to the first year of Adam for to acoun^e
bakwarde were five thousand years so seith eusebeus and so many years make lx*
year of grace and so by his tale the sixtene year of tiberius was the beginning
of the year of grace sixty and one / But the seventy say that from Adam to the
xv year of tiberius ^ere five thousand two honderd and xxv Bu^ the hebrews
tellen five thousand. therefore sum men wol mean that that year began the
sixth thousand for than the circumsicion seesid and cristendom bygan Other
begin from thincarnacion of crist Also that year Johan began to preche and
baptize and baptized crist the sixth day of Ianeuere the day of the showing of
our lord / And that day twelve month he turned water in to win Petrus Therefore
in old books that day is called the day of shewynges in the plurel nombre for
that day fill many diverse shewynges and had diverse names for in the same day
in diverse years were do three great shewinges the first hete epyphania and is a
name made of epy that is a booue and phanos that is showing a^^t were a
showing made from a booue as it were a ste^^^ the second hete theophania / and
that name is made of theos that is god and phanos that is showing as it were
showing made of god in baptising of crist by a douue^ The thyrdde hete
bethphania and that is made of bethe that is house and of phanos that is
showing as it were a showing made in an hows by tornyng of water in to wine R
And some men meene that that day two year was the miracle do of the five loves
and two fysshes and heete fagephania that name is made of fagyn that is ete and
phanos that is showing / for that miracle was do in fedynge of men Also that
second year as Luke and Ierom says Crist bygan the thyrtty year of age so
seyth the gospel Jesus was beginning as it were xxx year Crisostimus marianus /
And common meenyng of holy church. and Eusebius in historia ecclesiastica /
Meneth that than crist byga^ his one and thyrtty year hool and as much as was
from the natiuite to the passion time / thanne crist* the monday next after
his baptym was ladde in to wilderness by the spyryt / and bygan his fasting
and fastyd forty days And ended his fasting in a frydaye the xv day of
feuyre / that day he ouercam the devil that temptid him / in the which day the
devil had overcome and supplanted Adam the first man Than the next ester
after as true loore tells he drofe and chacid sellers and buyers out of the
temple / In the same year after he called and chees his disciples Andreu Petyr
Philip Nathanael The next year after he turned water in to wine in a xij day
And after that beda tellyth Crist and his disciples baptized in the Iewery /

heled in a saturday one that had the palsy eight and thyrtty year And after
that in the same year he went up in the hill there he chees the twelve Apostles
and sent them for to preche And so it seems that three gospelers that tell
the doing of crist / after the prisonyng of johan baptist leueth untold almoost
the doing of one year before the prisonyng / but johan the evangelist speaks
less of other things and tells the doing and deeds how ihus turned water in
to wine nichodemus come to ihs by night and how ihs drofe out the sellers of
the temple / after that at third ester John was biheded wha^ he had be
prysoned al a yere^ at iiij Eester crist suffered death / Petrus C / 11. The xj
book ecclesiast^^e history tellith that Johan was byheded at macheronta a
castle of Arabia / His body was buried at sebasten that is Samaria His heed
was buried at Jerusalem bysides Herodes howse^ for dreede leest he would arise
from deth^ to live if the head were buried with the body

Mysbyleuyd men divided his bones and threw them abroad in Iulianus Apostatas
time for they had envy to the myraclis that he wrought / And they gadryd
again the bones to gyders and and burnt them and wynnewyd the asks away with
the wind / that doing sum men now acounteth as it were the second
martyrdom of the deed man / they wist not what they did In the feast of his
natyuyte while they gadryd his bones to geders and burnt them as ferforth as
they might And while mysbyleuyd men gadryd Iohans boones men of Jerusalem were
meddled among them and took with them a greet dele of the bones among the

saint tecla brought that fyngre unto Alps Alps ben hye hills in Lombardy

sent to Athanasius bishop of Alysaundre In marcianus the princes time Johan
warnyd two monkys of his heed and told where it lay The monks were of the

wete the tale and the nombre of Jews that were at Jerusalem / for he despised
that temple with all his myghte^ and cestius the styward as he had learned of
bisshopes wrote to nero that there were found at Jerusalem in one holy day
twenty C / M. and seven honderde thousand without them that were pollute and

to forsake his lot / And thereby he e escaped peril at home and so he was
brought to vaspasianus Josephus libro 6 At last vaspasianus was called to be
Emperor and his sone titus was left at the siege of Jerusalem. And went in a
day with six honderde horsemen without haberions about for to see the cite

After (...) the synodus nycena had yeuen that pryuelege to the Bishop of
Rome that he should be above al other bisshops as them perour is above all

the patriarch was turned to constantinople as it were to the second Rome The
other se^s of patriarchs were chaunged^ the sea of antiochia to Jerusalem And

it should follow that they should lose the holy places Eusebius in historia
ecclesiastica libro decimo Constantynus did to god almyghtyes p^^estes great
reverence and worshipe Therefore when the bisshops were assembled in the Synod
of nycena by commandment of constantyn and by counseylle of siluestre for to
declare the faith of holy church Many of hem playned each upon other and put
up bylles to the emperor for he should do hem right The Emperor saw that holy
church for the which the bisshoppis were comen might lightly be l^tte by
such playntes and strif Therefore he set^e hem a certain day after the sinode
and counseil for to make an end of al thylke causes and playntes^ But he
burnt privily all thylke bylles of hem that made playntes and said God has
ordained you as it were gods to be your own I^gges. Therefore I hold that it
were vnsittynge that we that should be demed of you should deem you that been
gods But in holy church among you self trete ye of your errors and
defawtes so that no thing be known outward that is v^semely to your holiness
And if ye will needs strive Abide ye the dome of god almighty as the psalm
says / God stood in the sinagoga of gods Certainly if I saw^ any of your

Gaufredus celleth if he had made the king of france subgette. if he had
slain lucius in ytaly procuratour of thempyre^ and of the comynte-why left
all the writers of stories of Romans frenssh men and saxons-and speak not of

is that the manner of every nation is to over preyse sum one of the same

About that time lived machamet the false prophet duke and leder of Sarasyns
and of turkes^ his story is brought in this manner / But steven of caunterbury
and girald of cambria helpen much in this matter. Sometime while thempyre of
rome was in great might and strength. Crystendome was nyghe wydder and more
than thempyre of Rome was in great might and is no wonder. for crystendom was
so encreced that it contained Europa and many prouynces of Asia and well nygh
al affryca within his merkes and bounds. At last by d^scorde and stryf of
christian men between hem self / It was do that that Agarenes wexe strong / the
agarenes have three names and ben called agarenes Ismalytes and saracenes / of
her empire prophesied methodius the martyr and said that christian relygyon
should ^aue little without thendes of Europa Also after that error of Sarasyns
had infecte al affryca. hit defouled also a great dele of spain And but gods
grace and mercy had helped / it would have infecte and shente al ffraunce with
spain Then after the great gregoryes time the empire of Rome that stretched
sometime from th^ccean of brytayne unto the ends of perse was so destroyed
with tyrauntrye and civil bataylles that it was not of power to defend it
self against enemies / then the cruel paynym host of perce bygan to occupye
many prouynces of the lordship of Rome and of men of christian feyth in the est
lands / Then as the great fly follows the trace of the malshawe. so after
other woo comes pestylence of the ismalytes that was more grievous and
destroyed neygh the christian men that were left in the eest lands by ledyng of
the prince machomete in heraclius themperours time Then in the fyfth bonefas
time while heraclius regnede about the year of our lord six honderd and
twenty. machamete the false prophet and witch begyled the ysmalytes and
agarenes in this manner. a famous clerk was at court of Rome and might not
speed at his will and p^ssed the sea and plesed many men and had hem at his
assente / Among the which he promised machomete that he would make him prince
of h^s people if he would do as he said / then this clerk fed up a douue
and made him fe^che his mete in machome^s ere. for there he put the co^ne that
the douue should ete / And of that same the douue would often feed him self
then in a day this clerk gadred the people to geder and promised them that he
would make him their prince whom the holy ghost would show in lykenes of a douue
and let anon his douue flee. And the douue as he was wont sat upon
machomets sholderes and put his bylle in machamets ere / And therefore machamet
was chosen prince and leder of the people. This that is said is the common tale^
but what now follows is more allowed and approu^d^ A monk that hete sergius
was put out of the company of monks that he was among for he was fall in to
nestorius errour^ he came in to Arabia and put him self to machomete and
informed him though it be radde that this sergius was archedeken of Antiochia
or patriarch of Ierusalem^ then machomet faderles and moderles was in his
emes keeping in his childhode and worshipped maumetrye somewhat of time with his
country men of Arabia / and he yaue him self specially to worshipe venus / And
therefore it is that yet the saraseyns holden the friday holy as the Jews don
the saturday and we the sunday After that machomet come to age and was sharp
of wit and went. in to many lands by cause of marchandyse and was often in
company of Jews and of christian men and learned the maners^ vsages and custommes
of both the laws of christian men and of the jews / And couth both wytchecraft
and nygromancy / and was a wonder fell man and fer casting and had noble
faconde and fair speech / th^nne he come to the lady of the prouynte Corozonia
/ the lady hete cadygan / And with sum spyces that he brought with
wytchecraft and fair words he made the lady so mad and so nyse that she
worshipped him as the grettest prophet of god almyghty^ or as it were messiah
tha^t the Jews abyden / and she desired him to husbond / It is the usage of
that prouynce to be ruled also by women Then he wedded the wedewe that was
queen and so he was made lord of that prouynce / then he drew to him the
Arabes and occupied the est empire unto Allexandria against heraclius the emperor
/ Then he took the manner of speaking of true prophets as though god had
spoke in him and spoke in this manner in his books that he made / Our lord
spak to his prophet and said. for so the books that he feyned gylefully
should be byleuyd as though they were made by auctoryte of god almighty

Then not only his own men but also men of fer lands fylle to him and bowed
to him in every side. he had great liking to have gretter lordship And as it
were for to bring men in to good manner living and as it were by commandment
of god almighty he assoylled the nations that dwelled nygh him and did by
craft and by gyle that he might not do by deeds of Arms Therefore when Egypt
Libia arabia and Siria were subgett by cause he would seem the more holy^ he
drew the people that were subget to his false law and made hem to forsake the
vsages and laws of their fornfaders / And he forbadde the paynems maumetrye
and he granted circumsicion to the Jews as they had vsed^ and feyned of his
own self sum new laws and alleged wytnes of either testament The sarasyns
call that law his law yet unto this time And he bade the sarasyns circumcide
hem as the Jews don / and forbad hem that would follow him etyng of swynyssh
flessh / And machomet would tell the cause why he forbade them the swynyssh
flessh and said that swyne come of camels dirt after noes flood and therefore
clean men should eschew it as mete that is unclean. And as it were to acorde
with Christian men in the manner of crystnynge / he ordained often wasshing of
lymmes in water as it were for clensing of sins And for to bring the people
that was so begyled the faster to snarle / what he knew that was most
playsanut to man's lykyng he ordained that for law / And so he ordained that
a man should have as many wives and concubynes as he might sustene with his
catel / Also that a man might have wives of his oun kynrede unto the nombre of
four. and that a man might four sithes forsake his wife and take her again /
and also that he might have as many concubynes as he would of wymmen / that
were bought prisoners^ And also that he might selle hem but if he had brought
any of hem with child- And ordained hem to use sobrenes of mete and drynk /
and forbad him drynkyng of wyn / but it were in certain solemn days in the
yere^ And for he would somdele varye fro the Jews that worshipped god westward
/ and fro christian men that worshipped god eestward / he taught his people to
worshipe god south ward with often knelynges^ for in the south is plente of
light / he ordained hem to worshipe the goddess venus and to hold the day
thereof solemn and ^ holy. that is friday / he bade worshipe one almighty god
creator and maker of all things and said that moses and Johan were
Prophets and that Christ was gretter and grettest of all prophets and that he
was born of the maid marie by virtue of god without man's seed as he says
in his book that hete Alkaron. netheles he meddled sum falls sawes with soth
sawes / And said that criste was afterward born up to heaven and not slayne^
For he says that Judas the traitor sought christ in a den and changed in
to the lykenes of christ / and so he was take and nailed to the cross instead
of crist Also he bade that the men of his law should every year if they might
goo in to gods hows that is in matha for to bydde her bedes / and when they
were comen thither they should ben clothed in one manner clothing / and they
should throw out stones through hooles of the walles^ as it were for to stone
the devil / and said that Abraham made that hows for his childeren ismaelytes
/ for they should there bydde their bedes / Also by machomets law ^e that were
take with a woman in spousebreche should be stoned to death / and if he deed
fornicacion with a sengle woman he should have four score lasshes / A thief the
first time and the second time should be beete^ and the thyrdde time he
should lose his hondes / and the fou^th time he should lose his feet / And he
seyth that who that holds all this and other heestes of his law god almighty
promised him paradys / the orcharde of plesyre and liking. there is no
distemprure ne pain that is any manner of gryef but al manner of welthe and of
liking / there is lykyng mete for to ete and clothes to were and maidens
tembrace fair shall serve them there / the Angels ben so great and so huge
that from that one eye to that other is the space of a day iourneye^ and to
them that hold ne keep not his lawe^ he promyseth hem fire and pain of hell
without end / And also in his book that is called alcoranum he prayseth all
the faders of tholde testament. and specially moses and Johan the baptist^
Christ and machomete Also there he preyseth all that that believe in god and do
rightwysenes / but it is not there red what is the right feyth. ne what men ben
of right believe. ne what men ben of mysbyleue Also there is wreton that five
books come fro heaven for the informacion of mankind / the sawter / moses
books / the books of prophets and machometes Alcaron / In that Alcoron it is
wreton that god almighty would rule and led mankind in to the way of
sauacion^ and after abraham he yaue to the childeren of Israel a law by which
law they should know God and worshipe him / But for they told not of his law
god gaf the gospel to other men / And also they mysused the law / And the
Arabes that came of Abraham by ysmael were mo men and gretter people than the
Jews that come of Abraham. by Isaac. And the Arabes that were left were left
without law / therefore out of the consistorye of gods rightwysenes come a
decree that a prophet of her own people should be sent to the ysmaelytes with
a law / the which prophet and law the sarasyns should follow as the Jews
followed moyses^ and christian men Christ And therefore the Sarasyns hold them self
better than Jews and Christian men for they hold holy their law / And Jews
and Christian men often trespacen against their own law / For to bring this
about / machomet norysshed and fed a fair camel in a pryue place / so that
the camel had no mete but of his own hand / And machomet waited his time and
henge that cursed book Alcaron about the camels neck. in that book were the
foresaid laws wreton And machomet let go the foresaid camel in to the feldes
with the book about to fore day light / Then the camel as it was no wonder
bygan to lepe and to sterte and made great joy for he was at large and fled
every man and would come nyghe no man's honde-Speche of this wonder sprange
once in feldes and towns and the people gadred thither out of every side. But
when machomete was comen the beast saw him a fer that yaf him alweye mete and
ran to him anon right^ and bowed to him and lykked his hondes as he was taught.
then the people cried and said in this deed is showed the holiness of gods
prophet / And they prayde him that he would undo the book with his holy
hondes / and when the book was opened / Lo says machomet Here is your law not
wreton with man's ynke but with angels hondes and sent fro heaven for to be
bolden ever without any. end In the book ye ben taught how ye shall worshipe
god / and how greet mede ye shall hope to resseyue of him for keeping of this
law / The day that this was don in is every year made solemn and holy /
and is called the fest of the camel / and they fast a month to fore that
feste in this manner Every day of that month fro the first light of the day
when men may know bitwene white and blac unto the going dou^ of the son /
they fast and ete not ne drink / ne delen with their wives / but ben alwey in
her prayers but after the going down of the son unto the dawynge again
they ete drink and lie by their wives / but seek men and feeble ben not holden
so for to fast. This machomet displesyd often his wife for he had the falling
evil / and in that evil he fill often to the ground / But he plesyd her and
other that had r^sseyued his law in this manner and said that he fill to ground
for the words of seint mychel tharchangel that spak with him so often For a
flesshliman he said may not suffer an angels words but if he fall / he hated
wyn dronkenes as Rybawdrye / and harlottrye / by cause of heete of the country
he would have it spared^ But in a night he was drunk and fylle down in the
streete^ And there swyn ete him which he reputed unclean beestes Therefore they
that hold his laws spare wyn and swynes flessh In the first point it seems
that they follow the Jews / In the second point it seems that they follow
the philosophye of their master Also after the death of machomet that cursed
sect encreced so fast that it caused so mighty men of perce to draw to that
cursed law of the Arabes Also that sect has infecte unto this time al
africa and a great dele of spain as gernarde. And tharchebisshop turpinus
tellith that machometes image of latone that he made with his own hondes /
stondeth in the Sea stronde and has his face toward the south. In that image
machometus by wytchecraft closed a legyon of fendes. A cryste^ man that comes
there is lightly perysshed. But a sarasyn goth alwey hoole and sound / A bird
that comes there dies anon The image holds a mace in his right hand And
that mace shall first fallen when a king shall be born in gallia that shall
renew al spain with christian laws / And when the mace shall fall / then the
sarasyns shall flee a^nd leave their tresorye / The famous norye of this cursed
sect Saladinus duc of turks the strong hamer of christian men about the year
of our lord enleuen honderd four score and ten he herd that christian men used
many messes of mete at one mele and said that christian men were not worthy to
have the holy land Also he was fell and slyhe for to praise his own secte^
and to blame and despise our law. and that is known by this ensample On a
time were two white monks brought to fore him that thieves of turks had take.
And he knew by her strange clothing that they were philosophres and christian
men. And he axyd by one that knew both langages of hem what they were and of
what condition and profession and they said that they were monks and had don
their profession to saint Benettes rule. Then he axyd besyly many points of
that rule. And specially among other. he axed if they should by her rule ete
flessh or drink wyn / Then answered they and said that they had at al time
somewhat of wyn for to drink. but flessh should they none ete / but it were for
sekenes or great need / then the tyrant badde that they should have more
large keeping and have two young fair wymmen to serve hem / and badde that they
should ete flessh and drink water / And so they ete flesh and drunk water^
and took ensample by saint Job / and made covenant with their eyes that they

procured fredome and pryueleges in many articles to that Cite / he suffered
noman to take degree or order / to what manner dygnyte of holy church / but he
were well lettred / he turned the best laws in to englyssh tongue / At last
he auentred him to translate the sawter in to English / But he translated
uneath the first part before his death / when he come to age and would stable
his heart and his thought in gods heestes / the lechery of his flessh greuyd
him and let him of^e time / therefore to put awey temptacion of flesshely

at cokkes crowyng and prayed god that he would chastyse his flessh with such a
sickness that he should not be unprofitable to worldly deeds / and that he
might the more freely serve god almighty / At gods ordenaunce he had many year

parties of the kings ministres were at home for to ordeyne for homly things /
In the thyrdde month every party and company of his howsholde should serve

with fyss^yng^ / On a time while his felawes were a fysshynge / and he
comforted his uncertain and vnstidfast life with comfort of ^okes / A pilgrim
came to him and axed alms in gods name / The king lift up his hands to
heaven and said I thank god that vysyted his poor man this day / by a pore man
That he wol vouchsauf this day to axe of me that he has yeuen me / and restore
again with encreace / that he axeth of me / Anon the king called his
servant that had but one looff and little what of wine / and had him give
the half thereof / to the poor man / The poor man thanked him and vanysshed
suddenly away / and no step was seen of his going in the nesshe more / And
also all that was yeuen him / was founden hoole an^ sound / And they that
were a ffysshynge brought great plentye of ffysshe / Then when the king
was slepynge / one appeared to him in a Bisshops wede / and charged him that he
should love god / and keep ryghtwysenesse and be merciable against pore men / and

not of great name / but it was ruled by the kings Forsters of France /

Also this Charles put fro him his wife / for it seemed that she was to pryue
with the bishop of Versell / Therefore the king of France knowleched openly
that he himself had never leyne by her flessbely / And she was glad of her
maydenhode / and and went in to an Abbaye when she was forsaken / At last
/ the tenthe year of his kingdom / this Charles went out of France in to

of her daughter edyth / it is said that while she was a menchon at wylton /
she used often gayer clothes than her profession axed / and she was therefore
blamed of saint ethelwold and she answered nowther vncouenably ne full cu^tously

The westsaxons saw that / and delyuerd him pledgys / and did the same /
King egelredus dyed at london eight days before maij / and was buried in

forsook his issue / and progenye / and knouleched at Southampton / that
Canutus should be her king / and he swear that he would be to hem a true lord
both to god ward and to the world / But the londoners and many of the lords
made her king edmund yrensyde / And anon he made the westsaxons subgette /
sum for dread / and sum by her own good will / In the mean time canutus
bysieged london / but be was put of there / and he fought with edmonde in

in the prouynce of wiccyes / that is the prouynce of wircetre / there they
fought so strongly that either hooste / withdrough hem from other for / pure

fewte to king Edmond / yet the fyfthe time when the danes robbed and reued and
took prays / edmond overcome hem at okeford in kente and chaced hem unto the
yland of shepeheye / Then while Edward turned in to westsaxon Canutus took
prays in mercia / therefore edmond met him upon asshdon / there was strong
fighting on either side / Duc Edrycus saw the danes downward / and fled as
a traitor should / so that many noble men were slain on edmondes side / there
was slain the bishop of lincoln and the Abbot of Ramesey that were come to
pray for the knight / Than by counseyll of Edrycus pees was made between the

favor of fortune / But what shall be the fruit of this contynuel stryf / but
when the knights he slain on either side / than the dukes compellyd by need

indygnacion to take and have part with other / owther to be under / than late
hem fight alone / that wol be lords alone / lest if al men fight al men be
slain / and so should leave no knights under the heestes of dukes / nowther to
defend the king ayenste strange alyenes / Then the dukes with her hoostes
come to geder at yland of olneye besides Gloucestre / there all men cried
owther they should acorde / or fight a^ one / Than both the kings come to
geder in middel of the yla^d and the people stood / and beheld on either side /
The kings fought first on horse / and than on foot / There canutus espied that
Edmonde might not be overcome and acorded to be partyner of the kingdom / and
they threw awey her wepens and kyssed either other Then al men wondered / and
were ioyeful thereof / when this was done the traitor Edrycus desired to make
him self leeue Canutus / And at oxenford when edmonde was at pryny to cleanse
his womb / as need of kind axeth / Edrycus was pryuely hid under the place
/ and stykked the king upward / that sat on the sege / And than edrycus
went to canutus and said hayle king aloone / When the king knew how it
stood / he said to Edrycus / For thou trowest to plese me with such manner
service / and have slain the best body of the world / I shall arerethyn head
above all the lords of england / Than anon Edrycus heed was smyten of / and
set above the highest yate of london /

R But sum stories say / and specially marianus / that Edmond dyed not in
that manner / But after that the acorde was made / and stabled between the
kings / and the kyngd^me deled between hem tweyn / Edmond dyed at london
about saint andrews tide / and was buried at glaste^bury with his grauntsir
edgar / That seems soth / For comune cronykes tellen / that after edmundus

the offryng of christian men The remenaunt was taken awey owther occupied by

naked swerdes outher robbed in the high streets and weyes / therefore all
prouynces left of and took not the wey to Rome / because of thieves in the wey /
and of other thieves in saint peter's church / Gregory saw this and treated
with them first soft / and with fair speech / but when he saw that helpyd not
/ he cursyd all them that did so / and departed hem from the body of holy church / and all that were assenting to them that so did / when the pope
saw that / that halp not but it brought him self in to peril of death / he
wrote to the emperor that he should help holy church / that was in point to
fall / the emperor excused him by the war of wandalia / and prayed the pope /
that he would in his stead / and at his cost put to his hand / therefore the pope
yaue the dome / that the yren of cuttynge must be vsid and gat him armor and
horsemen on every side / that drofe awey first owther slough the thieves that
robbed the offrynges of saint peter's church / than the pope gate again the
land that he had lost long time / Then the quyrytes that were wont to
live by theft and robberye cleped the pope ablodsheder and a man sleer / And
said he was not worthy to do thoffyce of the altar / So that many of the
cardynals were assenting to that meouynge / and demed that the pope should not

called the cardynals before him / and he spak to hem in this man My brethren
me wondreth gretely / that ye deem your bishop so rabbyshly I have lived so

in the law the same is blamed and punysshed and praised for diverse intent For
the thef that sleeth in hydels. is punisshed and the knight is preysed that
sleeth his enemy in bataylle / for the first sleeth the man for couetyse / and
the second for the sauacion of the country Also the first pope Adryan was
sometime preysed / for he granted to charles the inuestiture of prelates / now
be our Bisshopes preysed for they do the contrary / and taken fro princes such
manner power / Then for sum manner causes it was resonably granted / that

couetyce of princes has shente al / In this manner may my cause be taken

netheles it fallyth to him / if he sue the innocente in peryle / to help and

/ And him to whom it befalls to worche with the sword / I prayede thryes by
messagers / and by lettres that he would come and chastyse such manner thieves /
and he wrote again that he was occupied in the war of wandalia / and prayed
that I would at my travail / and his cost dystourbe the thieves / what should I
do than when he had put his office upon me / and I saw the sleynge of
cyteseyns / the damage of pylgryms and the meschyef of the pope and of the
Cardynals / And he that spares the thief / yeueth cause and occasion why the
ryghtful man and innocent is slain / but one caas ye sey that it falls not
for a priest to shede man's blood / I grant but if he defowle him self that
bears down the wykl^ed man and saves the man that is innocente and ryghtful
/ and they be blessed that keep ryghtfull dome / and ryghtwysenes / Phynees and
mathathyas be praised for they stykked hem through / that trespast / but we shall
less suffer our very holy things to be defowled / than they her mysteries

without peril and shame pass by the weye with so few naked men / and
unarmed / In the mean time goodwyns knights withdrewe them sum and sum /

About this time Mananus the scot was closed in the abbay Fuldence and was
there ten year / when kynsius Archebisshop of york was deed / Aldredus bishop
of wyrcetre was archebisshop after him / and went t^ Rome with Tostius Earl of
northumberlond for to receive the palle / but he was found blame worthy in his
answer / and he was pryued of al manner worship / and as he went homeward he
was robbed of all that he had / Therefore tostius therle went ageyn to Rome and
entreated so the pope by skylles that he alleged / that the pope yaue
Aldredus the Archebisshopryche / Tostius said that nations of fer lands should
set right little by the popes cu^s / while it was so scorned of thieves that
dwelled there nygh. therefore owther aldredus should have his catayll restored /
owther it would seem that he was robbed by fraud of the pope / Also the king
of england shall here thereof and withdraw the tribute of saint peter / It is
evil do said therle that Aldredus shall goo home worshiples and be robbed of all that he had / And so Aldredus had the pall and went in to england and made
wulstan the pryour bishop of / wyrcetre / No man would gladly of Stygandus the
archebisshop of caunterbury receive the yefte of bisshopryche nowther wiliam
conqueror when he was come would receive the blessyng of him / After nycol
the second Alysaunder was pope enleuen year and was chosen by the Cardynals /
and defended him manly ayenste one Candulus tha^ the ytalyens had chosen pope /
They said that no man should be chosen pope but if he were of the paradys of
ytaly born / Herald duc of westsaxon by commandment of king Edward went in
to wales with few horsemen after crystemasse and set king gryffyns palace on
fire / at Ruthlan and his ships also / But Gryffyn fled and escaped / After
that about the Rogacion time he went about Brystow with a great naueye / and
sailed nyghe al about wales and his brother Tostius Earl of northumberland
met him with an hooste of horsemen and destroyed so the countrees of wales /
that the walsshmen delyuerd pledgys and paid trybute as they were wont / and
outlawed and put out her king gryffyn and slough him at last about the
fyfth day of August / and sent his heed to harold therle / After that king
edward granted the land of wales to Gryffyns twey brethren that swear to him
feute / Henricus libro septimo / This year harold went toward normandy to
speak with his brother wylynotus and with his broders son hacun / that were in
pledge with duc wyliam^ But he was driven with tempeste in to the prouynce of
ponntyf / The duc of that land took him / and sent him to duc wiliam / Me

daughter and that he should keep for him England when king Edward were deed /
And so he had his neuewe with him and came in to england ageyn / R / But his

agreued and wroth and went thens to herford / there Harold had arayd a feste
for the king / there Tostius to hakked his brother servants and souced her
lymmes / and sent word to the king that if he would come to his feste he should
have salt mete ynow / The northumbres herd thereof and put out her duc
Tostius and slough his servants also and they brake his tresory and made him
flee in to Flaundres / Willelmus de Regibus / But the king herd thereof and
sent harold to take wreche of the wrong that was of his brother / they alleyed
that they were freely born and freely nourysshed / and that they might not suffer
the cruelnes of dukes / Also that they had learned of her soueraynes / to
mayntene fredome owther else take the death / Also that they should lightly be
ladde by an esy duc / Then harold seemed that it were more wisdom to favor
the country / than to take heed to the syngler prouffyte of his brother / and
sent that his host should come ayene / and went to the king and procured that
malcherus should be her earl / All this grieved Tostius / and therefore he went
in to flaundres with his wife and his childer and was there unto the kings death

When harold was set up in the kingdom and thought not on the couenauntes

duc william came toward England after mychelmasse day / and landed at hastynge

led hem about his tents and pauylons and fed hem ryally and sent hem to
Harold again / than they told to harold tidings / and said that all that were

tharchebisshop / though he wythstode in that with all that he might / he ladde
him with him / as it were for to do him worship / but his mening was specially
for no treson should be done in his absence in england by auctoryte of
stygandus Among all other it is hard for to tell / how greet worship he
did to stygandus for he would arise and come against him with procession and
that with great boost and array / but all that was closed and hyd in that doing
/ come out afterward clear enough / when the popes legate come in to england /
and made a counseyll by thasse^t of the king / and stygandus was deposed and
set a down / and prayed besyly the king of his grace / the king excused him
self with fair words as he couthe well enough / and said that he might not
do ayenste the popes heste / And so he held stygandus in boondes at
wynchestre term of his life / Alfr / Herafter against winter king will^iam came

drad the cruelnes of william and took with them edgar adelyng and his mother
agath and his twey systres margret and crystia^ and sailed to malcolyn king of

with his mother and his twey systres in to his own country there he was y bore
/ But there come great tempest and drofe him in to Scotland / By occasion
thereof it was that malcolyn king of Scotland wedde edgars sister margret / and
gate on her six sons and twey doughtes / three of his sons were kings
after the fader / Edgar Alysaunder and david / Mold malcolyns daughter was
married to the first henry king of England / of him come mold themperyce / the
other daughter mary was married to eustas earl of ^oloyne / of her come mold /
that was married to king steven / Also that year king william made a strong

england and was crowned of aldredus / harald and Canutus the sons of suanus
king of denmarche come a land in the mouth of humber with two honderd ships
/ Edgar adelyng yaf him self to hem / Aldredus the archebisshop was so soory
for her coming that he deyde for sorrow the / xj / day of September / The eight
day thereafter the normans that kept castles dradde / lest the houses of the
subarbes should help the danes to fylle the dyches / and therefore they set hem
a fire / but the light aroos to hye / and burnt the cite of york / with the
mynster of saint peter / But er the fire were done came the strength of the
danes and slough by assente of the cyteseyns more than three thousand normans /
Than king wylliam was wroth and destroyde so that prouynce that for great

without tylyer and wonyer / out take only saint Ioones land of beuley. for there
fill a wreche upon one of the kings knights for his horse neck was to broke
and his face turned bacword / Also that time was brent saint bedas abbay that
was in girmu^ upon the brynk of the river wyre / That year malcolyn destroyed
so northu^berlond that he slew all the old me^ and feeble / and made the strong
boonde for reverence / so that uneath any was hows in scotland without an
english boonde man other woman / king william by counsayll of some me^ made
search all the abbayes of england and took all the money in to his own tresour
/ W / d / p / li / 1 / Sone there after in the vtas of ester was made a
counseyll at wynchestre by ass^nt of the second pope alysander / there were twey
cardynals present / In that counseyll stygandus tharchebisshop was degraded for
three skylles / first by cause he had holden wrongfully the bisshopriche of
wynchestre and the Archebisshopriche of Caunterbury while Robert the
Archebisshoppe was a live / and used the pal that was there left without leave
of the court of Rome / For he had received the pal of pope benette that was
acursyd of the church of Rome / And though stygandus sought besyly fre^dshippe
of the king the king excused him self swetely as he well couthe by the popes
commandment and cast stygandus in to bonds at wynchestre to his lives end
/ and yaue him every day a little what of enchetes / to live by / Stygandus was
kyndely so hard that he would take right naught of his own / and swore by at
halowen that he had not a penny / but that oath was preued untrue by a little
key that henge about his neck / when he was deed / For by that keye was
found great riches in many places under earth / Also in that counseyll were
set down many bisshops and abbotes / namely by procuring of king wylliam
for he would bring in normans in their stead / Sum men trowyd that he did so
for he would be the more seker of the kingdom / Also in that counseyl saint
wulstan bishop of wyrcetre axyd besyly sum possessions of his bisshopryche
that were with hold by Aldredus Archebisshop of york and y fall in to the
kings hondes after aldredus death / But for the church of york was dombe that
time / for the sea was void / It was demed that that cause should be stylle and
not y touched at that time / herafter at wyndsor in a whitsonday king william
yaf tharchebisshoprich of york unto thomas chanon of baiocens / Wd / p / li /

lanfrank was of the nation of ytaly and was most connyng of holy wryt and of
syngler lettrure and most ready in gouernyng of things / In our lady day the
assumpcion the king made him archebisshop of caunterbury / R / Of his thewes
and of his noble deeds it is wreton Innermo^e / about his death time / W / d / p

for to be sacred as the usage would. lanfrank axyd of him an oath and his
profession y write of his obedyence / Thomas answered and said / that he would
never do that but if he herd there for auctoryte y write / other skillful reasons
and byndyng^ by the which it were know that he should so do without any
preiudyce of his chirch / he said so more for lewdnes of wit than of rebelnes
/ and pride of heart / as he that was a new man and begyled by flateryng words
/ and knew not the custom and vsages of england And lanfrank declared and
preued resonably / that his axynge was reasonable and ryghtful / but yet thomas
would not assente but wthsayde hit and went his weye vnsacred / the king herd
thereof and was wroth and trowyd that lanfrank would have great things
wrongfully / and he trusted more in his conning / than in good feyth and
reason / But he answered thereto in presence of the king / and esed the kyngys
heart / therefore by commandment of the king / thomas was compellyd for to come
again / and came again and wrote his profession of obedyence and rad it / In
that profession he byhete without any condition that he should be obedyente in all that longs to the worship of god and Christian feyth / and so he was sacred

of all the bisshops of england that were sacred of other men before hond

scyences / specially he conth skylle in aba^^ that is a table to make by
diverse fygures and shappes / ^e knew the course of the moon and of the other
sterres and planetes That time Marianus Scott and monk was closed at magounce
in Almayne / In his long solytarye being / he serched cronykes and storyees /
and was waar first other alone of denis exyguus dyscord against the sothnesse of
the gospel in acountyng of cycles and of years / And marianus acounted all the
years from the beginning of the world and put two and twenty year that lakked
of the foresaid cycles and years and made a great book of Cronykes the which
book this robert defloured solempnly and take out the best / so that it
seems that that defloracion is now more worthy than all the great volume and
long / Wyllelmus de pon / tificibus / libro primo / Also this lanfrank
archebisshop of Caunterbury / and thomas Archebisshop of york went to Rome y
fere for to have the pal / But lanfrank received the palles / one of Worship /
and anthoer of love / for lanfrank had such grace to pope Alexander / that
both his felawes that come with him to Rome thomas of york / and Remigyus of
dorchestre that were right fully y pryued of her croyses and rings / he
restored hem to their office again / For the first was a priests son / And
while the second was monk of ffyscam / he halpe duk wyllyam in many things /
to his wendyng to England / So that the duc byhete him by covenant a
Bisshopryche if he had the vyctorye and that was preued upon him before the
pope / and therefore he was set a down / in the presence of the pope / Thomas
of york meoued a cause of the challenge of the prymate of Dorobernia that is
caunterbury / and of subjection that should long to him of three Bisshopryches
/ of Lyncolne / of wyrcetre and of lychefeld

And said that the Sees of Caunterbury and of york were far atwene / and
that another of him by Gregoryes constitucion should be subgette to other / but
that the one of he^ is more worthy than the other / for he is of elder^ time /
Then lamfrank declared skylfully that that constitucion of gregory makes no
mention of Caunterbury / but of york and of london Than the pope demede that
that cause should be termyned to fore the king and the Bisshops in england /
And though lanfrank held thomas y bound by the professyon that thomas had
made before him byforehonde / yet him was lever trauayll for his successors
than let that challenge abide to him to strive therefore afterward / This year
the year of our lord a thousand three score and twelve at wyndsore before king
wylliam and the clergy that cause was treated / and there Bedas story was
shewde and thereby it was showed that from the first Austyns time / to Bedas
last time about an honderd year and forty / the Archebisshopryche of
Caunterbury had prymacye over all the land of Brytayne / and of Irlonde also
/ And also that he hadd hold cou^sayls fast by york / and cleped thereto the
bisshops of york and made bisshops and punysshed sum bisshops of york for her
trespaas / and set down many / and put hem out of the dygnyte / Herto
were rehearsed pryueleges that were granted upon this manner of doing / Against
all this thomas aleyde the pystle in the which pope Gregory demed that the
chirches of york and of london should be even peers and neither subget to other
/ Than lamfrank answered and said I am not bishop of london nowther the
question is not meoued of the church of london / Then thomas that had many
fauctours and much folk / gadred with him answered and said that Gregory had
granted to Austyn al one to have under him all the bisshops of england and
that the bisshops of london and of york should be good friends / and love well
either other / and he that were first ordained should be first worshipped / and
though Austyn had changed the Archebisshops see from london in to kente yef
gregory would that Austyns successors should be above the bisshops of york /
he would lightly have set in his epistle such manner words / I grant to
the Austyn and to thyn successors / But for he would not that it should stretche
to austyns successors / therefore he made no mention of his successors /
Lanfrank answerde herto and said / if that auctoryte was granted to Austyn
alone and not to his successors it was a simple yefte that the pope yaue
Austyn that was pryue with him / and namely while Austyn ordained no
Archebisshop of york while he was a live / and also there was no bishop at
york / that should be ordained by austyn / Also pryuelege of popes confermeth
this dygnyte to Austyns successors of caunterbury / and demed that it is skyle
and right that all the chirches of England should take loore of living of
that place for of the well of that place they had the leeme of believe / But
for thou say that gregory might if he would have confermed with a word to
austyns successors that he had granted to saint Austyn / That is soth but
that does no preiudyce to the sea of Caunterbury / For when christ said to
peter / I shall give to the the keys of the kingdom of heuene / he might also
have said / if he would I grant the same power to thy success^urs / And though
he said not so yet he bynymeth Peter's successors nothing of reverence /
another of autoryte / But they had lawfully the dispensacion of office of
holy church / what makes that but the virtue of god that spryngeth by Christ
of peter in to his successors / Also if thou kanst know between falls and
soth^ what has strength in all / has strength in the party / and what
strength in the more / has strength in the less / The church of Rome is as
it were al of all chirches and other chirches both as it were parties thereof /
And as for to take heed in one manner wise / man is the kind of his syngulers /
but in every syngler man is the kind of al mankind / So for to take heed in
sum manner wise the church and the sea of Rome is as it were the kind and
conteyneth al in comparyson to other chirches / and yet in every church
regneth the full holiness of Christian feyth / The church of Rome is grettest of
al chirches / and what has strength in that church shall have strength in
less chirches / So that in every church the power of the first shall spring
in to al his successors / but ought be namely and specially out take /
Therefore as Criste said to all the Bisshops of Rome that he said to peter /
So Gregory said to all Austyns successors / what he said to Austyn / Hereof
follows that as Caunterbury is subget to Rome for he takes the feyth of Rome
So shall york be subgette to Caunterbury / that sent thither prechours to
preche hem the feyth / But for thou say that Gregory would that austyn should
have his see at london. hit may not stand / who would trow that so noble a
disciple as Austyn was would wythstonde / nd do against his maystres will /
that was so noble a maystre and do ayenste holy decrees / But though it were
so that Austyn as thou say passed from london / what is that to me that am
not bishop of london / therefore yef this stryf is ceesed and pees made for a
time / yef thou desyrest to plede / I shall not be from the dome / but I shall
defend mine office / and my right / By these reasons thomas was overcome and
granted gladly that the yonder brynke of humber should be the beginning of his
dyocesy / Also it was demed that there afterward in things that longs to
worship of god and to the feyth of holy church the archebisshop of york should
he subget to the Archebisshop of Caunterbury / So that if tharchebisshop of
Caunterbury would make a counseyl in any place of england the Archebisshop of
york should be there at with the bisshops of his prouynce and he shall be
obedyente to his lawful heestes / If the Archebisshop of Caunterbury is deed /
the Archebisshop of york shall come to Caunterbury with bisshops of the foresaid
church / and sacre the primate that is chosen / And if tharchebisshop of york
is deed his successor shall come co the archebisshop of Caunterbury where he
wol assygne in england and be sacred of him / And he shall make him an oath
with profession and obedyence / Than lanfranck hopped for joy and took all this
wreton for that new doing should not slide out of mind and his successors
should be begyled of the knowleche thereof / but he bare him so that he lost
naught that another passed in speaking / For it is hated a man to make him self
curious in his own praysynge / Than lanfranck sent a pystle to pope
alysaunder that contained all this doing with the profession of thomas the
Archebisshop of york / This year king wylliam went in to Scotland with a
great nauey and an hooste of horsemen / And made king malcolyn subget / and
king malcolyn bycame his lyege man / and swore him hommage and feute
Sygebertus bishop of magounce went to saint James a pylgremage / but in his
coming again he was made monk of cluny / than shi^pmen would have bought his
Bisshopryche / he saw that / and went again to his bisshopriche as his abbot
bad him

This year Edgar Adelynge went to king wylliam in to normandy and was acord
with him

the king came again in to England and outlawed some and chaced Earl Rauf and
prysonned waltef and made afterward smote of his heed wyckedly besides

williams prysonne came in to england / to him was yeuen the Erldom of kente He

shrowsbury and ano^ he fill on them that him hadd forsake and occupied odoes
castles in kent / and took odo and made him forswere england / and besieged

castle in saint nycolas mount and resed upon either brother now upon the one and
now upon the other / there in a day king william went out of his tente on war

Capitulum sextum /
THis year dyed lanfrank Archebisshop of Caunterbury / the fourth day of Iuyn
after that he had be archebisshop / xviij year / And than the sea was void
four year / W / de p / li / p / This lanfrank of the nation of lombardes was a
noble man of lettrure / he had y give al his yought to free arts and
scyences and spente his elde al in holy books / he was connyng thereof / and
despised the smokyng and schyllyng speech of mysbyleuyd men And of al thabbayes
of normandy he chose becco^ and was y capped by the pouert and relygyo^ of that
place / there he was monk under abbot herlewing / and was a man that couth do
no great works to get his lyuelode therewith / therefore he held open scole of
art to releue the nedy place by fredome of his scolers / the loos of his
praysynge and of his worship sprang out among wykked men / so that they had
great envy to the good man and to the priests of the cou^tray meoued so
william duc of normandye that he comau^ded to put out lanfrank out of
normandy for his vnnesynesse W / li / 2 / By cause hereof duc williams preeste
was holden a man of great science before the coming of lanfrank / And he came in
a day to lanfrank scole with greet brag and boost / than by his first
speech lanfrank was waar that the man couth well nygh^ right naught / and took
him a thing with lettres for to speed / And so he overcome the wyldenes of the
man by cunning of ytaly / therefore he was wroth / and made duc willya^ put
lanfrank out of al normandy / But occasion to have grace of the duc was for
lanfrank went to the dukes court / and his horse halted and made the duc laugh
/ The duc took head of courtosye of lanfra^cks answer and of the fayrenesse of
his face / and made him pryour of becco / abbot of caen and afterward
archebisshop of Caunterbury / W / de / pon / li / 1 / This man was so famous of
lore that Pope alysaunder aroos worshipfully against him when he came to rome and
said that he did not to the archebisshop that worship / but to his clergy /
therefore the pope axyd that / sith that he had do / what was worshipful
la^ffra^k should do what was rightful that is that he should fall down to the
feet of saint peter's vyker / when he had do so / the pope by cause of him
restored his felawes bisshops that come with him to their state croyses and
Rings that were before y preued as it is said before / Also this lanfra^k
tretid and byladde king wylliam conqueror by an holy craft / not with
grymchydynge / but sometime an ernest and sometime in good myrthe / King william
was stern and dradde no man and ruled both temporalyte and spiritualyte at his
own will / he took no man fro the pope in his land but he come and plesyd him
/ he suffered no counseyll made in his own country without his own leave / Also
he would no thing suffer to be ordained in such a counseyll but as he would
assente / Also no lord of his land should be punysshed but at his own heest /
Sometime lanfrank took money for to spare the more the trespass of his subget /
That did he not for light the charge of sin / but for to get the more grace
of the king / The need why it most be do excused somewhat the kings deed in
gadryng of money / For with great money one may make peace / in the land that
is won thith deeds of arms and with strength / And though it be little
acounted among men to rauysshe of men of the land and give to enemies / yet
before god I hold it right naught / Then king wylliams deeds in comparyson
of deeds of kings. that now ben be worthy to be preched for ensample of free
and lordely heart / That was said trespaas of presu^pcion / Lanfrank suffryd
it ageynste his will / And when ^e saw his time he would speak plesauntly
and warned him and wythsayde him in skillful manner / Lanfrank had filled his
wit with all virtues and specially in / alms deeds / he passed other
men in words and in deeds / and vsyd often that word of holy writ yeueth
alms and al thing is clean to you / And though c^uetyse be a special vice
to lombardes he put that gleymyng fer from his person / so that he spence on
pore men mete and drynk and cloth / he shamed him not to gyrde him self high
and feed and serve pore men and make pore stolers strive and dispute / and
when they had done either should goo glad aweye / the vyctor for he had
the maystrye / and he that was overcome for comfort and solace of shame / he
advanced namely the place of monks and of clerkis / he brouht manly a^en
possessions that were alyened / Sharpnes of wit and dunsta^s favor comforted
him often / for as often as he was thoughtful for such doings and abode with the
sentence / Saint dunsta^ would come to lanfrank when he was a sleep / and warn
him of all the sleyghte of his adversaries / and teache the weyes how he should
escape / Also in a time lanfrank was seek and him s^med that dunstan warstled
with him and delyuerd him of his sickness and made him al hoole / And as it is
take out of saint Dunstans life / lanfrank was so mylde and so fair of speech
in herynge of shryfte that when the shryfte were do he would kiss their
hondes that were y shryue to him / and say these have made me holy this day
/ Also in his time the monks of Caunterbury as well nyghe al other monks in
england were not vnlyk to seculer men save that they left not their chastyte /
but they vsyd haukynge / and huntyng and playeng at dees and great drynkers
also / So that thou would wene that they were consuls rather than monks for
they had so many servants of so great arraye / lanfrank suffryd their
outrage a space of time / but he fered hit awey with the staf of couenable
sternesse / The wise master of souls knew and wist well the customme is the
second from kind / And he knew also that sudden chaungyng of manner and
thewes greueth thoughts and wits / there for otherwhiles emonge he put awey
somewhat of such manner doyngis with fair speech and soft / and whette the
ruyde souls to good with the whestone of virtues / So that they forsook the
branches of shrewdness and evil manners of living and desired the kind course
of virtues and of thewys by their own good will / therefore yet they have the
holy man in mind and greet devotion to god and fair speech to ghestes and
charity among them self / this lanfrank let never man go fro him ^lenge or
sorry / if he saw any man discomforted he would besyly axe and wit the cause
and give comfort and medicyn / he would freely profre penyes to young childeren
/ he ordained to monks what them neded in every side / so that they should
not lack of what that them neded / and out of rule they should not blenche /
that time spra^ge envy among bisshops that would put out monks of their places
/ and bring in seculer clerks / auctor of that doing was walk linus bishop
of winchestre a good man in other deeds / though he were bade in that doing and
brought thereto by cou^seyl of bacbitres Also he had co^utid king william to the
same intent / but la^fra^k herd thereof and destroyed the castes of the mighty
me^ as who destroys attercops nestes / so they that comen afterward should not
be hardy to begin that doing ne none other like / he made that pope alisander
forbode it by his writing / he restored thabbay of rochestre from the no^bre of
four clerks to the no^bre of fifty monks that had enough to live by. his
wit is y wist that he translated gundulphus monk of cadony to the bisshoprych
of rochestre as I trow by the election of god / For this gundulphus learned
holy writ of lanfrank at cadony while his master took heed to other things
he and his felawe walter with the third held on hand the book of the
gospels / and said now essaye we be turnynge of the leaves which of us shall be
abbott and which shall be Bishop / than gundulphus fond this place true
servant wise and ready that our lord ordeyneth over his meyne / but walter
fond this place gods servant and true enter in to the Joy of thy lord /
The third felaw fond I not what hard word that grieved him soore / and though
I have herd it / I foryete it gladly for it is a gentil heart to make no game
and scorn of other men's woo / then they made joy of that hap / and
lanfrank axyd what they had of murthe / and when he knew how it stood / he
told them without doubt that gundulphus should be a bishop and walter an
abbot / and that the thyrdde should torn to the slidyng of the world / as it
fylle afterward / the soth was preued / for gu^dulphus was bishop of Rochester
/ and walter abbot of euesham / and the third passed in vein / when lanfrank
acorded not in manners with king wylliam the reed / he lay at last seek of
the feuer^ and was shryuen and houseled and drank a medecinale drank and so he
yield up the ghost as he had desired / he knowleched that he had prayde god
that he might deye in the fevers or in the flux / for these euyls dystourbith
not the mind nowther lets the speech

THis year when the counseyll was made in the cite turon in gallia / in france

and made pees by medyacion / So that malcolyn should be obedyente to king
william / as he was sometime to his fader / and king william should give him
every year twelve mark of gold and he should yield him twelve cytees / in
england / but sone there after the king failed and Robert took with him edgar
and went again in to normandy / This year the fyfte day of October a great
struck of lyghtnyng smote the church toure at wynchecom be and thyrled the
wall and threw the crucifyxe head down to the earth and brake the right
thygh and threw down our lady image that stood by the roode / thereafter came a
stynkynge smoke that filled all the church / and dured till the monks had
goo a procession about all the places and offices of the abbay with holy water and relykes of holy saints and with the Letanye

Also at london a whyrle wind threw down six honderd houses or moo / and
many chirches thereto / and slew two men in seint marye church at bow / and
lift up six reftres of the church / and stroke them so deep in the

after that osmundus had hallowed that church / Willelmus de pon / libro quarto
/ Remigius the Bishop that translated the sea from Dorchestre to lyncolne /
cast for to halowe the church that he had newely build / But thomas bishop
of york wythstode him and said / that that place was of his parysshe / And
king wylliam for money that Remigius had yeuen pryuely commanded nyghe all
the bisshops of England that they should come to that dedycacion the fyftenth
day of may / but twey days before that day of the dedycacion Remygyus dyed by
gods preuy doom / Robert Bishop of herford aloone would not come to the
halowyng of that church / for he knew by certain sight of the steres that that
church should not be hallowed in Remygius time / This Remygius seemed nygh a
wonder forbodyng for his body was so little / but he overcome kind and showed
outeward a noble heart and wit / So that gracious and noble virtue come of
that litel body / After this Remigius Robert bloet was Bishop a full lecherous
man / he fulfilled ryally the halowyng of that church / Atlast at wodestok he
went from the king and deyde and his bowels were take out of his body and
beryed in the abbay of euesham that he had founded / the other dele was
buried at lyncolne / there it was well know that the wardeyns of the place
were often dysesed with shadows by night / till that the place was clensyd
with holy prayers and be dys / That year king william went in to
northumberlonde / and repaired the cite of lugubalia / that now is called
caercol and made a Castle therynne / that cite had been destroyed from the
coming of the danes two honderd year / And sone thereafter at gloucestre the

give the king five thousand marc / Also this year deyde Rogyer earl of
shrowesbury / when he lay seek he made him mo^k for to have sum socoure by
assente of countess Adelysa / for he had sent Reynald pryour of shrowesbury
to cluny for to have saint Hughe / the abbots kyrtel to were it about him /
Treuisa A wyseman would mean that earl Rogyer had as much mede of that he was
monk / as malkyn of her maydenhode / that no man would have and not adeel

Also that year was great reyne and flodes / And soon thereafter so great fro^t
that one might over all led carts and waynes over waters and ryuers / And
when the frost byganne to. thawe and to melte it brake nygh all the bridges in

Willelmus de pontificibus / it was told this malc^lyn in a time that one of
the lords of his land had conspyred to bring him to death / he badde him be
stylle that told him that tale and he held it preuy with him self till the
traitor was comen / At last the traytoure came to the king to awayte his
time to do that cursed deed / the king bad erly in a morning that all the
hunters should come with their hounds / While they were an hunting the king
went with this traytoure to a brood pleyne / that was bysette with thykk wode

there he lost many horses and men / than the king saw that the walshmen

down a great dele of the wodes / and thereafter he beete down many walshmen /
Wulstan Bishop of wyrcetre deyde the eyghtenth day of January / Willelmus de
pon / li / tercio / This wulstan in the hour of his dyyeng appeared to his well
byloued friend Robert bishop of he^ford in the town of Cryklade and chargyd
him that he should array for his beryeng / and efte the thyrtenth day thereafter
he appeared to ^ym and warned that he should amend him of the negligence of him
self and of his also / And said that he should not long in his chayr sytte /
And soon thereafter Robert deyde / Also this wulstan wol^de suffer no man
when he was deed to take of him his ryng that he had first when he was
sacred bishop / he had often sa^de while he was a live that he would never
leave that ryng / Also he said often to egnlysshmen / It is gods chastysynge
that ye suffer / Englysshmen answered him and said that the norma^s were wors
than ever were englysshmen / god almighty quod he uses well the wykkednesse of
hem in you and by hem that be unworthy he takyth wreche of hem that have
trespaced and a gylt

So god by his good will the fend by his evil will tormentyth evil men in
hell and is tormented with them also / Ensample may be yeuen / thou art wroth
and smytest a man with a staf / of the brekyng of the staf thou rechest but
little / Willelmus de pontificibus likro quarto / Wulstan was borne in warwyk
shyre. and learned lettrure and office of holy church in the abbaye osburgh /
At last he was made preeste and song a long mass / and heelde him apayed
with only the offrynge of christian men / and he was holden a clean maid / he
did no outrage in drink / Flessh / he ete sometime / but he f^rsoke etynge of
flessh / by cause of this hap / In a day when he should goo for to plede /
him seemed that he should first sing his mass / and than took sum mete to
releue with his need / Then a goos was leyd to the fire / and he smelled the
roasted flessh / while he was at mass and was let of his devotion by the
smell of the flessh and so he strof long time and might not torn awey his
thought at this will / therefore he swore on the holy sacrament that he had on
hond / that he would never ete such manner mete after that time / and said his
mass and ete and went forth to the ple as he must / At last his devotion
encreaced and he auowed chastyte / and forsook the world by ensample of his
forfaders that hadd auowed chastyte before his death time / and in the abbay of
wyrcetre there his fader had served before that time / he was made monk /
there he went upward by all the offices of the house / He was ever besy in
fasting waking and in bedes / he was wo^t to lay his head on a form of the
church / there he badde his beedes and slepte there / he lay before the
altar in a night / in his bedes / and there came a fend in a man's likeness
/ and warstled with him / whether he would or no. and cast him thryes to the
ground / therefore he had afterward great penance in an evil that is called
yleos and greueth fast by the reins / the fend came to him in a servants
likeness of the court. as often as wulstan saw that servant afterward he
wexyd al pale for dread / he would not light down from his horse for no
brekyng of brydges / but he would ride surely enough upon the high brinkes of
the bridge^ though it were right strayte / At last when the forsayde aldredus
was translated to the bisshoprych of york wulstan was chosen Bishop of
wyrcetre specially by the procuryng of aldredus that hoped to blind his
rebberye by the symplenesse of wulstan / but he had more help of virtue than
of lettrure / and defended manly the right of his church / But he was not so
lewd of lettrure as he was holden / for he couth what him neded for to kunne /
out take fables of poets / and wyly and Sly Sylogismes / that he would not on
cas / vouche sauf for to learn / wulstan would not assente to his own election
/ Then one wulsius an holy man had be forty year closed / blamed him
sharply for he would not assente / Also he was warned of god that he should
assente to the election / In his consecracion were two legates of the court of
Rome / and though he made profession to Stygandus the Archebisshop / he took
his consecracion and his sacryng of aldredus the Archebisshop of york / but for
to avoid chalenges that might fall afterward / Aldredus made protestacion
that he chalengyd no right of subjection in wulsta^ after that time / though he
had be his monk before that time / Than wulstan was made bishop and spared
both mete and drink in his halle all the hours after mete / as the usage was
of englisshmen / he would sytte by him and frote his palms and feyne to drink
as his time come and comforted him that would drink / but he did that more for
usage of the countraye / than for any liking that he had therynne / and he
left not of the boost of the normans but he had knights about him where he
would we^de He said his mass every day and the sauter also / and memoryes and
minds of famous saints departed a seuene by the seuene hours of the day / As
often as he was at wyrcetre he would sing the hye mass / and said that he
would not leave that office for to resygne the bisshopriche / he would be at
collacio^ of monks / and made the general confession with other / and yaue the
beneson / and goo in to his chamber / when he rode on his horse he would say his
sawter / and beneson that englissh men makyth on the cup. he spared it not
at kings board / if need droof him to plede in any manner time / he would
bydde crstes curs to al evil arbytrours and moyens / but to all the good he
would bydde crystes blessing / he used furs of simple price / and rought but
little of wh^t manner skynnes / but be vsid more skynnes of lamb than of other
beestes / and if one had counseyled him sometime that he should use skynnes of
cattes / he answered in his game and said / I herd sing in the church of
gods lamb and not of gods catte / therefore I love better the heete of the
lamb than I do the beete of a catte / In a time his monks went in the more
church that he had builded / and he saw that the old church was destroyed
that saint oswald had bylded and wept full soore teres / He was in fair manner
wythsayd of that deed / and it was said unto him that he should rather be glad
that his church had so great worship in his time / And also as the houses
were more / so were the moo of monks / He answered and said I mean al other
wise than ye do / we wreches destroy the works of holy saints for to get
us a great name and praysyng of men In that time they used not to build / no
hostful buyldynges / But they used to offer them self to god under that roof
what it ever ewre / and and to draw their subgettis to their own ensamples /
but we do the contrary and gader stones to hepe and retche not of souls In a
time he made a sermon of the pees to the people / and many men turn to love
and to pees / But one there was that would not be acorded in no wise / another
for reasonne another for skyll another for prayeng of the bishop / he stood
before the bishop / and the bishop said to him / It is y wryt^n that men of
pees ben blessed / Than they that been not men of pees be wr^tches and the
deuyls children / Than till thou amend the / I betake the to him that has the
as his own child / And anon as he was made the enemies manciple / he byganne
to lygge and to foam / to grysbyte and to grynde with his teth / and to cast
his head about Wulstan heeled him again / but he would not of peace / Than the
fend had him efte and the third time till he had foryeuen all manner trespaas
/ In a time lanfrank put against wul-stan of lettrure / And the archebisshop
of york Aldredus chalengyd of him lawful subjection / and he went out of the
palace / and said the hour of none that he had behind and came again boldly
/ and answered and had the mastrye / One Alwyn that leuyd as an anchor at
maluerne hills had great will to take the weye to the holy land and told
his counseyll to Bishop wulsta^n / the bishop answered nay / and said leave of
Alwyn with thy good will / trow thou me / thou would have great wonder if
thou wist / what god thinks to do by the / he did by his read / and went
thennes^ and gadred thyrtty monks in the same place / A shipman that hight
Sewulphus shroof him to wulsta^ often of the same sins / than the bishop
said I see well that ese makes a thief / therefore I counseyll the that thou be
a monk / He would not for it was an hard life / Go quoth the bishop / whether
thou wolt or no thou shall be a monk / and so it happed afterward / In a time
wulstan groped the heed of one nycol that was his own nory / that byganne to
wexe balled right in his yongthe / wulstan said to him / I trow son that
thou shall be balled in short time / Than said he / fader why kepyst thou not
my here and make it abide. Sone quod the bishop trow thou me / the other dele
of thy here shall abide while I am alive / and it happed that the same weke the
bishop deyde / That here of Nycols heed fill awey and lofte not on his heed
but the bare skyn After wulstans death when all the church was a fire / there
fell neither ysel nor spark another soote upon wulstans grave / and so it ferde
of the matte that was under him / when he badde his bedes / Of him it is said
that king william the conqueror would have pryued for vnsuffysaunt lettrure /
And also for he couth no Frenssh and cast in that manner to bring in sum nor
man's in his stead / Then wulstan took his cross / and pyghte it in the hard
stone at saint edward the kings feet that lay there in his grave / he pyght
so the cross / that no man it might take out of the stone er he took it him
self at the kings heeste / While he pyght there the cross / he said to king
william a better man than thou art / betoke it to me / and I take it to him
again / take it awey now if thou might /

the great hall of westmynstre / Also the kings meyne grieved the people over all
where they went /

Willelmus de Regibus libro quarto / And yet herto the rote and norysshyng of
couetyse of Ranulph that was sometime the first king williams priest and his
chapellayne was made thus his procuratour in every place / If this Ranulph
should gadre the kings trybute / he would take such two as reasonn would / He
pylled the rich / and bare down the pore / and dysperagid herytages and took
hem in to the kings hand / therefore the king bourded in a time and said that
he was a man alone / for he couth so torn his wit that he rought of no
man's wreche while he might plese his ^orde at full / By his doing holy
dignytees were sold / and sone thereafter he bought the bisshopryche of durham
for a thousand pound / That time they used strowtyng locks and long blasyng
clothes / gay sporres and sharp / tho men yede tryppyng showing the sides /
Ancelm would amend all this and had no help of his suffragans / and therefore he
went out of england / but by heste of the king in his going in a haven of ke^t
he was pylled and robbed and faren with as it were a thief / His males were
serched / his bouges and his trussyng coffers and all that he had / Then
ancelm went to pope urban in great counsel at barus in apulea / he declared
clerly against thoppynyon of the greeks that tellyn that the holy ghost comes
of the fader and not of the son / Willelmus de pontificibus libro secundo
That time Raf bishop of Chichestre spared not the king another the bisshops
that hold ageynste ancelm / but he spak for Ancelm and wythsayde the king to
his own face / and dradde right naught / he showed forth his cross and his
ring and cesed never nether slaked the great doing of his wit / er ancelm in
his going had brought his cause to a good end / And also this would he not
assente that the king should take tribute of prestes that vsyd fornycacion / but
in all his dyocesy the service of holy church was suspendyd and the church
doors were stopped with thorns / the king was awelded by grymnesse of that
deed So that he granted to him aloone the trybute of his priests / Also he
aleyde that the church that is destroyed and burnt should not be pylled and
robbed with trybutes. but it should be releued and helped with fre yeftes / And
the king that had take from al chirches / he yaue gladly to raufes church
many great yeftes / This Rauf spared not to blame mysdoers for her sins and
if his blamyng halp but little / he would destroy the sin wyttyly / with game
and with myrth^ he would go about his dyocyse thryes a year / but he pylled
not his subgettis by might or by maystry / but what they would freely give him
he took it with good will / Hereof would I not speak at this time nether that it
should be acounted a miracle now in our age to find in a bishop besinesse of
prechyng and reasonable receiuyng / Willelmus de re / li / 4 Will / de regibus

Cenomania herd of his coming and brake the syege / Helyas the master of that
treson was take and brought before the king and the king spak gamely to him and
said master now I have the yet is by hap quoth he that thou have take me /
I wot what I would do might I ones escape / The king was wroth and said go
thy wey and flee / I grant the to do what thou may and if thou ouercomest
me / I shall acorde with the / For the king did such deeds / that if it might
stand with the feyth of holy church / ye would wene / that Julius cesars soul

That time the great king of the norganes the son of Olanus took with him
harald that was sometime king haraldes son / and took the ylandes orcades and

from Tedford to norwiche / And he founded a solempnel abbaye with his own

monks of cluny that were rich in the world and clear of relygion to god ward
And so herbart was amended by double saw of warning / that one was of his

there he took lightly the points of the rule that he had seen before / And
when he saw other put forth to be holden and kept that he had never seen

thereof soberly as a monk should and said / the higher worcher made al thing by
reason and gouneth al thing that he made by reason / by reason the elementis have
their being and the sterres also meoueth by reason and kepyn their course by

sleuthe and uncunning and is y cleped ageyn by law to reason / and also by saint
benets rule / in the which rule is somewhat contained of the which I am not of
power to conceive the reasonne / but yet I hold that it be resonne to assente
to auctoryte / For the auctorytees of holy scripture ben alone though it seem
sometime / that they discord and god does nothing without reasonne / how shall
I than trow that holy father that folowyd cast ordained ought without
reasonne / As though we should give feyth to all^ one auctoryte and naught to
reason / Than of that ye do show so^me auctoryte other reason / and shows
ensample of saint benets rule / if ye mow not / it is al ydel that ye make
profession / that is so noble and despise to follow the lore thereof / the
sentence of this speech passed from one to other and meoued many on lest / they
had run in veyn other should run in veyn / than it was demed that the
superfluyte of the rule should be take awey and only the marouh should be hold /
thabbot made him besy to make all assente / but it is hard to wreche up on
thoughts that is roted in of long time / Only eyghten monks and abbot hardyng
left that abbay and said that the clennes of the rule might not be holden in

that if he byhyght any man good other evil / he might be full syker of that he

deed that is worthy to be kept in mind / For in a time an abbot was deed in
england / and twey monks gadryd a great sum of money / and went to the
king either to supplante other / to geete the Abbots office / and the thyrdde

than the sea of Caunterbury was void full five year / And in the mean time holy
church good was spente in the kings use / And when the king was meoued to
help the church that so was hedles as it were a wydowe / he would put it of

Archebisshops the best men that they could find / and that he would not goo
out of kind / but he would make archebisshop the best man that he might find

that was ar^red of the archebisshoprych^ plesyd the kyngis herte^ though emerus
monk of Caunterbury had write and descryued saint ancelms life at full / yet by
the help of william malmesbury somewhat mot be said of so noble a man / Than
ancelm was born in the Cite August fast by the hills that hight Alps / and
was lettred and chaste of his childehode and had his fader^ wrethe and might
plese him in no manner wise / wherefore he fled awey fer from his fader and came
to becco in normandy / And was favored under la^fra^k priour of becco / and
was made monk there in his six and twenty year / After three year lanfrank
pryour of becco was translated to the abbaye of Cadony / And ancelm was made
pryour under abbotte herlewyn / Then Ancelm yaf him to penance and to
fasting and to techyng of children namely fyften year and would say full often that
him was lever to be in hell without sin than in heaven with sin / he made
many books of clergy in the which our believe that other men make hem besy to win with aucterite / he strengthed with reasons and arguments that may not
be assoylled / So that he passyd not only her works that were before him^ but
also be gadred her works al in to one hepe / Also ly wit and pacyence he
overcome the malice of his enemies / After the fyftenthe year of his priory
herlewin Abbot of becco deide and ancelm was made abbot in his stead and held
him five year out of england / though his coming were nedeful for many manner
causes lest that it should be demed that he converted the archebisshopryche of

causes he was compellyd for to come in to england as it is said before / That

and exylynges and taking in to the kings hand / For it were esyer to by waill
the Empire of one man alone than be under new lords that comen one after
other / Among all this was great silence among the bisshops / The ryghtful
dome was choked within the conscience of hem that might not other durst not
spek^ for dread of one man / For what prouffyt is hit for to speak there thou
shall arere wreth / and win no proufyt / then was hope for to escape all this meschyef if the banyonr ancelm that was first common child were made
archebisshop / King William put of all that was well said to him with swellyng
wreth other with myrthe and curtosye of speech / he suffryd do no bedes for
him / another for the state of holy church / but he said pray ye what ye wol
/ I shall do what me lyketh / At last he was take with a great sickness and
sent for Ancelm / and by assent of bisshops he ordained that he should be
Archebisshop and he wythsayde it / and alayde for him in this manner / if a
young sheep that is Ancelm shall be coupled and yocked to a wild boole that is
william the reed / for they draw not al like / the solouh of holy church
shall not goo a right / But Ancelm took the inuestiture and was sacred / but he
recovered of his sickness and was wors after than before / his friends
cou^seylled him to good / and he used to answer and say / per vultum de luca
/ god shall never have me good / for the harm that he does me / Also this king
was a Rauenour in gadryng and a great waster in spendyng / he fered despytously
every man that proferyd him ought / but the yefte were great and acordyng to
his own heart / So in a time saint ancelm proffered the king five honderd pound
/ and he would not take it / Than Ancelm deled it to pore men / diverse wondres
were seen in to al england / for at shrowesbury was a great earth shaking / and
a^ notyngham from the erly morrow tide to under of the day / The River of

is naught that thou do / we seek and axe a prince and not money / Neygh every

me is as leef be slain of the in England as of Sarasyns in siria / for thou
art wors than any sarasyn / though all my men said the king were one body and

King henry is deed at Fontreuerard / And his son Rychard was king after him
and reigned ten year / Steven of Caunterbury descryued clearly his manners and
his deeds And by cause this storye should not mysse the noble deeds of so great
a duke / I have studied to take the flowers of steuens book / This king
ordained redyly his things beyond the Sea / and came in to England for to be
crowned / In his coming prisones were opened and he was crowned at london of
Baldwyn Archebisshop of Canterbury the third day of September the which day
is acounted an evil day by the vein believe and usage of mysbyleuyd men / and
is clepyd in the calendar Dies Egypciaca / and dies mala an evil day as it
were a day of bodynge of evil happes to the Jews for the Jews of England had
evil hap that day / Many Jews came to this solempnyte lest the welthe that
they had under the old king should be withdraw in the new kings time /
But the king heet and commanded that the I^wes should not come in to the
church / while he were crowned nowther in to the palace while he were at mete
/ But while the king was at mete / sum of the Jews pressed among other / and
come within the palace gate / and one of hem was smyten with a man's fyste /
Than the Rabyssh people wend that the king had so commanded / and up with
staves battes and stones / and laid on the Jews and made them to flee / Hereof
sprang lykyng things in to all the Cite / as though the king had commaund^d to
dystroye the Jews / and the people resxny and cryeng brake up the houses there
the Jews were fled for dread / and burnt and spoylled and took what they
might / and would not leave for the kings sendyng / The outrage of* so great
wodenesse if it were suffered should pass many cruel deeds and blemysshed much
the kings beginning / But for the great multitude of hem that were gylty he
must let pass what he might naught take of full wreche / At last the Jews
had pees granted / And anon the king ^eueth dygnytees that auoydeth / And all
without that his brother Johan had of his faders yefte in Irlond and in
normandy. he yaf him the prouynces of Cornewail Of Deuenshyre / of notyngham
and of lancastre / Also he yafe him the earls daughter of Gloucestre to wife
that was his Cosyn in the third degree with all her faders lordship / The
lordship of the fourth dele that was yeuen him made him unkind and untrue and
desire the hoole kingdom / The king committed the governance of the Royame to
the Bishop of Durham / that should more skylfully and semely occupye him self
in gods service than in the kings service / For the Gospel says that no
man may serve twey lords at full as he should / though the Bishop would to dele
him self for to plese either king of heaven and of earth / Certainly the king of
heaven aloweth not service that is so deled For he would be seruid with all the
might of the soul / And what if the Bishop that is but half yeuen to Gods
service does not his office as he should / but ordained unworthy and recheles
persons in his steed for he would serve ho^ily in the palais other in the
feire and court / For in none half man makith God at full of the acountes of
an erthely prince / Also the king for to have the more large spence toward
Jerusalem he resigned the Castles of Berwick and Rokesburgh to the king fo
Scotland for ten thousand pound / Also he begiled the old man the rich
bishop of durham and made him bye his own prouynce for a greet sum of
money / therefore the king said often in his game / I am a wonder crafty man /
For I have made a new earl of an old bishop by such manner wyle and speech he
empted many man's purses and bags / and sold dygnytees and lordshipes that
longed to the king as though he thought never for to come again / In a time
his friends that were homely with him blamed him therefore and he answered and
said I would selle london and I might find a chapman that might well pay /
many men bought with the better will / For they trowed that the king would
never come again / he had take power of the pope that he might byneme the
cross whom that he would / and thereby he gate many thousand pound / than
the king as it seemed betoke rechelesly the gouernyng of the kingdom to his
chaunceler bishop of hely / and sayl^ed in to Normandy before mydwynter tide /
That time at dunstaple the sign of the cross was seen in heuene / and soon
thereafter the sh^p of the cross was seen forsake the baner and pass somewhat
of space therfrom / Tell who that will what it might mean / For I have learned
to tell this wonder and not to descryue what hit should mean / Than the kings
of England and of France after that they had made suerte between hem tweyne
they dwelled at Turon in France for to abide somer to wend in the wey to the
holy land not only for holy entente and for cause of the feyth / But for
desire of her own welthe and hope of great hap and fortune / but the
ryghtwysenesse of God aloweth not such manner doing / but semely god ordeineth
that outrageous pride of mysbyleuyd men should be alayd in that manner / Also
without the meschyef that Jews suffryd in her body and catel at lyncolne and
at lynne / yet at york after a long siege and great meschyef and woo / Raby
master of Jews forkytte the veins of four honderd Jews and of his own

many great prays / there the hostiler slow him pryuely by night for couetyse
of money that he had brought / And threw the body by night without the cite

wonder falls sightes of falls tokenes / and the sely men bare on hand / that it
was for the holiness of that man that they held a very martyr and worshipped
the sepulcre of the deed man with solemn watches / and yeftes / But wise men
lough hem to scorn / but clerks of the places were well apayd therewith / for
they had prouffyte thereby / this was told to the bishop / and anon he forbad

kings power / and bare down the common people and showed auctoryte of the pope
of Rome / and roode with a thousand horses / he grieved abbayes with paymentes
and with gifts / and made his allies the grettest of the land / Either
prymates see he held low enough / at his own will / For Baldwyn

year that he was not sacred / And also geffrey landed at Dover / and he bynam

popes legate There his fautour hughe nouaunt bishop of Chestre put forth a
playnt that the monks of Couentre had shadde his blood right before the high

prouendes by occasion her of this hughe that was gyleful of wit / shameless
and hardy in evil deeds cunning in lettrure and fair speech / and had alweye

gilty of hughes tr^spaas / and sent anon to the court of Rome men of answer
full informed with lettres of bisshops witnessyng that the monks had forsake
Cristes chiualrye and were fall to wordly liking / therefore he prayed the pope
of free ordenaunce of that Abbay^ / The pope abode six months with the
sentence for to abide if any man would come and speak for the monks / but
defaute of spences let the monks and made that the bishop had al his will
/ the monks come uneath at last when they had long wept the wrong of her
violent out puttinge. But the bisshops might and power had the maistrye by
money and slight and many years the monks were disparpled / and what they
had was ordained to prouendes of clerks and they lived porely* and gate their
lyflode as they might / therefore when this bishop hughe was seek at becco in

home again for to take afterward gretter wreche of king rychard / Than all that there was won was departed between the kings of england and of France
/ and the king of France sold his prisoners and the king of england henge his
own prysonners / Herfor and for other such deeds the king of France byganne
for to strive / and had great envy to the name that king rychard had and said
that the eyer was dystempered and went home again and swore that he would do
no damage to king rychard before his coming out of the holy land / than he
had good wind and sailed in to ytaly / and came to the pope and prayed to be
assoylled of an oath that he had made against his will / but the pope would not
asse^t Than Conradus the markys was slain of twey thieves in his own Cite
Tyrus / And the king of france founded for to put that cursed deed upon king
Rychard / and made a counseyll at Paris / and there he said that he would be
wroken upon king rychard / but the wisest men cou^seyled him to leave his purpos
/ and take none hasty wreche / and said / though it were soth that was bore
king richard on hand / yet men should not hastly and vnskylfully worche but men
should abide by cause of honest till he were come home ageyn / for it was
known that he was in pylgremage for crystes sake / Also if he would when he
were come home purge him of that men bare him on hand other make good for the
trespaas / than it shall be well enough / and else it is ryghtful to axe wreche
and that in skylfull time / and if this counseyl plese you not / axe cou^seyl
of the pope / the king ceessed for a time / but he cast a cruel doing and blody
for the kingdom of England / For the king of France sent messagers for to
have to his wife the kings suster of denmark upon such a covenant that he
should have granted with her all the right that the danes had sometime in
England and nauey and strength for one year to help win that right

That condicyon was denied for the Wandales that were against him in the other
side / but the king had with the wenche ten thousand marc of silver / But after
the first night of the weddyng / the king forsook her and put her awey
unseemly other by cause her breath stank / other for he fond her not maid /
That time in the eeste lands was greet defaulte of spence and also king
Rychard was wyckedly defamed that he was untrue to the king of France and had
done him wrong. and also that he had hired thieves to slay conradus the markys
and that he had conspyred with the soudan to bytraye the holy land / and that
it was therefore that king rychard would not go to for to take the holy cite /
therefore king rychard arrayed him hom ward Also for the more dele of the
cryste^ host was destroyed with sword / with sickness with honger and with
hard trauayll / In that doing take heed that the high wysedom of god that
ret^^^th but little as it seems of the wordly heel and sauacion of his
servants while he makes hem come wisely by meschyefs and sorrow to fulfill
the cite of heaven / I tell it for they that passed so there sped more graciously
than they that come home ageyn to her foul manner of living of old time / so
christ our king uses well the evil deeds of mankind while he takyth the erthly
Jerusalem in to the hands of enemies for the sin of hem that dwelled
th^rynne and bryngyth forth wisely large wynnyng of high Jerusalem of heaven /
for the defaulte / and shame of our time the holy Cite mot be defouled of
mysbyleuyd men un to that time / that god knowyth alone / For without any
doubt when time comes the holy land shall cast out evil me^ that dwell
therein as it did sometime and on caas with well less strength / for gods owe^
stre^gthe should be more known in that man deed / So among the machabeys one
said it is but little maystrye to god almighty to overcome many men with the
might and strength of few men and that was showed and declared when one
pursued a thousand and tweyne chaced ten thousand / And gedeon did aweye the
greet multitude / and had the vyctorye of a greet multitude with three
honderd men that laped water in to their own mouths / But Christian men shall
not assaye god and start forth rabbyschly and unwisely few against many
enemies / as who says we have a good lord and a mighty / For god wo^ that his
servants trust so on him that they be not recheles and neglyge^t but worche

THan trewes were take for three year between king richard and the soudan / and
hubert bishop of Salesbury yede to the sepulcre for him self / and for the

to Cypres / Thennes the king sent forth to Scicile twey queen's / his wife /
and his suster neygh with al^ his meyne / and he might not well endure in the
soft see / but he sailed with a strong wind toward the countray of hystria
with few men / and was driven til that he came between Aquila and venyse / and
there he houed and bleynt hider and thither / and hyd him somewhat of time and men
made great purueaunce of vytayls for him / and so he was aspyed and take of the
dukes men of Austryche / when that was known the king of france made Johan
king Rychardes brother to torn lightly against king rychard / a^nd exyted also
the emperor of almayn against king rychard / than the emperor made covenant with
the duk of austryche for to have the thyrdde part of the prouffyte and wynnyng
that come of king rychard and had king rychard in to his own ward / yet while
king rychard bare the cross and the sign of our lord / And the emperor put
hyin in a place that is called Tryuallis / there arystotle seith it were good a
man to sle his own fader / but about palmsonday the emperor brought forth king
rychard to give his answer before many lords of the emperors land / and he
came forth with so glad chere and answered to all thing that was put against
him / that the Emperor was bowed not only to mercy / but also for to do him
great reverence and worship / than came to the king that was so holden william
bishop of hely that was put out of england for his great extorcio^s and
outrages / he came to the king for to espy what will the king had to him ward /
and when he might not begyle the king with gyle of blind flateryng he had
evil trust to him self and turned again to France with hoope of grace / But
Hubert bishop of Salesbury come out of Scicile to the king and was sent in
to england for gouernyng of the Royame and also for to speed the kings
raunsone when he was comen in to england he was chosen archebisshop by assente
of the monks of Caunterbury and of the Bisshops / and no wonder / He took the
pal and and was stalled / and took anon the habyte of Chanon at Marton / and
was not grievous to the monks of Caunterbury / but the sharpness of baldwyn
had somewhat unwisely grieved them before / Though this baldwyn was a good man
and holy in other deeds / yet he founded to torn the right and the prerogatyf
of the election of the Archebisshop from the monks of Caunterbury / by cause
thereof fast by the monks church by favor of the king he byganne to bylde a
place and great housyng not without shedyng of blood for to have there
prouendes for seculer chanons / and for bisshops suffrygans should come thither
for to trete therewith clerks of the election of the archebisshop and for to do
awey the monks / but in the other side the monks appellyd to the pope and
compellyd to ceesse the work that was begone / and after baldwyns death they
threw it down straight to the ground / In that doing it is wonder of so
greet a man / that was first archedeken and than white monk / and than abbot
/ and than bishop of wyrcetre and than Archebisshop that ^e would bring men
of more wnparfyghte life / seculer chanons instead of men of more parfyht life /
For sometime holy princes and bisshops in england would not have to many of such
manner clerks / and give them choice / whether they would leave their benefyce
other change their life and goo in to Relygyon / Treuisa / It seems that
baldwyn was well aduysed that christ was head of holy church / and his apostles
heyghe bisshops / and none of them all was never monk another freer / and so it
might seem that he knew well that other clerks were more parfyht than eu was
monk other freer / but for it is said that the clerk^s had^^ choys whether
they would leave their benefice or go in to Relygion / of that choys it might
seem great wonder / for it semyth thereby that they should leave their benefyce /
how it ever were / for if they yede in to relygyon they should leave their
benefyce / and if they yede not in to relygyon they must leave the benefyce by
the rule of relygyon / other they speak other wise of relygyo^ than al men in
common spech^ wol mean and so it seems more wonder of that wonder than of his
menynge / but men would wonder that baldwyn that was a mo^k would not flater with
monks but held other clerks more holy than monks / sith he knew the degree
of eu either. than it folowith in the story / after the woe and tene that king
rychard had in prison in almayn a year and three months / he was delyuerd in
the month of Ianuar for an / C / thousand pound of silver / and left with
the emperor pledges / the Bishop of Rothomage and of bathe for sum of the
money that was not yet paid / And for to pay that sum of money all the woll of
white monks and of chano^s was take / and also rings of prelates vessels
croyses and chalyces were take and gold of seuentene shrynes y shave and molten
and no pryuelege of person another of holy church another fredom was spared /
the king dwelled two months full at swynne in Fl^aundres other to abide the
wind other for to array what him neded / There the emperors men had almost
take him eftsoon / for the Emperor thought tha^t he had latte goo the king
as phaaro forthought sometime that he had let go the children of Israel / But
in the month of march the king came a land at Sandwyche / and dwelled a while
at london and went and took the strengest castle that his brother Johan had
The Castles of nothyngham and of tykkehylle / and put the wardeyns thereof in
prysonne / and by counseyl^ and dome of l^ordes he pryned his brother John of al
manner worship / For he held him untrue and unkind / And heelde his eester at
hampton / And so at wynchester when the meschyef of his taking was wyped of /
he was newely crowned as a new king the fyfthe year of his kingdom / After
the solempnite of that crownyng the king axyd again all that was before
lygh^ty yeuen or grievously sol^de / and he acounted for the sort all the
fruit that was take in the mean time and spared for no covenant another for
charter / another for deed / another for instrumente / And so he dwelled a while
and sailed in to france for to werre against the king of France / than the
kings fought and either sped dyuersly / And trewes were granted for one year
/ and that was prouffytable for king Rychard for to gader both riches and
strength / though hit would not stand with reason of honest / Johan king
Rychardes brother that turned to the king of france against his own brother for
he had right naught / he might do right naught / therefore he was forsake of
the king of France / But by help of his mother Elyanor he came mekely ageyn to
king richard and was afterward his true knight / for use of ong knights as it

ladde steven in to a privy place and showed him a brazen heed in the which

king rychard had left with him come suddenly and told that the tyrant was

About that time were tweyn that founded as it were to do the kings prouffyte

warned the king of the fraud of his officers / therefore he would that their
outrage should be chasted that men of the contrayes might live in pees / But
william with the long berd warned the king of the outrage of rich men that
spared their own Richesse and pylled pore men / Then this abbot had a
warrau^t and came to london in the month of Februar and made sum to come
before him / the officers of countrayes and of prouynces to yield full ac^untes
/ But death him let so that he saw not eesterdaye / Men sayn that this
william was borne at london / and had (...) of his long berde that he used /
and was cleped william with the long berde / He used that long berde because
that he would seem the more worthy / and semely in speech and gaderyng of many
me^ He was sharp of wit and somewhat y lettred and over mesure a great speker
and by a manner kyndly Rabbysshnesse of wit and of thewes. he would geete him a
great name and cast him to do new deeds and byganne to here great doing and
deeds / Also his wreched and shamely deeds ageynste his own brother was sign
and token of his wodenesse in his other deeds / For he accused his own brother
of treson to the king / for he yaf him no more large spence of solace and cost
than he was wont / His brother was a bourgeys of london / and had found him to
Scole / He was scorned of the prince for that deed / and yet by favor of
sum men he had place among the great of london / Also among the people he
blamed venymously the pryue deeds and outrage of rich men that mysferde with
pour men and so he excited hugely^ the mean men to love and desire fredome
out of mesure So that he socyed many to him as though they were bywytched
right with wytchecraft / For there he had tendaunt to his heestes five
honderd thousand and two thousand men of london / as it were to the common
puruyour of al / when he had so many fautours as he that would stand for the
pore people and for the kings prouffyt he would in every gaderyng and counseyll
with stand gentylmen and say that by her fraud the king lost many great
enchetes / they grutchyd against him therefore / and he sailed to the king and
said him / that Rich men did him greet wrong by cause he was true to him /
Then he came again and byganne to worche with fraud as he was wont more
besyly and more trustly / and comforted his fautours as it were by favor of
the king. Noise and tidings of this conspyracy spra^ge out and hubert
Archebisshop of Caunterbury that had the rule of the Royamme herd thereof /

forth as he had bygonne and had much folk about him and went with great
boost and array and made openly Conuentycles and counseyls and gadrynge of m^n
and cleped him self the savior of poor men / and made great boost and brag

depart the people that is true and meek from the people that is fal^ and
proud / I shall depart good men from evil men as light from derknesse / than
by counceyll of lords this hubert sent for william for he should stand and
answer to that m^n should put against him / he come at that time as he was
somned / but he had so much people about him that he that had sent for him was
aferd and the softer in his doing and put o^ the dome for that time Afterward
oportunyte was aspyed by two burgeys of london / when he might be found
aloone without people about him and men of arms were sent for to take him /
But william with his axe slew one of the bourgeys that had espied him / Anon
william with few of his men and with his concubyne that would never from him
went in to a church / that was there fast by that is saint mary chirch at
bow / there he would not defend him as it were in a church but as it were in a
Castle with strength and hoped in veyn that his people would come and deliver
him / The people was soory for the peril that he was Inn / and is no wonder
but by cause of the pledgys that they had yeuen him / and for dread of the
knights that they saw armed they came not to his delyueraunce / than william
was boden come out but he would not / than he was compellyd by fire and smoke
to come out maugre his teeth / when he came out the bourgeys son / that he
had slain forkytte his womb with a knyf / but by d^me of the court when he
was taken he was first drawn with horses and than he was hanged with nine
felawes that would never leave him / but fautours defamed the Archebisshop as a
mansle^r and not only that but alfo for to wype awey the shame of their own
conspyracye and for to preue that they that dampened william were wicked men and
evil doers / By craft and by fraud and gyle they fonded to make william to
have the name and worship of a martyr Also men seyn that a priest of williams
kyn leyde the cheyne that william was with bounden under a man's head that was
seek of the fevers and preched openly that the man was hool anon / Right this
sprang out among the people / and the people came pryuely by night and took
aweye his gybet and pared awey little and little the earth that was by bled with
his blood / And made a great dyche and kept the earth as it were holy relyques
to hele with seek men / Name and tidings hereof sprang wel^ wide and great
company both of slye men and of fools came to the place and woke there by night
/ Alwey came theder greet multitude of lewdmen and of fools / and as much
worship as they did the deed man so much vylonye they put upon him that him
had dampened / This error had so his forth when it was bygon that it would
have by witched wise me^ and ready and they redyly take h^ede to the doing that
they knew of this willia^s deeds / for he slew a man a little before his taking
/ and that is enough for a wise man to know that he should not be worshipped as
a martyr / and yet his last confession that he made when he should dye / should
sham^ all that worshipped him / for a martyr. Many counseylled him to be shreuen
mekely of his sins / and to worship god / he shroof him / though it were
laate and knowleched that he had defouled saint mary church and lay there by a
woman while he was therynne / Also by cause his men come not at his will to
delyuere him / he forsook mary sone and called the devil to help and prayed that
he would deliver him Williams fautours denied all this and said that it was
falsely feyned / also the vanyte of this tale fill down sone and dured but a
while and alayde the stryf / For sothnesse is steadfast and is str e^ger in long

challenge normandy and his right that he had in France / to the end to set

matters / And so all his life after he labouryd in the warrys in conquerynge

a part / and not only so / but that it was said through the Royame that tho
said lords should be destroyed utterly as it openly was showed at bloreheth
by them that would have slain the Earl of Salesburye / Then they for sauacion
of their lives and also for the common well of the Royame thought for to remedy

the west countray / to which the earl of warwyck came from calays with many of

much more people than the duc of york / and the Earls of warwyck / and
Salysbury / For it is here to be noted that every lord in england at this time
durst not dysobeye the queen / For she rewlyd peasybly all that was done about

dispoylled the castle and the town / And sent the duchess of york with her
children to my lady of Bokyngham her suster / where she was kept long after /
And forthwith the king ordained the duc of somersete Capytayne of Calays / And
these other lords so departed as a fore is said were proclaimed rebellys and
great traitors / Then the duke of Somersete took to him all tho Soudyours
that departed fro the field / and made him ready in all haste to goo to Calays
