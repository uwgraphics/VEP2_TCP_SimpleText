The co^uercyon of swerers.



THe fruytfull sentence and the noble works
To our doctrine written in old antyquyte
By many great and right notable clerks
Grounded on reason and high auctoryte
Did give us example by good moralyte
To follow the trace of truth and ryghtwysnes
Leuynge our sin and mortal wretchedness
By their writing does unto us appear
The famous acts of many a champyon
In the court of fame renowned fair and clear
And some endyted their entencyon
Cloked in color hard in construccyon
Specially poets under cloudy fygures
Coueryd the truth of all their scryptures
So hystoryagraphes all the worthy deeds
Of kings and knights did put in writing
To be in mind for their memoryall medes
How should we now have any knowledgynge
Of things past / but by their endytynge
Wherefore we ought to preyse them doubteles
That spente their time in such good besynes
Among all other my good master Lydgate
The eloquent poet and monk of bery
Did both contryue / and also translate
Many virtuous books to be in memory
Touching the truth well and sentencyously
But sith that his death was intolerable
I pray god reward him in life perdurable
Among all things nothing so prouffytable
As is science with the sentencyous scripture
For worldly richesse is often transmutable
As daily does appear well in ure
Yet scyens a bydeth and is most sure
After pouerte to attain great richesse
Scyens is cause of promocyon doubtless
I little or naught expert in poetrye
Remembrynge my youth so light and frail
Purpose to compyle here full breuyatly
A little treatise woeful to bewail
The cruel swerers which do god assail
On every side his sweet body to tere
With terryble oaths as often as they swear
But also for dread plonged in neclygence
My pen does quake to presume to endyte
But hope at last to recure this science
Exorteth me right hardely to write
To deuoyde idleness by good appetyte
For idleness the great mother of sin
Every vice is ready to let ynne
I with the same right gretely infecte
Lykely to deye till grace by medecyne
Recured my sekenes my pain to abiecte
Commaundynge me by her hye power deuyne
To draw this treatise for to enlumyne
The reders thereof by penytencyall pity
And to pardon me of their benygnyte
Right mighty princes of every christian rygyon
I send you gretynge much hertly and grace
Right well to govern vpryght your dominyon
And all your lords I greet in like case
By this my lettre your hertes to enbrace
Besechynge you to prynte it in your mind
How for your sake I took on me mankind
And as a lamb most mekely did enclyne
To suffer the death for your redempcyon
And ye my kings which do now domyne
Over my commons in terrestryall mancyon
By pryncely preemynence and Iuredyccyon
In your regal courts do suffer me be rent
And my tender body with blood all be sprente
Without my grace ye may nothing prevail
Though ye be kings for to mayntene your see
To be a king it may nothing avail
But if my grace preserve his dygnyte
Behold your servants how they do tere me
By cruel oaths now pvon every side
About the world launcynge my wou^des wide
All the graces which I have you showed
Reuolue in mind right often ententyfly
Behold my body with blody proppes endewed
Within your realms now torn so pyteously
Towsed and tugged with oaths cruelly
Some my heed some mine arms and face
Some my heart do all to rent and race
They new again do hang me on the rode
They tere my sides and are nothing dysmayde
My wounds they open and devour my blood
I god and man most woefully arayde
To you complain it may not be denayde
ye now to tug me / ye tere me at the root
yet I to you am chief refuyte and boot
Wherefore ye kings reygnynge in renown
Refourme your servants in your court abused
To good example of every manner town
So that their oaths which they long have used
On pain and punysshement be holly refused
Meke as a Lamb I suffer their great wrong
I may take vengeance though I tarry long
I do forbere I would have you amend
And grant you mercy and ye will it take
O my sweet brederne why do ye offend
Again to tere me which deyed for your sake
Lose my kyndenes and from sin awake
I did redeem you from the deuylles chain
And spyte of me ye will to him again
Made I not heaven the most glorious mansyon
In which I would be glad to have you in
Now come sweet brederne to mine habytacyon
Alas good brederne with your mortal sin
Why flee ye from me / to torn again begin
I wrought you I bought you ye can it not deny
Yet to the devil ye go now wyllyngly
See
Me
Be (kind
Again
My pain
Reteyne (in mind
My sweet blood
On the roode
Did the good (my brother
My face right red
Mine arms spread
My wounds bled (think none oder
Behold thou my side
Wounded so right wide
Bledynge sore that tide (all for thyn own sake
Thus for the I sinerted
Why art you hard herted
Be by me converted (and thy swerynge aslake
Tere me now no more
My wounds are sore
Leave swerynge therefore / and come to my grace
I am ready
To grant mercy
To the truly / for thy trespace
Come now nere
My friend dear
And appear / before me
I so
Iu woe
Did go sese
I
Cry
Hy (the
Unto me dear brother my love and my heart
Turmente me no more with thyn oaths great
Come unto my Joy and again reuerte
From the deuylles snare and his subtle net
Beware of the world all about the set
Thy flesh is ready by concupyscence
To burn thy heart with cursed vyolence
Though these three enmyes do sore the assail
Upon every side with dangerous iniquite
But if thou list / they may nothing prevail
Nor yet subdue the with all their extremyte
To do good or ill / all is at thy lyberte
I do grant the grace thyn enemies to subdue
Sweet brother accept it their power to extue
And ye kings and princes of hye noblenes
With dukes and lords of every dygnyte
Endued with manhood wisdom and riches
Over the commons having the soueraynte
Correct them which so do tere me
By cruel oaths without repentance
Amend by time lest I take vengeance
Exodi vicesimo / non accipies nomen dei tui in van^^.
Unto the man I gave commandment
Not to take the name of thy god vaynfully
As not to swear but at time conuenyent
Before a Judge to bear record truly
Namynge my name with reverence mekely
Unto the Judge than there in presence
By my name to give to the good credence
I my brederne if that I be wroth
It is for cause ye falsely by me swear
Ye know your self that I am very trothe
Yet wrongfully ye do me rent and tere
ye neither love me nor my Justyce fere
And if ye did ye would full gentylly
Obey my bidding well and perfytely
The worldly kings having the soueraynte
ye do well obey without resystence
ye dare not take their names in vanyte
But with great honor and eke reverence
Than my name more hye of magnyfycence
ye ought more to dread which am king of all
Both god and man and reygne celestyall
No erthely man loves you so well
As I do / which mekely did enclyne
For to redeem you from the fendes of hell
Taking your kind by my godhede dyuyne
you were the fendes I did make you mine
For you sweet brethren I was on the rode
Gyuynge my body my heart and my blood
Than why do ye in every manner of place
With cruel oaths tere my body and heart
My sides and wounds it is a pyteous case
Alas sweet brederne I would you convert
For to take vengeance ye do me coherte
From the house of swerers shall not be absent
The plage of Justyce to take punysshement Unde. Ecclesiastici.xxxiii. Uir
multam iurans implebitur iniquitate et non discendet a domo eius plaga.

A man much swerynge with great iniquite
Shall be replete / and from his mancyon
The plage of vengeance shall not cessed be
Wherefore ye brederne full of abusyon
Take good head to this dyscrypcyon
Come now to me and axe forgyuenes
And be penytente and have it douteles Angustinns. Non potest male mori qui
been vixit et vix been moritur qui male vixit.

Who in this world lives well and ryghwysly
Shall deye well by right good knowlegynge
Who in this worldely ueth ill and wrongfully
Shall hardly escape to have good ending
I do grant mercy but no time enlongynge
Wherefore good brederne whiles that ye have space.
Amend your life and come unto my grace
My words my prelates unto you do preche
For to convert you from your wretchedness
But little auaylleth you now for to teache
The world has cast you in such blyndnes
Like unto stones your harres has hardness
That my sweet words may not reconsyle
Your hertes hard with mortal sin so vile
Woe worth your hearts so planted in pride
Woe worth your wrath and mortal envy
Woe worth sloth that does with you abide
Woe worth also in mesurable glotony
Woe worth your tedyus sin of lechery
Woe worth you whom I gave free will
Woe worth couetyse that does your souls spyll
Woe worth short Joy cause of pain eternal
Woe worth you that be so perverted
Woe worth your pleasures in the sins mortal
Woe worth you for whom I sore smerted
Woe worth you ever but ye be converted
Woe worth you whose making I repent
Woe worth your horrible sin so vyolente
Woe worth you which do me forsake
Woe worth you which wyllyngely offend
Woe worth your swerynge which does not aslake
Woe worth you which will nothing amend
Woe worth vice that does on you attend
Woe worth your great unkindness to me
Woe worth your hertes withouten pity
Woe worth your falshode and your doubleness
Woe worth also your corrupt Judgment
Woe worth delight in worldely richesse
Woe worth debate without extynguyshement
Woe worth your words so much impacyent
Woe worth you unto whom I did bote
And worth you that tere me at the rote
Blessed be ye that love humylyte
Blessed be ye that love truth and pacyence
Blessed be ye following works of equity
Blessed be ye that love well abstynence
Blessed be ye vyrgyns of excellence
Blessed be ye which love well virtue
Blessed be ye which do the world eschew
Blessed be ye that heavenly Joy do love
Blessed be ye in virtuous governance
Blessed be ye which do pleasures reprove
Blessed be ye that consider my greuaunce
Blessed be ye which do take repentance
Blessed be ye remembrynge my passion
Blessed be ye making petycyon
Blessed be ye following my trace
Blessed be ye loving trybulacyon
Blessed be ye not willing to trespace
Blessed be ye of my castycacyon
Blessed be ye of good operacyon
Blessed be ye unto me right kind
Blessed be you which have me in your mind
Blessed be ye leuynge ill company
Blessed be ye hauntynge the virtuous
Blessed be ye that my name magnefy
Blessed be ye techynge the vycyous
Blessed be ye good and relygyous
Blessed be ye in the life temperall
Which apply yourselfe to Joy celestyall
The brytyll world right often transmutable
Who will in it his life and time well spend
Shall Joy attain after inestymable
For in the world he must first condyscende
To take great pain as his power will extend
Against the world the flesh and the devil
By my great grace for to withstand their evil
For who can be a gretter fool than he
That spends his time to him uncertain
For a breuyat pleasure of worldly vanyte
Than after that to have eternal pain
Who of the world delyteth and is feign
Shall after sorrow and cry ve ve
In another world quante sunt tenebre
Who is wyser than he that will apply
In the world take pain by due dylygence
After short pain to come great glory
Which is eterne most hye of excellence
Where he shall se my great magnyfycence
With many aungelles which for their solace
Insacyately do behold my face
Regard no Joy of the erthly consystory
For like as Phoebus does the snow relente
So passes the Joys of the world transytory
Time renneth fast till worldely life be spente
Consider this in your entendemente
Blessed be they that my words do here
And keep it well / for they are to me dear
Therefore good brederne your hertes enclyne
To love and dread me that am omnipotent
Both god and man in Joy celestyne
Behold my body all to torn and rent
With your spytefull oaths cruel and vyolente
I love you ye hate me ye are to hard herted
I help you ye tere me lo how for you I smerted
Mercy and peace did make an unity
Between you and me but troth and ryghtwysnesse
Do now complain bidding my godheed se
How that ye break the lege of sothfastnesse
They tell me that by Justice doubtelesse
I must take vengeance upon you sykerly
That by your swerynge / again me crucefye
For at the request of good mercy and peace
I have forborne you long and many a day
yet more and more your sins do increase
Wherefore my Justice will no more delay
But take vengeance for all your proud array
I warn you often ye are nothing the better
But ye amend my vengeance shall be gretter Contra iutatores ^^^ in celo

nonne satis pro te afflictus sum? de sine amplius peccare. qr magis aggrauat
vuinus yeccau q vulnus lateris mei

Am not I wounded for the suffyeyent
Have I not for the enough afflyccyon
Leave more to sin by good amendment
The wound of sin to me is more passion
Than the wound of my side for thy redempcyon
Though I do spare I shall not desteny
But ye amend to brenne eternally
With my blody wounds I did your chartre seal
Why do you tere it / why do ye break it so
Sith it to you is the eternal heal
And the releace of everlasting woe
Behold this lettre with the prynte also
Of mine own seal by perfyte portrayture
Prynte it in mind and ye shall health recure
And ye kings and lords of renown
Exhort your servants their swerynge to cease
Come unto me and cast your sin adowne
And I my vengeance shall truly releace
With grace and plente / I shall you encreace
And bring you which reuolue inwardly
This my complaynt / to eternal glory
Amen.
