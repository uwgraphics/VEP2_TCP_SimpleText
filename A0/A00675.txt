the BOHEMIAN Controversy or no?

An Answer to the Question; whether the Emperor that now is, can be Judge in
the Bohemian Controversy or no? Together with the Extract taken out of the
Acts of the Diet at Augspurghe, in the year 1548: concerning the Kingdom of
Bohemia.
THey that endeavor to attribute unto the Imperial Majesty that now is, the
office of a Judge in the Bohemian Controversy, ground their opinion upon this,
that namely, the Crown of Bohemia is an Electorate and a Fee depending on the
Empire; from whence they infer, that as it is only and alone due unto a
Roman Emperor to confer Electorates and Fees depending on the Empire, so
likewise it is due only and alone to the Emperor to judge and to give
sentence in and of the same; and, that in case of not obeying or gainsaying,
he may make use of his Imperial authority.

But whilst the King of Bohemia that now is, being besides Count Palatine and
Elector, has accepted of that now mentioned Crown, Electorate and Fee
imperial; and that at that time when his Imperial Majesty was exalted unto
the Imperial dignity, was of the said King himself acknowledged to be his
Emperor, and liege Lord; and knew very well that his imperial Majesty laid
claim to the said Crown, Electorate and imperial Fee: having besides that
neglected the respect he owes to his Imperial Maiestle, as well in not
abandoning that once accepted Crown according unto the monitoriall Mandate sent
forth in that behalf; as also in not obeying (as he ought) his lawfully
ordained Emperor, and liege Lord.

And therefore his Imperial Majesty, being lawfully elected Emperor of the
Romans, and Lord of the said Fee, and so supreme Judge, can and may use against
the said King all sharp, constraint, and executionall processes.

But every one (the eyes of whose understanding are not altogether blinded
with ouerwhelming affects) can casily perceive the insufficiency of those
confused arguments, if he vouchsafe but as it were by the way to consider and
look upon both parties, and upon the cause it self.

For it is more then world-notorious, and more then manifest out of all
Writings, edictall cassation, and Mandate set forth and published by his
Imperial Malestie, that his Majesty neither pretends nor groundeth his
complaint upon any wrong done to the holy Roman Empire, by accepting of the
said Crown of Bohemia: But altogether and alone upon this, that namely the
mentioned Crown of Bohemia appertains only and alone unto the House of
Austria, as being an only Inheritance of the same; and that therefore it is
due unto his Imperial Majesty, as being borne an Archduke of Austria.

But if his Imperial Majesty may lawfully ground his claim of his pretended
inheritance to the Crown of Bohemia upon virtue of his obtained election to
the Imperial Dignity, why then should not the succeeding and from other
Families descending and issuing Emperors, have the like pretense and claim of
Inheritance to the same Crown? the which the House of Austria I am sure would
never allow of.

It must therefore needs follow, first that the King of Bohemia that now is,
has nothing at all to co^test with the holy Empire, nor with his imperial
Majesty as with an elected Emperor of the Romans, touching the accepting of
the Crown of Bohemia now complained of, but as with a borne Archduke; and
then, that his Imperial Majesty in this private cause and Austriacall
pretense, nor ought nor can be both party and Judge, especially whilst the
Kingdom of Bohemia allows no jurisdiction at all to the Roman Emperor (save
only in that which is due unto the Empire, as from a Fee depending on the
same.) And is not subject neither to the Roman Emperor, nor to the judgments
of the holy Empire, whether they be pronounced at the Imperial Court, or at the
Chamber at Spire; nor to the Constitutions of the Empire, nor to the decisions
of the deuisions of the Empire, nor to common acts of the same.

And whereas his Imperial Majesty in this case against the person of the
Count Palatine Elector, now King of Bohemia, will be considered and produced
not as a party, but as a Roman Emperor, liege Lord and Judge, it is more then
absurd; forasmuch as his Imperial Majesty it self in this Bohemian
Controversy, has never but entitled himself King of Bohemia, and Tenant to
the Empire, in that he still has endeavored to confirm his pretense
principally with this, that namely his Majesty has been invested into the
said and often mentioned Crown of Bohemia, by a Roman Emperor.

Wherefore then the Count Palatine Elector, and now King of Bohemia, can be in
no manner accused as if he had committed any thing against the holy Roman
Empire, and the Roman Emperor his liege Lord, and so lost that Fee of the
Empire he has accepted of.

And if his Imperial Majesty would needs herein supply the office of a Judge
as Roman Emperor and liege Lord, then must he necessarily take upon him two
senerall and distinct persons, and set the one upon the imperial Tribunal,
and make the other as ARchduke of Austria, together with the Count Palatine
Elector, to appear before him, and then judge which of those two has the
better Law, whether the Archduke which by clancularie Conuentions has sought
to change and convey the Crown of Bohemia (a Fee of the holy Roman Empire) to
the great disadvantage and hurt of the same Empire, to the House of Spain,
which long since has affected an universal Monarchy: or the Count Palatine,
which still has, and as yet labors daily to obtain the said Crown and
Imperial Fee from the Empire.

And yet more absurd is this, that they go about to persuade the World as if
the Count Palatine Elector had done too much, and had committed against the Law
in accepting of that him offered Bohemian election and Crown, and that at that
time, when his Imperial Majesty was already exalted to the Imperial
dignity: when his Imperial Majesty was acknowledged by the said Count
Palatine Elector himself, to be his Emperor, and liege Lord: and when he
knew full well that his Imperial Majesty laid claim to the same Crown. For
should the consideration and respect of Imperial dignity be holden sufficient
enough for to bar him from accepting of that, unto the accepting whereof (as
constantly he believes) he was warranted by God, and by the Law?

And what will the effect of this objection be else, but to conclude that the
pretense of the demandant must needs be the stronger in Law, because he is
now preferred to higher dignity then he was before? There is no Prince of the
Empire, which pretends not some one action or another against his equal in
private affairs: But if his equal should attain to the Imperial dignity,
would that same his preferment be cause enough for to cut off the lawful
action of the other Prince? Or should a Canon be barred from prosecuting his
action he has entered against his fellow Canon, concerning some private
demands, because his fellow Canon and adversary is chosen to wear the Myter?
Should a Citizen lose his Law and pretense, because his fellow Citizen and
adversary has got the Majorship? Should a Soldier give over his suite,
because his fellow Soldier has got the Captainship, and so a command over
him that sued? If we should grant this, then must we likewise and most
necessarily grant, that the Dignities of what degree soever, have been
brought in rather for suppression then for promotion of justice:
notwithstanding the scope and principal cause of the establishing and
ordaining of heads, and governors in all estates and degrees of the World, is,
that thereby good government may be maintained, Law and Justice may be
administered to every one which seeks for it, and to whom it is due; and that
none may be molested by another unlawfully and wrongfully.

And although in all estates and degrees, every one is bound by Law and Justice
to render due honor and respect to his lawful Superiors, yet ought that same
honor and respect to be in no wise derogatorie to the right of him that is
bound to honor his Superior, but rather a motive and way to attain to the
same.

But more then absurd it is that they dare persuade his Imperial Majesty to
make use of his obtained Imperial power for to maintain and color his
private Austriacall pretense, and to go through-stitch with force, as being
Roman Emperor: witness all those Writings and Patents which here and there
have been published and putsorth under the name of his Imperial Majesty,
concerning as well the forcible Spanish Army raised in the Provinces of Lower
Burgundy, as also those which are and have been entertained of the united
Electors, Princes, and Estates of the Roman Catholic Religion. For in the
said Writings there be contained these two reasons, That (namely) these Armies
have been leuyed; first for the maintenance of his Imperial authority;
secondly, for the recuperation of the same, as which has been taken away from
him and from his House of Austria, in and together with Bohemia.

Out of the which reasons every one may easily perceive, to what end the
pretended first reason, which is the Imperial authority, serves; namely,
that under the Cloak of the former, the second reason, which is the claim of
Austriacall interest, might be the better put forward: which is indeed a most
monstrous and great abuse of Imperial authority; forasmuch as it is most
manifestly proved and evident, not only out of the Constitutions of the
Empire, and all Imperial Capitulations, but also out of Nature, that the
Imperial authority is given to all and every Emperor, to this end only,
that right and justice (the only true foundations and Pillars of every Realm,
and without which no Realm can nor may subsist) may be administered without
partiallitie, no Prince and Estate of the Empire molested. But every one, as
members of one body, against all unlawful power defended, and so the whole
Body in good unity, peace, and estate preserved: which end to obtain, it
would be impossible, if every Prince, after he is exalted to the Empire, should
be allowed to confound the private actions of his own or of his Family,
against his or their equals with those of the holy Empire; and to drive
through by war, proscription, or other such like sharp means (though they
were made without all lawful precedent cognition, and rested only upon his
own will and pleasure) that, which in propria causa, he never was able to
perform and obtain by himself, and that under color of Imperial
Sovereignty and authority: which indeed is nothing else but to set into
disquietnesse and combustion and extreme danger, the holy Empire;
notwithstanding the Imperial Majesty that now is, has highly obliged
himself to the increasing of the peaceable welfare of the same.

But for to prevent and to auert all mischief and inconvenience which might
arrive out of the abuse of the Imperial authority, it has been most
wholesomely provided by all the holy Roman Empire, that every new elected Roman
Emperor shall at his Imperial election instantly be urged by the electorall
College, to confirm and ratify with a corporal oath this of so many strong
clauses consisting imperial capitulation: That namely, neither he himself will
by violence and power, hurt or suppress any of the Electors, Princes,
Prelates, Counts, Lords, and other Estates of the Empire; neither cause nor
give way to others for to do the same: But if either he or any other has to
demand any thing, be it of them all in general, or of some of them in
particular, that then (for to avoid tumults, dissentions, and other hurtful
inconveniences in the Empire, and to preserve peace and unity,) he shall open
lawful audience and process; and suffer in no wise, neither in these nor in
other matters, where they may have ordinary Laws, and are willing to submit
themselves thereunto, to hurt or to invade by robberies, spoiling, burning,
defiance, war, or any other way, under what color, or pretense or name
whatsoever: that he will and shall prevent and suffer that henceforth in no
wise no body, be he of high or low degree, either Elector, or Prince, or any
other, without cause and unheard to be proclaimed or declared guilty of
iterate proscription and banishment. But that herein all lawful proceedings
and ordinances enacted by the holy Empire, shall, according unto the direction
of the reformed order of the Imperial Chamber at Spire, be fully and strictly
observed and accomplished: And finally, that he contrary unto the golden Bull,
and other Ordinances of the holy Empire, shall in no manner of way send forth,
nor use, neither of himself, nor by way of Entreaty from other Magistates
whatsoever, any Rescript, Mandate, or whatsoever may hurt; with this express
addition, that, if any thing repugnant to the aforesaid points be either
obtained or sent forth, then all the same shall be void and of none effect.

Whilst the now-Imperiall Majesty that now is, has ratified and confirmed
every word of this Capitulation by a corporal Oath, it must needs be more
clear then the Sun it self, that he neither ought nor can be both Party and
Judge in his own proper cause against any Elector or Estate of the Empire,
much less make use of his Imperial authority.

But forasmuch as it might easily happen that at one time or the other, either
the Roman Emperor should have occasion upon some controversy to enter action
against one or the other Elector and Estate of the Empire, or some one Elector
or Estate of the Empire, or the other against the Roman Emperor, touching some
private causes and pretensions; and that therefore necessity would have and
require an impartial Judge, it is further expressly set down and ordained by
the Constitutions of the Empire, and by the fundamental Law of the Goulden
Bull, that in such like cases, that is, when either the Roman Emperor shall
sue in Law any Estate of the Empire, or be sued in Law by any Estate of the
Empire; the whole matter of Controversy ought to be pleaded, and tried, and
judged only and alone before and by the Count Palatine of the Rhyne, Elector,
as ordinary Judge lawfully thereunto authorized by and in stead of the whole
Roman Empire.

And although it cannot be denied, but that, (for to give some colorable show
to the abuse of the Imperial Sovereignty and authority.) it is furthermore
and again alleged and cast abroad, because this Controversy and Action
concerns an whole Electorate of the holy Empire, that therefore all Electors
together have power granted unto them, for to give their judgment, and to
interpose themselves in it: and that likewise not long since, with one consent,
it has been agreed upon by the Electors to this end assembled at Milheusen,
that namely his Imperial Majesty might lawfully, and by virtue of right and
justice, make use and put in ure his Imperial authority and power in this his
Austriacall private pretense against the Count Palatine Elector, now King of
Bohemia: yet is the same the very fullness and height of all absurdities and
vnrighterousnesses which ever were heard of under the cope of Heaven. For if
the three spiritual Electors be of opinion that the Electorall College has
power by reason of the Electorate of Bohemia, to take the cause in hand, and to
judge in and of the same, then had it been their part and office at the last
past Election-day at Frankford, when the whole Electorall College was most
earnestly required, as well by the States of Bohemia's Ambassadors, as also
thereunto instantly admonished, by the Deputies of the three Temporal Electors
themselves, before all other things, to employ all their labor and pain for
to appease and take up the matter, especially cum Res adhuc esset integra. But
whilst at that time they would take no notice at all of it, whilst also the
Elector of Mogunce would not so much as once propose unto the Electorall
Councell-Table, the Letters of Intervention delivered unto him by the
Ambassadors of Bohemia, (notwithstanding his Electorall Grace should have done
and performed the same ratione officij, as being Arch-Chancellor to the
Empire:) whilst also the three Spiritual Lords-Electors, together at that time
would not permit the aforesaid Bohemian Ambassadors to come to that by them
required audience, notwithstanding it did concern the Electorate of Bohemia,
and was due unto them by the very Law National; We cannot but greatly
marvel, that now they show themselves to be possessed as it were with an evil
beforehand privily preiudicatiue conceyned judgment; in that now, they of,
and among themselves, and without priuity of the whole electoral College, much
less of any other of the Princes and Estates of the Empire, ouer-shoote
themselves so far, that, contrary unto all Laws both divine and humane,
they forget not to condemn one party unheard, and to absolve the other.

Out of this manifest behavior of theirs then, it will be hard to find out, or
see any way, whereby they may or can be able to free themselves from
partiality, much less to show or make, or obtrude themselves Judges
impartial; forasmuch as it cannot be denied but that the Crown and Electorate
of Bohemia, has his own proper and undoubted fundamental Laws and
privileges, according unto the Tenor whereof, the King together with the
Estates of Bohemia, ought to be conuented in cases of the like nature, and
allows no jurisdiction at all to the holy Empire, save only (as it was said
before) in that which is due unto the Empire, as from a Fee thereon depending.

And whereas the fault which was publicly committed at Frankford, strives
privily and without all power to excuse or shrub it self by and under the name
of Imperial authority; it is such a thing which hereby must be remitted to
the Judgment and Tribunal of God, the most just Judge.

But the things now spoken, are by no means to be thus understood, as if the
King of Bohemia, Count Palatine, and Elector, would not submit himself, nor
undergo any other lawful judgment, forasmuch as he has still and of his
own accord offered himself thereunto, if so be the same might be done and had
in due and convenient places, by impartial and thereunto qualified persons;
but not before some few Estates of the Empire, arrogating unto themselves
apart, and de facto ius iudicandi: Nor by his Imperial Majesty's private
Councel-Table, and obtrudent passionate Servants.

Neither is the question which party has the Law on his side, But whether his
Imperial Majesty, or his Privy Counselors, may or can be Judges, or no?
For, as concerning the mean and principal cause in and of it self, we
refer the gentle Reader to the Deduction published not long since by the
Estates of Bohemia, in the which there is contained at large, first a
demonstration, how and in what manner they have obtained the right of their
free Election, how and in what manner they have continued the same without any
interruption, till the time of his imperial Majesty: Secondly, a fundamental
confutation of the Austriacal pretencio^s and grounds: Thirdly, a deductio^ of
those most urgent and pregnant Motives, by the which (assisted by their ancient
and well deduced right, and free Election) they were lawfully moved to reject
the Imperial Majesty that now is, and to take in hand a new election:
concerning which points they are ready to give reason, and answer in due
place, and before competent Judges; and to produce further proof for to show
that their most gracious King and Lord that now is, is most unkindly dealt
withal, in that he is said to have pulled the Crown of Bohemia from the head
of his Imperial Majesty, whereas his royal Majesty obtained the same most
lawfully by ordinary and vnanim free election, the same Crown being then
altogether vacant. But we deem it needelesse to dwell any longer upon this,
especially discovering as it were by the way, another gross absurdity worthy
to be taken away.

For many there are found among these which entertain an erroneous opinion of
the lawfulness of the pretended claim of inheritance of the House of Austria,
and which say, That although in the Golden Bull there be expressly reserved
unto the Estates of Bohemia the right of free election, whereas in other
temporal Electorates and masculine Fees of the Empire, there is set down and
confirmed a special order concerning the hereditarie succession in the same,
of the eldest Sons and other near kinsmen by the fathers side: that
nevertheless the same is to be restrained to the Family of Charles the
Fourth, and so to the House of Austria only, forasmuch as it is not to be
presumed that Charles the Emperor, and they then assembled Electors, Princes,
and Estates of the Empire, would have thus easily, and that directly given the
Electoral office annexed to the Crown of Bohemia, to the free election of the
Estates of Bohemia, and so attributed the same to an uncertain Family.

But this imaginary objection has as little ground and strength, as may be
found in this which would persuade us that the free Election of the three
Cathedral Chapters, of Mogunce, Colen, and Triers, of their Archbishops and
Electors of the Empire, is not granted unto them simply, but is restrained to
some certain Houses and Families: Whereas much the more it is to be presumed,
that, because and whilst, according to the Go^den Bull, the other three temporal
Electorates and Fees masculine, cannot hereditarily descend upon the daughters,
but unto the sons only, and to the nearest kinsmen of the fathers side; so
in like manner the Estates of Bohemia, after the Crown of Bohemia has bin
made an Electorate, should elect no woman to be their Queen, and so an
Electrize of the Empire; as also the aforesaid three Spiritual Chapters use
not to choose women to be their Archbishops, and Electors of the Empire.

And surely it is a thing very new, nay heretofore never heard of in the holy
Empire, that men should so much have endeavored to appropriate the Electorate
of Bohemia, as well to women as to men, and that by a feigned and never as yet
proved right of Inheritance; yea, that the claim of Inheritance, pretended by
his Imperial Majesty, will needs and principally be deduced from a Woman,
to wit, from Anna, wife to Ferdinand the first, Emperor. Forasmuch, as long as
the Electorall College has been, never woman wore the Electorall office.

And it would be a thing unaccustomed and strange, if a woman should be either
received or intruded into the Electorall College, considering that a woman is
not only incapable thereof by reason of the quality of that Sex, as being
unable to accomplish the warlike service due of such Fee of the Empire to the
Empire; but also that it would be resembling more a Stage Play, then be
convenient to the gravity of an Electorall College, if a woman at the
election of a Roman Emperor, should sit in the midst of the spiritual and
temporal Electors, should moreover ride together with and amongst them, should
perform the Electorall office, should bear the Electorall sword.

Whereupon then now, and to conclude, it is left to the wise consideration of
the whole impartial World, but especially of the most illustrious Electors,
Princes, and Estates of the Empire, to judge, whether it would be just and
lawful, and not rather contrary and repugnant to God, and to the liberty of
the Electors, Princes, and Estates, if it should fall out that his Imperial
Majesty should, as well in this present case, as in other of the like nature,
(where nothing at all is attempted nor meddled against and with the holy Empire,
nor any orderly and lawful cognition had) defend and maintain his private
pretense and interest (the which by arms he has defended ere and before he
attained to the Empire) by way of obtained Imperial authority, and that
against so chief an Elector of the Empire; should in causa propria press
forward with Imperial power, should raise dangerous war, not only in
Bohemia, the pretense whereof is controuerted, but in the very midst of the
holy Empire, and that by Spanish servants, evil affecting the German Nation;
should be both party and Judge, should as elected Roman Emperor adiudge to
himself such pretended Austriacall right, should condemn the contrary part
and that unheard, should put forth and execute the threatened process of
proscription, and that under the name of Imperial Sovereignty: but for
private commodity, should by such extremes expose to uttermost danger of
total ruin (which God forbid) the whole Roman Empire our native Country, and
that all contrary unto that by corporal oath ratified Imperial Capitulation.

Thus now (courteous Reader) have thou here a short Answer to the proposed
Question; Consider the same well, and desire God to assist the right. Farewell.

An Extract taken out of the Act made at the Diet at Worms, in the year
1548: Concerning the Kingdom of Bohemia.
THe Royal Majesty of Bohemia, has betimes and before this been put in
mind by his ordained Council of the Division, how that the King of Bohemia
has been found in the last Contribution-Roll at Worms, and that therefore
the intent of the general Assembly of the Division, is, to put his Royal
Majesty (as being King of Bohemia and Elector) likewise into the new Roll,
and to assign him his portion of Contribution, for those Lands which his
Majesty holds from the Empire, as King of Bohemia, so as the said Council
has done already in the reformed Contribution-Rolle.

But because this their motion and intent has been altogether strange to his
Royal Majesty, by reason that his Majesty heretofore never heard nor knew
any thing of it; his Royal Majesty has deferred the matter (for want of
sufficient present instruction) until his happy return into the Crown of
Bohemia, where, after most diligent search and inquiry made, he could find out
or know nothing else, but that the Estates of the Crown of Bohemia, knew of no
contribution to the Empire; and say plainly, that neither the alleged Rolls
of Worms, nor the ancienter, has been made with will and consent of his
Royal Majesty's renowned Predecessors, Kings of Bohemia; and that they were
never liable to any aid, nor never gave aid; and, in a word, that they owe
none.

Neither can his Royal Majesty call to mind, that ever he was burdened with
any Contribution, or demanded any aid; much less paid or performed any,
notwithstanding not a few Contributions and aids to and for the Empire, have
been made and agreed upon by the Empire; Whereas, moreover, the King of
Bohemia is never summoned to appear or to be present at the general Diet of
the Empire, and has neither place nor voice in the Council of the Empire.

Besides this, whilst the Contributions to the Empire have hitherto been laid
only and alone upon those Estates which are contained and particularly set
down in the ten Divisions. But the Crown of Bohemia being found in no
Division at all, the general Estates of the Empire may easily perceive and
know that that Crown has heretofore never contributed with the Empire, and
can therefore not be but wrongfully put into the Roll of Contribution.

Neither do the Contributions of the Empire concern but only the Estates of
the Empire of the German Nation, which rest under the defense and protection
of the holy Empire, and use the peace and Laws of it.

And though his Royal Majesty, as King of Bohemia, holds of the holy Empire
certain Countries and Dominions that use the German Language, yet have the
said Countries and Dominions, from the Roman Empire, neither defense nor
protection, nor peace nor Law, but are from ancient times severed from the
Empire of the Germane Nation, into a particular Realm and Nation, and are not
incorporate to it, and therefore not subject unto the burdens, aids, and
Contributions of the Empire of the German Nation.

And though many Strangers, and outlandish Potentates, hold of the Imperial
Majesty and the holy Empire, many renowned Countries and Dominions, yet are
they never burdened, or subject, with or to any Contributions and Aids to the
Empire of the Germane Nation.

Whilst then, now out of this it appears, that the King of Bohemia is not
bound to the Contributions of the Empire, but wrongfully and by mere error,
put into the Contribution-Rolle of Worms, or perhaps into others more ancient,
as his Royal Majesty, as King of Bohemia, does assure himself considently,
and hopes that the general Estates of the Empire will desist from their intent
and demand, and burden his Majesty no more, then were his Predecessors,
Kings of Bohemia. And if his royal Majesty, as King of Bohemia, and Elector,
can do or show any assistance to the holy Empire, or else to the Estates of
the German Nation, as well in general as in particular, for the profit and
common welfare, whether it be out of duty, or out of good will or friendship,
his Royal Majesty offers himself hereby most willingly and friendly
thereto: giving likewise hereby notice unto the general Estates, That as
hitherto the Estates of his Royal Crown of Bohemia, have showed themselves
most obedient, ready, and forward in all occasions of any necessities against
the Infidels, so now and hereafter they will not want to perform the same at
the utmost of their power.

FINIS.
