TO THE RIGHT REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, AND MY VERY GOOD LORD, JOHN KING BY the
Divine providence L. Bishop of London, S. B. wishes all grace and happiness.
RIGHT REVEREND, AND HONORABLE,
I Have adventured this second time to commend my poor labors to your
Honorable protection. My former were involued in a few paper leaves. In
presenting them to your Lordship, I seemed not much unlike the Samian Poet,
Choerilus, who presumed to offer to great ALEXANDER a few harsh verses. Your
then favorable acceptance of that little Sermon, has emboldned this larger
volume to press into your L. presence. It contains country Sermons. They
intend principally the reformation of ma^ners, in such, as desire to live a
godly life in this present world. This is the mite, which for this time I cast
into Gods treasury. If I have done it with your Honors good liking, I shall
the less regard, what bitter tongues shall say. Censurers I will not heed. I
know whose liveries they walk in. It must be an admirable piece of work, that
shall have their approbation. Against such I oppose a wall of brass: What I
do, I do it only to discharge some little part of that duty, which I owe
unto Gods people through my Ministry. I may not longer detain your Lordship.
God Almighty so bless your government in his Church among us, that the bounds
of the Gospel of CHRIST may be enlarged, that faithful Pastors may be
comforted, that the enemies of true religion may be suppressed, that the glory
of God in all may be advanced.

YOUR HONOVRES in all duty, and service, to be commanded, SEBASTIAN BENEFIELD.

The Preface to the Christian Reader.
GENTLE READER,
These sermons were provided for the Pulpit, not intended for the Press. Yet,
since I live in a prodigal age of the world, wherein too many with their
unprofitable, if not obscene, Pamphlets, do run Ad prelum tanquam praelium.
to the Press, as a horse to the battle, and are entertained with applause; I
have the more willingly now published them to thy view. Thou will say: There is
already great store of Sermons abroad; more, then we can well use. I deny it
not. Yet, to the fullness of this Sea, I add more; and repent not. Is
abundance a burden to thee? If thy soul may be fed with variety, as well by
the eye, as by the ear, have thou any reason to find fault? But weak
stomachs may surfeit at the sight of too much. Let such, favor their
eie-sight. They may easily look of, and please themselves with their old
choice. There is no reason, that their daintiness should prejudice that
profit, which others might reap from this abundance. We that are called to be
laborers in the Lords harvest, must resolve with the LORD of the Harvest. His
resolution was, Ioh. 9.4.
I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night
comes, when no man can work. Our day is our life time; the only time for us
to work in. If now, in this our day time, we will instead of working, only
treasure up knowledge in our hearts, as that horder in the Cap. 11.26
Proverbs did his corn, in his storehouse; or will wrap up the gifts,
wherewith God has blessed us, in wast papers, as the slothful servant in the
Luke 19.20.
Gospel did his talent, in a napkin; the night will come upon us, and we shall
not work. Suffer us therefore, while it is our day, to work. Our work
consists in the preaching of the Gospel. The Gospel is preached as well

by writing, as by speaking; as well by pen, as by tongue. The word spoken for
the time is most piercing, but the letter written is of most continuance. I
shall account it my happiness, if I may do good both ways. My place in that
worthy Foundation, whereof I am an unworthy member, wearing me out in the
reading of HVMANITIE, now the fourteenth year, has hindered me from doing
that good, I wished to have done, the one way, by my speaking, by my tongue. If
the other way, by my writing, by my pen, I may redeem the time past, and by
these my poor labors may do some good, not only to The inhabitants of MEIS

them, among whom I first sowed this seed, but also to other Congregations of
my Country, I have enough. If ( dear CHRISTIAN) thou find in these my Sermons
the same things iterated, marvel not thereat; I have my Prophets warrant for
it. He in this first chapter repeateth the same things five times over. May not
I after his ensample do it once, or twice? I must profess unto thee, ( good
CHRISTIAN) that my chief intent in this Commentary, is the destruction of
sin. If to any of the learned, J seem to have failed of my purpose, my
earnest desire is, that they will be pleased to take the pains to amend it.
The rest, who to this poor labor of mine shall afford their gracious, and
favorable good liking, I heartily entreat to help me with their godly prayers,
that this work, and whatsoever else of like kind I shall hereafter attempt to
publish to the censure of the world, may wholly redound to the glory of God, and
good of his Church. Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our
Lord JESUS, that great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the
everlasting covenant, sanctify thee throughout, that enjoying the peace of thy
conscience in this world, thou may hereafter have full fruition of that
eternal peace of God in Heaven.

Thine unfeignedly in the Lord, for thy good, S. B.

THE FIRST LECTVRE.
AMOS chap. 1. ver. 1. The words of Amos, who was among the heardmen at Tokoa,
which he saw upon Israel, in the days of Vzziah King of Judah and in the days
of Jeroboam the son of Ioash King of Israel, two years before the earthquake.


ONE of the Pharisees in the gospel, as if he were unwilling to be ignorant in
so weighty a matter, as is man's salvation, in a tempting manner asked Christ
this question: Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? Our Savior
for answer put forth another question, and said, what is written in the law,
how read thou? Luke 10.26. Where we may note that the law is written for man
to read, that so he may be instructed, what he is to do in discharge of his
duty toward God.

The rich man in Hell, prayed Abraham, that Lazarus might be sent unto his
fathers house, to testify unto his five brethren, lest they also should come
into that place of torment. To whom Abraham answered, They have Moses and the
Prophets, let them hear them. Luke 16.29. The parable teaches us thus much,
that unless we delight in hearing the word preached, we shall never attain to
the means of escaping eternal torments. Two notable uses of the word of God,
Reading, and hearing; They lead man as it were by the hand to the very point of
his felicity. For what more blessed then to possess eternal life? Yet (...)
the Pharisee taught, that by reading of the law life eternal might ^ee
purchased. And is it not a blessed thing to be freed from Hell torments? Yet
was the rich man told by Abraham, that his five brethren by hearing of Moses
and the Prophets, might be saved.

It was a settled opinion of Deuteronomy. 8.3.
old, though uttered in fulness of time by our Mat. 4.4. Luc. 4.4.
Savior, that a man lives not by bread only, but by every word, that
proceeds out of the mouth of God. The truth of which is confirmed by the
practice of Godly men in former ages. I will no^ trouble you with many
instances. Many and excellent wor^ the revelations which God gave unto the
Prophet David, yet notwithstanding all them, as himself witnesses cap. 9.2.
he omitted not the reading of the prophecy of Jeremy. Much doubtless for the
spiritual food of his own soul: yet for our ensample also, that we should be
conversant in the scriptures too. It was a worthy commendation which Luke gave
the Romans, Act. 17.11. for that as soon as they had heard the word preached
by S. Paul, they diligently conferred the scriptures, to know whether it were
so, or no; and thereby confirmed themselves in the truth, which they had heard.
This their zeal, and diligence, should stir us up also, for the confirmation
of our faith upon the hearing of the word, to search the scriptures. That great
heathen Lord, Queen Candaces Eunuch, as he was riding on the high way in his
chariot, did read the prophet Esaias, and the Lord of heaven had regard unto him
for it. Act. 8.28. So. Daniel by reading, the Beroeans, and the Eunuch by
reading, and hearing of the word, were spirituallie f^d, and nourished unto
everlasting life.

To these holy exercises both of reading and hearing the scriptures, the
scriptures are full of exhortations, fit for all estates: for VN^RL^^^ERS; that
they would search the scriptures, because in th^^ they think to have eternal
life, and they do testify of Christ, John. 5.39. for BELIEVERS; that besides
other parts of their spiritual armor, they would take unto the^ the sword of
the spirit, which is the word of God. Ephesians. 6.17. for YOUNG MEN; that they
would rule themselves after the word of God, and so cleanse their ways. Psalm.
119.9. for ALL MEN, that they would meditate in the law of God day and night.
Psalm. 1.2.

Now, that the scriptures, the sword of the spirit, the word and law of God
might be much used to the dividing asunder of the soul and the spirit, of
ioints and marrow, it was decreed in a Nirena Synodus decretis suis tavit ne

The much preaching and often reading of Gods holy word in the congregations of
this land in the days of her, whom of late you loved, Queen ELIZABETH, have
set up, and established her never dying praises. And is not God much to be
blessed for our good Josiah, our most dread sovereign, King JAMES? His heart
is from above replenished with a religious zeal to free the passage of Gods
most holy Gospel. His desire to have God sincerely worshipped throughout this
land, is made known by the good order he has taken to set before you, and al
other his liege people, Gods word, if possible, in greatest purity. Let God be
with the workme^, I mean, the tra^slators of the old and new testaments; This
sermon was preached in the year of our Lord 1605. Nov. 3. Since: the
Translation is perfected and published, the exactest that ever this Land had.
Let God be with them in their holy labors; and let the remembrance of our
King for it, be like the composition of the perfume that is made by the art of
the Apothecarie.

Hitherto (beloved) I have by way of preface exhorted you to the reading and
hearing of Gods word; and I doubt not of your obedience to it. Yet if any of
you shall except against the reading of it for the hardness of the phrase,
being of the Eunuchs mind, Act. 8.31. that you cannot understand what you
read, except you have a guide; let it be your comfort, that his Majesty in
giving his royal assent to those laudable Canons, and Constitutions
Ecclesiastical, a greed upon in the late Begun at London. Anno Do. 1603.
Synod at London, has by the 45. and 46. canons, provided guides for you,
such, as are soberly, and sincerely to divide the word of truth to the glory
of God, and the best edification of his people.

And now it being my lot to be sent unto you, to you I bring an inestimable
pearl, the word of the Lord, which the Prophet Amos saw upon Israel. In
dividing it, I promise you in the words of Paul. 2. Cor. 12.19. by the help of
God, to do all things for your edifying. Wherefore (beloved) give ear I
beseech you, with reverent regard and attention to the word of the Lord as it
is written, Amos, 1.1. The words of Amos, who was among the heardmen at Tekoa,
which he saw upon Israel, in the days of Vzziah King of Judah, and in the
days of Jeroboam the son of Ioash King of Israel, two years before the
earthquake. This first verse we may call the title of this book, or the
preface unto it. It yields to our considerations sundry circumstances.

Amos] Epiphanius in his book of the lives and deaths of the Prophets,
holds this Amos to be Esays father. To which opinion a learned and late
Divine Prolog. in 12. proph. n^n.
Danaeus seems to give his assent. But St Hierome is against it; and so are
most interpreters; So also is Drusius in his sacred observations lib. 4. cap.
21. And worthily. For as much as the Hebrew writing of these two names, (...)
the name of ESAYS father, and (...)
this our Prophets name, is evidence and proof sufficient, that they were not
one, but two names: and consequently not one, but two men. Again Amos the
father of Esaias is, by interpretation fortis, and Hieronym. Nic. de Lyra.
robustus, stout and valiant, but Amos our prophet is Hieron. ep. ad Paulin.
Onustus, a man burdened, and laden; or Hier. Lyran
avulsus, one that is separated from others. These diverse interpretations of
these two names, the name of Esays father, and this our Prophets name, is
evidence and proof sufficient, that they were not one, but two names, and
consequently not one, but two men. Besides Amos our Prophet is in the ancient
monuments of the Hebrews surnamed (...), id est, balbus
a stutterer, stammerer, or maffler as Drusius notes upon my text. We find not
any such surname given to Esays father. Therefore our Amos, is not Amos the
father of Esaias. From our Prophets name let us come to his condition of life,
and vocation, expressed by himself in these words. Who was among the heardmen.

There are two sorts of heardmen: the one is of such, as do use the feat and
trade of graziers, or are sheep-masters; such as have under them in pay other
heardmen, and shepherds. In this sense Mesa King of Moab. 2. King. 3.4. is
called a heardman, or shepherd; and is registered to have rendered to the King
of Israel an hundred thousand lamb and an hundred thousand rams, with the
wool. The other sort of heardmen, is of such as are hired to keep^ cattle, a^
s^e to their feeding, and safety: such we properly cal^ ^^ardm^n, (...)
shepherds, and such a one was Amos our Prophet: witness himself cap. 7.14. I
was no Prophet, neither was I a Prophets son, but I was a heardman, or
shepherd. You see now his former condition of life, profession and vocation,
see also the place where he lived.

At Tekoa] this town Lib de vit. Prophet.
Epiphanius ascribes to the land of Zabul^n: Apud Mercerum.
R. David to the inheritance of the sons of Aser: but St Hierome (whom with
the rest of the expositors of this book. I choose to follow) places it in the
tribe of Iudae, six miles southward from Bethlehem. Adrach^m in his description
of the holy land says it is two miles from Bethlehem. More or less; its not
much pertinent to my present occasion. For the place it self: Tekoa is 2.
Chron. 12.6. rehearsed among al those strong Cities which Rehoboam built in
Judah. Beyond the City Tekoa (as St Hieromae observes) there was not any little
village, no not so much as a cottage; only there was a great wilderness,
called 2. Chron. 20.20. the wilderness of Tekoa; a fit place for a shepherds
walk. Here Amos for a time led a shepherds life. At length God separated him
to carry his word against Israel. Which is the fourth circumstance of this
verse, the matter or argument of this prophecy, implied in these words.

The words of Amos which he saw upon Israel.] The Hebrew manner is to call
sermons, words, as Ierem. 1.1. The words of Jeremy. And Eccles. 1.1. The words
of the preacher. And Haggei 1.12. The words of Haggei. And Luke 3.4. The words
of Esaias. By these words we understand sermons; the sermons of Jeremy,
Ecclesiastes, Haggei, and Esaias. So here the words of Amos, are the sermons of
Amos.

Which he saw] this adiectio^ shows that these words of Amos were committed
to him, by that kind of prophetical instinct, and motion, which is termed
vision, as Aria^ Montanus observes in his common disputes of the prophetical
books. Indeed vision is one of the kinds of prophecy: In which regard (as
Saul's servant bears witness. 1 Samuel 9.9.) Prophets were in the old time
called seers. Well then does Drusius expound this place; The words which Amos
saw] that is, the words which God did disclose or reveal unto Amos in a
vision. These words which Amos saw;] this vision, or prophecy, was concerning.
Israel, upon, or against Israel.]

Upon Israel] Israel was a common name to the 12. tribes which issued out of
Jacobs loins; and was so from the beginning of Saul's reign to the end of
Salomons. After whose death a rent was made in the kingdom. Jeroboam son of
Nebat seduced 10 tribes. Rhehoboam Salomons son could keep with him but two.
Thus of one kingdom; Israel; were made two: Judah and Israel. A strange
division. Israel divided from Israel: ten tribes from the other two. Two
tribes, the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, continued in their obedience to the
house of David* the other ten forsook it, and fell away. The two tribes, Judah
and Benjamin (called but one tribe. 1. King. 11.13. because of the mixture of
their possessions) these two tribes, settled in their faithfulness and
obedience to the seed of David, are in holy scripture called sometimes Amos.
2.4.
Judah, sometimes Ierem ^ 1.
Benjamin, sometimes Micah. 1.1.
Jerusalem, sometimes Amos 6.1.
Sion, sometimes Zach. 12.7.
the house of David. The other ten tribes which fell away from, and forsook
their rightful King, and holy religion, have in like sort their diverse
appellations: Hos. 10.15.
Bethel, Hos. 10.5.
Bethaven, Micah 1.1.
Samaria, Hos. 2.22.
Iesreel, Amos 5.6.
Joseph, Hos. 4.17.
Ephraim, Hos 10.11.
Jacob, Hos. 10.11.
Israel. These are the names in the sanctified writings of the holy prophets
appropriate to signify the 10. revolted tribes. Israel you see is one of them;
and that is the Israel in my text. Thus was Amos by the holy spirit deputed,
and directed with his message peculiarly, and properly, to the kingdom of the
10. revolted tribes; the kingdom of Israel. Some mention is made of Judah
incidently, and by the way; but the scope of the prophecy is Israel. The time,
which was my last circumstcan^, follows.

In the days of Vzziah King of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam the son of
Ioash King of Israel. The time is she down in general, and in particular.
First in general, thus.

In the days of Vzziah etc:] Vzziah or Ozias called also, Azarias. 2. King.
14.21. succeeded his father Amazias in the throne of Judah. This he did in the
17th year of the reign of Jeroboam in Israel, as appears 2. King. 15.1.
That same Jeroboam, (that you may distinguish him from a former King of the
same name) is called in my text Jeroboam the son of Ioash. Hereby we see in
general the time of his prophecy; which is more particularly set down in the
last words two year before the earthquake.] He means that same notable and
famous earthquake mentioned also Zach. 14.^5. Ye shall fly (says he) like as
ye fled from the earthquake in the days of Vzziah King of Judah. In what year
of Vzziahs reign this earthqu^ke happened, it is not to be collected out of
holy scripture Flavius Josephus Lib. 9. antiq. Iudaic. cap. 11. says that this
earthquake happened then when King Vzziah usurping the Priests office went into
the temple of the Lord to burn incense. Ribera disproue^ Josephus his
judgment; and says that the earthquake happened within the fourteenth year
of the reign of Vzziah. Some do hold it was in the 22th year; And the
Hebrews (whom Fun^cius follows in his Chronology) do ascribe it to the 25.
year. For my part I say not in what year it happened. Why should I speak
where the holy spirit is silent? It is out of doubt that there was such an
earthquake, in the days of Vzziah, witness the Prophet Zachary: two years
after Amos had begun his prophetical function; witness Amos here in my text.

Thus (dearly beloved in the Lord) have I briefly run over the exposition of
this first verse, let me now upon it build some doctrine, for the building up
of our selves in our holy faith. you will be pleased to remember with me,
that Amos of a heardmen or a shepherd became a blessed Prophet to carry a
terrible word, and fearful message from the living God, to the King, Nobles,
Priests, and people of Israel. The doctrine to be grounded hereupon, I deliver
in this proposition; God chooses vile and despised persons, to confound the
great and mighty.

Vile, and despised persons, I call such, as to the world, to humane wisdom,
and to the eye of reason are of no price, esteem, or worth. Such as Joseph
was, when he kept sheep in Canaan with his brethren, and was by them sold to
the Ismaelites. Genesis 37.2, 27. Such as Moses was, when first he was cast into
the flags Exodus 2.1. Such as David was while he meddled with sheepfolds, and
followed the ewes great with young. Psalm. 78.70. Such as were Peter, Andrew,
James, and John while they busied themselves about mending of nets, and
catching of fish Matthew. 4.18, 21. These, Joseph, Moses, and David, shepherds,
Peter, Andrew, James, and John, fishermen, vile and despised in the account of
the world, were chosen by the wisdom of the great God of heaven, one to be a
ruler in Egypt; another to be a leader of Gods people, the third to be a King;
the rest to be Christ's Apostles.

Hear now a word of eternal verity and full of comfort. You shall find it
Psalm. 113.7, 8. The Lord who is high above al nations, and glorious above the
heavens, he raises the needy out of the dust, and lifts up the poor out of
the dung, to set him with Princes. St Paul's discourse touching this point is
more large and spacious. You shall find it 1. Cor. 1.27, 28. God has chosen
the foolish things of this world to confound the wise, and the weak things to
confound the strong, and vile things, and things despised, and things which are
not, to bring to naught the things that are. The reason of Gods dealing thus in
the advancement of the foolish, weak, vile, despised, needy and poor to
places of dignity, is expressed 1. Cor. 1.29. It is, that no flesh should
rejoice in his presence, that is, that no man should glory before the Lord. In
this reason are two things, worthy our religious considerations, as Musculus
well observes. For hereby our God, first suppresseth and beats down the
pride of flesh, and takes from it all glory of wisdom, power and nobility;
and secondly, whatsoever glory there is of wisdom, power and nobility, he
does claim and challenge it for his own peculiar. Thus have you (dearly
beloved) the confirmation of my doctrine. The doctrine was: God chooses vile
and despised persons, to confound the great and mighty.

Be patient, I beseech you, while I point at some uses of it.

The first use is, to lift up our minds to the contemplation of Gods good
providence. Poor shepherds and fishermen God exalts and advances into the
highest places of dignity in Church and commonwealth. Hereby we know that
neither Empire, nor Kingdom, nor place in them of dignity, prioritie, or
preeminence, Ecclesiastical or politic, is gotten by the industry,
wisdom, wit, or strength of man: but that all are administered, ruled, and
governed by the deputation and ordination of the highest power, God almighty.

A second use is to stop blasphemous mouths, such as are evermore open against
heaven, with Cic. de not. Deor.
Epicurus, and Cic. ibid.
Diagoras, and their adherents, to affirm that the God of heaven, in as much
as he is absolutely blessed, is not to trouble himself with cares for this
lower world: that it stands not with Gods majesty to care for the vile,
abject, and despised things of this world. This impious rabble, and Satan's
brood, do think that all things below the moon are ruled by their blind
Goddess Fortune and by Chance.

Here must I beseech you, to let your hearts be joined with mine in the
consideration of God his sweet, and never sleeping care and providence over
this lower world.

Let us not suppose our God, to be a God to halfes and in part only; a God
above, and not beneath the moon: a God upon the mountains, and not in the
valleys; a God in the greater and not in the lesser employments. The holy
scriptures do teach us, that our God examineth the lest moments and titles in
the world, that we can imagine, to a 1 King. 17.14.
handful of meal; to a Ibid.
cruse of oil in a poor widows house, to the falling of Matthew. 10.29.
sparrows to the ground, to the Matthew. 6.26.
feeding of the birds of the air, to the Psalm. 29.9.
calving of hinds: to the Matthew. 6.30
clothing of the grass of the field; to the Luke 12 7.
numbering of the hairs of four heads: to the trickling of Psalm. 56.8.
tears down our cheeks. Why then are we troubled with the vain conceits of
luck, fortune, or chance? Why will any man say? this fell unto me by good
luck, or by ill luck? by good fortune, or by misfortune? by good chance, or
by mischance?

We may and should know, that in the course of Gods providence all things are
determined and regular. This is a sure ground: we may build upon it.

The fish that came to devour Jonas, may seem to have arrived in that place by
chance; yet the scripture says, the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow
Jonas, Ion. 1.17.

The storm it self which drove the pilots to this straight, may likewise
seem contingent to the glimse of carnal eyes; yet the prophet says, I know
that for my sake this great tempest is upon you. Ion. 1.12.

The fish which Peter took might seem to have come to the angle by chance,
yet he brought in his mouth the tribute which Peter paid for his Lord and for
himself. Mat. 17.27.

By the diversity of the opinions among the brethren touching the manner of
dispatching Joseph out of the way, we may gather, that the selling of him into
Egypt, was but accidental, and only agreed; upon by reason of the fit arrival
of the mercha^ts while they were disputing and debating what they were best to
do: yet says Joseph unto his brethren: you sent me not hither, but God. Genesis
45.8.

What may seem more contingent in our eyes, then by the glancing of an arrow
from the common mark, to strike a travailer that passes by the way: yet God
himself is said to have delivered the man into the hand of the shooter, Exodus
21.13.

Some may think it hard fortune, that Achab was so strangely made away, because
a certain man having bent his bow, and let slip his arrow at hap hazard,
without aim at any certain mark, 1. King 22.34.
struck the King: but here we find no luck, nor chance at all, otherwise,
then in respect of us, for that the shooter did no more, then was denounced to
the King by Micheas from Gods own mouth before the battle was begun, 1.
King. 22.17.

What in the world can be more casual then lottery? yet Solomon teaches that
when the lots are cast into the lap, the providence of God disposes them,
Prove. 16.33.

See now, and acknowledge with me the large extent of Gods good providence.
Though his dwelling be on high, yet abaseth he himself to behold us below.
From his good providence it is, that this day we are here met together, I to
preach the word of God, you to hear it, and some of us to be made partakers of
the blessed body and blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Let us pour
out our souls in thankfulness before God for this his blessing.

You are now invited to the marriage supper of the lamb, every one that will
approach unto it let him put on his wedding garment. A garment nothing like the
old rags of the Gibeonites which deceived Joshua, Ios. 9.5. A garment,
nothing like the suit of apparel which Micah gave once a year to his Levite,
Iud. 17.10. A garment nothing like the soft clothing worn in kings courts.
Mat. 11.8. But a garment something like the garment of the high Priest, which
had all the names of the tribes of Israel written upon his breast, Exodus 28.21.
For this your garment is nothing else but Christ put on, in whose breast and
book of merits are written and registered all the names of the faithful: but a
garment something like Elias Mantle which divided the waters, 2. King. 2.8. For
this your garment is nothing else but Christ put on, who devideth your sins
and punishments, that so you may escape from your enemies, sin and death: but a
garment something like the garments of the Israelites in the wilderness, which
did not wear: 40 years together they wandered in the desert, and yet says
Moses, neither their clothes nor their shoes waxed old, Deuteronomy. 29.5. For this
your garment is nothing else but Christ put on, whose righteousness lasts for
ever, and his mercies cannot be worn out.

Having put on this your wedding garment, doubt not of your welcome to this
great feast maker. If any that hears me this day has not yet put on his
wedding garment, but is desirous to learn how to do it; let him, following S.
Paul his counsel, Romans 13.12. cast away the works of darkness, and put on the
armor of light: let him walk honestly as in the day, not in gluttony and
drunkenness, neither in chambering, and wantonness, nor in strife and
envying: let him take no thought for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts of it: so
shall he put on the Lord Jesus.

Psalm. 24.7.
Lift up your heads you gates and be you lift up, ye everlasting doors, that a
guest so richly apparelled may come in, and sup with the King of glory. And the
king of glory vouchsafe so to cloth us all, that those gates and everlasting
doors may lie open to us all. So at our departure from this valley of mourning,
we shall have free and easy passage in the city of God, where our corruptible
shall put on incorruption and our mortality shall be swallowed up of life.
Even so be it, (blessed father) for thy welbeloved son Jesus Christ his sake,
to who^ with thee in the unity of the holy spirit be all praise and power
might and Majesty, dignity and dominion for evermore.

Amen.
THE SECOND LECTVRE.
AMOS 1.2. And he said: The Lord shall roar from Sion, and utter his voice
from Jerusalem, and the dwelling places of the shepherds shall perish, and the
^op of Carmel shall wither.


IN my former Sermon upon the first verse of this chapter (beloved in the Lord)
I commended to your religious considerations five circumstances.

1 Touching the prophets name. It was Amos, not Amos Es^^^ father, but another
Amos. 2 Concerning his former condition of life. He was among the heardmen:
that is, he was a heardman or shepherd. 3 Of the place of his usual abode:
At Tekoa; a little village in the confines of the kingdom of Judah, beyond which
there was not so much as a little cottage: only there was a great wilderness,
called 2. Chr. 20.20. the wilderness of Tekoa: a fit place for a shepherds
walk. 4 About the matter or argument of this prophecy, employed in these
worder: The words which he saw upon Israel. Then you heard that Amos was by the
holy spirit deputed and directed with his message peculiarly, and properly to
the 10. revolted tribes, the kingdom of Israel. 5 Of the time of the
prophecy, which I told you, was set down in that verse generally and
specially. 1 Generally; In the days of Vzziah king of Judah, and in the days
of Jeroboam the son of Ioash king of Israel. 2 Specially: Two years before
the earthquake.

After my exposition given upon those five parts of that text, I recald to your
remembrances, that Amos of a heardman, or shepherd, became a blessed prophet,
to carry a terrible word and fearful message from the living God to the king,
nobles, priests, and people of Israel. Thereupon I commended to you this
doctrine.

God chooses vile and despised persons to condemn the great and mighty. That
doctrine proved, I recommended to you the uses of it. The first was to lift up
your minds to the contemplation of Gods good providence. Poor shepherds and
fishermen God exalts and advances into the highest places of dignity in
church and common wealth. This might persuade you that neither empire nor
kingdom, nor place in the^ of dignity, priority or preeminence,
ecclesiastical or politic, is gotten by the industry, wisdom, wit, or
strength of man, but that all are administered, ruled, and governed by the
deputation, and ordination of the highest power God almighty.

The second was to stop blasphemous mouths such as are ever more open against
the God of Heaven, to affirm, that all things below the moon are ruled by
their blind Goddess fortune and by chance. Here my desire was, that your
hearts might be joined with mine in the consideration of Gods most sweet and
never sleeping care over us in this lower world: that we would not suppose our
God, to be a God to halfes and in part only, a God above and not beneath the
moon, a God in the greater and not in the lesser employments.

To this holy meditation I exhorted you, taught by the holy scriptures, that
our God examineth the lest moments, and titles in the world, that you can
imagine; to a handful of meal, to a cruse of oil in a poor widows house; to
the falling of the Sparrows to the ground; to the feeding of the birds of the
air; to the calving of Hindes; to the clothing of the grass, of the field;
to the numbering of the hairs of our heads; to the trickling of tears down
our cheeks. Thus far as Gods holy spirit assisted me, I led you the last
time. Now let it please you with patience and reverence to give ear to the
word of God as it follows, ver. 2.

And he said: The Lord shall roar from Sion, and utter his voice from
Jerusalem and the dwelling places of the shepherds shall perish and the top of
Carmel shall wither. In this verse I commend unto you two general parts: 1 A
preface to a prophecy: And he said. 2 The prophecy it self: The Lord shall
roar from Sion, etc.
In the prophecy, I must further commend unto you 3. things: 1 The Lord
speaking: He shall roar and utter forth his voice. 2 The place, from whence he
speaks: from Sion and Jerusalem. 3 The sequels of his speech. They are two; 1
Desolation to the dwelling places of the shepherds: The dwelling places of the
shepherds shall perish. 2 Sterility and barrenness to their fruitful
grounds: The top of Carmel shall wither.



The first general part, the preface to the prophecy I must first speak
unto. And he said.] He, that is, Amos: Amos the heardma^, or shepherd, whose
dwelling was at Tekoa. He said; what said he? Even the words which he saw upon
Israel, that is, he spoke the words of God committed to him, by that kind of
prophetical instinct and motion which is commonly termed vision: the words of
God, which were disclosed or reveiled unto him in a vision; Amos spoke; but his
words were Gods words.

Here (dearly beloved) we may learn whence the holy scriptures have their
sovereign authority. Their authority is from above, eve^ from the LORD,
whose name is JEHOVAH, whose Matthew. 5.34.
throne is the heaven of heavens, and the Habak. 3.15.
sea his floare to walk in, the Esai. 66.1.
earth his footstool to tread upon, who has a chair in the conscience, and
sits in the Psalm. 7.9.
heart of man, and possesses his secret reins, and divides betwixt the flesh
and the skin, and shakes his inmost powers, as the Psalm. 29.8.
thu^der shakes the wilderness of Cades.

This powerful and great JEHOVAH, God almighty, spoke in old time to our
fathers by the mouth of Moses. Exodus 4.12. and in the mouths of all his
Prophets Hebr. 1.1. Know this, says S. Peter in his second epistle 1. chap.
ver. 20. That no Prophecy in the Scripture is of any private motion. Mark his
reason verse. 21. for the Prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but
holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the holy Ghost. Hence sprang these
usual and familiar speeches in the books of the Prophets: The word of the
LORD came unto me: The LORD God has spoken: Thus says the LORD; and the like.

This LORD, who thus spoke in old time by his Prophets, did in fulness of time,
when he sent his Son to co^summate, and perfect the work of man's redemption,
speak by his blessed Evangelists, and Apostles. This appears by the faithful
promise made them, Mat. 10.19. Take no thought how, or what ye shall speak,
for it shall be given you what ye shall say. It is not ye that speak, but
the spirit of your Father that speaks in you. It must stand for truth in
dispite of all the powers of darkness, which is recorded 2. Tim. 3.16. (...);
The whole Scripture, and every parcel thereof, is given by inspiration of GOD,
and has inward witness from that Spirit, which is the author of all truth.

Hence arises this true position: Scriptura est authentica regula tum fidei,
tum vitae nostrae: The word of God, which by an excellency we call the
Scripture, is an infallible rule both of our faith, and also of our life. And
another position follows hereupon: The authority of holy Scripture is
greater, then the authority of the Church.

Our observation here may be: Since such is the worth of holy Scripture by
reason of the author of it, as that it is the perfect rule for our faith, and
life; and is of greater authority then the Church, it must be our part to take
heed unto it, to hear it, and to read it with reverence, obsequie, and
docilitie.

This worth, dignity, and excellency of holy Scripture, which is Gods holy
word, now commended unto you, yields a very harsh and unpleasant sound to
every Popishly affected ear, and may serve to condemn the Romish Church of
impiety, and sin for her neglect, and contempt of so inestimable a treasure.
How little they esteem of Gods written word, the word of life, and sole food
of our souls, the grave and learned B. Jewel. Defense of the Apology par 4.
cap. 19. and 20. 1.
Brentius in his preface upon Iacobus Andreas against Hosius, makes it plain
unto us, while he tells of the crying out against the holy Scriptures, as if
they were blind, and doubtful, and a dumb schoolmaster, and a killing writ,
and a dead letter, yea, and if it may like those reverend fathers, no better
then Aesops fables.

Now lest Brentius may be thought to charge them wrongfully, be patient I
beseech you, while I show you out of themselves, how they harp upon this This
point see touched in my Sermon upon Psalm. 21 6. page 12. etc.

A Cardinal of great name in his time, Hosius the Popes Legate, and President
of the Council of Trent in his book De expresso verbo Dei, says, Vanus est

It is but lost labor that is spent in the Scriptures: he gives this reason;
for the Scripture is a creature, and a poor kind of outward element. Citatur

In the Colloquie held at Ratisbone of late Anno 1602. between the Ministers
of the Augustane confession and Papists, when it was alleged Scripturam esse
normam fides, that Scripture is the rule of faith; it was answered by a
Jesuit, hoc esse fo^tem omnium haerese^n: that this was the fountain of all
heresy: as M. Willet makes relation in his Fo A 3. b.
answer to the libellers Introduction. It may be he means the Jesuit
Tannerus whose foul, reproachful, and dishonorable speech against the holy
Spirit, the author of holy Scripture, is set down by Hunnius in his Page 26.
historical narration of that Colloquie at Ratisbone: Nulla, nulla, nulla
vnquam fuit haeresis, quae ex sola Scriptura sufficienter refutari potuit. A
speech vehement enough. Never, never, never was there any heresy sufficiently
refuted only out of Scripture. He requires their imagined infallible authority
of their Church to be joined.

There was another Jesuit at the same Colloquie, by name Gretserus, of no
less impudency, and egregiously blasphemous. For when it was alleged that
the holy Scripture or the holy Ghost speaking in the Scripture is the highest
and the infallible judge of controversies of religion, this GRETSERVS, as one
possessed with the spirit of contradiction, vtters this proposition: Colloq.
Ratisb. per David Rungium K. 1. b.
Neque Scriptura sola, vt est verbu^ Spiritus Sancti, neque ipse Spiritus
Sanctus, vt loquitur per Scripturam, est index supremus, and infallibilis

the holy Ghost, nor the holy Ghost himself, as he speaks by the Scripture is
the supreme and infallible judge of controversies of religion. This he
undertook to prove by experience. Ecce flamus in conspectu huius iudicis (haec

Behold, says he, we stand before the face of this Judge (with that he rose
up, and took the Bible in one of his hands, and stroke it with the other) we
stand says he before the face of this Judge. See now, I am here. (I use his
own words as they are set down by David Rungeus, in his description of the
forenamed Colloquie) Ecce adsum: behold, now I am here, let the holy Spirit
judge me if he can by this Scripture: let him condemn me, if he can, by
Scripture; the holy Spirit cannot judge me by Scripture; he cannot; let him do
it if he can: he cannot condemn me by Scripture. Increpet te Deus Sath^^*
Gretser, we doubt not, but that the LORD has, or will rebuke thee.

Dearly beloved in the Lord, Scholars can tell you of Bro^tes, Steropes,
Pyracmo^, Polyphemus, and others of that rabble of Cyclops, and Giants, who
made a head, and banded themselves together to pluck Jupiter from out his
throne. Behold in this Jesuit Vene Cyclopicam audaciam, as great impudency,
as ever was seen in any Cyclops face; that a man by profession a Christian,
and among Popish Christians of the precise sect, a sanctified Jesuit, should
challenge to a single co^bat God Almighty, who would think it?

Some that were at the Colloquie at Worms An. 1557 have often remembered in
their common talk Rung. Colloq Ratisb. Q. 2 a.
a new, insolent, and unheard of assertion, maintained by the Papists; Sacram
Scripturam non esse vocem iudicis, sed materiam litis, that the holy Scripture
is not a judges voice, but rather the matter of strife and contention. It was
indeed a strange assertion, and by a consequent, striking God himself, the
author of holy Scripture. Yet you see, it is by our modern Jesuits this day
matched, forasmuch as with their impious assertions touching holy Scripture,
they do directly strike the holy Spirit.

It is an old saying ex vngue Leonem: A man may know a Lion by his claw.
Surely, let men of understanding consider the audaciousnes, impudency, and
fury of railing with which those Jesuits before named have been thoroughly
replenished, they must acknowledge and confess, that those Jesuits were guided
by the Spirit of lies, and blasphemies. You already see the readiness of
popish Doctors to tread Scripture under foot, and to do it all the disgrace
they can. Yet give me leave, I beseech you, by some instance to show the same
unto you.

The instance, which I make choice of, is Gods soveraignety over the Kings and
Kingdoms of this world. Hereof I entreated in a Sermon upon Hos. 10.7.
Kings and kingdoms are wholly, and alone, in the disposition of the Almighty.

A truth included within the general doctrine commended by S. Paul to the
Romans chap. 13.1. All powers that be, are ordained of God: acknowledged by
Elihu, Job. 34.24. God shall break the mighty, and set up other in their
steed: expressed in the prayer of Daniel, chap. 2.21. God takes away Kings,
and sets up Kings: proclaimed as in the Lords own words, Prove. 8.15, 16. By
me Kings reign, by me princes, nobles, and judges do rule. This truth has 3
branches, displaied in so many propositions by Lipsius in his In Monitis
Politicis.
politic advertisements, Lib. 1. c. 5.

1 Kings, and Kingdoms, are given by God. 2 Kings, and Kingdoms, are taken
away by God. 3 Kings, and Kingdoms, are ordered, ruled, governed by God.
All three are further made good in the infallible evidence of the written word
of God.

The first was: Regna a Deo and Reges dari. Lipsius, Monit Polit. lib. 1. c. 5.
p. 24
Kings, and Kingdoms, are given by God. Thus says the LORD of Saules
successor, 1. Sam. 16.1. I have provided me a King among the sons of Ischai:
and of the revolt of the ten tribes, in the rent of the kingdom of Israel, 1.
King. 12.24. This thing is done by me: and of the victories which
Nabuchodonosor was to get over the King of Judah, and other his neighbor
Kings; the Kings of Edom, of Moab, of the Ammonites, of Tire, of Zidon, Ier.
27.6. I have given all these lands into the hand of Nabuchodonosor the King of
Babel, my servant. It is true which we learn, Psalm. 75.6. Advancement is
neither from the East, nor from the West, nor from the wilderness. Our God is
judge; he alone advances. You see now, it is plain by holy Scripture, that
Kings, and Kingdoms, are given by God.

The second was: Regna a Deo and Reges tolli Lips. ib. page 28.
Kings, and Kingdoms are taken away by God. That Gods hand is likewise
exercised in the removal of Kings, and translation of kingdoms, its well
known, as by the aboue-cited texts of Scripture, so by divine examples, whereof
I might make a long recital* would I remember you out of Genesis 14. of the fall
of those Kings delivered into the hands of Abraham; out of Exodus 14. and 15. of
Pharaohs overthrow in the red sea; out of Dan. 4. and 5. of Nabuchadnezzar and
Belshazzar his son dispossessed of their crowns: and out of other places of
the divinely inspired word of like patterns. Its plain without any further
proof, that Kings, and Kingdoms are taken away by God.

The third was, Regna a Deo and Reges temperari. Lips. Ibid. p. 34.
Kings, and Kingdoms, are ordered, ruled, governed by God. For proof hereof I
need no more, but remember you, of that which I reco^mended to you in the
beginning of this Sermon, even of the wonderful extent of Gods care and
providence to the least and basest things in this world: as I said to a
handful of meal; to a cruse of oil in a poor widows house; to the falling
of sparrowes to the ground; to the feeding of the birds of the air; to the
calving of hinds; to the clothing of the grass of the field; to the numbering
of the hairs of our heads; to the trickling of tears down our cheeks. Shall
God care for these vile and base things? and shall he not much more order,
rule, and govern Kings, and kingdoms?

Now (beloved in the Lord) you see by the evidence of holy Scripture that
Kings, and Kingdoms are wholly and alone in the disposition of the Almighty.
Give ear I beseech you, while I show you how this doctrine, and the holy word
of God, whereon it is grounded, is in popish religion neglected, disgraced,
trodden under foot.

Romes chiefest champion, Cardinal Bellarmine in his fifth book De Romans
Pontif. cap. 7. does exempt Kings and kingdoms from the disposition of the
Lord of heaven, notwithstanding the eternal truth in the holy Scriptures. This
he does in four positions.

1. Bellarm. de Romans Pontif. lib 5. cap 7. Probatur. Tenentur Christiani non
pati super se Regem non Christanum, si ille conetur avertere populum a fide.
Princes if they go about, avertere populum a fide, to avert their people from
the faith, (the faith of the Church of Rome) then by the consent of all, they
may, and must be dispossessed of their scepters and regalities.

2. Ibid Quod si. Quod si Christiani olim non deposuerunt Neronem and
Diocletianu^ and Iulianum Apostatam, and Valentem Arianum, and similes, id fuit
quia deerant vites temporales Christianis.
If the Christians in times past deposed not Nero, Diocletian, Julian the
Apostata, Valens the Arian (and other like tyrants) id fuit, quia deerant vires
temporales Christianis, it was because they wanted power, and force, and were
not strong enough for that attempt.

3. Ibid. At non. At non tenentur Christiani, immo nec debent cum evidenti
periculo religionis tolerare Rege^ infidelem.
Christians are not bound to tolerate a king that is an infidel; (or a King
not a Papist.) Not bound to tolerate him? Nay, says Bellarmine, they must not
tolerate such a one cum evidenti periculo religionis; if the toleration of him
be an evident danger to their religion.

4. Ibid. At non.
De iure humano est, quod hunc aut illum habeamus regem: It is by the law of
man, that we have this, or that man to be our King. This last positio^ is
formerly avowed by the same author in the same book; but in the second
Chapter, with oppositio^ and disgrace to the soveraigntie of the Lord of hosts.
Quod ad primum.
Dominium no^ descendit ex iure divino, sed ex iure gentium. Kingdoms and
dominions are not by the law of God, but by the law of nations. It is an
impious, blasphemous, and atheologicall assertion.

From these positions of the great Jesuit, by a necessary inference do
follow these two conclusions.

1 That the Papists would most willingly deprive our most gracious Sovereign
of his royal throne and regalitie, if they were of force and power so to do.

2 That all subjects of this land, may stand in manifest rebellion, against
their King, because he is no Papist. Both which are summarily acknowledged by
his royal Majesty in his excellent speech the 5. of November Ann. Dom. 1605.
last: The C. 2. ^.
Romish Catholics by the grounds of their religion do maintain, that is
lawful or rather meritorious, to murder Princes or people, for quarrel of
religion. By the grounds of popish religion, it is lawful, yea meritotorious
for Papists to murder Kings, which are not Papists. You see his Majesty's
royal acknowledgement of impiety in the grounds of Romish religion. You will
not doubt of it, if you rightly esteem that same late, thrice damnable,
diabolical, and matchless plot conceived in the womb of that religion, with
a full resolution to consume at once our pious King, and this flourishing
kingdom.

You perceive now, in what contempt, and disgrace the popish faction holds
the holy Scriptures, the written word of God. The written word of God expreslie
requires obedience unto Princes, as placed in their thrones by Gods sole
authority. But the Popish religion mainteineth rebellion against Princes, as
placed in their thrones by man's sole authority. Which will you follow? the holy
word of God; or the doctrine of the Romish Church?

Beloved, remember what I told you in the beginning of this exercise; though
Amos spoke, yet his words were Gods words; remember that God is the author of
holy Scripture: and then for his sake; for the authors sake, for Gods sake, you
will be persuaded to take heed unto it, to hear it, and read it with
reverence, obsequie, and docility.

We, the branches of the same vine, that bare our predecessors, to whom by
devolution the sacred Statutes of the eternal God, the holy Scriptures are
come, must esteem of them all for D King. B. of Land. upon Ion. lect. 1. p. 2.

breath of our nostrils, pillar of our faith, anchor of our hope, ground of our
love, evidence and deeds of our future blessedness.

Behold the value, and price of the words, which Amos saw upon Israel, which
God willing, with all my diligence, and best pains, I will expound to you
hereafter, as occasion shall be ministered.

Now let us pour out our souls in thankfulness before the LORD, for that he
has been pleased this day to gather us together to be hearers of his holy
word, and partakers of the blessed Sacrament of the body and blood of our Lord
Jesus Christ, thereby to confirm our holy faith in us. We thank thee
therefore, good Father, and beseech thee more and more to feed us with the
never perishing food of thy holy word, that by it being made clean and
sanctified, we may in due time have free passage from this valley of tears to
the city of joy, Jerusalem which is above, where this corruptible shall put on
incorruption, and our mortality shall be swallowed up of life. So be it.

THE THIRD LECTVRE.
AMOS 1.2. And he said, the LORD shall roar from SION, and utter his voice
from JERUSALEM; and the dwelling places of the shepherds shall perish, and the
top of CARMEL shall wither.


Upon the preface to this prophecy [these words: and he said] my last lecture
was bestowed: wherein because whatsoever Amos, the heardman, spoke, was the
word of God, I endeavored to show forth the worth, dignity, and excellency of
the word of God, commonly called by the name of holy Scripture. A point that
yields a very harsh, and unpleasant sound to every popishly affected ear, as
then at large I made plain our of popish mouths, and practice. Order now
requires, that I go on to the next general part of this text, to the
prophecy it self. The first point therein to be recommended at this time
unto you, is the LORD speaking.

The LORD shall roar, and utter his voice] wherein I desire you to observe
with me, who it is that speaks, and how he speaks.

Who speaks? It is the Lord.

How speaks he? He roareth, and utters forth his voice.

First of him that speaks: He is in the Hebrewe text called JEHOVAH; which
is the D. King, B. of London upon Jonas Lec. 11. p. 152.

powerful name for the working of miracles, and that Christ and Moses had by it
done great wonders.

But my tongue shall never enlarge that, which my soul abhors, such
brainsick, superstitious, and blasphemous inventions. Yet this I dare avouch
before you, that there is some secret in this name. It is plain, Exodus 6.3.
There the LORD speaking unto Moses says: I appeared unto Abraham, to Isaac,
and to Jacob, by the name of a strong, omnipotent, and al sufficient God, but
by my name Jehovah, was I not known unto them. I unfold this secret. This
great name JEHOVAH; first it imports the eternity of Gods essence in
himself, that he is Heb. 23.8.
yesterday, and today, and the same for ever, Apoc. 1.8.
which was, which is, and which is to come. Again it notes the existence, and
perfection of all things in God, as from whom all creatures in the world have

him and in him, and by him are all things. And last of al it is the Memorial
of God unto al ages; as himself calls it Exodus 3.15. the memorial of his
faithfulness, his truth, and his constancy in the performance of his
promises. And therefore whenever in any of the Prophets, God promises or
threatens any great matter, to assure us of the most certain event of such
his promise, or threatening, he adds unto it his name, JEHOVAH.

In steed of this Hebrew name, JEHOVAH, the most proper name of God, the 70.
interpreters of the old Testament do every where use (...), a greek name, a
name of power, well suiting with the living, true, and only God. For he has
plenum (...). The power and authority, which he has over all things, is
sovereign, and without controlement. He that made the heavens, and spread them

be named from power, (...), the absolute LORD, ruler and commander of all
things.

This name of power, (...), fitly put for the Hebrew name JEHOVAH, commonly
rendered in our English tongue, LORD, is in the writings of the Apostles simply,
and absolutely, (if the learned have made a Zanch. de Attrib. lib. 1. c. 17.
just calculation) ascribed unto CHRIST 1000 times: and may serve for
sufficient proof of the deity of CHRIST. For it imports thus much: that
CHRIST, the Heb. 1.3.
engraved form of his Father, sitting at the right hand of the Majesty in the
highest places, is together with the Father and the Holy Ghost, the author, and
governor of al things; and in a very special manner, he is the heir of the
house of God, the mighty protector of the Church.

CHRIST, the only begotten Son of God, he is the LORD: yet so, that neither
the Father, nor the Holy Ghost are excluded from dominion. The Father is LORD,
the Holy Ghost is LORD too. For in all the works of God ad extra, (so we speak
in the schools; but to speak more understandingly to your capacities,) in all
external works, each person of the TRINITY has his operation.

Yet so that a common distinction be observed. For these external works of
God do admit a double consideration, Zanch. de Incarn. lib 2. c. 3. q. 1. These.
2.
either they are beg^n (...) the Divine persons and ended extra divivinas
personas.
in some one of them: or they are both begun and ended, (...) the Divine
persons. The works of God begun externally, and ended in some one of the
persons, what are they? They are such as was the Voice of the F^^her concerning
CHRIST. Matt. 3.17.
This is my beloved son a voice formed by all three persons, In aliqua
personarum.
yet uttered only by the Father. They are such as was that Matt. 3 16.
Dove, descending upon CHRIST at his baptism: a Dove framed by all three
persons, yet appropriate only to the Holy Ghost. They are such, as were the
body and soul of CHRIST: a body and soul created by all three persons, yet
assumed only by the son of God.

This is that obvious, and much used distinction in school divinity:
Inchoative, and terminative. I thus expound it. In these now named works of
God, the voice that was spoken unto CHRIST; the Dove that descended upon
CHRIST, the body and soul of CHRIST, We are to consider two things: their
beginning, and their end. If we respect their beginning, they are the works of
the whole Trinity, common unto all; but respect we their perfection and end,
they are no more common, but hypostaticall and personal, for so the voice is
the Fathers alone; the Dove is the Holy Ghosts alone; the reasonable soul, and
humane flesh are the Sons alone.

Besides these, there are other works of God, as begun so ended also EXTRA
PERSONAS; externally: and they are of two sorts: either supernatural, (such I
call the miraculous works of God;) or natural; such as are the creation of the
world, the preservation of the same, and the government of it. All these works
of which kind soever, whether miraculous, or works of nature, are common to
the whole TRINITY. The Father works, the Son works, and the Holy Ghost
works, as in doing of wonders; so in creating all things, in preserving all
things, in governing all things. Whereupon follows that which before I
affirmed; that as the Father is LORD, so the Son is LORD, and the Holy Ghost is
LORD also. So the LORD, whom I commended unto you for the speaker in my text,
is the Unity in Trinity, one God in three persons, God Almighty, the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost.

Before I go on, to show you, how he speaks, I must make bold upon your
patience, to tell you of some duties, necessary duties, to be performed by us
toward him, as LORD. God is the LORD, we are his servants. The duties we owe
him in this respect are three: to obey him, to serve him, to profit him.

The first duty required of us, is obedience unto God his word, laws, and
commandments. This duty whosoever performs, shall easily perform the
second duty, to wit, faithful service, with all care and diligence to do
whatsoever work it pleases God to employ him in: and shall not leave undone
the third duty, but shall do good, and be profitable unto the LORD.

All these duties were well discharged by our first parent Adam. As long as he
was invested with his roabe of innocence, he was perfectly obedient, a
faithful servant, and profitable to his LORD.

Now if it will be doubted here how a man should be profitable to God; thus I
answer. That Gods riches do consist in his glory, and therefore if his glory
be increased and enlarged, his advantage is procured. The parable of the
talents, Mat. 25.14. confirms this point. The parable is there plainly
delivered unto you. The meaning of it is; that God gives us his graces to this
end, that we should use and increase them for his adva^tage. Yea God there
compares himself to a covetous usurer, so greedy of gain, as that he
reapeth, where he sowed not, and gathers where he scatered not. By all means
he labors to gain glory to himself.

Eliphaz in the 22. chapt. of Job ver. 2.3. seems in word to thwart, and
cross this doctrine. For says he; may a man be profitable unto God? Is it any
thing to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? Or is it profitable to him,
that thou make thy ways up right? I answer, that God indeed is not so tied
to man, but that he can set forth his glory, without him, or his righteousness;
yea he can glorify himself in the unrighteousness, and destruction of man: yet
I say, that to stir up m^n to holiness, it pleases God in mercy to count
only that glory gained, which is gained by the obedience of his servants. And
therefore I say again, that Adam in the state of his innocence was perfectly
obedient, a faithful servant, and profitable to his LORD.

But alas, man once beautified with innoce^cie, with holiness, and with the
grace of God, is now spoiled of his roabes; the Queen once clothed with a
vesture of needle works wrought about with diverse colors, is now stripped of her
jewels: and the soul of man once full of grace, is now robbed of her ornaments,
and rich attire. My meaning is, that man once able to present himself spotles,
and without blame before the lamb is now fallen from that grace.

The preacher Eccl. 7.20. does assure us that there is no man just in the
earth, that does good, and sins not. So much does Solomon's question import.
Prove. 20.9. Who can say I have purged my heart? I am clean from my sin? O,
says Eliphaz unto Job cap. 15.14. What is man, that he should be clean? and
he that is borne of a woman that he should be just? Behold, (says he) God has
found no steadfastness in his Saints, yea the heavens are not clean in his
sight; how much more is man unsteadfast, how much more abominable, and filthy,
drinking iniquity like water? When the LORD looked down from heaven, to see
whether there were any child of man, that would understand, and seek God,
Psa. 14.2. could he find any one framed according to the rule of perfection,
which he requires? He could not. This he found, that all were gone out of the
way, that all were corrupt, that there was none that did good, no^ not one.

So sinful is man in his whole race: sinful in his conception: sinful in
his birth; in every deed, word, and thought wholly sinful. The actions of his
hands, the words of his lips, the motions of his heart, when they seem to be
most pure and sanctified, yet then are they as unclean things, and filthy
clouts Esaias 64.6. So that, that which is spoken of cursed Cain Genesis 4.14. may
in some sense, be applied to man in general; that for his sin he is cast
forth from the presence of God, and is now become a fugitive, and a vagabond
upon the earth.

I will not prosecute this point of man's nakedness any farther. By this which
has been spoken it appears plainly, how unfit man is, to fulfill those
good duties required of him by his LORD God. For his first duty, instead of
obedience he continually breaks the comma^dements of his God in thought,
word, and deed. For his second duty, insteede of waiting upon God to do him
service, he serves Satan, sin, and his own corrupt desires. For his third
duty, instead of bringing any advantage of glory unto God; he dishonors him
by all means, leading his life, as if there were no God.

You have seen now the miserable and wretched estate of man, by nature the
vassal, and slave of sin: with whom it fares, as it did with Pharaohs
servants, when they had sinned against their Lord. Genesis 40. You know the story,
how Pharaohs chief butler was restored to his former dignity, when as the
baker was hanged.

These two servants of Pharaoh may resemble two sorts of me^ exiled from
paradise, and from the presence of God because of their sin, to live upon the
face of the earth, as it were in a dungeon full of misery; namely the
reprobate, and the elect. For the reprobate; as they live, so they die in this
dungeon, and do die eternally, but the elect, they are pardoned, and restored
to their former dignity; and enabled by CHRIST, their redeemer, and reconciler
to God, to perform their duties to their LORD, their duties of obedience, of
faithful service, and of profitablenes; to obey the commandments of God, to
perform whatsoever service is enjoined them, and to procure advantage of glory
to their LORD.

Beloved, I doubt not, but that all we, who are now religiously assembled in
this place, are the elect of God, chosen by him in Christ Jesus Ephesians. 1.4.
before the foundation of the world, to be holy and without blame before him
in love: yet I fear me, should we enter into our own hearts, and examine our
selves, how we have walked in dutifulness toward him; our best course will
be to run unto him with a PECCAVIMVS in our mouths. LORD we have Luk 15.18.

servants.

By the first branch of ^ur duty we are required to be obedient servants, but

By the second branch of our duty we are required to be faithful servants; but

Now (dearly beloved) suffer a word of exhortation, let the remembrance of
your holy duties by you to be performed to the LORD your God be like Ecclus.

and do much fail in the performance of your holy duty.

And to keep you the better in the right way, let me plainly tell you out of
1. Cor. 6.9. and Ephesians. 5.5. That neither Idolaters, nor the covetous, nor
extortioners, nor thieves, nor adulterers, nor fornicators, nor buggerers, nor
wantons, nor drunkards, nor raylers, shall have any inheritance in the kingdom
of God. Have not some of us been such? yet to such there is ministered a word
of comfort 1. Cor. 6.11. First is our accusation, Such were some of you: then
follows our comfort, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are
justified in the name of the LORD JESUS, and by the spirit of God.

Is this true beloved? Are we washed, and sanctified, and justified, in the
name of the LORD JESUS, and by the spirit of God? why then; resolve we to
follow St Paul's advise, Phil. 4.8 Whatsoever things are true, and honest, and
just, and pure, and do pertain to love, and are of good report: if there be
any virtue, or praise, resolve we to think on these things: think we on
these things to do them, and we shall well perform our holy duties to our
LORD. Thus far of my first note touching the speaker, who speaks. Now
follows my other note; How he speaks?

He shall roar, and utter his voice] The metaphor of roaring with reference
unto God, is frequent and much used in holy Scripture. You shall find it as
here, so Ierem. 25.30. joined with the voice of the Lord: The Lord shall roar
from above, and thrust out his voice from his holy habitation. And so again
Joel. 3.16. where you have the very words of my text: The LORD shall roar out
of SION, and utter his voice from Jerusalem. You shall find it without any
mention of the Lords voice, Hos. 11.10. The LORD shall roar like a Lion: when
he shall roar, then the children of the west shall fear. You shall find it
with application, Amos 3.8. The Lion has roared; who will not be afraid? The
LORD God has spoken, who can but prophecy?

St Hierome acknowledges this metaphor to be very fit out of Amos his mouth,
for as much as it is fit for every man to use in his speech such examples, and
similitudes, as are most familiar to him in his own art, daily course, and
trade of life. Its fit for a sea faring man, to compare his heaviness to a
tempest, his loss to a shipwreck, his enemies to contrary winds: fit for a
soldier, to tell of his sword, his buckler, his coat of male, his lance, his
helmet, his musket, his wounds, his victories: sit for a husbandman to be
talking of his oxen, his kine, his sheep, his grounds. Not unfitly then does
Amos our Prophet, sometimes a shepherd, one that kept his sheep in the wast
wilderness of Tekoa, where many a time he had heard the Lions roar, compare
the terrible and dreadful voice of the living God, to the roaring of Lions.

The Lord shall roare] By this hyperbolicall form of speech the holy Spirit
convinces us of stupidity, and dullness, as unable to entertain any
admonition from God, except he speak unto us after an extraordinary manner. For
this reason, even for our dullness sake, is God here in my text compared to a
Lion.

He shall roare] The meaning of this phrase, is opened by the next words; He
shall utter his voice. It will be no lost labor to consider how God an
incorporeall, and spiritual essence, devoid of such parts of nature, by which
we are enabled to speak, may himself be said to speak, and utter a voice.
That he spoke it is well known to them, to whom the Scriptures are not
unknown. He spoke with Adam, Eve, and the serpent; with Noah; with Abraham 8
times, with Isaac, with Jacob, with Moses, and the Prophets; with CHRIST, and
the Apostles. But how he spoke, that is disputed of by the ancient and learned
Fathers.

St In cap. 7. Esai.
Basil is of opinion that the Prophets did not at all with their outward ears
hear God speaking to them; but that the word of the LORD is said to have come
unto them, because their minds were illuminated, and their understanding
enlightened by the shining of the true light in great measure, readily to
conceive what God would have revealed, and faithfully to publish it according
to the will of God.

St De Genesi ad literam lib. 11. c. 33.
Austine enquiring how God spoke with Adam and Eve writes to this purpose. It
may be, God talked with them as he talks with his Angels, by some
Intrinsecus, and inessabilibus modis.
internal and secret means, as by giving light to their minds, and
understandings: or it may be, he talked with the^ by his creature; which God
uses to do, two manner of ways: either by some vision to men in a trance: so
he talked with Peter, Act. 10. or else by presenting some shape, and semblance
to bodily senses. So God by his Angels talked with Abraham Gen 18. and with Lot
Genesis 19.

St Expos. Moral. lib 28. in cap. 38. B. Job. cap. 2.
Gregory most accurately handles this question to this sense: God speaks
two manner of ways.

1 By himself, as when he speaks to the heart by the inward inspiration of
the holy Spirit. After which sense we must understand that which we read Act.
8.29. The spirit said unto Philip; go near and join thy self to yonder
chariot: that is, Philip was inwardly moved, to draw near and join himself
to the chariot wherein the Ethiopian Eunuch sat, and read the Prophecy of
Esaias. The like words we find Act. 10.19 The spirit said unto Peter, Behold
three men seek thee: the meaning is the same: Peter was inwardly moved by the
holy Spirit to depart from Ioppa, and to go to Caesarea, to preach unto the
Gentiles to Cornelius, and his company. Where we may note thus much for our
comforts, that whenever we are inwardly moved, and do feel our hearts
touched with an earnest desire, either to make our private requests unto God,
or to come to the place of public prayer, or to hear a sermon, we may be
assured that the HOLY SPIRIT, God, by himself speaks unto us.

2 God speaks to us by his creatures Angelical, and other, and that in
diverse manners.

1 In word only as when no form is seen, but a voice only is heard: as John
12.28. when Christ prayed, Father, glorify thy name; immediately there came a
voice from heaven; I both have glorified it, and will glorify it again.

2 In deed only: as when no voice is heard, but some semblance only is objected
to the senses. S. Gregory for illustration of this second way of Gods speaking
by his creatures, brings for example the vision of Ezechiel 1.4. He saw a
whirle wind come out of the North, with a great clowd, and fire wrapped about
it, and in the midst of the fire the likeness of Amber. All this he saw; but
you hear no mention of any voice. Here was res sine verbo; a deed, but no
voice.

3 Both in word and deed; as when there is both a voice heard, and also some
sembla^ce objected to the senses: as happened unto Adam presently after his
fall: He heard the voice of the Lord walking in the garden. Genesis 3.8.

4 By shapes, presented to the inward eyes of our hearts. So Jacob in his
dream saw a ladder reach from earth to heaven. Genesis 28.12. So Peter in a
trance saw a vessel descend from heaven, Act. 10.11. So Paul in a vision saw
a man of Macedonia standing by him, Act. 16.9.

5 By shapes presented to our bodily eyes. So Abraham saw the three men that
stood by him in the plain of Mamre, Genesis 18.2. And Lot saw the two Angels,
that came to Sodom; Genesis 19.1.

6 By Celestial substances. So at Christ's baptism a Mat. 3.17.
voice was heard out of a clowd, as also at his Mat. 17.5.
transfiguration upon the mount. This is my beloved son, etc. By Celestial
substances I do here understand not only the Heavens with the works therein, but
also fire, the highest of the elements, and the Air next unto it, together
with the Winds, and Clouds.

7 By Terrestiall substances. So God to reprove the dullness of Balaam, enabled
Balaams own Ass to speak, Number. 22.28.

8 Both by Celestial and Terrestiall substances, as when God appeared unto
Moses in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. Exodus 3.2.

You see now, how God of old at sundry times, and in diverse manners did speak
to man: either by himself, or by his creatures: and by his creatures many
ways: sometimes in word, sometimes in deed, sometimes in both, word and deed;
sometimes in sleepings, sometimes in watchings; sometimes by Celestial
substances, sometimes by Terrestiall, sometimes by both, Celestial and
Terrestiall.

To make some use of this doctrine; let us consider, whether God does not now
speak unto us, as of old he did to our forefathers. We shall find that now
also he speaks unto us by himself, whenever by the inspiration of his holy
Spirit he moves our hearts to religious and pure thoughts; and also by his
creatures: sometime by fire, when he consumes our dwelling houses: sometime by
thunder, when he throws down our strong holds; sometime by heat, sometime
by drouth, sometime by noisome worms, Locusts and Caterpillars, when he takes
from us the staff of bread; sometime by plagues, when in a few months he
takes from us many thousands of our brethren; and sometime by enemies, when he
impoverisheth us by war.

All these, and whatsoever other like these, are Gods voices, and do call us to
repentance. But as when there came a voice from heaven to CHRIST, Ioh. 12.2^.
the people, that stood by and heard, would not be persuaded that it was Gods
voice; some of the^ saying that it thundered, others that an Angel spoke: so
we, howsoever God lays his hand upon us, by fire, by thunder, by famine, by
pestilence, by war, or otherwise, we will not be persuaded that God speaks
unto us; we will rather attribute these things to nature, to the heavens, to
stars and planets, to the malice of enemies, to chance, and the like.

As perverse as we are, there is a voice of God, which we cannot but
acknowledge to be his, and at this time to be directed unto us. Mention of it
is made Heb. 1.2. In these last days God has spoken to us by his son. The
gospel of Christ is the voice of God. It is the voice of God, the rule of all
instruction, the first stone to be laid in the whole building: that clowd by
day, that pillar by night, whereby all our actions are to be guided. This
gospel of CHRIST, and voice of God, calls us now to obedience.

O the crookednes of our vile natures! Our stiff necks will not bend. God
speaks unto us by his Ministers, to walk in the old way, the good way; but
we answer like them, Ier. 6.16. We will not walk therein. He speaks to us
by his watchmen, to take heed to the sound of the trumpet; but we answer like
them, Ier. 6.17. We will not take heed.

Turn us good LORD, unto thee, and we shall be turned. Good LORD open thou our
ears, that if it be thy holy will, either to Roar unto us, or to speak with
a milder voice: either to come against us in judgment, or to visit us in
mercy; we may readily hear thee, and yield obedience: and as obedient children
receive the promise of eternal inheritance. So when the time of our separation
shall be, that we must leave this world, a place of darkness, of trouble, of
vexation, of anguish, thou, LORD wilt translate us to a better place, a place
of light, where darkness shall be no more, a place of rest, where trouble
shall be no more; a place of delight, where vexatio^ shall be no more; a place
of endless and unspeakable ioies, where anguish shall be no more. There this
corruptible shall put on incorruption, and our mortality shall be swallowed up
of life. Even so be it.

THE FOVRTH LECTVRE.
AMOS 1.2. And he said, the LORD shall roar from SION, and utter his voice
from JERUSALEM; and the dwelling places of the shepherds shall perish, and the
top of CARMEL shall wither.


IN my last exercise I entreated of the Speaker. Now am I to entreat of the
places from whence he speaks; expressed in two names: Sion and Jerusalem.

The LORD shall roar from Sion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem, etc.

Sion] I read in holy Scripture of two Sions. The one is Deuteronomy. 4.48. a hill of
the Amorites, the same with Hermon. Moses there calls it (...)
Sion, by the figure Iunius in Deuteronomy. 3.9.
Syncope; the right name of it is (...)
Sirion; and so recorded Deuteronomy. 3.9. The other (...)
Sion, is the Sion in my Text; mount Sion in Judah, upon the top whereof was
another mountain Drusius observe. 14.21. Not. and Iunius in Psalm. 48.3.
Moria, upon which stood the Temple of the LORD. Before it was called the 2.
Sam. 5.7.
Tower or Fort of Sion. It was a fortress, a bulwark, a strong hold, and
place of defense for the Iebusites, the inhabitants of the land against their
enemies. Against these Iebusites King David came with a warlike power speedily
surprised their fort, built round about it; dwelt in it; and called it his The
City of DAVID.
own City, as appears 2. Sam. 5.9.

This is the city of David, so much 2. Sam. 5.7. 1. King 8.1. 1. Chron. 11 5 2 Chronicles. 5.2.
mentioned in the sacred books of Samuel, the Kings, and Chronicles. To this
his own City, mount Sion, David accompanied with the Elders, and Captains of
Israel, 2. Sam. 6.15.
brought the Ark of the LORD with shouting, with cornets, with trumpets, with
cymbals, with viols, with harpes; as is plain by the story, 1. Chron. cap.
15. and 16. Now began the holy exercises of religion duly to be observed in
this city of David mount Sion was now the place of the Name of the LORD of
hoasts.

Hitherto belongs that same excellent description, and commendation of mount
Sion, Psalm. 48.1, 2, 3. Mount Sion lying northward from Jerusalem, is fair in
situation. It is the city of the great King; the city of God; Gods holy
mountain; the joy of the whole earth. In the palaces thereof God is well
known for a sure refuge. In this city of David, the holy mount Sion, the Lord
of hoasts, whom the 1. King 8.27 2. Chron. 6.18
Heavens, and the Heaven of Heavens are not able to contain, is said to Psalm
74.2.
dwell, Psalm. 9.11. not that he is tied to any place; but because there were
the most manifest, and often testimonies of his residence; Thus is Sion taken
literally.

It is also taken spiritually, by a Synecdoche, for the Church, Spouse, and
Kingdom of Christ: as Psalm. 2.6. where God is said to have anointed his King
over Sion, the hill of his holiness. Sio^ there is not to be understood the
terrestiall Sion by Jerusalem, but another Sion; elect, and spiritual; not of
this world; holy Sion; so called for the grace of sanctification powered out
upon it, even the holy Church of Christ: whereto do appertain the holy
Patriarchs, the Prophets, the Apostles, the universal multitude of believers
throughout, not only Israel, but the whole world. Sion in this signification is
obvious in holy Scripture. To which sense by the daughters of Sion, in the
Psalm. 149.2.
Psalms of David, in Cantic. 3.11
Solomon's song, in the prophecies of Esa. 3.16.17. Esai. 4.4.
Esaias, and Joel, 2.23.
Joel, you may understand the faithful members of the Church of Christ.

There is yet one other signification of Sion. Its put for Heaven, as learned
Drusius in his notes upon my text observes. The like observation is made by
Theophylact, and Oecumenius commenting upon Heb. 12.22.

Now the Sion in my text, from whence the LORD is said to roar, to speak
terribly, and dreadfully, is, either the Temple upon mount Sion by Jerusalem:
or the Church of Christ, whereof Sion is a type; Sion the holy one of Israel,
whose walls are salvation, and gates praise: or the Heaven of Heavens, the
most proper place of Gods residence.

Ierusalem] Of old this city was called Salem, as Genesis 14.18. when
Melchisedeck, King thereof, brought forth bread and wine to refresh Abram, and
his followers. Afterward it was possessed by the Iebusites, and named Iebus,
Judge. 19.10. Peter Marty^ in 2. Sam. 5.6. from both these names Iebus and
Sale^, supposes that by the change of a few letters Jerusalem has had her
name; and not from the mountains called Solymi, as some do conjecture, but
err: for that the mountains Solymi were in Pisidia, not in Judea. Many were
the names of this city. Some of them, Benedictus in his marginall note upon
Joshua chap. 10. names in a distiche, Solyma, Luza, Bethel, Ierosolyma, Iebus,
Helia, Vrbs sacra, Jerusalem dicitur, atque Salem. In this distiche 9 names of
this one city are couched together; Solyma, Ierosolyma, Jerusalem, Iebus,
Salem, Bethel, Helia, Luza, the holy City. Drusius Observat. sacr. lib. 14.
cap. 21. notes that Jerusalem did consist of two parts: the one was called,
(...), the lower city; the other, (...), the higher city. This higher city was
Sion, or mount Sion, whereof you have already heard, and was diversely termed,
(...), the city of David, the fort; the fort of Sion, the tower of Sion.

But I come not to preach names unto you. Will you hear of the honor of this
city? they that were alive, when Jerusalem flourished to have Psalm. 48.1^.
numbered her towers, to have considered her walls, to have marked her
bulwarks, and to have told their posterity of it, might have made a report
scarsly to have been believed. This we know by Psalm. 48.4, 5. When the Kings
of the earth were gathered together, and saw it; they marvelled, they were
astonished, and suddenly driven back. Thus is Jerusalem taken literally.

It is also taken spiritually for the Church; either militant here on earth, or
Triumphant in heaven. For the Church Militant, Psalm. 128.5. Thou shall see the
wealth of Jerusalem all thy life long. And for the Church Triumphant, Gal.
4.26. Jerusalem, which is above, is free. The Catholic Church, Militant, and
Triumphant, is called Jerusalem; because Jerusalem was a type thereof.

Jerusalem was a type of the Catholic Church in sundry respects.

1 God did choose Jerusalem, above al other places of the earth, to Psalm.
132.13. Psalm. 135.21.
dwell in. So the Catholic Church, the company of the predestinate, God has
chosen, to be a peculiar people unto himself.

2 Jerusalem is a city, Ps. 122.3.
compact in it self, by reason of the bond of love, and order among the
Citizens. So the faithful, the members of the Catholic Church, are linked
together by the bond of one Spirit.

3 Jerusalem was the place of Gods sanctuary, the place of his presence, and
worship, where the promise of the seed of the woman was preserved till the
coming of the Messiah. Now the Catholic Church is in the room thereof. In
the Catholic Church we must seek the presence of God, and the word of life.

4 In Jerusalem was the Psalm. 122.5.
throne of David. So in the Catholic Church is the throne, and scepter of
CHRIST; figured by the Kingdom of David.

5 The commendation of Jerusalem was the subjection, and obedience of her
citizens. The Catholic Church has her citizens too: Ephesians. 2.19. and they do
yield voluntary obedience and subjection to Christ their King.

6 In Jerusalem the names of the citizens were enrolled in a register. So the
names of all the members of the Catholic Church are enrolled in the book of
life, Revel. 20.15.

You see now what Jerusalem is literally, and what spiritually. Literally, it
is that much honored City in Judea, the Ps. 46.4.
City of God, even the sanctuary of the tabernacle of the most High.
Spiritually it is the holy Church of Christ: either his Church Militant on
earth, or his Church Triumphant in Heaven.

Now the Jerusalem in my text, from whence the LORD is said to utter his voice;
is either Jerusalem in the literal, or Jerusalem in the spiritual
understanding: it is either Jerusalem the mother city of Judea; or Jerusalem
the Church of Christ, Militant upon earth; or Jerusalem above, the most proper
place of Gods residence. So that Jerusalem here is the same with Sion, an
exposition of Sion. The LORD shall roar from Sion, that is, in other words,
The LORD shall utter his voice from Jerusalem.

Mark I beseech you, (beloved in the LORD,) The LORD shall roar, not from
Dan, and Bethel, where Ieroboams calves were worshipped; but from Sion, the
mountain of his holiness: and he shall utter his voice, not from Samaria,
drunken with Idolatry: but from Jerusalem, the Zach. 8.3.
city of truth, wherein the purity of Gods worship did gloriously shine. We
may take from hence this lesson.

Sion and Jerusalem are to be frequented, that thence hearing God speak unto
us, we may learn what his holy will is. To speak more plainly. This is the
lesson which I commend unto you.

The place where God is served, and the exercises of his religion are
practiced, must be carefully frequented. That I may the more easily persuade
you to come unto, and to frequent this place, this house of God, his holy
Church, and Temple, I bring you a guide. This guide is a King, and leads you the
way, the blessed King David. I beseech you, mark his affection, Psalm. 84.1. O
LORD of hoasts, how amiable are thy tabernacles? My soul longs, yea and
faints for thy courts. Mark his love, Psa. 26.8. O LORD I have loved the
habitation of thine house, and the place where thine honor dwells. Mark the
earnestnes of his zeal, Psalm. 42.1.2. As the Heart brayeth for the rivers of
water, so pants my soul after thee O God. My soul thirsts for God, even
for the living God; when shall I come, and appear before the presence of God?
Let this holy King, King David, be that pattern of your imitation.

Beloved, you must have an earnest love and desire to serve God in the assembly
of his Saints: you must much esteem of the public exercise of religion. It is
Gods effectual instrument and mean to nourish, and beg^t you to the hope of a
better life. In what case then are you, when you absent your selves from this,
and the like holy assemblies: when either you come hither carelessly, or else do
gracelesly contemn this place. Here is Sion, here is Jerusalem; here God
speaks to you in the language of Canaan: and here may you speak to him
again with your own mouths.

It is every man's duty, the duty of everyone that loves God, to come unto Gods
house, his house of prayer. In this respect thus says the LORD, Esaias 56.7.
Mine house shall be called the house of prayer for all people. For all people:
there is no difference between the Galat. 3.28.
Jew and the Grecian, between the bond and the free, between the male and the
female; for our LORD, who is LORD over all, Romans 10.12.
is rich unto all that call upon him. Mine house shall be called an house of
prayer for all people.

To imprint this sentence in your hearts, it is repeated unto you, Mat. 21.13.
Where Jesus Christ to the money changers, and doue-sellers, whom he found in the
Temple, uses this speech, It is written, mine house shall be called an house
of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves. Iunius his note upon the
place is good: Qui domo Dei non vtitur ad orationis domum, is eo devenit, vt
speluncam latron^m efficiat came: Whosoever uses not the house of God, for a
house of prayer, he comes thither to make it a den of thieves. Let us take
heed (beloved in the Lord) whe^soever we come unto the Church, the house of
God, that we be not partakers of thi^ sharp censure.

Ecclesiastes chap. 4.17. giu^^^ a profitable caveat, Take heed to thy feet,
when thou enterest into the house of God: intimating thus much; that of duty we
are to enter into the house of God. Though the Temple in Jerusalem and all the
worship in ceremonies, that was annexed to it, are taken away; yet i^ Solomon's
caveat good for us still. Take heed to thy feet when thou enterest into the
house of God. For we also have Gods house, where he is chiefly to be sought,
and worshipped; even in every place appointed by public authority for public
assemblies.

Wherefore, I pray you, has God given his Church 1. Cor. 12 27.
some Apostles, some Prophets, some Evangelists, some Pastors, some Teachers?
Is it not as we are taught, Ephesians. 4.12. for the gathering together of the
Saints, for the work of the ministry, and for the edifying of the Body of
Christ? See you not here a forcible argument, and evident proof, for this your
public meeting? There is Matthew. 18.20. a special promise of a blessing to
light upon you, as often as you shall come to this place; and thereof the author
of all truth assures you: Where two or three are gathered together in my name,
there am I in the midst of them. O weigh, and consider this. If you love, and
would have the society, fellowship, and company of your sweet Savior, Jesus
Christ; you must frequent this place, hither must you come. Know this: you
cannot be right worshippers of God in private, if you refuse, or neglect to
frequent this public assembly, the Sion, the Jerusalem, from whence God is
pleased to speak unto you.

Much then, very much to blame you, whosoever do for none, or for small
occasions absent your selves from this place, this house of God, at appointed
times, where, and when your public prayers should be as it were a public
renou^cing of al sects, and society with idolatry, and profaneness; an
acknowledgement and confession of the true God, and a public sanctification of
Gods holy Name to the glory of God.

The time was, and I dare avouch it, Act. 21.5. when all the congregation of
Tire with their wives and children, bringing St Paul out of the town to the
sea shore, kneeled down with him, and prayed. Shall we in these days find
this zeal among Christians? I much doubt it; and am persuaded, men will be
ashamed, in imitation of those Tyrians, to kneel down in an open place, to
pray unto God publicly.

I will not rub this soar; I know somewhat, and you know more then I; how
backward many of you have been, from doing God due service in this place.
Shall I say, you have dishonored him, some by irreverence, some by much
absence, some by wilful refusal to be made partakers of the blessed
Communion of the body, and blood of our Lord, and Savior, Jesus Christ? I
think, should any one of you invite your neighbor to sup with you, but once,
and he refuse it, you would take some displeasure at him: and shall God
Almighty, the mighty creator of Heaven, of Earth, and of all you, that hear
m^ this day, invite you many times to come, and suppe at the table of his
blessed Son, and you refuse it? Believe it, he cannot take it well.

It is no indifferent, or arbitrary thing, to come, or not to come to the Lords
table. Come you must of duty; though of duty you are first to examine your
selves. Whosoever therefore wilfully refuses to come, he sins very
grievously, as a learned Bucanus Loc. 48.
Divine well notes.

1 Because he contemns not any humane, but a divine edict, the express
commandment of the Lord of life: Do this in remembrance of me.

2 Because he little esteems the remembrance of Christ his death, by which we
are redeemed.

3 Because he neglects the communion of the body, and blood of Christ.

4 Because he shows himself to be none of the number of Christ's disciples.

I beseech you (dearly beloved) lay up these things in your hearts; let this
day be the beginning of your reformation; resolve from hence forth to perform
your due obedience to God in this place; to pour forth your prayers before
him, to hear his holy word, and to frequent the Lords table; whereby faith in
his death and passion, you may receive many a gracious blessing: forgiveness of
your sins, your reconciliation with God, the death of iniquity in you, and
the assured pledge of eternal life.

I have now by occasion, of SION and JERUSALEM, the place, from whence God will
speak unto y^^, exhorted every one of you in particular to come to the Church.
I pray you note this to be but a part of your duty. It is not enough for you to
come your selves to the Church; you must solicit and exhort others to come
likewise. Fathers must bring their children, Masters must bring their Servants.
For old, and young, should come.

My warrant for what I say, I take out of Joel. 2.15, 16. Calla solemn
assembly, gather the people, sanctify the congregation, gather the elders,
assemble the children, and those that suck the breasts. Mark, I beseech you.
Children, and such as suck the breasts must be assembled. You must have the
spirit of resolution, to say with Joshua, cha. 24.15. I, and my house, will
serve the LORD.

Your duty is yet further extended beyond your children, and servants; to your
neighbors, and also strangers, if they come in your way. This we may learn
out of the prophecies of Esaias, Micah, and Zachary. First Esaias 2.3. The
faithful shall say Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the
house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us his ways and we will walk in
his paths: for the law shall go forth of SION, and the word of the Lord from
JERUSALEM. Again Micah 4.2. You shall find the very same exhortation made by
the faithful, and in the same words: Come, and let us go up to the mountain
of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, etc. The Prophet Zachary chap.
8.21. for sum, and substance speaks the same thing: They that dwell in one
town, shall go unto another, saying, up, let us go, and pray before the LORD,
and seek the LORD of hoastes, I will go also.

Thus far of the place from whence the Lord speaks expressed by two names
Sion and Jerusalem.

THE FIFTH LECTVRE.
AMOS 1.2. And he said, the LORD shall roar from SION, and utter his voice
from JERUSALEM; and the dwelling places of the shepherds shall perish, and the
top of CARMEL shall wither.


OF the speaker, and place from whence he speaks, I have heretofore spoken.
Now proceed we to the sequels of the speech, which shall for this time be the
ground of my discourse.

The dwelling places of the shepherds shall perish] So do the words sound for
their substance. Yet after the letter in the original, and Hebrew copy, we
are to read otherwise: the fruitful or pleasant places of the shepherds have
mourned. Let us briefly take a view of the words, as they lie in order.

The dwelling places] So is the Hebrew (...) englished not unfitly. For though
properly it signifies fruitful, and pleasant fields, and pastures; yet
because shepherds did use in the wilderness, near unto such fields and
pastures to erect themselves little cottages and cabins, that they might be at
hand to defend their harmless sheep from savage and ravenous beasts, it may
here well be englished, the dwelling places.

The dwelling places of the shepheards] In my first lecture upon this prophecy,
I told you there were two sorts of shepherds. In the first rank, I placed
sheepmasters; in the second, their servants. Among the first sort of shepherds
was Mesa King of Moab: who 2. King 3.4. is called a shepherd, and there
registered to have rendered to the King of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and
an hundred thousand rams, with the wool. The other sort of shepherds, is of
such, as are hired to keep sheep; to see to their feeding and saftie. Such we
properly call shepherds, and such are the shepherds in my text. It follows.

Have mourned] The text is so; the meaning is; shall mourn. This enallage or
change of the time; of the time past for the time to come, has its reason from
a truth contained in a saying of the Schoolmen, Apud Deum non est tempus: God
is beyond times limits. He was when time was not; and shall be when time
shall be no more. Its common with the Prophets to speak of a future thing, as
of a thing past, or present. A learned Oath Gualt perius.
Grammarian does well express the reason; quia Prophetia ipsorum tam certa
est, ac si spectatores rerum futurarum in praesenti omnia fieri cernerent. The
prophecies in the old time, which came not by the will of man, were of as
great certainty as if the Prophets had been present spectatours of the things
to come.

The sweet singer of Israel, to show Gods promise made for the encouragement of
the man, that loves to live a godly life, says Psalm. 1.3. He has been like
a tree planted by the rivers of waters. He has been, that is the text; the
sense is, he shall be like such a tree. Jacob in the 48. of Genesis ver. 22. thus
blesses Joseph: I have given thee one portion above thy brethren. I have given
thee, that is the text; the sense is, I do, or will give thee. In Hosea 10.5.
we read thus, The people of the Calfe of Bethaven have mourned over it. The
text is, have mourned; the sense is, shall mourn. So here my text is, The
dwelling places of the shepheardes have mourned: the sense is, they shall
mourn.

Shall mourne] Mourn? How can dwelling places mourn? Even as the earth can
mourn. The lamentations and mournings of the earth are eternized with holy
Prophets pens. With Esayes pen, chap. 24.4. For the sins of the people
the land lamenteth and fades away* and again chap. 33.9. For the sins of
the people the earth mourns and faints. With Ieremies pen, first chap.
4.28. For the sins of Judah the earth shall mourn; again chap. 12.4. For
the wickedness of the inhabitants shall the land mourn; a third time chap.
23.10. because of oaths the land mourns. With Ioels pen chap. 1.10. for
sin the land mourns. With Hoseas pen chap 4.3. because there is no truth,
nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in Israel, every one breaking out by swearing,
by lying, by killing, by stealing, by whoring, blood touching blood, therefore
shall the land mourn.

Lamentation, and mourning proper passions of the reasonable creature, are by a
translation ascribed to the Earth; to note either that she is ilfavored, and
out of fashion for lack of dressing; or that men for her desolation do
lament, and mourn; as Drusius lib. 1. quaest. Hebr. qu. 27. observes out of
St Austine. Suitable to the mournings of the Earth, is the mourning in my text:
the dwelling places of the shepherds shall mourne] It is a translation from
living things to things without life; from shepherds to their dwelling houses:
The dwelling places of the shepherds shall mourn, that is, the shepherds
themselves shall mourn, when they shall behold the spoil, overthrowe, and
desolation of their dwelling houses. Our English reading then for the sense is
good, The dwelling places of the shepherds shall perish.

You see now the desolation of the dwelling places of the shepherds. Will you
have the reason of it? Look back then to the but-now cited places of Esaias,
Jeremy, Hosea, Joel, for the reason, why the earth is said to mourn. The
reason is the same for the earthes mourning, and the mourning of the shepherds
dwelling houses: even sin and iniquity. Whence you may learn this lesson.

Sin and iniquity are means to lay wast, and make desolate [our dwelling
houses] yea the fairest, and goodliest buildings; all manner of buildings. This
point I might at large demonstrate and make plain unto you, by the ruins of
time: by the ruins of the old world of Sodom, Gomorah, and their sisters; of
Babel; of the first, and second Temples; of the Eastern Churches; of the
Abbeyes, and Monasteries of this land. But for this present I will content my
self only to deliver unto you, and that briefly, a few brief notes for your
further instruction, and meditation.

It is true? Are sin and iniquity means to lay wast, and make desolate all
manner of buildings? Why then (beloved) you must acknowledge and confess, that
the crying sins of your forefathers have been the cause why Gods own house,
and The Chapel at MARSTON MEISEY ruined.
Chapel among you, is become wast, and desolate. This meditation concerns
some of you specially: you among whom God sometimes had his Sion, and
Jerusalem, his house of prayer, and sacred Chapel. O it is a fearful
judgment of God upon you, that he has removed his kingdom, and your
candlestick from among you. But you will lay this blame upon your forefathers.
I cannot excuse them. Yet must I tell you, that except ye amend your lives, a
worse thing may befall you.

And you (beloved) who have your dwelling near unto this House of God, the
place of assembly for his Saints, will you match your neighbors in sin, and
iniquity; and not fear their punishments? When first I beheld, and considered
the condition of this House, wherein we are now assembled; it seemed to me that
desolation had begun to set her foot here. What else could your selves
think of, or hope for, as often as you beheld her decayed estate?

Such Churches as this, if any be so bad as this, within this Realm, may give
some occasion to that same scandalous assertion, of one of our English Gul.
Reginald. Calvino turc. lib. 2. cap 15. in argumento Libri. In Anglicano and
Turcico ministerio summa est convenientia. TEMPLA vtrinque sunt similia, sed
Turcis ornatiora and magnifice^tiora. page 313.
fugitives beyond the seas: that the Churches in Turkey are more sumptuous, and
stately, then ours in England. Of ours he says, that they are Apud vestros
Evangelicos -- Ecclesiae pleru^que turpes, sordidae, and immundae iacent. At
hominum nobiliu^, mercatorum, iuridicorum, Baronum, Comitu^que domibus, nihil
ornatius, nihil operosius, and in his poliendis homines privati regias
aliqua^do gazas consumu^t Ibid. page 318.
turpes, sordidae, immundae; foul, unclean, and sluttish. To persuade you to
repair her decayed places, I would it were within the compass of my
Rhetoric. Yet let me propound one question unto you, Hag. 1.4. Is it time for
your selves to dwell in your seiled houses, and this house to lie wast?
Consider your own ways in your own hearts and give your answer unto God.

A second note for your further instruction, and meditation follows. It is
true? Are sin and iniquity means to lay wast, and make desolate all manner
of buildings? How then is it, that our dwelling houses do yet stand, and
flourish? Our sins, and iniquities, are exceeding impudent, and saucy; they
are ascended into the presence of God, and do stand like Satan among his
children before his face. Yet for all this impudency, and sauciness of our
sins and iniquities, God is pleased to suffer our dwelling houses to be in
safety. The consideration of this point may stir us up to a grateful
agnition, and acknowledgment of Gods singular bounty, and longanimitie. It is
out of the bounty of the LORD, that the earth, since the time it first was
cursed for the fall of man, does to this day yield fruit in abundance for the
use of man. That our possessions, habitations, dwelling houses, and Churches
are not laid wast, and made desolate, it is to be ascribed to Gods long
sufferance, and longanimitie. Of which I shall (God willing) anon speak more
fully, when I shall have considered the words of the second sequel, or
consequent of Gods speech, which are: The top of Carmel shall wither.

The top of Carmel] There were two hills of this name, as St Hierome teaches;
both in Judea; the one in the southern climate of that country, whereon Nabal
the husband of Abigail did dwell, 1. Sam. 25.2. the other near unto Ptolemais,
toward the sea coast, upon which Elias prayed for rain, 1. Kings 18.42. St
Hierome seems to doubt, which of these two Carmels our Prophet here
intends. But Ribera resolves for that Carmel, which was near unto
Ptolemais, because it did appertain to the lot of the ten tribes, against whom
Amos in this book prophecieth.

This Carmel was a hill of much fatness, and fertility: whereupon it may, as
proverbially, be taken for any such place. St Hierome writing upon Esaias 16.
says, it is the Scriptures idiome, and proper form of speech evermore to
compare the rich hill, Carmel, to fertility, and abundance. One of the Hebrewe
R. David apud Drusiu^.
Doctors says, that Carmel is a general name for all fruitful arable fields,
and vineyards. A great Pagnin.
Hebrician says, that because the hill, Carmel, had by it a valley of
exceeding feracitie, and fruitfulness, therefore Carmel is appellatiuely taken
for any place set with corn, trees, or vines; and specially with standing
corn, with new and fat wheat while it is in ear: though another Marinus in
Arca Noe
Hebrician of like note, affirms that because Carmel collectiuely signifies
standing corn, or new wheat yet in the ear, therefore a certain region in
the province of Canaan of extraordinary fertility (as also a hill, and city
there) was called after this name, Carmel. Whatsoever Carmel be in this place,
whether a proper name, or an appellatiue, out of doubt it betokens a place of
much fruitfulness. Following the stream of expositors, I am of opinion, that
Carmel in my text, is that same fruitful mountain of Judea by Ptolemais.

The top of Carmel] A place fit by reason of the woods there, to lurk, and
lie hid in; as is plain by Amos, 9.3. Though they hide themselves in the top
of Carmel, I will search, and take them out thence.

The top of Carmel] In the Hebrew it is the head of Carmel. The head, or top of
Carmel, is the Scripture phrase, to express whatsoever is best in Carmel. By
the like phrase we say Caput vngue^ti, the head or the top of the ointment, to
signify the best of the ointment.

The top of Carmel] Pagnine thus translateth it, vertex loci fertilis: the top
of the fruitful place. And Iunius thus: praestantissimum aruorum: the best of
the fields. Both Pagnine, and Iunius, do take Carmel here for an appellatiue,
and not for a proper name.

The top of Carmel shall wither] shall wax dry, or be dried up. That is, where
most fruitful fields, and pastures are, there shall be a defect, and want of
necessaries for man's life.

Thus have you the exposition of this last clause. Now be patient, I pray
you, while from hence I commend on lesson unto you. It is this: For the sins
of a people, God will make the top of their Carmel to wither. I speak it more
plainly.

For the sins of a people, God will make their best grounds to yield them
little, or no profit. For proof of this point, you will be pleased to hear
the evidence of the holy Spirit, given in the word of life, Deuteronomy. 28.20, Thus
says the LORD: because of the wickedness of thy works, whereby thou have
forsaken me, the LORD shall smite thee with blasting, and with mildew: the
Heaven which is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thee,
shall be iron: instead of rain, the LORD shall give thee dust and ashes, even
from heaven shall it come down upon thee until thou be destroyed.

In the 2. Chapter of Hosea, and the 5 verse, because Israel, had played the
harlot, and done shamefully, departing from the LORD, thus says the LORD: I
will take away from Israel my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the
season thereof, and will recover my wool, and my flax, which I lent her, to
cover her shame. Mark I beseech you, the manner of the LORDS speech, my corn,
my wine, my woll, my flax; they are none of ours, they are all the Lords. The
LORD has lent the^ us, to serve our turns, and necessities: if we abuse them
to idolatry, or prophanes, he will take them from us, and recover them again
unto himself.

In the 4. Chapter of Hosea, and the 3. verse, because there is no truth, nor
mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land: but every one breaks out by
swearing, by lying, by killing, by stealing, by whoring, and blood touches
blood, thus says the LORD: the land shall mourn, and every one that dwells
therein shall be cut of, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of
heaven, and also the fishes of the sea shall be taken away. If so: what good
then comes to you from Carmel, from your best, and most fruitful grounds?

In the 8. chapter of Hosea, and the 7. verse, because Israel transgressing the
covenant of the LORD, and trespassing against his law, had sown the wind,
thus says the LORD: they shall reap the whirlewinde: it has no stalk; the
bud shall bring forth no meal; if so be, it bring forth, the strangers shall
devour it. If so; what profit then can we, matching Israel in their most
grievous transgressions, and trespasses, expect from Carmel, our most
fruitful, and pleasant fields.

The wisest King that ever sacred writ made mention of, has this saying, Prove.
13.25. The belly of the wicked shall want. True great Solomon. The belly of the
wicked man shall be empty. His Carmel, the very best of his possessions, shall
yield him little profit.

To make an end of this discourse, I would, I could write it in your hearts,
what the sweetest singer, Psa. 107.34. delivers unto you, touching this
point: it is worthy your best remembrance. A fruitful land God turns into
barrennes, for the wickedness of the^, that dwell therein. This one place (had
I troubled you with no more) would have been a pregnant, and sufficient proof
of my propounded doctrine. What fruit can you look for out of barrenness? And
by this one place you see, that God turns a fruitful land into barrenness,
for the wickedness of them, that dwell therein. You must then acknowledge the
lesson commended unto you to be good, and true; namely, that for the sins of
a people, God will make their Carmel to wither; that for the sins of a
people, God will make best grounds to yield them little, or no profit.

Now let us see, what use we may make of this doctrine for our further
instructions.

A first use, is to admonish such as do dwell in delectable, pleasant, well
watered, and fruitful places, that they boast not overmuch of their fertile,
and sweet possessions: since there is no land so delectable to the eye, or
fruitful to the purse, but it may be turned into a wilderness. If for our
sins God shall come against us in the fierceness of his wrath; we shall be
as Esaias, 1.9.
Sodom, and like unto Gomorah: our land shall burn with brimstone, and Deuteronomy.
29.23
salt; it shall not be sown, nor shall bring forth; neither shall any grass
grow therein. O LORD, deal not with us after our sins, neither reward us
according to our iniquities.

A second use, is to warn rich men, the richer sort among you, that weighing
rightly the power of Almighty God, by which he makes the top of Carmel to
wither, and turns your fruitful fields into barrenness; you will beware of
insolency, and contain your selves in modesty, and submission. Know this;
there is no man has a foot of ground, or never so small a possession to dwell
in, but he has it at Gods hand; and upon this condition; that he keep his
statutes, and commandments. Which if you disobey, contemn, and cast behind
you, assure your selves, your riches are none of yours, you are not the right
owners of them; but mere usurpers. The LORD of hoasts will send an host of
enemies against you.

Art thou rich in money? thou art in danger of thieves: art thou plentiful in
household stuff? thou art in danger of fire: have thou much gold? the rust does
venime it, and thee: is thine apparel gorgious? the moth will eat it: have
thou store of cattle? rottenness may consume them: is thy maintenance by
husbandry? blasting and mildewes will hinder thee, the Joel. 1.4.
palmer worm will eat thy fruits, that which the palmer worm shall leave,
the grasshopper shall eat; that which the grasshopper shall leave, the ca^ker
worm shall eat; and that which the ca^ker worm shall leave, the caterpiller
shall eat. So many, and many more enemies can the LORD of hoasts send to fight
against you; if you hate to be reformed, and cast his commandments behind you.

A third, and the last use of my propounded doctrine, is, to stir up my
self, and all you, that hear me this day, gratefully, and thankfully to
recount the mercifulness, patience, and long sufferance of our God. Our sins
have deserved it at his hands, that he should make the top of our Carmel to
wither; that he should make our best grounds to yield us little, or no profit;
that he should smite us with blasting, and mildew; that he should make the
Heaven over our head, brass; and the Earth under us, iron: that instead of
rain, he should give us dust and ashes; that he should take from us, his
corn, his wine, his wool, his flax, and whatsoever good thing else, he has
lent us for our use. All this, and much more have our sins deserved: and yet
God withholdeth from us his revenging hand. O the depth of the riches of the
mercifulness, patience, and long sufferance of our God.

Yet stay ye sons of Belial, and imps of Hell; ye wicked ones, who serve
under Satan's Banner. Gods mercifulness, patience, and long sufferance, is to
you very small advantage. S. Basil treating upon the words of the covetous rich
man, Luke 12.18. those words: I will pull down my barnes, and build greater,
tells you that God his goodness, extended to you in your fields, or elsewhere,
brings upon you in the ^nde the greater punishment.

True great Basil. God his justice goes on (...) slowly, and in order. Long
before thy time was this lesson learned in Natures school. Lib. 1. c. 1.
Valerius Maximus who lived under Tiberius Caesar, recounting some of the
sacriledges of Dionysius, clearly carried with frompes, and mockeries, says
Lento gradu ad vindictam sui divina procedit ira: the wrath of God proceeds
to the execution of vengeance, with a remiss and slow pace; but evermore, as
he well adds, tanditatem supplicij gravitate compensat: it recompenseth the
slacknesse of punishment, with the heaviness thereof.

I will not weary your religious ears with profane, though fit sentences for
this argument, out of Lib. 3. od. 2. Raro antecedentem scelestum Deseruit pede
poena claudo.
Horace, Lib. 1. eleg. 9 Ah miser, et si quis primo perjuria celat, Sera tame^
tacitis poena venit pedibus
Tibullus, Lib. 3. -- Quis enim laesos impune putaret Esse deos? --
Lucan, and Lib. de ijs qui tarde a numine corripiuntur.
Plutarch; nor with those well known proverbs, Dij lenti, sed certi vindices,
Di^ lan^os pedes habent: Tacito pede, and Cunctabundus natura Deus. From
Natures school I recall my self to the God of Nature, who though in his word
of eternal truth he proclaims himself (...) a Exodus 34 6.
God slow to anger, and is for such acknowledged by the never failing
testifications, and reports of divinely inspired Nehem. 9 17 Psalm 86.15. Psalm.
103.8 and 145.8. Romans 2.4. 2. Pet. 3.9.
Prophets and Apostles: is notwithstanding in the same word noted to Exodus
20.5. and 34.7. Deuteronomy. 5 9 Ierem 32 18.
recompense the iniquity of the Fathers into the bosom of their children after
them.

It must stand ever good: Quo tardius, eo gravius, that the longer God is
before he punishes, he punishes so much the more grievously. Though for a
time he be pleased to hold his tongue, and to walk as with woollen feet; yet
at length shall we, or our posterity, find by woeful experience, that he has
a rod of iron to rule us, yea, and to break us in pieces, like potters vessels.

Wherefore (dearly beloved in the Lord) while God is pleased, to withhold from
us his one hand of Justice, and to strech over us his other of Mercy, to the
blessing of us in our fields, in our cattle, in our stoare, let us not be
wedded to the hardness of our own he^rts; let us not dwell in our old sins,
nor heap new upon them: least so we treasure up unto our selves wrath against
the day of wrath.

Let us rather even now, while it is now, cast away al works of darkness, and
put on the armor of light: let us take no further thought for our flesh to
fulfill the lusts of it. Let us walk no more as formerly we have done, in
gluttony, in drunkenness, in chambering, in wantennesse, in strife, in envying,
in deceit, in falsehood, in vanity; but let us walk honestly as in the day;
and put we on the Lord Jesus. Whatsoever things, are true, and honest, and
just, and pure, and do pertain to love, and are of good report; if there be
any virtue, or praise, think we on these things. Think we on these things to
do them, and we shall not need to fear any desolation to our houses, or
barrenness to our grounds; our dwelling houses shall not mourn, or perish;
the top of our Carmel shall not wither; our fields shall bring forth increase
unto us. For God, even our own God, shall give us his blessing. God will
bless us to pass the time of our pilgrimage here in peace, and plenty; and
when the day of our separation shall be, that we must leave the earth, a vale
of tears, and misery, he will translate us to Jerusalem above, the place of
eternal joy, and felicity, where this corruptible shall put on incorruption,
and our mortality shall be swallowed up of life. So be it.

THE SIXTH LECTVRE.
AMOS 1.3, 4, 5. Thus says the LORD: For three transgressions of Damascus, and
for four I will not turn to it, because they have threshed Gilead with
threshing instruments of iron.

Therefore will I send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the
palaces of Benhadad.

I will break also the bars of Damascus, and cut of the inhabitant of
Bikeath-aven: and him that holds the scepter out of Beth-eden, and the people
of Aram shall go into captivity unto Kir, says the LORD.


THough in this prophecy there be mention made of Judah, yet was Amos by the
holy spirit deputed, and directed with his message peculiarly, and properly to
the ten revolted Tribes, the kingdom of Israel. The mention that is made of
Judah, is made but incidently, and by the way. The scope of the prophecy is
Israel; as I showed in my Page 7.
first Lecture.

If Israel be the scope of this prophecy, how comes it to pass, that the
Prophet bestows the residue of this chapter, and a part of the next, in
making rehersall of foreign nations, their transgressions, and punishments?
Why does he acquaint Israel with his burdensome prophecies against the Syrians,
the Philistines, the Tyrians, the Edomites, the Ammonites, the Moabites? why
does he not rather discharge his function, and duty laid upon him? and check
the Israelites, and terrify them, and reprove them for their evil deeds?

The reasour^ (...) se^^ of purpose with a message to the Israelites, does
^^^st prophecy against the Syrians, and other foreign nations, are (...).

1 That he might be the more patiently heard of his countrymen the Israelites.
The Israelites seeing their Prophet Amos so sharp against the Syrians, and
other their enemies, could not, but with more quiet hear him, when he should
prophecy against the^ also. Consolatio quaedam est, afflictio inimici: some
comfort it is to a distressed natural man, to see his enemy in distress
likewise.

2 That they might have no cause to wonder, if God should at any time come
against the^ in vengeance, seeing that God would not spare the Syrians, and
other their neighbor Countries, though they were destitute of the light of
Gods word; and ignorant of his will.

3 That they might the more fear at the words of this prophecy, when they
should see the Syrians, and other nations, afflicted, and tormented accordingly.

Here might they thus have argued? Will not God spare our neighbors, the
Syrians, and the rest? Then out of doubt he will not spare us. They seely people
never knew the holy will of God, and yet shall they be so severely punished?
How then shall we escape, who knowing Gods holy will have contemned it?

From the reasons why Amos first prophecieth against foreign nations, and then
against the Lords people, Israel: I come now to treat particularly of his
prophecy against the Syrians, verse. 3, 4, 5.

Wherein I commend to your christian considerations three parts.

1 A preface, proeme, or entrance, verse. 3. Thus says the LORD. 2 A prophecy,
In the 3, 4, and 5. verses. For three transgressions of Damascus and for four,
etc. 3 A conclusion, In the end of the 5. verse. Says the LORD.
The preface, and the conclusion do make for the authority of the prophecy,
verse. 3. and 5.

In the prophecy these parts may be observed.

1 A general accusation of the Syrians, verse the 3. For three transgressions
of Damascus, and for four. 2 A protestation of Almighty God against them; I
will not turn to it. 3 The great sin, by which they so offended God: their
extreme cruelty, verse 3. They have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments
of iron. 4 The punishments to be laid upon them for such cruelty.
These punishments are here set down generally, and specially.

Generally verse. the 4. I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it
shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad. Specially verse. the 5. I will break also
the bars of Damascus, and cut of the inhabitant of Bikeath-aven: and him that
holds the scepter out of Beth-eden, and the people of Aram shall go into
captivity unto Kir.
Thus says the LORD] It is a very usual thing with the Prophets, so to begin
their special Prophecies, to let the world understand, that they feign nothing
out of their own brains, but that whatsoever they speak, they have received
it from the spirit of the LORD. Thus says, not Amos, but in Amos the LORD. The
LORD, the powerful JEHOVAH of whom you heard at large out of my third lecture
upon this chapter.

Thus says the Lord] the powerful JEHOVAH, See Lect 3.
who made the heavens and Psalm. 104.2.
spread them out like a curtain, to cloth himself with light as with a
garment; and can again Esai. 50.3.
cloth the heavens with darkness, and make a sack their covering: who made
the sea, to Psalm. 104.3.
lay the beams of his chamber therein, and Ierem. 5.22.
placed the sands for bounds unto it, never to be passed over, howsoever the
waves thereof shall rage, and roar; and can with a word smite the pride
thereof: at his rebuke Esai. 50.2.
the flowds shall be turned into a wilderness; the sea shall be dried up; the
fish shall rot for want of water, and die for thirst: who made the dry land,
and so Psalm. 104.5.
set it upon foundations, that it should never m^^e; and can Psalm. 104.6.
cover her again with the deep, as with a garment, and so Esai. 24.20.
rock her, that she shall reele to and fro, and stacker like a drunken man.

Thus says the LORD] This powerful JEHOVAH, whose throne is the heaven of
heavens, and the sea his floare to walk in, and the earth his footstool to
tread upon, who has a chair in the conscience, and fitteth in the heart of
man, and possesses his secretest reins, and devideth betwixt the flesh and
the skin, and shakes his inmost powers, as the thu^der shakes the wilderness
of Cades.

Thus says the LORD.] Has the LORD said, and shall he not do it? has he
spoken, and shall he not accomplish it? Balaa^ confesses as much unto Balak,
Number. 23.19. God is not as man, that he should lie, nor as the son of man,
that he should repent. Indeed says Samuel (1. Sam. 15.29.) The strength of
Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not as man, that he should repent. Al
his words, yea all the titles of his words are yea, and Amen. Verily says our
Savior, Matthew. 5.18. Heaven and earth shall perish, before one jot, or any
one title of Gods law shall escape unfulfilled.

Thus says the LORD.] Then out of doubt it must come to pass. Hereby you may
be persuaded of the authority of this Prophecy: and not of this only, but of
al other the Prophecies of holy Scripture; that neither this, nor any other
Prophecy of old, is destitute of divine authority. This point touching the
authority of holy Scripture I delivered unto you in my second lecture, and
therefore have now the less need to spend time therein. Yet a word or two
thereof.

God almighty spoke in old time to our fathers by the mouth of Moses, Exodus
4.12. and not by the mouth of Moses only, but by the mouths of all his
Prophets, Heb. 1.1. and 2. Peter 1.20. Know this that no Prophecy in the
Scripture is of any private motion. He gives the reason hereof ver. 21. for
the Prophecy in old time came not by the will of man, but holy men of God
spoke, as they were moved by the holy Ghost. Hence sprang those usual and
familiar speeches in the books of the Prophets; The The word of the LORD came
unto me; the LORD God has spoken; and this in my text, Thus says the LORD.
This LORD, who thus spoke in old time by his Prophets, did in fullness of time,
when he sent to consummate, and perfect the work of man's redemption, speak
by his blessed Evangelists, and Apostles.

This appears by the faithful promise made unto them, Matthew. 10.19. Take no
thought how, or what ye, shall speak; for it shall be given you, what ye
shall say. It is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your father, that
speaks in you. It must stand ever true, what is recorded, 2. Tim. 3.16. the
whole Scripture (and every parcel thereof) is given by inspiration of God: and
has inward witness from that Spirit, which is the author of all truth.

Here may you note the harmony, consent, and agreement, of all the Prophets,
Evangelists, and Apostles, from the first unto the last: not one of them spoke
one word of a natural man in all their ministeries; the words, which they
spoke, were the words of him that sent them: they spoke not of themselves, God
spoke in them. Whenever were the time, whatsoever were the means, whosoever
were the man; whersoever were the place, whatsoever were the people, the words
were the Lords.

Thus says the LORD] How then dare we, potters clay, lift up our hands
against him, that fashioned us? How dare we absent our selves from his house of
prayer, where God in and by his holy word speaks unto us? How dare we, when
we are come to this place, behave our selves carelessly, negligently,
irreverently?

But I will not at this time press you any further with this point, having
heretofore in my fourth lecture occasioned by the Lords roaring out of Sion,
and uttering his voice from Jerusalem, exhorted you in many words, to the due
performance of your dutiful service of God in this place. For this present, I
will only give you a taste of the sweetness of the word of the LORD, conveied
unto us by the ministeries of his sanctified Prophets, Evangelists, and
Apostles. It is the Lords most roial and celestial testament, the oracles of
his heavenly sanctuary, the only key unto us of his reveiled counsels; milk
from his sacred breasts; the earnest and pledge of his favor to his Church;
the light of our feet, joy of our hearts, breath of our nostrils, pillar of our
faith, anchor of our hope ground of our love, evidences, and deeds of our
future blessedness.

Thus far of the preface, proeme, or entrance, making for the authority of
this prophecy; Thus says the LORD.

Now follows the prophecy against the Syrians: wherein I commended to your
Christian considerations four things.

1 The general accusation of the Syrians, verse. 3. For three transgressions of
Damascus, and for four. 2 The LORDS protestation against them, verse the 3 I
will not turn to it. 3 The particular sin, by which the Syrians had so
offended God, verse. the 3. They have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments
of iron. 4 The punishments attending them for this sin; set down generally,
and specially. Generally verse. 4. I will send a fire into the house of Hazael,
and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad. Specially verse. the 5. I will
break also the bars of Damascus, and cut of the inhabitant of Bikeath-aven:
and him that holds the scepter out of Beth-eden, and the people of Aram shall
go into captivity unto Kir.

Order requires: that I begin, with the first part: the accusation of the
Syrians verse. 3.

For three transgressions of Damascus, and for foure] This Damascus was a very
ancient city, built, as Arias Montan. Justin. lib 36 Stephan. Adrichom.
Hieron. Heb. quaest. in Ge^.
some conjecture, by Eliezer, the steward of Abraham's house, who was surnamed
Damascus, Genesis 15.2. The first mention of this city is Genesis 14.15. Apud Hier.
ibid and Joseph antiq. Iudaic lib. 1. cap. 7. Willet in Ge^. cap. 15.
Others holding the name of this city to have been more ancient then Abraham,
do attribute the building of this city to Huz, one of the sons of Aram, Genesis
10.23. Where upon Damascus was called also Aram, as In Esai, 17.
St Hierome witnesses. Whatsoever were the antiquity of this city, it is
plain by Esa. 7.8. that it was the Metropolitan, and chiefest city of Syria.

I need not tell you what Jews Vertomannus, a gentleman of Rome, saw in this
city about some hundred years since, as the place where Caine slew Abel; the
place where the body of the Prophet Zachary lay; the tower wherein S. Paul was
committed to prison; and the like: that would be beside my purpose. For the
present know ye, that Damascus, was the Metropolitan, and chiefest city of
Syria; whence by a figure, the figure Synecdoche, it is here, in my text, put
for the whole cuntry of Syria. By this figure Synecdoche in the name Damascus,
our Prophet here threatens all inhabitants in the country about Damascus; he
cites all the Syrians to appear before the tribunal seat of Almighty God,
because they had unjustly troubled and vexed the city Gilead. But of this
hereafter. Now let us see, what is meant by the three transgressions, and
four, here mentioned in the general accusation of the Syrians.

For three transgressions, and for four.] The word Transgressions, signifies,
whatsoever detestable thoughts, words, or deeds may be conceived, uttered, or
acted, against Gods law, our holy faith, and Christian duties. These three
transgressions of Damascus, are in the judgment of Arias Montanus, the same
with the three transgressions of Azzah, and of Tyrus, and of Edom, and of
Ammon, and of Moab, and of Judah, and of Israel, so often repeated in this, and
the next chapters: namely; the vain worship of strange Gods, whordomes, and
murders. The fourth, says he, is added in the text, even their barbarous
cruelty: They threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron.

For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four.] S. Hierome expounds
these words, as if the Syrians of Damascus had dealt cruelly against the
people of God, not once, or twice only, but also a third, and fourth time, to
this sense: if the Syrians had persecuted my people but once, or a second time,
I should have pardoned them; but now when they have not ceased a third, and
fourth time, to practice their cruelty upon my chosen people, even to thresh
them with threshing instruments of iron, shall I not visit for these things? is
it not time that I beat them with rods? is it not necessary that I turn from
them the countenance of my clemency?

For three transgression^ of Damascus, and for four.] Apud Mercerum.
Some refer these three, and four transgressions, to three, and four
generations; thus: though God uses to forbear, and pardon men's sins to the
third, and fourth generation, yet in the fourth he will undoubtedly execute his
vengeance. Ibid.
Some others do make this sense of these words: God uses to remit, and to
forgive any man his sins for thrice; but if the fourth time he sin likewise,
there is no hope of remission. According to that, which we read, Job 33.29. All
these things will God work twice or thrice with a man, that he may turn back
his soul from the pit, to be illuminated in the light of the living. Twice, or
thrice, will God chastise us for our sins; but if we sin the fourth time,
Woe unto us; we are left unto our selves.

For three transgressions, and for four.] Mercer. Wincklema.
Some do join these numbers to make seven; because the number of seven in
holy Scripture, is a number of plenitude, and perfection, as Levit. 26.18. If
you will not obey me, I will punish you seven times for your sins. To which
sense here by three transgressions, and four, that is by seven, they affirm
the multitude, and greatness of the sins of Damascus to be designed, and
pointed at.

For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four.] The last exposition,
wherewith I will now hold you, is the most Mercer. Calvin. Drusius.
general, proper, and significant: to understand by three, and four, which
make a certain number, a number infinite, and uncertain. For as often as he
will, God forgiveth, though we sin a hundred times. It is but the custom of
the Scripture thus to speak. God waits for us, twice and thrice, that is, a
good while, to have us return from our evil ways unto repentance; but the
fourth time, that is, at length, when he sees us persist in our impenitencie,
he reproves us, casts us away, and leaves us in our sins.

You have hitherto the general accusation of the Syrians, whereby you know
they were defiled with three transgressio^s, and with four; with very many
sins. Now follows the protestation of Almighty God against them for their
sins.

I will not turn to it] to them; to the inhabitants of Damascus; to the
Syrians: that is, I will have no mercy on them. These words are diversely
rendered by expositors: by the author of the vulgar Latin, and by Gualter, Non
convertam eum. I will not turn it: that is, I will not recall the Syrians of
Damascus to the right way, they shall run on to their own perdition. By
Calvin, Non propitius ero ei; I will not be favorable to the Syrians of
Damascus; I will not return unto mercy. By Mercer, Non parcam ei: I will not
spare the Syrians of Damascus: According to their deserts, so shall it be
measured to them. By Iunius, Non avertam istud: I will not turn away the
punishment, wherewith I have resolved to punish them. I am the LORD, and am not
changed; I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the
palaces of Benhadad, etc.

The sum of both, the Accusation and Protestation, is: if the Syrians had
offended but once, or a second time, I would have been favorable to them, and
would have recald them into the way, that so they might have been converted,
and escaped my punishments: but now whereas they do daily heap transgression
upon transgression, and find no end of sinning, I have hardened my face against
them, and will not suffer them to be converted, but indurate, and obstinate as
they are; I will utterly destroy them. For three transgressions of Damascus and
for four, I will not turn to it.

Having thus expounded these words, give me leave out of them to gather such
notes, as may make for our further instruction, and reformation.

My first note is; Three transgressions and four do pluck down from Heaven,
the most certain wrath, and vengeance of God upon the transgessors. The
doctrine.

Three transgressions, and four, that is, Many sins do pluck down from
heaven the most certain wrath, and vengeance of God, upon the sinners. God is
of pure eyes, and beholds not iniquity; he has laid righteousness to the
rule, and weighed his justice in a balance. The sentence is passed forth, and
must stand uncontrollable, even as long as sun, and moon. Tribulation and
anguish upon every soul that does evil. The soul that sins it shall be
punished. God makes it good by an oath: Deuteronomy. 32.41. that he will wh^t his
glittering sword, and his hand shall take hold on judgment to execute
vengeance upon sinners. His soul hates and abhors sin; his law curses,
and condemns sin; his hand smites, and scourges sin. Sin was his motive
to cast down Angels into Hell; to thrust Adam out of Paradise; to turn cities
into ashes, to ruinate nations; to torment his own bowels in the similitude of
sinful flesh: because of sin he drowned the old world; and because of sin,
ere long will burn this. All this makes for the truth of my propounded
doctrine.

Three transgressions and four, that is, Many sins do pluck down from
heaven, the most certain wrath and vengeance of God upon the sinners. A lesson
(dearly beloved) able to make us (if grace be in us) to be wary, and to take
heed, that we be not overtaken with three transgressions and with four. It is
a very dangerous thing to add sin to sin. This is done Perkins Cas. Consc.
three manner of ways.

1 By committing one sin in the neck of another. 2 By falling often into the
same sin. 3 By lying in sin without repentance.
Here we must remember, that we are not simply condemned for our particular
sins, but for our continuance, and residence in them. Our sins committed do
make us worthy of damnation; but our living and abiding in them without
repentance, is the thing, that brings damnation;

Great is the D. King B. of London in Ion. Lect. 31.
strength that sin gathers, by growing, and going forwards. The growth of sin
In Amos 1.3.
Albertus Magnus shaddoweth in marshaling the order of sinning: first is
peccatum cogitationis, next loquutionis, thirdly operis, then desperationis.
The beginning of sin is inward, an evil thought; it hastes out into an evil
word; then follows the wicked work: what is the end of all? Desperation,
waited on by final impenitencie.

This growth of sin, S. Hierome plainly expresses. The first step is,
cogitare, quae mala sunt; a wicked thought; the next, cogitationibus
adquiescere peruersis; to like well of wicked thoughts; the third, quod mente
decreveris, opere complere; to put that in action, which thou have wickedly
imagined. What is the end of all? Non agere poenitentiam, and in suo sibi
complacere delicto: even impenitencie, and a delight, or pleasure to do
naughtely.

Hugo the Cardinal in sins proceeding, notes, 1 Suggestion. 2 Consent. 3
Action. 4 Custom, and pleasure therein.


Suggestion is from the Devil, who casts into our hearts impure and ungodly
thoughts: the rest are from our selves; (such is the corruption of our nature,)
we readily consent to the Devils motion; what he moves us to, we act
accordingly; we take pleasure in it, and make it our custom. This Custom is
not only a grave to bury our souls in, but a great stone also rolled to the
mouth of it, to keep them down for ever. I say no more to this point; but
beseech you for Gods sake, to be wary, and heedfull, that you be not overtaken
with three transgressions, and with four.

You have now my propounded doctrine; and the first use to be made of it. My
doctrine was.

Three transgressions and four, that is, Many sins do pluck down from
heaven the most certain wrath and vengeance of God upon the sinners. The first
use is, to make us wary and heedfull, that we be not overtaken with with three
transgressions, and with four.

A second use, is to move us to a serious co^templation of the wonderful
patience of Almighty God: who did so graciously forbear to punish those
Syrians of Damascus, till they had provoked him to displeasure by three
transgressions, and by four. God is merciful, and gracious, long suffering,
and of great goodness. He cries unto the fools, (and are not we such
fools?) Prou. 1.22. O ye foolish, how long will ye love foolishnes? He cries
unto the faithless (and is our faith living?) Matthew. 17.17. O generation
faithless, and crooked, how long now shall I suffer you? He cries (...) the
Jews, (and are not we as bad as the Jews?) O (...), I^^^salem, (...) often?
He dressed his vineyard with the b^^t and ^^^dliest husbandry, that his heart
could invent, (...) he looked for fruit; he required it (...) first h^^^e, but
^arrying the full time, he looked that it should being forth grapes, in the
autumn, and time of vintage. He wayteth for the fruit of his Luke 13.6.
figgtree three years; and is content to be entreated, that digging, and
dunging, and expectation a fourth year may be bestowed upon it.

Thus we see Gods patience is wonderful; He is merciful gracious, long
suffering, and of great goodness. Yet may we not hereon presume. Our safest way
shall be to rise at the first call; if we differ our obedience to the second
call, we may be prevented. Then may God justly say to us, as he said unto the
Jews, Esai. 65.12. I called, and ye did not answer; I spoke and ye heard
not. And albeit some fall seven times a day, and rise again; albeit to some
sinners it pleases the Lord to iterate his sufferance, yet may not we take
encouragement thereby, to iterate our misdoings. We know that God punished his
Angels in heaven for one breach; Adam for one morsel; Miriam for one sclander;
Moses for one angry word; Achan for one sacrilege; Ezechias for once showing
his treasures to the Ambassadors of Babel; Josias for once going to war
without asking counsel of the LORD; and Ananias and Sapphira for once lying to
the holy Ghost.

Is the Lords hand now shortened that he cannot be as speedy, and quick, in
avenging himself upon us for our offenses? Far be it from us so to think.
God is not slack in coming, as some count slacknes: He makes the clouds his
Chariots, he rides upon the Cherubins, he flies with the wings of the wind;
and so he comes; and comes quickly, and his reward is with him to give to
every one, according as his works shall be.

THE SEVENTH LECTVRE
AMOS 1.3. Because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron.


THis is the third part of this Prophecy: the description of that great sin
by which the Syrians so much offended. Let us first examine the words.

Gilead] Gilead, or Galaad, or Galeed, in holy Scripture is sometime a hill,
sometime a city, and sometime a regio^, or cuntry. A hill, Genesis 13. So named as
appears verse. the 47. of the heap of stones, which was made thereon, as a
witness of the league between Jacob, and Laban: for Gilead is interpreted an
Acervus testimonii.
heap of witness.

This mountain Gilead, is the Adrichom.
greatest of al beyond Jordan: it is in length 50 miles; and as it is
continued, and runs a long, it receives diverse names. From Arnon to the
city Cedar, it is called Galaad; the^ to Bozra it is named Seir, afterward
Hermon, and so reaching to Damascus it is joined to Libanus: and therefore as
St. Comment in hunc locu^.
Hierome says; in the 22. of Ierem. verse. 6. Lebanon is called the head, or
beginning of Galeed.

Gilead, or Galaad, or Galeed is also a city, built upon mount Gilead, as St
Hierome witnesses. Here was borne, and buried, the valiant captain, and judge
of Israel, Iephte, when he had judged Israel six years; as Judge. 12.7.
Against this city Hoseah prophecieth chap. 6.8. Gilead is a city of them, that
work iniquity and is polluted with blood.

Gilead, or Galaad, or Galeed, is also a region, or country, called, De^ (...)
possessed by the R^^benits, Gadite^ (...) of (...): as Number. 32.33.

If Gilead the city, book (...) in my text, it is a figure; the figure
Synecdoche: a part for the whole; one city, the Metropolitan city for the
whole cuntry. If the land of Gilead, be the Gilead in my text, it is a figure
too; the figure Metonymia; the land of Gilead, for the inhabitants thereof. The
inhabitants of the land of Gilead were Gods own people, his people Israel, of
the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh: against whom the Syrians of Damascus
did so rage, as that they are noted in my text to have threshed them with
threshing instruments of iron.

These threshing instruments are not in use among us. Yet will I, as well as I
may, out of the ancient, and learned, describe the^ to you. One of the Hebrew
Doctors Mercer. Pagnin. in Lex. in (...)
R. David Kimchi makes them to be planks of wood, to the which on the nether
side are fastened little stones, to part the wheat from the husk, and chafe;
which cannot be the threshing instruments in this place because these were of
iron.

St Hierome says, they were a kind of waynes, or carts, with wheels of iron,
and toothed, to beat out corn from the husk, and to bray, or bruise straw, and
stubble, to be meat for cattle, when hay is scarce. Nicolaus de Lyra joins
with S. Hierome in opinion.

Iunius.
Some do take these instruments to be Tribulis ferreis.
iron flailes, or carres, or corn carts, or some such like instrument, of
old time in use for the threshing out of corn. Of this opinion Iunius by his
translation seems to be, and Calvin disallowes it not.

Here some do understand Rast. is ferreis
iron rakes, as Gualter; some Trahis ferreis
dreyes or sleddes of iron, as Marinus in his Arca Noe; some Rotis ferreis.
wheels of iron, as Theodotio, and Symmachus; some Serris ferreis.
sawes of iron, as the Septuagint, and Calvin; some Avec herses de ser.
harrowes of iron as the French translation. Whatsoever were the threshing
instruments in this place; whether waines, or carts, or carres, or dreys, or
sleds of iron, or wheels of iron, or flayles of iron, or rakes of iron, or
harrowes of iron, or sawes of iron: it is out of doubt, that the holy Spirit by
this kind of speech ( they threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron)
notes the extreme cruelty practiced by the Syrians, against the people of
God, the Gileadites, the Israelites, of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh.

They threshed Gilead Winckleman here notes a Metaphore, or translation, put
by the holy Spirit to design, or signify the notorious cruelty of the Syrian
Kings upon the Gileadites; but I take it to be a proper speech of a true thing,
indeed acted by Hazael, King of Syria, against the Gileadites; according to the
word of God which came to Elizeus the Prophet touching Hazael, 2. King. 8.12.
where Elizeus weeping thus speaks unto Hazael: I knew the evil that thou
shall do unto the children of Israel: their strong cities shall thou set on
fire; their young men shall thou slay with the sword; thou shall dash their
infants against the stones; and rent in pieces their women with child.

But you will say, what is this to the Gileadites? I answer, very much; as you
may see, 2. King. 10.33. where Hazael is said to smite the Israelites in all
the coasts of Israel, from Jordan Eastward, even all the land of Gilead, the
Gadites, and the Reubenits, and them that were of Manasseh, from Aroer, (which
is by the river Arnon) and Gilead, and Bashan. All these regions did King
Hazael grievously torment, and bring to much woe, and misery; but specially
the Gileadites, who therefore are twice mentioned in the forecited conquest of
Hazael: The Gileadites did Hazael, King of Aram, destroy, and make like dust
beaten to powder, 2. King. 13.7.

They threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of yron] The like torments
have been inflicted, with the good approbation of Almighty God, by King David
upon the Ammonites, 2. Sam. 12.31. where you shall find, that King David after
his victory over Rabbah, a city of the Ammonites, carried away the
Inhabitants that were therein, and put them under sawes, and under iron
harrowes, and under axes of iron, and cast them into the tile kelne.

Thus did David, guided by Gods own Spirit, deal with the Ammonites. His
course was warrantable, because he was guided by (...) destitute, could (...)
threshing Gilead with threshing (...) of (...) so with the Am^^^^^^s, (...) God
whereas Hazael, Gods enemy, dealt so with the (...); the people of God.

He threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of yron] A course that God can
be content shall be taken with Moab, Esai. 25.10. Moab shall be threshed, as
straw is threshed? but that his own people Israel, or any part of them, as the
Gilladites be thus used, God likes it not. Witness my text, where the LORD
protests that he will not turn Damascus, that is, that he will not recall
the Syrians from their error into the right way, that he will not bring them
again into his favor; that he will leave them to themselves, because they have
threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron.

Now let us see what lessons may be taken from hence for out further
instruction, and meditation. Gods dislike with Damascus, for threshing (...)
with threshing instruments of iron I yields us this (...).

God (...) never will pleased with too much cruelty. This truth will well
appear unto us, if we do but consider how God has evermore rewarded cruelty.
The cruel tyrant Adonibezek did cut of the th^^bes, and great ^o^s of seauenty
Kings, and caused them to gather the crummes under his table, Judge. 1.7. but
what was his reward? As he had done to those captive Kings, so did God do to
him again. The Israelites under the leading of their captain Judah, took
Adonibezek prisoner, and cut off the thumbes of his hands, and great toes of
his feet, verse the 6.

Agag King of the Amalekites by his sword had made many a woman childlesse, 1.
Sam. 15.33. but what was his reward? You may see in the same verse what Samuel
said, and did unto him. Samuel said, as thy sword has made women childlesse;
so shall thy mother be childlesse among other women; and Samuel hewed Agag in
pieces before the LORD in Gilgal,

The Babylonians were wonderful cruel, and hard hearted against the
inhabitants of Jerusalem: they spared none of the^, no not their young
children, but cruelly destroyed them, and all theirs. But what was their
reward? You may see it by the prophetical denuntiation of the ruin of Babel,
Psalm. 13 7, 8, 9. O daughter of Babel, worthy to be destroyed: blessed shall he
be that rewards thee as thou have served us; blessed shall he be that takes
and dasheth thy children against the stones. This reward of Babel is enlarged
Esaias. 13.16. Their children shall be broken in pieces before their eyes: their
houses shall be spoiled; and their wives ravished.

Thus not to trouble you with many examples, we see by the reward of cruelty
in the examples of Adonibezek, Agag, and the Babylonians, that God abhors
it. God abhors cruelty, howsoever he does punish it with another cruelty.
God repaieth cruelty with cruelty, according to the well known proverb, Matthew.
7.2. With what measure you mete, with the same shall men measure to you again.

The use of the doctrine now confirmed, is to work in us the love of clemency,
and mercifulness. When we are well assured, that the cruel themselves shall
taste of cruelty by way of punishment, we will be afraid to behave our selves
toward any cruelly. All cruelty is checked by the law of God, by the sixth
commandment, Thou shall do no murder; or Thou shall not kill.

The law that is written Deuteronomy. 25.3. touching forty stripes, and not above, to
be given to an offender, should draw our cruel rage and fierce affections to
pity, and compassion. The tenor of the law is: If a wicked man be condemned
to be beaten, the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before
his face according to his trespass unto a certain number forty stripes shall
he cause him to have and not past, lest if he should exceed, and beat him above
that with many stripes, thy brother should appear despised in thy sight.

We may be many ways guilty of cruelty. First, if we exercise tyrannous
cruelty, in inflicting punishments. This we know by the above cited place out
of Deuteronomy. 25.

Secondly, if we fight with, or beat our neighbor, or maime his body. This is
a (...), and a breach of the sixth commandment: but specially (...), Levit.
24.19, 20. If a man cause any blemish in (...) has done, so shall it be done
to him. Breach for (...) for t^^th; such a blemish as he has make in any,
(...) such shall be repai^d to him.

Thirdly, if we procure any way the death of our neighbor, whether it be by
the sword, by famine, by poison, by false accusation, or otherwise. This is a
cruelty, and a breach of the sixth commandment. The offender in this behalf
may be rankt with Cain, Genesis 4.8. where it is said: Caine rose against his
brother, and slew him.

Fourthly, if we use any of Gods creatures hardly. This is a cruelty, and a
breach of the sixth commandment: but specially controlled, Deuteronomy. 22.6. If thou
find a birds nest in the way, in any tree, or on the ground, whether they be
young, or eggs, and the damme sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shall
not take the damme with the young, but shall in any wise let the damme go, and
take the young to thee, that thou may prosper, and pro^ing thy days. This
special cruelty is taxed, Prove. 12.10. where we are told, That the righteous
man regards the life of his beast.

Fifthly, if because of our neighbors infirmities, we use him discourteously,
and make him our laughing stock, or taunting recreation. This is a cruelty, and
a breach of the sixth commandment: but specially checked, Levit. 19.14. Thou
shall not curse the d^^st; nor put a stumbling block before the blind.

Sixthly, if we injury a stranger. This a cruelty, and specially controlled,
Exodus 22.21. Thou shall not do injury to a stranger, neither oppress him.

Seaventhly, if we molest any widow, or fatherless child. This is a cruelty,
and specially checked, Exodus 22.22. Ye shall not trouble any widow, or
fatherless child.

Eighthly, if we wrong the poor. This is a cruelty, and a breach of the sixth
commandment. This cruelty we are guilty of many ways.

First, if we lend money to the poor upon usury. This cruelty is taxed, Exodus
22.25. If thou lend money to the poor with thee, thou shall not be as an usurer
unto him, ye shall not oppress him with usury.

Secondly, if we pay not the poor labourer his hire. This cruelty is taxed,
Deuteronomy. 24.14. Thou shall not oppress a needy and poor hired servant: thou
shall give him his hire for his day: the Sun shall not go down upon it: for he
is poor, and therewith sustaineth his life, lest he cry against thee to the
LORD; and it be sin unto thee.

Thirdly, if we restore not the pledge of the poor. This cruelty is taxed,
Exodus 22.26. If thou take thy neighbors raiment to pledge, thou shall restore
it unto him before the Sun go down. For it is his only covering and garment
for his skin.

Fourthly, if we withdraw our corn from the poor. This cruelty is taxed,
Prove. 11.26. He that withdraws corn, the people will curse him. Whosoever he
be that withdraws his corn from the market, where it should be sold, keeping
it against a dear time; the people will curse him: they will speak, as they
have just occasion, all manner of evil of him, as that he is a covetous and
miserable wretch.

Now (dearly beloved) you have been taught out of the eternal word of
truth, that many ways you may be guilty of cruelty, and so break the sixth
commandment of Almighty God. If you fight with, or beat your neighbor, or
maime his body: if by any means you procure the death of your neighbor: if
you use your neighbor discourteously, or make him your laughing stock, or
tau^ting recreatio^? if you use any of Gods creatures hardly: if you injury
strangers: if you molest fatherless children, and widows: if you be too
severe in punishing your servants, or children: if you wrong the poor, either
by lending him your money upon usury: or by not paying him his hire: or by not
restoring him his pledge: or by with drawing your corn from him; if you offend
but in the lest of these, you are guilty of cruelty, and transgressors of Gods
holy commandment. The consideration whereof if it work in you the love of
clemency, and mercifulness, happy are you: if not; I have discharged my duty.

Thus (...) can c^^ried by my first doctrine, grounded upon these words: They
have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of (...). My doctrine was God
is never well pleased with (...). Now be patient, I beseech you, while upon the
same words I ground a se^o^d doctrine.

They have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:] They] that is,
the Syrians, Gods enemies, have threshed Gilead] that is, some of the
Israelites, Gods own people, with threshing instruments of iron. The lesson we
learn from hence is.

God often humbles his servants under his foes, and their adversaries. This
point is notably verified, in Lot sore pressed upon by the Sodomites, Gen*
19.9. in the Israelites hardly dealt with by the Egyptians, Exodus 1.11. etc.
in the 70. bre^hren, sons of Ierabbam, persecuted by Ab^molech, most of the
unto the death, Judge. 9.5. in Jeremy twice evil entreated; first beaten, and
put in the stocks by Pashare, Ier. 20.2. and a second time beaten and
imprisoned by Z^dechias his nobles, Ierem. 37.15. In the three children, cast
into the fiery furnace by Nabuchodonosor, Dan. 5.21.

Many more are the examples registered in the book of God, fit to prove this
point: which also may further appear unto you, in those bloody persecutions
after Christ his death by the Roman Emperors, in those strange torments which
they devised to keep down religion, and religious professors, men and women;
they plucked of their skins quick; they boared out their eyes with wimbles;
they broyled the^ alive on gredirons; they scalded them in boiling liquors;
they enclosed the^ in barrels, and driving great nails through, tumbled them
down mountains, till their own blood so cruelly drawn out, stiffled, and
choked them in the barrels: women's breasts were scared of with burning yrons,
their bodies rent, and their iointes racked. Many more were the grievous
torments, endured by the faithful in the time of the ten first persecutions in
the primitive Church. All, and every of which, do strongly prove my doctrine,
God often humbles his servants under his foes, and their adversaries.

The reason why God humbles his servants, under his, and their enemies, is
their disobedience to his word. This is plain, Deuteronomy. 28.36, 37. If thou will
not obey the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep, and to do all his
commandments, and his ordinances, the LORD shall bring thee, and thy king unto
a nation, which neither thou, nor thy fathers have known; and there shall thou
serve other Gods, wood, and stone: And thou shall be a wonder, a proverb, and a
common talk among all the people, whether the LORD shall carry thee. Where you
see captivity, and banishment, denounced to Gods own people, if they disobey
his word.

You have now my doctrine, and the reason of it. My doctrine, God often
humbles his servants under his foes, and their adversaries.

The reason is, The disobedience of Gods servants to the word of God. The uses
of this doctrine.

1 To show unto us how great Gods anger is for sin, that does punish it so
severely, even in his dearest children. The consideration hereof should work
in us a loathing, hatred, and detestatio^ of sin. Yet such is the perversity of
our corrupt natures, that we daily fleet from sin to sin, like the fly, that
shifteth from sore to sore: we tempt the LORD, we murmur, we lust, we commit
idolatry: we have our eyes full of adultery, our hearts exercised with
covetousnes, our bodies weakened with dru^kennes; by all means we serve the
flesh, sitting down to eat, and rising to play. Never, more need, then now,
to smite our breasts, and pray with the Publicane, Luke 18.13. O God be
merciful unto us sinners.

2 To teach us, not to measure the favor of God toward our selves, or others,
by the blessings, or adversities of this life, seeing the wicked do often
flourish, when the godly are in great misery; and on the other side, the godly
do prosper, when the wicked are in distress.

In my text we see the Gileadites, a portion of ISRAEL; threshed with
instru^^^t^ of (...), by the ^ands of a wicked people, and Gods enemies, the
Syrians of Damascus. Behold the prosperity of the wicked. In Exodus 14. we see
the children of Israel passing through the red sea, a^ by dry land, whereas the
Egyptians assaying to do the like were drowned. Behold the prosperity of the
Godly.

Measure not therefore the favor of God, by the blessings or adversities of
this life. Whatsoever our estate be now or hereafter shall be, let us
therewith be contented. If God be pleased to bless us with peace, plenty, and
prosperity, blessed be his holy Name: and if he shall not like so to bless us,
but shall rather chastise us with trouble, want, and adversity; yet still
blessed be his holy Name: and his will be done.

3 To make us power out our souls in thankfulness before Almighty God, for our
present estate and condition. We know that our sworn enemies, the Popish crew,
and faction, have of long time envyed, and malized our happy peace. Had they
had power according to their will, how would they have used us? Would they not
have threshed us with threshing instruments of iron?

What mercy, or pity, could be expected from them, who with so inhumane,
barbarous, and cruel a plot, their plot of gunpowder, the like whereof was never
before heard of, would have blown up, and torn piecemeale, the King, Queen,
Prince, Lords, and Commons, the fifth of November This Sermon was preached Sept.

last, as you well know? what shall we render unto the LORD, for this so great a
deliverance. Let us render the calves of our lips applying David's song of
degrees, Psalm 124. to our present purpose.

1 If the Lord had not been on our side, (may great Britain now say.)

2 If the LORD had not been on our side, when the Popish sect rose up against
us.

3 They had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us.

4 Then had their Seven sparks of the enkindled soul by R.B.P. Psalm. 2. page

5 Then had we been like Ibid.
stubble in their way.

6 Praised be the LORD, who has not given us a pray unto their teeth.

7 Our soul is escaped, even as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the
snare is broken, and we are delivered.

8 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who has made heaven, and earth.

To this thankefulnes, I purpose further to incite you, if God give life, and
leave, upon the fifth of November next, the day appointed by act of parliament
for your public thanksgiving for that most happy deliverance. My text shall
be the Psalm now applied unto us, the 124. Mean time let us beseech Almighty
God to give his blessing to that which has been spoken, that it may
fructify, and bring forth fruit in us, in some thirty, in some sixty, in some
a hundred fold, to the glory of Gods holy name, and the salvation of our own
souls.

THE EIGHTH LECTVRE
AMOS 1.4. Therefore will I send a fire into the house of HAZAEL, and it shall
devour the palaces of BENHADAD, etc.


THis is the fourth part of this prophecy against the Syrians, wherein are set
down the punishments to be inflicted upon the Syrians for their sins, as
first I noted, Generally, verse the 4th. Specially, verse the 5th.


In the fourth verse, wherein the punishments to be inflicted upon the Syrians,
are generally set down, I note, 1 Who punishes. 2 How he punishes. 3 Whom he
punishes.


The punisher is the LORD; he punishes by fire. The punished are the Syrians,
to be understood in the names of their Kings, Hazael and Benhadad. I will send
a fire into the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the palaces of Benhadad.

The punisher is the LORD; for thus says the LORD, I will send. The note
yields us this doctrine, It is proper to the LORD to execute vengeance upon
the wicked for their sins.

In speaking of the vengeance of God, our first care must be, not to derogate
any thing from his proclivitie, and propensnes unto mercy. We must break out
into the mention of his great goodness, and sing alowd of his mercies, as
David does, Ps. 145.7. The Lord is gracious, and merciful, slow to anger; and
of great kindness; he is loving, and good to all; his mercy is over all his
works. The Lord strong, and mighty, blessed above all, yea being blessedness
it self, and therefore having no need of any man, is loving, and good unto
every man.

Our sins have provoked his vengeance against us: yet he, slow to anger, and
of great goodness; reserueth mercy for thousands, for all the elect, and
forgiueth all their iniquities, transgressions, and sins. His goodness here
rests not: it reaches also unto the reprobate, though they cannot feel the
sweet comfort of it. For he makes his Matthew. 5.45.
sun to rise on the evil, and the good; and sends rain on the just, and
unjust; yea many times the sun, and rain, and all outward, and temporary
blessings, are wanting to the just, and good, when the unjust, and evil do
flourish, and are in great prosperity.

Thus is Gods graciousnesse, and great bounty extended unto every man, whether
he be a blessed Abel, or a cursed Cain; a loved Jacob, or a hated Esau; an
elected David, or a rejected Saul. God is loving and good unto every man: the
Psalmist adds; and his mercies are over all his works. There is not any one
of Gods works, but it shows unto others, and finds in it self very large
testimonies, of Gods mercy, and goodness; I except not the damnation of the
wicked, much less the chastisements of the Godly.

Gods mercies are over all his works. David knew it well, and sang
accordingly, Psalm. 145.8. The Lord is gracious, and merciful, long suffering,
and of great goodness. Jonah knew it well, and confessed accordingly, chap.
4.2. Thou art a gracious God, and merciful slow to anger, and of great
kindness, and repentest thee of evil. The Church knows it well, and prays
accordingly: O God whose nature and property is ever to have mercy, and to
forgive, receive our humble petitions. David, Jonah, and the Church, all have
learned it at Gods own mouth, who having descended in a cloud to mount Sinai,
passed before the face of Moses and cried, as is recorded, Exodus 34.6. The
LORD, the LORD, strong, merciful, and graci^us, ^^ow to anger, and abundant in
goodness, and truth, reser^^ng mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity,
transgression, and sin. In which place of Scripture, although afterward there
follows a little of his justice, which he may not forget, yet we see the
maine stream runs concerning mildness, and kindness, and compassion:
whereby we may perceive, what it is, wherein the LORD delights. His delight
is to be a savior, a deliverer, a preserver, a redeemer, and a pardoner. As
for the execution of his judgments, his vengeance, and his fury, he comes
unto it with heavy and leaden fe^te.

To which purpose Zanchius alleges that of the Prophet Esai, chap. 28.21. The
Lord shall stand (as once he did in mount Perazim, when David overcame the
Philistines) he shall be angry (as once he was in the valley of Gibeon, when
Joshua disco^fited the five Kings of the Amorites) he shall stand, he shall be
angry, that he may do his work, his strange work, and bring to pass his
act, his strange act; out of which words of the Prophet he notes that Gods
works are of two sorts; either proper unto himself, and natural; as, to have
mercy, and to forgive: or else strange and somewhat diverse from his nature;
as, to be angry, and to punish.

I know some do expound these words otherwise, understanding by that strange
work, and strange act of God, there mentioned, Opus aliquod insolens, and
admirabile, some such work as God seldom works; some great wonder.
Notwithstanding this natural exposition of that place, the former may well be
admitted also. For it is not altogether unnatural, being grounded upon such
places of Scripture, as do make for the preeminence of mercy above justice.
It Is true: God has one skale of justice, but the other proves the heavier;
mercy does overweigh. He who is ever just, is merciful more then ever, if it
may be possible. He may forget our iniquities, but his tender mercies he will
never forget.

This our LORD, good, merciful, gracious, and long suffering, is here in my
text the punisher, and sends fire into the house of Hazael: whereupon I built
this doctrine; It is proper to the LORD to execute vengeance upon the wicked
for their sins.

This office of executing vengeance upon the wicked for sins, God arrogateth
and assumeth to himself, Deuteronomy. 32.35. where he says, vengeance, and
recompense are mine. This due is ascribed unto the LORD by St Paul, Romans
12.19. It is written vengeance is mine, I will repaie, says the LORD. By the
author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, chap. 10.30. Vengeance belongs unto
me, I will recompense, says the LORD. By the sweet singer, Psalm. 94.1. O LORD
God, the avenger, O God, the avenger.

You see by these now-cited places, that God alone is he who executes
vengeance upon the wicked for their sins. This doctrine is faithfully
delivered, by the wise son of Sirach. chap. 39. where he says: verse. 28.
There be spirits that are created for vengeance, which in their rigor lay on
sure strokes; in the time of destruction they show forth their power, and
accomplish the wrath of him, that made them: Fire, and hail, and famine, and
death, 29.
al these are created for vengeance: The teeth of wild beasts, 30.
and the scorpions, and the serpents, and the sword, execute vengeance for the
destruction of the wicked. Nay, says he, verse. 26.
The principal things for the whole use of man's life: as water, and fire, and
iron, and salt, and meal, and wheat, and honey, and milk, and the blood of
the grape, and oil, and clothing, 27.
All those things though they be for good unto the godly, yet to the sinners
they are turned unto evil. So my doctrine stands good; It is proper to the
LORD to execute vengeance upon the wicked for their sins.

And you see he has ways enough to do it. All things that may be for our
good, are glad to do him service against us.

The consideration hereof should move our hearts to wisdo^e. It should move
us Hereof I spoke in a Sermon upon Hebr. 10.30.
to beware of those crying sins usually committed against the first table,
that we provoke not Gods vengeance against us, by Idolatry, in worshipping the
creature above the creator, blessed for ever; by tempting God, in making trial
whether his word be true, or not; by murmuring against God in laying injustice
to his charge, quod bonis male sit, and malis been; for afflicting the godly,
when the wicked live at ease; by rebellion and contumacie, in taking counsel
together against the LORD, and against his CHRIST; by blasphemy, in doing
despite to the Spirit of grace.

It may move us also to beware of those other sins, crying sins too, usually
committed against the second table; that we provoke not Gods vengeance against
us by dishonouring our parents, and such as God has put in place of government
above us; by grieving our children, and such as are by us to be governed; by
oppressing the fatherless, and the poor; by giving our selves over unto
filthy lusts.

Beloved in the Lord, let us not forget this: though God, be good, gracious,
merciful, and long suffering, yet is he also a just God; God the avenger, and
punisher. Here we see he resolves to send a fire into the house of Hazael;
which is, the second thing to be considered; How God punishes: By fire. I will
send a fire etc.

Albeit sometime God himself does by himself immediately execute his vengeance
upon the wicked; as when he smote all the first borne of Egypt, Exodus 12.29.
and Nabal, 1. Sam. 25.38. and Vzzah, 2. Sam. 6.7. yet many times he does it by
his instruments: Wigand. Syntagm. Vet. Test.
Instrumenta sunt tota creatura Dei; All the creatures of God are ready at his
command to be the executioners of his vengeance. Among the rest, and in the
first rank, is fire.

God sent a fire to lay wast Sodom and Gomorah, and their sister cities, Genesis
19.24. to eat up Nadab, and Abihu, Levit. 10.2. to cut of the two hundred, and
fifty men, that were in the rebellion of Korah, Number. 16.35. to devour two
captains, and twice fifty men, 2. King. 1.10. and 12. I will not load your
memories with multitude of examples for this point. My text tells you, that
fire, Gods creature, becomes Gods instrument, and executioner of his
vengeance: I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it shall devour
the palaces of Benhadad.

By fire in this place the learned Lyranus. Drusius. Ar. Mo^tanus. Mercer.
Calvin. Gualter.
expositors do understand not only natural fire, but also the sword, and
pestilence, and famine; quodlibet genus consumptionis, every kind of
consumptio^, every scourge, wherewith God punishes the wicked, and
disobedient, be it hail, or thunder, or sickness, or any other of Gods
messengers. So far is the signification of fire, though not in the natural,
yet in the metaphorical understanding extended. The doctrine which from hence
I gather is.

As is the fire, so are all other creatures at the Lords commandment to be
employed by him in the punishment of the wicked. This truth well appears by
that which I even now repeated out of Eccles. 39. whence you heard, that some
spirits are created for vengeance; as also are fire, and hail, and famine, and
death, and the teeth of wild beasts, and the scorpions, and the serpents, and
the sword; yea, that the principal things for the whole use of man's life, as
water, and fire, and iron, and salt, and meal, and wheat, and honey, and
milk, and the blood of the grape, and oil, and clothing, are all for evil
unto the wicked. If that proof, because the book, whence it is taken, is
Apocryphal, like you not: give ear I pray you, while I prove it out of
Canonical Scripture. The doctrine to be proved is.

Fire, and all other creatures, are at the Lords commandment to be employed by
him in the punishment of the wicked. I prove it by the service of Angels, and
other creatures. 2. King. 19.35. we read of an hundred fourscore and five
thousand in the camp of Ashur slain by an Angel of the LORD. The thing is
related also, Esaias 37.36. This ministry of Gods Angels David acknowledges,
Psalm. 35.5, 6. where his prayer against his enemies is, that the Angel of the
LORD might scatter, and persecute them. 1. Sam. 7.10. we read that the LORD did
thunder a great thunder upon the Philistines. Ezech. 14. we read how the LORD
punishes a sinful land, with his four Ezech. 14.21.
sore judgments, the sword, pestilence, famine, and noisome beasts.

The story of Gods visitation upon Pharaoh, and the Egyptia^s in Exodus chap. 8,
9, and 10. is fit for my purpose. You shall there find, that froggs, lice,
flies, grasshoppers, thunder, hail, lightning, murraine, boteh^s, and sores did
instrume^tally avenge God upon man, and beast in Egypt. Add hereto what you
read, Psalm. 148.8. fire and hail, and snow, and vapors, and stormy winds do
execute Gods commandment. Thus is my doctrine proved, As is the fire, so are
all other creatures at the Lords commandment to be employed by him in the
punishment of the wicked.

The use of this doctrine, is to teach us: how to behave our selves, at such
times, as God shall visit us with his rodd of correction, how to carry our
selves in all our afflictions. We must not so much look to the instruments, as
to the Lord that smites by them.

Here set we before our eyes holy King David. His patience! be it the pattern
of our Christian imitation. When Shimei a man of the family of the house of
Saul, came out against him, cast stones at him, and railed upon him, calling
him to his face a man of blood, and a man of Belial, a murderer, and a wicked
man, the good King did not, as he was wished to do: he took not away the
murderers life, but had respect to the primus motor, even Almighty God, the
first mover of this his afflictie; Shimei he knew was but the instrument. And
therefore thus says he to Abischai, 2. Sam. 16.10. He curses, because the
LORD had hidden him curse David; and who dare then say, wherefore have thou
done so? Suffer him to curse for the Lord has bidden him.

Here also set we before our eyes holy Job. His patience be it the pattern of
our Christian imitation. The loss of all his substance, and his children, by
the Sabeans, Chaldeans, fire from heaven, and a great wind from beyond the
wilderness, could not turn away his eyes from the God of heaven to those
second causes. They he knew were but the instruments. And therefore possessing
his soul in patience he said, Job 1.21. Naked came I out of my mothers womb,
and naked shall I return thither: the LORD has given, and the LORD has
taken: blessed be the name of the LORD.

To these instances of David, and Job, add one more; that of the blessed
Apostles, Peter, John, and the rest, Act. 4.27. Though Herod, Pontius Pilate,
the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, had crucified and done to death the
Lord of life, our LORD and Savior Jesus Christ. Yet did not the Apostles
therefore grow into a rage, and bitter speeches against them. In that great
execution of the LORD Jesus, they had regard unto the hand of God. Herod,
Pontius Pilat, the Gentiles, and the Jews, they knew, were but instruments. For
thus make they their confession before the LORD of heaven and earth, verse the
28. Doubtless both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the
people of Israel, gathered themselves together against thine holy Son Jesus,
to do whatsoever thine hand, and thy counsel had determined to be done.

To good purpose then is that question propounded by Amos chap. 3.6. Shall
there be evil in a city, and the Lord has not done it? It may serve for an
anchor to keep us, that we be not carried away with the waves of tribulation,
and affliction. It assures us that God, who bad Shimei curse David, who sent
the Sabeans, Chaldeans, fire from heaven, and a great wind from beyond the
wilderness to spoil, and make an end of Jobs substance, and his children; who
determined that Herod, Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the Israelites,
should put to death the LORD of life: that the same God has his finger, yea
and his whole hand too, in all our crosses, and tribulations. Is there any
evil in the city, and the LORD has not done it?

Here (beloved in the Lord) must we be taxed for a vanity at least, (I had
almost said a blasphemy) deeply rooted, and too well settled among us. Upon the
access of any calamity we cry out, bad luck, bad fortune. If the strong man
come into our house, and take from us the flower of our riches, our silver and
gold, then we cry, What luck? What fortune? If our sheep and cattle fail us,
then also we cry, What luck? What fortune? Whatsoever cross befalls us;
luck, and fortune is still in our mouths: Quasi Deus ^tium coleret in coelo,
and non curaret res humanas; as if we were to hold it for an article of our
belief, that God lives idly in heaven, and has no regard of man's affairs.
Whereas the holy Prophet Amos in propounding this question; shall there be any
evil in (...), and the LORD has not done it? and the holy Apostles, in
acknowledging Gods hand in the death of Christ, and holy Job in blessing the
name of the LORD for all his losses, and holy David, in patiently taking
Shimeis curses, as an affliction sent him from the LORD, do all plainly show
this, that the empire of this world is administered by Almighty God, and that
nothing happens unto us, but by Gods hand, and appointment. Learn we then
more patience toward the instruments of our calamities, miseries, crosses, and
afflictions: let us not be like the dog, that snatcheth at the stone cast at
him, without regard unto the thrower. Here we learn a better property: even
to turn our eyes from the instruments, to the hand that smites by them. Thus
far of my second circumstance; How God punishes.

My third was, whom he punisheth] Hazael and Benhadad; the house of Hazael,
and palaces of Benhadad. If you will know who and Hazael was, you must have
recourse to the s^cre^ story, 2 King* ^. There (...) you find him sent by
Benhadad, King of Syria, with a present unto Eliz^us to know concerning his
sickness, whether he should recover of it; and after his return from Elizeus,
with a thick we^ cloth to have strangled, and murdered his Lord* and Master,
King Benhadad. This was he, whom Elizeus foretold of his hard usage of the
Israelites; that he should set on fire their strong cities; should slay their
young men with the sword; should dash their infants against the stones; and
should rent in pieces their women great with child. This was he, who 2. Kings
13.7. so destroyed the children of Israel, that he made them like dust (...)
to powder. This was he of whose death we read verse the 24.

The house of Hazael] either the family, flock, and posterity of Hazael; as
Arias Montanus, Mercer, Drusius expound: or some material house, which Hazael
had proudly and stately built for himself, and his posterity. This later
exposition is added to the former by Mercer, and Drusius, because of that which
follows, the palaces of Benhadad.

Benhadad] In writing this name, I find three errors. One of the Greeks who
write (...), as if it were in the Hebrew Benader. The second of the Latins,
who write it Benhadab. The third of Jonathan, the Chaldee paraphrast, who
writes it Barhadad: whereas the right name is Benhadad.

Benhadad (says Mercer upon this place) was a name peculiar to the Kings of
Syria; as was first Pharaoh, and afterward Ptolemee to the Kings of Egypt, and
Caesar to the Roman Emperors. From this opinion of Mercer, Drusius in
observat. sacr. 11. 14. varieth, affirming that albeit diverse Kings of Syria
were called by this name Benhadad, yet does it not thereupon follow, that
Benhadad was a common name to all the Kings of Syria.

In holy Scripture we read of three Benhadads. Of the first, 1. Kings, 15.18.
who was King of Syria, at what time Asa reigned in Judah, and Baasha in Israel.
Of the second, 2. Kings, 8.7. who in his sickness sent Hazael to Elizeus, the
man of God, for counsel. Of the third, ^. Kings, 13.3. who was Hazaels son,
and his successor in the throne.

Now the Benhadad in my text, is either Benhadad, Hazaels predecessor, slain
by Hazael, or Benhadad, Hazaels son, and successor.

The palaces of Benhadad,] to be devoured by fire from the LORD. These palaces
of Benhadad are the goodly, sumptuous, proud, and stately edifices made, or
enlarged, by either of the Benhadads, or by both; Hazaels predecessor, and
successor.

Thus have you the exposition of my third circumstance, which was concerning
the parties punished; no mean parties; parties of no lower rank then Kings:
Hazael, and Benhadad; The LORD punishes, he punishes by fire; he punishes
by fire Hazael, and Benhadad; I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, and
it shall devour the palaces of Benhadad. Many profitable doctrines may be
hence deduced. I can but point at them.

1 In that the Lord sends a fire into the house of Hazael, against his (...),
who are put in mind of a truth expressed in the seco^^ com^andement; this: God
will (...) of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
generation.

Dearly (...) is that anger, the flame of whose punishment (...) smoke so
far: yet the meaning thereof is, as Ezech^^? shows, chap. 18. If the
children do follow the fathers wickedness, and not otherwise. To visit then,
is not to punish the children for the fathers offenses, but to take notice, and
apprehend them in the same faults, by reason they are given over to commit
their fathers transgressions, that for them they be punished.

The use is, to admonish you that are Parents, not only to live your selves
virtuously, and religiously, while you have your abode here, but also carefully
to see to the training up of your children, in virtue, and true religion, least
partaking with you in your sins, they pro^e inheritours of your punishments
also.

2 In that the LORD sends a fire into the house, and palaces of Hazael, and
Benhadad, two Kings: we learn this lesson.

It is neither wealth, nor policy, nor power, nor preferment, that can stood
us, if Gods unappeasable ang^^ ^reak out against us for our sins. The reason
hereof we read, Ierem. 4.4. It Is this: Because of the wickedness of our
inventions, Gods wrath comes forth like fire, and burns that none can quench
it.

The use is to teach us, that we despise not Gods judgments nor abuse his
mercies; but that we tremble at the one, and be drawn to well doing by the
other.

3 In that the LORD sends a fire into the palaces of Benhadad, to devour
them we learn thus much.

God depriveth us of a great blessing, when he takes from us our dwelling
houses. The great commodity, or contentment, that comes to every one of us
by our dwelling houses, does experimentally make good unto us this truth.

The use is; to teach us, first, to be humbled before Almighty God, whenever
our dwelling houses are taken from us. Secondly since we peaceably enjoy our
dwelling houses, to use them for the furtherance of Gods glory. Thirdly, to
praise God day by day for the comfortable use we have of our dwelling houses.
It would tire you to hear these doctrines, and their uses severally amplified,
and enlarged. In the sequel of this chapter, I shall have occasion to repeat
them to you.

THE NINTH LECTVRE.
AMOS 1.5. I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut of the inhabitant
of Bikeath-Aven, and him that holds the scepter out of Beth-Eden, and the
people of Aram shall go into captivity unto Kir.


WE are now come to the second branch of the fourth part of this prophecy, in
the 5. verse, wherein are set down more specially the punishments to be
inflicted upon the Syrians for their sins. And this is done in four several
clauses. In each we may observe three circumstances.

1 The punisher; the LORD, either immediately by himself or mediatly by his
instruments. 2 The p^^ished* the Syrians, not of any one city only, but of the
whole country; which we gather from these names, Damascus, Bikeath-Aven,
Beth-eden, and Aram. 3 The punishment; the spoil of the country, and ruin of
the whole state. The bar of Damascus must be broken; the inhabitant of
Bikeath-Aven, and the King, keeping his court at Beth-Eden, must be cut of: and
the people of Aram must go into captivity.
Of the words as they lie in order.

I will also break the bar of Damascus] I, the LORD, Job 9.5, 6. etc
remove mountains, and they feel not when I overthrow them; I remove the
earth out of her place, and make her pillars to shake; I command the sun, and
it rises not; I close up the stars as under a signet: I my self alone
spread out the heavens, and walk upon the height of the sea: I make Arcturus,
Orion, and Pleiades, and the climates of the South: I, the LORD, who do great
things, and unsearchable, marvailous things, without number, Amos 5.8. and 9.6.
JEHOVAH is my name. I, the Lord, JEHOVAH, who have resolved to send a fire
into the house of Hazael, and palaces of Benhadad; I will also break the bar
of Damascus.

You know what a bar is in its proper signification: an instrument, wherewith
we make fast the gates of our cities, and doors of our houses, against the
violence of our enemies. If the bar be broken, the entrance into the city, or
house, will be the easier. Kedar is discovered to be weak, for want of bars,
Ier. 49.^1. And so are they against whom Gog, and Magog, were to fight, Ezech.
38.11. they had neither bars, nor gates. Jerusalem had both; and God made
them strong, Psalm. 147.13. Therefore praise the LORD, O Jerusalem, praise thy
God, O Sion; for he has made the bars of thy gates strong; so strong, that
no enemy is able to break them, or to make any irruption into them.

A bar is also used to a figurative sense; Metaphorically, and
Synecdochically; and betokens munition, fortification, the forts, and strong
holds of a country, the strength of any thing. To which sense the sea has
bars. We read of them, Job 38.10. God has appointed the sea her bars, and
doors, saying, hitherto shall thou come; here will I stay thy proud waves. And
the earth has bars. We read of the^, Ion. 2.6. And, what are the bars of
the earth, but the D. King B. of London in Ion. lect. 27.
strongest muniments, and senses it has; her promontories, and rocks, which
God has placed in her frontiers, to withstand the force of the waters? And
Moab has bars, Esai. 15.5. There the bars of Moab, are put for the forts
in the borders of Moab. And Egypt has bars, Ezech. 30.18. Where Egypts
bars after the exposition of Illyricus in his Verbo, Vectis.
key of Scriptures, are munitiones, and robur, the fortifications, and strength
of Egypt.

So here: the bars of Damascus, are Damasci Mercer.
rob^r, munitiones, porta, and ^l^^stra ^^^tissima; the strength of Damascus;
the munitions of Damascus; the gates of Damascus; the most fensed fortresses of
Damascus. Yea Gualter.
Vniversum regni robur, the whole strength of the kingdom of Syria, is to be
understood in these barr^s of Damascus.

Of Damascus] no base, or contemptible city. Jews Vertomannus, a gentleman of
Rome, in his travail to those esterne parts of the world a hundred years ago,
saw this city: and admiring the marveilous beauty thereof, has Navigat. cap. 5.
left a record of it to posterity. It is (says he) in manner incredible, and
passes all belief, to think how fair the city of Damascus is, and how
fertile is the soil. This Damascus is a city of great antiquity, See my sixth
lecture upon this chapter.
built as some conjecture by Eliezer, the steward of Abraham's house, who was
surnamed Damascus, Genesis 15.2. So that this city was built more then 3444.
years ago; for In the year of the world 2124. Funcc. in Cronolog. And this
Sermon was preached A. C. 1606. Febr. 8.
so long ago Abraham died. The first mention of this city is, Genesis 14.15.

Others holding the name of this city to have been more ancient then Abraham,
do attribute the building of this city to Huz, one of the sons of Aram; Genesis
10.23. whereupon Damascus was called also Ara^, as S. Hierome upon Esai 17.
witnesses. Whatsoever were the antiquity of this city, it is plain by Esai.
7.8. that it was the Metropolitan, and chiefest city of Syria. The Prophet
Jeremy gives it a high commendation, chap. 49.25. where he calls it a glorious
city, and the city of his joy. Damascus in this place, is not the bare city,
but Tremellius.
tractus Damascenus, sive Decapolitanus; the whole cuntry about Damascus, and
the coasts of Decapolis whereof we read, Mark. 7.31.

I will also break the bars of Damascus] To break in the Hebrew phrase, and
by a Metaphore, is to consume, to destroy, to wast, to spoil. In the 24 of Es.
verse. 19. where the Prophet says; confractione confringetur terra: the earth
shall with breaking be broken; the meaning is: the earth shall certainly be
wasted, and spoiled. So here; I will break the bar of Damascus, that is, I
will consume, and spoil, all the munitio^s, all the fortificatio^s, all the
fenced fortresses, all the strength of Damascus.

This office of breaking bars, God elsewhere assumeth to himself, as Esai.
45.2. where thus says the LORD unto Cyrus, his anointed; I will break the
braeson doors, and barst the iron bars. The Psalmist also ascribes unto the
LORD this office of breaking bars, Psalm. 107.16. where exhorting us to
confess before the LORD his loving kindness, and to declare his wonderful
works, he brings this for a reason: For he has broken the gates of brass,
and has bursts the bar of iron asunder. Now have you the meaning of these
words: I will break the bar of Damascus; I] the LORD, will breake] by my
mighty power, will lay wast, and consume, the barre] bar for bars, all the
strength, of Damascus] of that part of Syria, which bordereth upon Damascus.

Now let us see what lessons may be taken from hence for our further
instruction, and meditation. You will remember my three propounded
circumstances; The punisher, The punisheme^t, The punished. The punisher, is
the LORD; the punishment, is breaking of bars; the punished, is the whole
country of Damascus. From the first circumstance of the punisher, the LORD
himself taking vengeance into his own hand, I gather this doctrine.

It is proper to the LORD to execute vengeance upon the wicked for their
sins. This doctrine was in my last Lecture commended unto you, and then at
large confirmed. I need not make any repetition of it. The consideration of it
day after day, cannot be either vain or unfruitful to us. It may cause us to
be wary, and heedfull, that by our daily sinning we make not our selves John
8.34. Romans 6.20.
servants unto sin, and 2. Pet. 2.19.
corruption. And whereas we cannot but sin daily, (for who can say, I have
Prou. 20.9.
purged my heart, I am clean from my sin?) it may draw us to repentance, and
to a godly sorrow for our sins; whereby we have transgressed the law of
God, offended his Majesty, and provoked his wrath. We must believe it: though
God be good, gracious, merciful, and long suffering, yet is he also a just
God; God the avenger, and punisher.

The consideration of this point, may further admonish us, to be wary in any
case that we breath not after revengement. To revenge our (...), is Gods
(...), we must not intrude our selves into ^^ we (...) ^surpe it. Why will we
herein be our own c^rvers? The wise son of S^rach, chap. 28.1. speaks it
confidently: He that seeks vengeance, shall find vengeance of the LORD, and he
will surely keep his sins. Mark his exhortation following, verse the 2.
Forgive thy neighbor the hurt, that he has done to thee; so shall thy sins
be forgiven thee also.

Wise Siracides says no more, then does our Savior Jesus Christ, Matt. 6.14,
15. If ye do forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly father will also
forgive you. But if ye do not forgive me^ their trespasses; no more will your
father f^^giue you your trespasses. Dearly beloved, is this so? Will not God
forgive us, unless we forgive others? We must needs grant it to be so,
praying daily as we do; forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that
trespass against us.

Much then (beloved) very much to blame are we, who lead our lives, as if Lex
^alionis, that same old law of rendering like for like, first recorded, And
Levit. 24 20. and Deuteronomy. 19.21. Matthew. 5.38.
Ezod. 21.24. were this day in force. Even this day, we stick not to be of
mind with the godless worldling: Receive I wrong? I will repay it, Eye for
eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound
for wound, stripe for stripe. As good as he brings, I will give him.

We are commanded, Matthew. 18.22. to forgive one another, even seaventie times
seven times. How have we cast behind us this holy commandment? If thy
neighbor sin against thee, will thou not be meet with him seven years after,
if possible? Tell me; if by order of friends, or constraint, thou be moved to
forgive thy neighbor, will thou forgive him? Forgive him? Yea after a sort. We
will forsooth forgive the fault, but not forget the matter, nor affect the
party, that wronged us. Is this to love our enemies? Is this not to resist
evil? Nothing less.

Learn therefore of CHRIST what it is, to love your enemies, Matthew. 5.44.
Bless them that curse you; do good to them that hate you; pray for them that
hurt you, and persecute you. And again learn of Christ, what it is, not to
resist evil: Matthew. 5.39. Whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn
to him the other also: and if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away
thy coat, let him have thy cloak also: and whosoever will co^pel thee to go
with him one mile, go with him twain. This is it, whereto St Peter exhorts
you, 1 Epist. chap. 3.8. Be ye all of one mind, one suffer with another; love
as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous, render not evil for evil, nor rebuke
for rebuke; but contrariwise bless, if ye will be heirs of blessing.

Let wise Solomon's counsel somewhat prevail with you; that counsel, which
he gives you, Prove. 24.29. O say not, I will do to him, as he has done to
me; I will recompense every man according to his work. What shall I do then,
when I have received a wrong? What else, but follow the same wise man's
counsel, given me, Prove. 20.22. Expectabo Dominum, and liberabit me; I will
wait upon the LORD, and he will deliver me. I shut up this meditation with St
Paul's exhortation, Romans 12.17 Recompense to no man evil for evil; if it be
possible, as much as in you is, have peace with all me^. Dearly beloved,
avenge not your selves but give place unto wrath; for it is written; vengeance
is mine, I will repay, says the LORD.

Hitherto, (beloved in the LORD) I have labored to work in you a detestation
of all private revengement. The occasion of my discourse, was from my
propounded doctrine. It is proper to the LORD to execute vengeance; proper to
the LORD, and therefore not any way to be meddled in by us. It is not for us by
our selves to avenge the wrongs done unto us; we must wait upon the LORD, who
in his good time will right all our injuries. For he has said, vengeance
belongs unto me, I will recompense.

Let us proceed, and see what doctrine may be gathered from the two next
circumstances; the circumstance of the punishment and the circumstance of the
punished. The punishment I noted in the breaking of bars, and the punished,
in the word Damascus. You have already heard the meaning of these words: I will
break the bar of Damascus] I] the LORD, will] with my mighty power, break
Lay wast, and consume, the barre] bar, for bars, even all the munition, and
strength, of Damascus] of the chi^^^st city of Syria, and the country adjoining.

Must Damascus, the strongest city of all Syria, have her bars broken? Must
she be laid wast, and spoiled? Here fixing the eyes of our minds upon the
power of the LORD, learn we this lesson.

There is no thing, nor creature, able to withstand Gods power, or to let his
purpose. Nothing: not gates of brass, nor bars of iron, these he breaks
asunder, Psalm. 107.16. No creature. What creature more mighty then a King? Yet
in the day of his wrath God wounds King^: witness the Psalmist. 110.5. Does
he wound Kings? yea he slays mighty Kings, Psalm. 135.10. and 136.18. My text
avoweth the same, in one of the next clauses, where God threatens to the
mighty King of Syria, a cutting off: I will cut of him that holds the
scepter out of Beth-eden.

These few now alleged instances do sufficiently (though briefly) confirm my
propounded doctrine.

There is no thing, nor creature, able to withstand Gods power, or to let his
purpose. The reason hereof is: because God only is omnipotent, and whatsoever
else is in the world it is weak, and unable to resist. Of Gods omnipotency we
make our daily profession in the first article of our belief, professing him
to be God, the Father Almighty. In which profession we do not exclude,
either the Son, or Holy Ghost, from omnipotency. For God the Father, who
imparteth his Godhead unto the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, does communicate
the proprieties of his Godhead to them also. And therefore our belief is, that
as the Father is Almighty, so the Son is Almighty, and the Holy Ghost is
Almighty too.

Now God is said to be omnipotent, or Almighty, in two respects. First,
because he is able to do, whatsoever he will. Secondly, because he is able to
do more, then he will. For the first; that God is able to do, whatsoever he
will, who but the man possessed with the spirit of Atheism, and infidelity,
dares deny? This truth being expressly delivered twice in the book of Psalms;
First, Psalm. 115.3. Our God in heaven, does whatsoever he will: again, Psalm.
135.6. Whatsoever pleases the LORD, that does he, in heaven, in earth, in the
sea, in all the depthes.

For the second that God is able to do more, then he will do: every
Christian, acquainted with the Evangelicall story, does acknowledge it. It is
plain by John Baptists reproof of the Pharisees, and Sadducees, Matthew. 3.9.
Think not to say within your selves, we have Abraham to our Father; for I say
unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
Able, but will not. So likewise, when Christ was betrayed, the story, Matthew.
26.53. is, that God the Father could have give^ him more then twelve legions of
Angels, to have delivered him. He could, but would not. The like may be said
of many other things. The Father was able to have created another world; yea a
thousand worlds. Was able, but would not.

You see for Gods omnipotency, that he is able to do, whatsoever he will do;
yea that he is able to do more, then he will do. God only is omnipotent:
whatsoever else is in the world, it is weak, and unable to resist: which is the
very sum of my doctrine already propounded, and confirmed.

There is no thing, nor creature, able to withstand Gods power, or to let his
purpose. For as Job says, chap. 9.13. The most mighty helps do stoop under
Gods anger. This is it, which Nabuchodonosor, Dan. 4.34, 35. confesses: In
comparison of the most high, who lives for ever, whose power is an everlasting
power, whose kingdom is from generation to generation; all the inahbitants of
the earth are reputed as nothing; according to his will, he works in the army
of heaven, and in the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, nor
say unto him, what do thou? This is it, whereat S. Paul aims in his
question demanded, Romans 9.19. Who has resisted the will of God? And this is
it, which Job intends, chap. 9.4. demanding a like question: who has been
fierce against God, and has prospered?

I will not further amplify this point; it must stand good against all the
might, and strength of this world,

There is no thing, nor creature, able to withstand Gods power, or to let his
purpose. Now let us consider some duties, whereunto we are moved by this
doctrine of Gods omnipotency.

1 Is there no thing, nor creature, able to withstand Gods power, or to let his
purpose? Learn we from hence crew humiliation; that same Christian virtue, to
which S. Peter 1. ep. 5.6. gives his exhortation: Humble your selves under the
mighty hand of God. What are we, (beloved) but by nature in our selves most
wretched; conceived, and borne in sin? hitherto running on in wickedness? and
daily rebelling against God? against Almighty God, against him, who alone is
able to do, whatsoever he will; able to do more then he will; able to cast both
body, and soul into hell fire?

Let the consideration of this our wretched estate, work in us the fruits of
true humiliatio^. This true humiliation stands in our practice of three
things. 1. The sorrow of our heart, whereby we are displeased with our selves,
and ashamed in respect of our sins. 2. Our confession to God, in which we
must also do three things. 1. We must acknowledge all our maine sins;
original, and actual, 2. We must acknowledge our guiltiness before God. 3.
We must acknowledge our just damnation for sin. The third thing in our
humiliation, is our supplication to be made to God for mercy, which must be
with all possible earnestnes, as in a matter of life, and death.

A pattern whereof I present unto you, Dan. 9.17, 18, 19. O our God, hear the
prayers of us thy servants, and our supplications, and cause thy face to shine
upon us. O our God, incline thine ear to us, and hear us; open thine eyes,
and behold our miseries; we do not present our supplications before thee for
our own righteousness, but for thy great tender mercies. O LORD hear us, O
LORD forgive us, O LORD consider, and do it, differ not thy mercies for thine
own sake, O our God. Thus (beloved) if we humble our selves under the hand of
Almighty God, God will lift us up.

2 Is there no thing, nor creature, able to withstand Gods power, or to let his
purpose? Learn we from hence, to tremble at Gods judgments, to fear them, to
stand in awe of them, to quake, and quiver at them. For as God is so are his
judgments: God is terrible, and his judgments are terrible. God is terrible
in the assembly of his Saints, Psalm. 88.8. terrible in his works, Psalm. 66.3.
terrible in his doings toward the sons of men, Psalm. 66.5. terrible to the
Kings of the earth, Psalm. 76.13. To pass over with silence many places of
holy Scripture, in which God is termed a terrible God, let us confess with
the Psalmist, Psalm. 76.7. Thou, O God of Jacob, thou art to be feared; who
shall stand in thy sight, when thou art angry?

Here are they worthily to be taxed, and censured, who are so far from fearing
Gods judgments, as that they plainly scoff, and jest at them. Such a one was
he of Cambridge shire, who This Sermon was preached Febr. 8. 1606.
some 14. years since, in the year 1592. made a mock of the Lords glorious
voice, the THVNDER. The story is delivered by Perkins, in his Printed at
Cambridg in 4o. 1596. page 36.
exposition of the Creed, in these words: One being with his companion in a
house drinking on the Lords day, when he was ready to depart thence, there was
great lightning and thunder: whereupon his fellow requested him to stay; but
the man mocking, and jesting at the thunder, and lightning said (as report was)
it was nothing, but a knave cooper knocking on his tubs, come what would, he
would go, and so went on his journey: but before he came half a mile from the
house, the same hand of the LORD, which before he had mocked, in a crack of
thunder struck him about the girdlesteed, that he fell down stark dead.

A memorable example, brought home as it were to our doors, to put us in
mind, of Gods heavy wrath against those, which scorn his judgments. Let us
(beloved) be wise upon it, and at every judgment of God tremble, and fear,
and confess, as before out of Psalm. 76.7. Thou, O God of Jacob, thou art to
be feared; who shall stand in thy sight, when thou art angry?

3 Is there no thing, nor creature able to withstand Gods power, or to let his
purpose? Here is matter enough to uphold, and stablish our faith in Gods
promises, to the abolishing of all wavering, and doubting touching our
salvation. Thus: No thing, nor creature is able to withstand Gods power, or to
let his purpose. God is able to do, whatsoever he will do; he will do, whatsoever
he has promised to do: he has promised to give eternal life to all that
believe in Jesus Christ. How then can I, who do believe, or any other, who does
believe in Jesus Christ, doubt of mine, or their salvation.

Upon this rock of Gods omnipotency Abraham's faith stood unshaken, as
appears Romans 4. Abraham he doubted not of the promise of God through
unbelief, but was strengthened in the faith. And how? Because he was fully
assured, that the same God who had promised, was able also to do it. This
ablenes of God Abraham opposed to his own weakness. And so, above hope believed
under hope, that he should be the father of many nations, according to that
which was spoken to him, so shall thy seed be. This promise Abraham laid hold
of, not considering his own body, eve^ now dead, being almost a hundred years
old, neither the deadness of Sarahs womb: he laid hold of the promise. How? By
faith. Which was increased, and confirmed to him, by the consideration of the
power of God.

And why is all this written of Abraham? S. Paul says why: ver. 23. Now it is
not written for him only, that it was imputed to him for righteousness; but also
for us, to whom it shall be imputed for righteousness, if we believe in him,
that raised up Jesus our LORD from the dead, who was delivered to death for our
sins, and is risen again for our justification. Wherefore to all our sins,
infirmities, and impotencies, from whence may arise diffidence, infidelity, or
unbelief, we must ever oppose Gods omnipotency; and thereby support our faith
in his promises.

I shut up this point, and my whole lecture with S. Austines discourse, Sermon.
123. de tempore: Nemo dicat, non potest mihi dimittere peccata: Let no man say
unto me; God cannot forgive me my sins. Quomodo non potest omnipotens? How is
it possible, that the Almighty should not be able to forgive thee thy sins?
But thou will say, I am a great sinner; and I say, Sed ille omnipotens est; But
God is Almighty. Thou replyest, and say; My sins are such, as from which I
cannot be delivered, and cleansed; and I answer, Sed ille omnipotens est; But
God is Almighty. Almighty; able to do all things, greater or lesser,
celestial or terrestiall, immortal or mortal, spiritual or corporal,
invisible or visible. Magnus in magnis, neque parvus in minimis: great in great
businesses, and not little in the least. No thing or creature is able to
withstand Gods power, or to let his purpose.

THE TENTH LECTVRE.
AMOS 1.5. I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut of the inhabitant
of Bikeath-Aven, and him that holds the scepter out of Beth-Eden, and the
people of Aram shall go into captivity unto Kir.


NOw proceed we to the other clauses of the last part of this prophecy against
the Syrians. The second clause is, I will cut of the inhabitant of
Bikeath-Aven: The third is, and him that holds the scepter out of Beth-eden:
the fourth is, and the people of Aram, etc. In each of these I do observe (as
before I did) three circumstances.

1 The punisher the LORD, either immediately by himself, or mediatly by his
instruments. 2 The punishment, to be understood in those phrases of cutting of,
and going into captivity. 3 The punished; the Syrians, noted in these names
Bikeath-Aven, Beth-eden, Aram.
Let us examine the words of the text, as they lie in order.

I will cut of the inhabitant of Bikeath-Aven] I, the LORD, JEHOVAH, See Le^^.
9.
who remove mountains, and they feel not when I overthrow them; who remove
the earth out of her place, and make her pillars to shake; who my self alone
spread out the heavens, and walk upon the height of the sea: I, the LORD,
JEHOVAH, who does great things, and unsearchable, marvailous things, and
without number: I, the LORD, JEHOVAH, who have resolved to send a fire into the
house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad, and have resolved
to break the bars of Damascus; I will also cut of the inhabitant of
Bikeath-Aven, and him that holds the scepter out of Beth-eden, etc

I will cut off] To cut off, is in sundry places of holy Scripture a Metaphore,
drawn ab excisione arborum; from the cutting down, or rooting up of trees:
and signifies, utterly to consume to wast, to dissipate, to destroy, to
exstinguish. So it is used, Ps. 101.8. where David, purposing not to be
negligent, or sloathfull, in the execution of justice against all malefactors
in Jerusalem, resolves to cut of all the workers of iniquity from the city of
the LORD: Betimes will I destroy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut of
all the workers of iniquity from the city of the LORD. So its used, Psalm.
109.15. where David's prayer against the wicked is; that their iniquity, and
sin be always before the LORD, that he may out off their memorial from the
earth. So it is used, Ezech. 14.13. Son of man when a land sins against me
by committing a trespass, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will
break the staff of bread thereof; and will send famine upon it, and will cut
off man and beast from it: I will cut off] that is, I will destroy both man and
beast from a sinful land.

I omit many like places of holy writ; and commend unto you, but one more,
parallel to this in my text. It is in the 3. ver. of the 2. chap. of this
prophecy. There thus says the LORD; I will cut of the judge out of the midst
of Moab; as here in my text, I will cut off the inhabitant of Bikeath-Aven; and
verse the 8. I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod. I will cut off, whether
the judge out of the midst of Moab; or the inhabitant from Ashdod; or the
inhabitant of Bikeath-Aven, the meaning is one, and the same: I will cut off,
that is, I will utterly destroy, or extinguish.

Which to be the meaning of the word, the author of the Vulgar Latin
acknowledges, translating the word in the original, not excindam; (as indeed
it signifies) I will cut off, but disperda^, I will destroy. So do the
Seaventy Interpreters in their Greek edition of the Bible, here translating
the Hebrew word not (...), (as indeed it signifies) I will cut off; but (...),
I will utterly, or altogether destroy, overthrowe, and extinguish.

I will cut off the inhabitant] the inhabitant? what? but one? yes, all, and
every one of the inhabitants. The Holy Spirit in the sacred Scripture uses so
to speak; by a word of the singular number to understand more then one; yea
all of that kind, which kind of speech is analogically reduced to the figure
Synocdoche.

Let us see the truth of this in a few instances. In Exodus 8.6. it is said;
when Aaron stretched out his hand upon the waters of Egypt, that then the
frogge came up, and covered the land. The frogge! It were senseless to think
that one frogge could cover the land of Egypt; and therefore by the frogge, we
are to understand many frogs. In Number. 21.7. the Israelites desired Moses to
pray to the LORD, that he would take away from them the Serpent. The serpent!
what? but one? It is out of doubt that the people meant all the fiery serpents
sent among them by the LORD, to sting them to death: of which we read verse
the 6. Jeremy in chap. 8.7. says that the storke, the turtle, the crane, and
the swallow do know, and observe their appointed times. The storke, the
turtle, the crane, the swallow! We may not think the Prophet singleth out one
storke, one turtle, one crane, one swallow from the rest; but his meaning is of
all storkes, turtles, cranes, swallows, that they know, and observe their
appointed times. As in the now cited places, so here in my text, the holy Ghost
uses one number, for another; the singular for the plural, understanding by
one inhabitant, all the inhabitants of Bikeath-Aven.

Of Bikeath-Aven] the Greek Translators taking the words partly appellatiuely,
and partly properly, do render them, the field of On. In like sort Gualter,
the valley of Aven. The author of the Vulgar Latin, understanding them wholly
appellatiuely, renders them, the field of the Idol: and so they may signify,
the plain of Aven, the plain of grief, the plain of sorrow, as Calvin
observes. Innius and Tremellius do render it, as before Gualter, e convalle
Avenis, the valley of Aven: understanding thereby the whole coast of Chamatha,
which way Syria bordereth upon Arabia, surnamed the Desert.

Calvin says it is uncertain, whether Bikeath-Aven be a proper name of a
place, or no; yet says he, it is probable. Drusius following the Hebrew
Doctors, affirms, that it is the proper name of a city in Syria. Mercer, the
learned professor of Paris, ioineth with him. And our English Geneva
Translation draws us to be of the same mind, that Bikeath-Aven is a proper
name of a city in Syria.

The same opinion must we hold of Beth-Eden, in the next clause; that it is a
proper name of a city in Syria: of which opinion I find Mercer, and Drusius,
and our English Translators at Geneva to have been. And Calvin holds it to be
credible, though he translates it the house of Eden; so Gualter does; so does
Tremellius, who by the house of Eden, understands the whole country of of
Coelesyria, wherein stood the city Eden.

The author of the Vulgar Latin takes Beth-Eden for an appellatiue, and
translates it, the house of pleasure,. Such indeed is the signification of the
word; and it is by Arias Montanus, and Ribera, applied to signify the city of
Damascus: as if Damascus were there called not only Bikeath-Aven, that is, the
field of the Idol; because of the Idolatry there used, but also Beth-Eden that
is, the house of pleasure, because of the pleasant situation thereof. But I
retain the proper name Beth-Eden, and take it for a city in Syria, wherein the
King of Syria had a palace, and mansion house. Which I take to be plain in my
text, where the LORD threatens, to cut off him, that holds the scepter out
of Beth-Eden.

Him that holds the scepter] that is, the King keeping his court at
Beth-Eden. For I see not any absurdity in it, if I say that the King of Syria
had a mansion house, as well at Beth-Eden, as at Damascus; and that at this
time the court lay at Beth-Eden.

Him that holds the scepter] This is a periphrasis, or circumlocution of a
King. A scepter is Regium gestamen, and insigne potestatis Regiae, a Kingly
mace, the proper ensign, or token of Kingly power. Whence in the best of
Greek Poets, Homer, Kings are called (...). 86. (...).
(...), scepter-bearers. Hereby we understand, what we read in the story of
Hester, chap. 8.4. King Assuerus hold out his golden scepter toward Hester. And
that Genesis 49.10. The scepter shall not depart from Judah. In the former place
Assuerus makes show of his kingly favor unto Hester, by holding out his mace
unto her: in the later Jacob prophecieth of the stabilitie and continuance of
the Kingdom in the tribe of Judah, till the coming of the Messiah. Here then
he that holds the scepter in Beth-Eden, is the King abiding in Beth-Eden.

Hitherto (beloved) have I labored to unfold the words of my text: I will cut
of the inhabitant of Bikeath-Aven, and him that holds the scepter out of
Beth-eden] I] the LORD, with my mighty power, will cut off] will utterly
consume; and destroy, the inhabitant] not one only, but every one, that
dwells in Bikeath-Aven] the so named city of Syria. There will I not stay my
hand, but I will also with my mighty power cut of, utterly consume, and
destroy, him that holds the scepter] not only the vnder-magistrate, but the
King him self, out of Beth-eden] another so named city of Syria. Bikeath-Aven
shall not be able to defend her inhabitants, nor Beth-eden, her king. I will
cut of, etc.] Thus far the exposition. Now some notes of instruction.

You will be pleased to remember with me, my three propounded circumstances.

1 The punisher, the LORD. 2 The punishment, a cutting of. 3 The punished; the
inhabitant of Bikeath-Aven, and the King of Beth-eden.
From the first circumstance; The LORD himself taking vengeance into his own
hands, arises this doctrine, It is proper to the LORD to execute vengeance
upon the wicked for their sins.

Which truth having been often commended to your Christian considerations, in
former lectures, I now let pass.

From all three circumstances of the punisher, the punishment, and the
punished, jointly considered, arise other profitable doctrines.

First we see, that the cutting of, of the inhabitant of Bikeath-Aven, and of
him that holds the scepter out of Beth-eden, is the LORDS proper work. The
lesson which we may take from hence is this; No calamity, or misery, befalls
any one of whatsoever estate, or degree, by chance, or at adventure.

It was an error of the Paynims to hold fortune in so high account; Iuven.
Sat. 10.
Te facimus, Fortuna, DEAM, coeloque locamus. They esteemed her as a goddess,
and assigned her a place in Heaven. They presented her by the image of a woman,
sitting sometimes upon a ball, sometimes upon a wheel, having with her a
rasour, Pierius Hieroglyph. lib. 29.
bearing in her right hand the stern of a ship, in her left, the horn of
abundance: by the rasour, they would give us to understand, that she can at
her pleasure cut of, and end our happiness; by the ball, or wheel, that she
is very prone to volubility, and change; by the stern in her right hand, that
the whole course of our life is under her government; by the horn of abundance
in her left hand, that all our plenty is from her.

This palpable idolatry of the Gentiles, giving the glory of the most high to
their base, and inglorious abominations, we Christians must utterly renounce.
We honor the LORD of hoasts alone, and to him alone do we ascribe the
soveraignety, dominion, and rule of the whole world. Such is the extent of Gods
wonderful, and eternal providence. The whole world with all things therein,
is wholly, and alone subject to the soveraignety, dominion, and rule of Almighty
God; by his providence all things are preserved, all things are ruled, all
things are ordered.

These are the three degrees by which you may discern, and take notice of the
Act of divine providence. The first is, Gradus conservationis. The second,
Gradus gubernationis. The third, Gradus ordinationis. The first degree is of
maintenance, or preservation; the second is of rule, and government; the third
is of ordination, and (...).

The first degree, which I termed gradum conservationis, the degree of
maintenance, and preservation, implies thus much; that all things in general,
and every thing in particular, are by Almighty God sustained ordinarily, in the
same state of nature, and natural proprieties, wherein they were created.

This truth is excellently explained, Psalm. 104. and 145. and 147. In which the
Psalmist joyfully sings out of the wonderful Providence of God in the
maintenance, and preservation of man, and every other creature; the beasts of
the field, the fowls of the air, the fishes of the sea. Psalm. 104.10.11.
He sends the springs into the valleys, that all the beasts of the field may
drink, and the wild asses quench their thirst. Psalm. 147.8. and Ps. 104 13
He covers the heaven with clouds, prepares rain for the earth, and makes
grass to grow even upon mountains, that cattle may have food; he has made
the mountains Psalm. 104.18.
to be a refuge for goo^s, and rocks for conies: the Lions, Verse. 21.
roaring after their prey, seek their meat at him.

You see Gods care, and providence for the preservation of the beasts of the
field; see the like, for the fowls of the air. He has planted the Psalm.
104.16
Cedars of Lebanon, for birds to make their nests there, and the fur trees
for the storkes to dwell in: the young Ps. 147 9.
ravens that cry unto him, he feeds. Our Savior Jesus Christ, Matthew. 6.26.
calls you to this consideration: Behold (says he) the fowls of heaven; they
sow not, nor reap, nor carry into barnes, yet your heavenly father feeds
them.

Gods care, and providence for the preservation of his creatures, here rests
not: it reaches even to the bottom of the sea. There is great Psalm. 104.26
Leviathan; there are creeping things innumerable, small, and great; all which
wait upon the LORD, that he may give them food in due season. In due season he
gives them food, and they gather it; he opens his hand and they are filled
with good. O LORD how manifold are thy works? Psalm. 104.24.
In wisdom have thou made them all; the whole world is full of thy riches.

The next degree whereby we may discern the act of divine providence, I termed
(...) ^^bernation is: the degree of rule, and government. It implies (...)
that Almighty God for his unlimited power, governs all things in the world,
and rules them pro liberate voluntatis sua, even as he lists.

This point is delivered not obscurely in many places of holy Scripture: as in
those general, and universal sayings, which do prove God Almighty, even
this day to work in the world, and to do all in all. In Esai 43.13. thus says
the LORD; Yea, before the day was, I am, and there is none, that can deliver
out of mine hand, I will do it, and who shall let it? Agreeable to this are
the words of our Savior, John. 5.17. My father works hitherto, and I work:
From both these places we may truly infer that God works in the government
of this world day after day, even until the end thereof: which St Paul Ephesians.
1.11. avoweth; He works all things, after the counsel of his own will.

To the consideration hereof Elihu stirs up afflicted Job chap. 37. wishing
him to consider the wondrous works of God, the clouds, and his light shining
out of them; the thunder, Gods marvailous, and glorious voice; the snow, the
frost, the whirlewind, the rain; all these God rules, and governs after his
good pleasure.

And who I pray you rules man, and man's affairs, but the LORD? O LORD, says
Ierem. chap. 10.23. I know that the way of man is not in himself, neither is
it in man to walk, and to direct his steps. King Solomon confesses as much,
Prove. 20.24. The steps of man are ruled by the LORD.

From this ruling providence of God, King David Psalm. 23.1. drew unto himself
a very comfortable argument: The LORD feeds me, therefore I shall not want.
Let us as comfortably reason with our selves; The LORD feeds us, therefore we
shall not want. It is spoken to our never ending comfort by our blessed
Savior, Matthew. 10.29. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them
falls not on the ground without your father? Fear ye not therefore, ye are
of more value, then many sparrowes. In the same place he further assures, that
all the hairs of our head are numbered. Does Gods care reach to the falling of
the hairs of our h^^d, (...) can we doubt of (...) rule and government in
(...) ^^mightie God for his unlimited power (...) all things in the world, and
rules them pro liber^^^^ (...) sua, even as he lists.

The third degree, by which we may discern the act of divine providence, I
called gradum ordinationis, the degree of ordination, or direction. It implies
thus much: that God of his admirable wisdom ordeineth, and sets in order,
whatsoever things in the world, seem to be most out of order; he brings
them all to his chiefly intended end; all must make for his glory.

In this divine ordination three things do concur: Constitutio finis;
mediorum ad finem dispositio; and Dispositorum directio. First God appoints
an end to every thing; secondly he disposes means unto the end; thirdly he
directs the means so disposed.

To discourse of these particulars severally, would carry me beyond my time,
and your patience: I will but only touch the general, which was, God of his
admirable wisdom ordains, or sets in order, whatsoever things in the
world seem to be most out of order: he brings them all to his chiefly
intended end; they al make for his glory.

Hereupon depends the truth of my propounded doctrine inviolable; No
calamity, or misery befalls any one, of whatsoever estate, or degree, by
chance, or at adventure.

For if it be true, (as true it is, and the gates of Hell shall never be able to
prevail against it) that God by his wonderful providence maintains, and
preserves, rules, and governs, orders, disposes, and directs al things
in this world, even to the very hairs of our heads, it cannot be, that any
calamity, or misery should befall any one of us by adventure, by hap-hazzard,
by chance, by fortune.

The Epicure in the book of Job, 22.13. was in a foul error to think, that
God, walking in the circle of heaven, cannot through the dark clouds see our
misdoings, and judge us for them. Dearly beloved, we may not think our God
to be a See Lect. 1. page 10.
God to halfes, and in part only, a God above and not beneath the moon; a God
upon the mountains, and not in the valleys; a God in the greater, and not in
the lesser employments. We may not thus think.

We have lived long enough, to have learned better things out of Amos 9.
Ierem. 23. Psalm. 139. that God is every where present, and that there is no
evasion from him. No corner in Hell, no mansion in heaven, no cave in the top
of Carmel, no fishes belly in the bottom of the sea, no dark dungeon in the
land of captivity, no place of any secrecy any where, is able to hide us from
the presence of God.

We have learned, Zach. 4.10. that God has seven eyes, which go through the
whole world. You may interpret them with me, many millions of eyes, He is
Hieroymus in illud Psalm. 94.9. Qui plantavit aurem, non audiet? aut qui finxit
oculum no^ co^siderat? Ego autem dico, quod Deus totus OCVLVS est, totus MANVS
est, totus PES est. Totus OCVLVS est, quia omnia videt. Totus MANVS est, quia
omnia operatur. Totus PES est, quia ubique est.
totus, OCVLVS, altogether eye, for he says all things. We have learned, Esai
40.12. that God has hands to measure the waters, and to span the heavens. You
may interpret it with me, that he has many millions of hands, He is totus,
MANVS, altogether hand, for he works all things. We have learned, Matthew.
5.35. that God has feet to set upon his footstool. You may interpret it with
me, that he has many millions of feet, He is totus, PES, altogether foot,
for he is every where.

We shall then be very injurious to God, if we deny him the oversight of the
smallest matters. The holy Scriptures do evidently show, that he examineth the
least moments, and titles in the world that we can imagine, Supra page 10.
to a handful of meal, to a cruse of oil in a poor widows house, to the
falling of sparrowes to the ground, to the clothing of the grass in the field,
to the feeding of the birds of the air, to the calving of hindes, to the
numbering of the hairs of our heads.

Wherefore (dearly beloved in the LORD) whatsoever calamity or misery has
already seized upon us, or shall hereafter overtake us, let us not lay it upon
blind Fortune, but look we to the hand that strikes us. He, who is noted in
my text to cut off the inhabitant of Bikeath-Aven, and him that holds the
scepter out of (...), that for our (...) brings upon us (...).

The late (...), ^^ging upon this land to the utter destruction of gre^^ store
of cattle, and much people; and the late rot of sheep in this, and other
places of this land, are Gods visitations upon us for our sins, and
admonishments for us to amend our lives.

Shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord has not done it? says Amos,
chap. 3.6. It Is out of question; there is no evil in the city, no, not in the
world, but the LORDS finger is in it; and that justly, for our sins sake.

What remains, but that we rent our hearts, and turn unto the LORD our God?
He is gracious, merciful, slow to anger, of great kindness, and repents him
of evil. How know we, whether he will return, and repent, and leave a
blessing behind him for us? Let us therefore go boldly unto the throne of
grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

THE ELEVENTH LECTVRE
AMOS 1.5. The people of Aram shall go into captivity unto Kir, says the LORD.


We go on with that which yet remains vnexpounded in this 5. verse.

The people of Aram] Aram registered Genesis 10.22. to be one of the sons of Sem,
was the father, author, or founder of the Aramites, or Syrians, Tremellius and
Willet. in Genes. 10.22.
whereof it is, that the Scythians after their return out of Asia, and Syria,
were called Aram^^, Aramites, Plin. lib. 6. cap. 17. This country of Aram, or
Syria, was divided into sundry regions.

2. Sam. 10.8. You may read of Aram Soba, Aram Rehob, Aram Ishtob, and Arum
Maacah; from which provinces there went a multitude of Aramites to aid the
Ammonites, in their war against King David. The success of their expedition
is recorded ver. the 18. David destroyed seven hundred chariots of the
Aramites, and forty thousand horsemen. So let them all perish, who make head,
and band themselves together, against the LORDS anointed.

2. Sam. 8.6. You may read of Aram of Damascus; out of which part there went a
great multitude to succor Hadadezer, king of Soba, against David. Their
success is recorded in the same place. David slew of the Aramites two and
twenty thousand men (...), let them al likewise perish, who make he^d, and
(...) themselu^s together against the LORDS anointed.

1. Chron. (...) which is by in^ (...) lying between the (...), commonly
known by the name of Bertram. Comparat. Gram. Hebr. and Aram. in Praefat.
Mesopotamia. And these Syrians gave aid unto the Ammonites against David, and
were partakers in their overthrow.

Genesis 28.5. You may read of Padan Aram, whither the Patriach Jacob was by his
father Isaac sent, to make choice of his wife of the daughters of Laban.
Tremellius and Iunius in their note upon Genesis 25.20. do make this Padan-Aram to
be a part of Mesopotamia, that part which is called by Ptolemee Ancoba^^.

Thus does the holy Spirit in the sacred Scriptures describe unto us the
country of Aram in its parts; Aram Soba, Aram Reh^b, Aram Ish^^b, Aram Maacah,
Aram of Damascu^, Ar^m N^^arai^, and Padan Aram.

Here Aram, put without any adiunc^ to (...) o^e region, may (...) all Syria,
divided by our Pr^phet Amos in this one verse into three parts, under the three
(...) of Damascus, ^ik^^th (...) and ^^th (...), as Tremellius and Iunius have
noted, understanding by Damasc^^, the country adioining, the whole coast of
D^^^polis, by R^k^^th-Ane^ the country called Ch^^^^th^, which way Syria
bordereth upon Arabia, surnamed the D^s^r^; by Beth-ed^n, the whole country of
Coelesyria, wherein stood the city Eden.

The people that is, (...) of all sorts, not only the ruder multitude, but the
^^ble also (...) word is general, and contains all.

Shall go into captivity] They shall be carried away from their native country
into a strange l^nd in sl^very* and bondage.

Unto Kir* not unto Cyr^^^, Ribera.
a noble city in that part of Africa, which is called P^^^apoli^ (the ^^tiue
country of Arias Montanus.
Callimachus the poet, and E^^^^st h^^es the historian,) as Apud Drusium.
Jonathan, and Sy^^^ch^^, and S. Hierome do seem to understand, and Eusebius,
and the author of the ordinary gloss, and Winckleman do expressly affirm; but
unto Kir, a city in the seigniories, or dominions of the king of Assyria, as
the Hebrews, and best approved expositors, do avouch, Tremellius and Iunius
upon the 2. Kings 16.9. do understand by this Kir, that part of Media, which
from this captivity was called Syromedia; it was named Kir, that is, by
interpretation a wall; because it was round about compassed with the hill
Zagrus, as with a wall.

This deportation, and captivity of the Syrians was foretold by our Prophet
Anno regni Oziae. 23.
almost fifty years, before it was fulfilled. It was fulfilled in the days
of Ahaz, King of Judah, who sent messengers to Tiglath Pileser, King of
Assyria, for help. Tiglath Pileser consented unto him, went up against
Damascus, took it, slew Rezin, King of Aram, and carried a way captive the
people of Aram into Kir. Thus is the story expressly delivered, 2. King. 16.

Thus far the exposition of the words. The people] not only the ruder
multitude, but the nobles also, of Aram] not of Damascus only, but of all
Syria, shall go into captivitie] shall be carried away captive by
Tiglath-Pileser, King of Assyria, unto Kir] a part of Media.

This accordingly came to pass. For it could no otherwise be; the LORD, true
in all his promises, and threatenings, whose words are yea, and Amen, he has
said it. The people of Aram shall go into captivity unto Kir, says the LORD.
Now to the notes of instruction.

Here must I commend unto you (as I have done out of the precedent clauses)
three circumstances: the punisher, the punished, the punishment.

1 The punisher; the LORD, by his instrument, Tiglath-Pileser, King of Assyria.
2 The punished; the Aramites, or Syrians, of all sorts, the ruder, and the
noble. 3 The punishment, a deportation, or carrying into captivity.
This third circumstance is amplified by the place. Their captivity, bondage,
and slaverie, was to be in an unknown, strange and far country; Kir in MEDIA.

From the first (...) of the punisher, the LORD of hoasts employing in his
(...) the King of Assyria, for the carrying away of the Ar^^i^^^, or Syri^^s,
into captivity, we are put in mind of a well known truth in divinity:
Almighty God in his government of the world, works ordinarily by m^anes, or
second causes.

I say ordinarily: because extraordinarily, he works sometime without
means, sometime against means. Ordinarily he works by means. And they are
of two sorts.

Definite; such as of their natural, and internal principles, do of
necessity produce some certain effects. So the fire burns, the water
drowneth. Indefinite; such as are free, and accidental agents, having in
themselves freedom of will to do, or nor to do.
In this rank you may place Joseph's brethren, at what time they sold him to
the Israelites, Genesis 37.28. they sold him not of necessity, they might have
done otherwise. In this rank you may place Shimei for his carriage toward
King David, 2. Sam. 16.6. His throwing of stones at the King, and railing upon
him, was not of necessity; he might have done otherwise. And the King of
Assyria carried into captivity this people of Aram, not of necessity; he
might have left unto them their native country, lands, and possessions.

All these; fire, water, Joseph's brethren, railing Shimei, the King of Assyria,
and whatsoever else like these, means, or second causes; definite, or
indefinite; necessary, or contingent; are but instruments, by which Almighty
God in his government of the world works ordinarily.

God laid wast Sodom, Gomorah, and their sis^er cities: he did it by fire, Genesis
19.24. God destroyed every thing that was upon the earth from man to beast, to
the creeping thing, and to the foul of the heaven (only was Noah saved, and
they that were with him in the Arc) the rest he destroyed by water, Genesis 7.23.
God sent Joseph into Egypt, to preserve his fathers posterity, and to save
them alive by a great deliverance, as Joseph himself confesses, Genesis 45.7.
This was Gods doing, but he did it by Joseph's own brethren, who (you know)
sold him to the Ismaelites. God sent an affliction upon David for his good, by
cursed speaking, and throwing of stones; where in David acknowledges Gods
special singer, 2. Sam. 16.11. The thing was Gods doing. He did it by Shimei,
the son of Iemini. God spoke the word concerning the people of Aram, that
they should go into captivity, as appears in my text: God spoke the word,
and it was done. God therefore sent the people of Aram into captivity, but he
did it by Tiglath-Pileser, King of Assyria.

All these; (though I said it before, I say it again) All these; fire, water,
Joseph's brethren, railing Shimei, the King of Assyria, and whatsoever else like
these, means; or second causes; definite, or indefinite; necessary, or
contingent; are but instruments, by which Almighty God in his government of
the world ordinarily works.

This doctrine of Almighty God, working ordinarily by means, may serve to our
use sundry ways.

1 It may move us to a due consideration of that absolute right, and power,
which God holds over all is creatures. This truth I have heretofore delivered
unto you in my eighth Lecture upon this Prophecy, in this proposition: As is
the fire, so are all other creatures at the LORDS commandment, to be employed
by him in the punishment of the wicked.

2 It may teach us, that God has a loving regard, and respect to our
infirmities, as well knowing, (for he knows all things) that in doubtful
matters we use often to look back, and to have recourse to means, or second
causes.

3 It may move us to obedience, and thankfulness: that we contemn not the
means, or second causes, by which God works; for this were to tempt God; but
that we thankefully embrace them, and commit their issue, event, and success
to God, that works by them.

4 It meets with a perverse opinion of such, as do hold that all second
causes are needless, and unprofitable, because God by his particular
providence directs, and brings to pass all things in the world.

Thus will these ^en (...) determined by Gods providence, that I shall (...),
there is no need that I use Physic: and ^f (...) determined, that I shall not
recover, in (...) shall I use the help of Physic. Again, if it be
determined that thieves shall have no power over me, I shall escape from out
the midst of many: but if it be otherwise determined, that I shall be
spoiled by them, I shall not escape them, no, though I be in mine own house.
Great is the injury which these disputers do offer unto God.

For answer to them, I must grant, that God has a very special care over us,
to defend us; and that we are no time safe, but by his providence; but mean
while, to make us well assured of his good will toward us, he has ordained
second causes, and means for us, at all opportunities, and times convenient to
use, in which, and by which, it pleases his heavenly Majesty to work
effectually.

The rule in divinity is good, Posita providentia particulari, non t^^^^t^r
(...) omnes causa secunda: It is not necessary, that the first, and principal
cause being put, the second, and isntrumental cause should be removed, and
taken away. The sun does not in vain daily rise, and set, though God creates
light, and darkness; the fields are not in vain sowed, and watered with rain,
though God brings forth the come out of the earth; our bodies are not in
vain with food refreshed, though God be the life, and length of our days.
Neither are we in vain taught to believe in Christ, to hear the preaching of
the Gospel, to detest sin, to love righteousness, to conform our lives
unto sound doctrine, though our salvation, and life eternal be the free gift
of God. For God has from everlasting decreed, as the ends, so the means also,
which he has prescribed unto us, by them to bring us to the ends.

This the great Father of this age, Zanchius de attributis Dei lib. 5. cap. 2.
qu. 5. expressly avoweth. His Thesis is concerning life eternal: Whosoever are
predestined to the end, they are also predestined to the means, without
which the end cannot possibly be obtained. For example; whosoever are
predestined to eternal life, (as all we, this day assembled, hope we are)
they are also predestined to the ^e^^es, by which life eternal may be
obtained.

These means unto eternal life are of two sorts: 1. Some are necessary unto
all, of whatsoever age, or sex: and they are, Christ, (as our mediator, and
high Priest) his obedience, and righteousness; our effectual vocation unto
Christ by the holy Ghost; our justification; our glorification. These are so
necessary unto all, that without them none can be saved. And therefore all
elect infants are inwardly, and after a secret manner by the holy Ghost called,
and justified, that they may be glorified. 2. Some annexed unto these are
necessary too, but not to all. Not to infants, because they are not capable of
them; yet to all, that are grown to years of understanding; and these are:
Actual faith, the hearing of the word, a hatred of sin, the love of
righteousness, patience in adversity, a desire of doing good works. All
these means, we, that are grown to years of understanding, must embrace, and
take hold of, every one according to our capacities, or else we shall never
enter into everlasting life; but our portion shall be in that lake, which is
provided for the Devil, and his Angels; from which God Almighty keep us all.

Thus far occasioned by my first circumstance, the circumstance of the
punisher; God by the King of Assyria sent into captivity the people of Aram.
My doctrine was, Almighty God in his government of the world works
ordinarily by means, or second causes.

The second circumstance is of the punished; the Aramites of all sorts, the
ruder, and the noble. The people of Aram. To ground some doctrine hereon, you
must note with me the quality, and condition of these Aramites. They were
professed enemies to the people of God. This appears before in the third
verse, where they are noted, to have exercised most barbarous cruelty against
the Gileadites, a parcel of Israel, to have threshed them with threshing
instruments of iron. These Aramites, or Syrians, for so highly offending, God
sends into captivity. The doctrine is, Though the LORD (...) use his
enemies, a^ instruments, to correct his own servants, and children; yet will
he in his due times, overthrow those his enemies, with a large measure of his
judgments.

Gods holy practice in this kind, specially registered in sundry places of his
eternal word, most evidently declares this truth. The Israelites were kept in
the al dome, and bondage, many years by the Egyptians. The Egyptians, they were
but the weapons of Gods wrath, wherewith he afflicted his people; they were
Gods weapons: were they therefore to escape unpunished? No. Witness those ten
great plagues, which at length God wrought upon them, and their fearful
overthrow in the red sea, at large set down in the book of Exodus, from the
7. chapter to the end of the 14. This was it, which God said unto Abraham, Genesis
15.13, 14. Know for a surety, that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land,
that is not their^, four hundred years, and shall serve them, and they shall
entreat them evil; notwithstanding the nation, whom they shall serve, will I
judge.

Ahab, the most wicked of the Kings of Israel, who sold himself to work
wickedness in the sight of the LORD, and his accursed wife, Iezebel, were Gods
instruments to afflict Naboth with the loss of his life, and vineyard. Ahab,
and Iezebel, were Gods instruments. Were they therefore to escape unpunished?
No. Witness both their ends: the end of Ahab, recorded, 1. King. 22.38. In the
place, where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, did dogs lick the blood of
Ahab also; and the end of Iezebel, registered the 2. Kings 9.35. She was eaten
up with dogs, all, saving her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands.

It was a part of Daniel his afflictions to be cast into the den of Lions. His
accusers unto Darius were the instruments of his affliction. These his accusers
were the LORDS instruments for this business. Were they therefore to escape
unpunished? No. Their fearful end is set down, Dan. 6.24. By the
commandment of King Darius they, with their wives, and children, were cast
into the den of Lions, the Lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their
bones in pieces, ere ever they came to the ground of the den.

The time will not suffer me to recall to your remembrances all the judgments
of God of this quality, written down in the register of Gods works, his holy
word; how, and what he re^dred to Ester 7.10.
Haman, to 2. Kings 19.35, 37.
Sennacherib, to Iere^. 36.29.
Ioachim, to the Ierem. 49.2.
Ammonits, to the Ierem. 49.9. and 51.20.
Chaldeans, to the Ezech. 35.2
Idumeans, and other wicked worldlings, for their hard measure offered to his
children, though they were therein his own instruments. The afore-me^tioned
insta^ces of the Egyptians, of Ahab, and his wife Iezebel, and of Daniel his
accusers, may serve for the declaration of my propounded doctrine, Though the
LORD do use his enemies, as instruments, to correct his own servants, and
children; yet will he in his due time, overthrow those his enemies, with a
large measure of his judgments.

The reason hereof is; because Gods justice cannot let them escape unpunished.
St Paul expresses it, 2 Thessalonians. 1.6. It is a righteous thing with God to
reco^pense tribulation to the^, that trouble you. Let this be our comfort,
whenever the wicked shall rage against us. For hereby are we assured, when
the LORD shall show himself from heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire,
that the^ to the wicked, whose behavior toward the godly is proud, and
dispiteous, he will render vengeance, and punish them with everlasting
perdition.

St Peter to make us steadfast in this comfort, disputes this point, Ep. 1.
chap. 4.17. The point he proves by an argument drawn a minori, inferring from
a truth to carnal men's understanding less probable, a truth of greater
probability. Judgment (says he) begins at the house of God; If it first
begin at us what shall be the end of them, which obey not the Gospel of God?
And if the righteous scarsly be saved, where shall the ungodly, and the sinner
appear? Our Saviors words, Luke 23.31. do co^taine a like argument: If they
do these things to a green tree, what shall be done to the dry? To like
purpose in Ierem. 25.29. says the LORD of hoasts: Lo I begin to plague the
city, where my name is called upon, and shall you go free? Ye shall not go
free.

Hitherto I refer also one other text, Esai 10.12. where it is said, that God,
when he has done, and dispatched all his work upon mount Sion, will visit
the fruit of the proud heart of the King of Assyria; the meaning of the place
is, that God, when he has sufficiently ch^stised, and corrected those of his
own house, his beloved children, will turn his sword against the skorners of
his Majesty. When God has served his own turn by the wicked, then comes
their turn also; howsoever for a while they flourish, in hope to escape Gods
hand, and to abide unpunished, yet will God in due time well enough find them
out, to pay them double.

The uses of this doctrine I can but point at. One is, to admonish us, that we
spite not any of the wicked, who now do live in rest, because their turn to
be punished, must come, and fail not. The further it is put of from them, the
heavier in the end it will fall upon them.

A second use is, to teach us patience in afflictions; for as much as God will
shortly cause the cup to pass from us to our adversaries. But say, he will
not. Yet nevertheless are we to possess our souls in patience; reioicing and
giving thanks to God, who has made us worthy, not only to believe in him, but
also to suffer for his sake. For we have learned, Act. 14.22. That through many
afflictions we must enter into the kingdom of God, etc.

The Prophets, and Apostles, and Martyrs, which were, not only reviled, and
scourged; but also beheaded, cut in pieces, drowned in water, consumed in fire,
by other tyrannical devises cruelly put to death, they all by this way
received the manifest token of their happy, and blessed estate, and entered into
the kingdom of God. And we undoubtedly know, 2. Cor. 5.1. That if our earthly
house of this tabernacle be destroyed, we have a building of God, an house not
made with hands, but eternal in the heavens.

Thus far of my second circumstance; the circumstance of the punished, the
Aramites, professed enemies unto God, yet by him employed in the correction of
his own children, the Israelits, are here themselves punished. My doctrine
was, Though the Lord do use his enemies, as instruments, to correct his own
servants, and children; yet will he in due time overthrow those his enemies,
with a large measure of his judgments.

The third circumstance is, the punishment, a going into captivity: amplified
by the place. This captivity, bondage, and slavery, was to be in an unknown,
strange, and a far country; Kir in Media. The people of Aram shall go into
captivity unto Kir. The doctrine is, For the sin of a land, God often times
sends away the inhabitants into captivity.

Captivity to be an effect, or punishment of sin, king Solomon in his prayer
made to the LORD at his consecration, or dedication of the Temple, 1. King.
8.46. acknowledges. It Is expreslie delivered, 1. Chro^. 9.1. of the
Israelites; that for their transgressio^s they were carried away captive unto
Babel. In Deuteronomy. 28.41. among the curses, threatened to all such, as are
rebellious, and disobedient to Gods holy commandments, Captivity is ranked,
and reckoned.

I let pass the multitude of Scripture-places serving to this point; my text
is plain for it. The Aramites for their three tra^sgressions, and for four,
for their many sins, for their sin of cruelty, for threshing Gilead with
threshing instruments of iron, were to go into Captivity. My doctrine stands
firm.

For the sin of a land, God oftentimes sends away the inhabitants into
captivity. Into Captivity? Into what kind of captivity? For there is a
spiritual captivity, and a corporal captivity; a captivity of the mind, and
a captivity of the body. Both are very grievous, but the first more.

The first which I call the spiritual captivity, and a captivity of the mind,
is a captivity under the Devil, under the power of Hell, under death, under
sin, under the eternal malediction, or curse of the law, propounded to every
one, that does not in all points, and absolutely, obey the law. This Captivity
is a heavy yoke to all mankind, considered without Christ. Every one male, and
female, that has no part in Christ, every unbelieving and reprobate person, is
in this construction, even to this day a captive. And such also were we, by the
corruption of our nature upon our first father Adams default: but now are we by
the sacrifice of the ^^^aculate Lamb, the LORD JESUS, ransomed, and freed. F^^
do this purpose was he sent into the world: as it is evident, Esai 61.1. and
Luke 4.18.

In both places he professes himself to be sent into the world for this
end, even to publish liberty, and freedom to captives, and the imprisoned;
which his office he has graciously performed. By his word of grace he has so
freed our consciences, formerly oppressed with, and captive under sin, that now
there is no condemnation to us; to us, I say; who are in Christ, and do walk
after the spirit, as S. Paul speaks, Romans 8.1.

This is it which our Savior foretold the Jews, John 8.36. If the son shall
make you free, you shall be free indeed. Be it repeated again to our eternal
comforts: If the son shall make us free, we shall be free indeed. But he has
made us free: for therefore was he sent, to publish liberty, and freedom to
captives; he has paid our ransom, his i^^ocent, and most precious blood: by
it are we thoroughly washed, and cleansed from our sins. Now there is no
condemnation to us. Thus freed from our spiritual captivity, bondage, and
slavery under Hell, death, and sin, let us with boldness looking up to the
throne of Grace, whereon sits the author, and finisher of our faith, say
with the blessed Apostle, 1. Cor. 15.55. O death, where is thy sting? O Hell,
where is thy victory? the sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is
the law. But thanks be to God, who has given us victory, through Jesus Christ
our LORD.

The Captivity in my text, is of the other kind, a corporal captivity, a
captivity of the body, which usually is accompanied with two great miseries,
pointed at, Psalm. 107.10. The first, they dwell in darkness, and in the shadow
of death; the second, they are bound in anguish, and iron. First they dwell in
darkness, and in the shadow of death, that is, they are put into deep
dungeons, void of light, whereby they are as it were at deaths door. Secondly,
they are bound in anguish, and iron, that is, day and night they are laden
with fetters, gyues, or shackles of iron; so laden, that they find no rest
unto their bones. Thus must it be with them, who by sinful living provoke
the LORD to high displeasure. Thus is my doctrine confirmed, For the sin of a
land, God oftentimes sends away the inhabitants into captivity.

Is it true, beloved? Does God oftentimes for the sin of a land send away the
inahbitants into captivity? Let us make this Christian use of it: even to power
out our selves in thankfulness before almighty God for his wonderful patience
toward us. The sins of such nations, as have been punished with captivity,
were they more grievous in Gods eyes, then ours are? It is not to be imagined.

Our sins are as crimson-like, and as scarlet-like, as ever were theirs; the
sins of our land, crying sins; Atheism, Irreligion, Oppression, Extortion,
Covetousnes, Usury, Adultery, Fornication, Uncleanness, Drunkenness, and many
like abominations of the old man in us, all our works of darkness, they have
made head together, and have impudently, and shamelesly pressed into the
presence of Almighty God, to urge him to pour forth the viols of his wrath,
and indignation upon us. Yet our God, good, gracious, merciful, long
suffering, and of great kindness withholdeth, and stays his revengeful hand,
from laying upon us his great punishment of Captivity: and suffers us to
possess our habitations in peace, and to eat the good things of the earth? O,
let us therefore confess before the LORD his loving kindness, and declare
before the sons of men the good things, that he has done for us.

Here (dearly beloved) let us not presume upon God his patience, to lead our
lives, as we list. We cannot but see, that God is highly offended with us
already, though yet he be not pleased to execute his sorest judgments upon
us. Gods high displeasure against us, appears in those many visitations, by
which he has come near unto us, within our memories. I may not stand to
amplify, the Spanish sword shaken over us, and the great famine brought upon
us in our late Queens days. Our now gracious Sovereign (...) no^ l^^g s^^e
at the stern of this kingdom. But few years are passed; and yet those few
have afforded manifest tokens of Gods sore displeasure at us.

Have not many thousands of our brethren, (happily not so grievous sinners, as
we) been taken away by the destroying Angel? and yet the plague is not ceased?
Unless we repent, and amend our lives, we may likewise perish. Have not many
of our brethren (too many, if it might have seemed otherwise to Almighty God)
have they not partly perished themselves, partly lost their cattle, and
substance, in An. D. 1607.
this years waters, such waters, as our forefathers have scarcely observed the
like? If we will not wash out selves from our evil doings; we see, God is
able to wash us extraordinarily. The unseasonable weather give^ us from heaven
to the rotting of our sheep, is but Gods warning to us of a greater misery to
befall us, unless we will return from our evil ways.

Wherefore (beloved) let us with one heart, and mind, resolve for hereafter to
cast away all works of darkness, and to put on the armor of light: take we no
further thought for our flesh, to fulfill the lusts of it. Walk we from
henceforth honestly, as in the day.

Whatsoever things are true, and honest, and just, and pure, and do pertain to
love, and are of good report, if there be any virtue, or praise, think we on
these things. Think we on these things to do them, and we shall not need to
fear any going into captivity; yea the destroying Angel shall have no power
over us; the raging waters shall not hurt us; our cattle, and whatsoever else
we enjoy, shall prosper under us. For God, even our own God, shall give us his
blessing.

THE TWELFTH LECTVRE.
AMOS 1.6, 7, 8. Thus says the LORD; For three transgressions of Azzah, and
for four, I will not turn to it, because they carried away prisoners the
whole captivity, to shut them up in Edom.

Therefore will I send a fire upon the walls of Azzah, and it shall devour the
palaces thereof.

And I will cut of the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holds the scepter
from Ashkelon, and turn mine hand to Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines
shall perish, says the LORD God.


THese words do contain a burdensome prophecy against the Philistines. I
divide them into three parts.

1 A preface to a prophecy, ver. 6. Thus says the LORD. 2 The prophecy, ver.
6, 7, 8. For three transgressions, etc. 3 The conclusion, in the end of the 8.
ver. Says the Lord God.
In the prophecy I observe four parts.

1 An accusation of the Philistines, ver. the 6. For three transgressions of
Azzah, and for four. 2 The Lords protestation against them, ver. the 6. I will
not turn to it. 3 The declaration of that grievous sin, by which the
Philistines so highly displeased God, ver. the 6. They carried away prisoners
the whole captivity to shut the^ up in Edom. 4 The description of the
punishments to be inflicted upon them; in five branches. One in the 7. ver. and
four in the 8. ver. The great cities Azzah, and Ashdod, and Ashkelon, and
Ekron, and all the rest of the Philistines, are partners in this punishment.
This prophecy for the (...), and current of the words, is much like the
former against the Syrians; the exposition whereof, in sundry sermons
heretofore delivered, may serve for the exposition of this prophecy also. The
preface is first.

Thus says the LORD Not Amos, but in Amos, the LORD. The LORD, JEHOVAH, who
made the heavens, and spread them our like a curtain, to cloth himself with
light, as with a garment; and can again cloth the heaven: with darkness, and
make a sack their covering: the LORD, JEHOVAH, who made the sea to lay the
beams of his chamber therein, and placed the sands for bounds unto it by a
perpetual decree, never to be passed over, howsoever the waves thereof shall
rage, and roar; and can with a word smite the pride thereof: at his rebuke the
floods shall be turned into a wilderness, the sea shall be dried up; the fish
shall rot for want of water, and die for thirst 2. the LORD, JEHOVAH, who made
the dry land, and so see it upon foundations, that it should never move, and
can cover ^er again with the deep, as with a garment; and so ^^cke her, that
she shall reele to and ^ro, and stacker like a d^^^ken man.

Thus says the LORD] The LORD, JEHOVAH, whose throne is the heaven of heavens,
and the sea his (...) to wal^e in; and the earth his footstool to tread upon;
who has a chair in the conscience, and sits in the heart of man, and
possesses his most secret reins, and devideth betwixt the flesh, and the
skin; and shakes his inmost powers, as the thunder shakes the wilderness of
Cades.

Thus says the LORD] Has he said it, and shall he not do it? has he spoken
it, and shall he not accomplish it? The LORD, JEHOVAH, the strength of Isael, is
not as man, that he should lie; nor as the son of man, that he should repent.
Al his words yea all the titles of his words are yea, and Amen. Heaven and
earth shall perish, before one ^^t, or any one title of his word shall escape
unfulfilled.

Thus says the LORD] Out of doubt then must it come to pass^: Here see the
authority of this prophecy; and not of this only, but also of all other the
prophecies of holy Scripture; that neither this, not any other prophecy of
old, is destitute of divine authority.

This point of the authority of holy Scripture I delivered unto you in my
second, and sixth lectures upon this prophecy: and then noted unto you the
harmony, consent, and agreement of all the Prophets, Evangelists, and Apostles
from the first unto the last; not one of them spoke one word of a natural man
in all their ministeries; the words which they spoke, were the words of^^n
that sent them: they spoke not of themselves, God spoke in them. Whenever
were the time; whatsoever were the means; whosoever were the man; wheresoever
were the place; whatsoever were the people; the words were the LORDS.

Thus says the LORD] Th^n must we give care unto him with reverence. But what
says he? Even the words of this prophecy.

For three transgressions of Azzah, and four, I will not turn it] AZZAH]
Palestina, the country of the Philistines; was divided into five Provinces, or
dutchies, mentioned Josh. 13.3. the Dutchies of Azzah, of Ashdod, of Askelon,
of Gath, of Ekron. These five chief, and the most famous cities of Palestina,
are recorded also, 1. Samuel. 6.17. where the Philistines are said to have
given for a sin offering to the LORD five golden Emerods, one for Azzah, one
for Ashdod, one for Askelon, one for Gath, and one for Ekron. Against four of
these cities, all save Gath, and against Gath too in the general name of the
Philistines, this prophecy was given by the ministry of Amos. In the
offense, or blame Azzah is alone nominated; but in the punishment are Ashdod,
and Askelon and Ekron, and the residue of the Philistines remembered as well as
Azzah.

AZZAH It Is first named Genesis 10.19. In the vulgar Latin, and in the Greek,
it is commonly called, Gaza; it has no other name in the new Testament, but
Gaza. It Is so called Act. 8.26. And you may call it, by which name you will,
AZZAH, or GAZA, it is not material.

Now by this Azzah, or Gaza, you are to understand the inhabitants of the city,
and not them only, but also the borderers; all the in^^ (...): to all which our
Prophet here denounces Gods judgments for their sins.

For three (...)] These words containing (...) for their sins, and the (...)

thereof. Yet (...) you, the (...), and subs^^^ce of them.

For three (...)] It is as if the LORD had (...) had offended but once, or a

doctrine i^: Many (...) pluck^ (...) from heaven, the most certain wrath,

God is of pure eyes, and beholds not iniquity: he has laid righteousness to
the rule, and weighed his justice in a balance. The sentence is passed forth,
and must stand uncontrollable, even as long as sun and moon. Tribulation,
and anguish upon every soul, that do the vill; the soul that sins, it
shall be punished. God ^^kes it good by an ^^th, Deuteronomy. 32.41. That he will
what his glittering sword, and his hand shall take hold on judgment, to execute
veng^^nce upon sinners. His soul har^th and abhors sin; his ^^w c^^seth,
and condemns sin; his hand smites, and scourges sin. (...) was his
motive to cast down Angels into Hell; to th^ust Adam out of Paradise; to turn
cities into ashes; to ruinate nations; to torment his own bowels in the
similitude of sinful flesh. Because of sin he drowned the old world, and
because of sin ere long will burn this. Thus do many sinner pluck d^^^e
from heaven the more ^^rtaine wrath, and vengeanes of God, upon the sinners.

O^^ use of this doctrine is, to teach us heedfullnesse in all our ways, that
we do not by our many sins provoke Almighty God to high displeasure.

A second use is, to move us to a serious contemplatio^ of the wonderful
patience of Almighty God, who did so graciously forbear these Philistines of
Azzah, ^ll by three and four transgressions, by their many sins, they had
provoked him to indignation. It Is true our God is a good God, a gracious God, a
merciful God, a God of wonderful patience: yet may not we thereby take
encouragement to go on in our evil doings.

The LORD who punished his Angels in heaven for one breach, Adam for one
morsel, Miriam for one sclander, Moses for one angry word, Achan for one
sacrilege, Ezechias for once showing his treasures to the ambassadors of
Babel, Josias for once going to war without asking counsel of the LORD, and
Ananias with his wife, Sapphira, for once lying to the holy Ghost; out of doubt
will not spare us, if we shall persist to make a trade of sinning, day after day
heaping iniquity upon iniquity, to the fulfilling of our sins. If so we
do, it shall be with us, as the Apostle speaks, 1. These. 2.16. The wrath of
God must come on us to the utmost.

Now therefore as the elect of God, holy; and beloved, let us walk in love,
even as Christ has loved us. As for the works of the flesh, cast we them
far from us; adultery, fornication, uncleanness, wantonness, hatred,
debate, emulation, wrath, contentions, envy, drunkenness, gluttony, and such
like, for which the wrath of God comes upon the children of disobedience, let
them not once be named among us, as it becomes Saints. But the fruits of the
Spirit, let us wholly delight in them; having laid up in the treasury of our
memories this lesson: Three transgressions and four; Many sins do pluck
down from heaven; the most certain wrath; and vengeance of God upon the
sinners. It follows,

Because they carried away prisoners the whole captivity to shut them up in
Edom] These words are the third part of this prophecy, and do (...) by which
God was provoked (...) the men of Azzah, (...) the rest of the Philisti^^^,
(...) the sin of ^^ailtie, rigor, unmercifulness, hardness of heart. They

put for the (...) or persons in captivity; a^ Psalm. ^^.1^. (...) captive.

The whole (...)] It Is well translated for the sense the word in the original
signifies, absolute, perfect, and complete. By this whole captivity, the holy
Spirit means an absolute, perfect, and complete captivity: ^^ram
captivitat^^, ap^rtam, atque manif^^^^^, says Ari^^ Monta^^^: a captivity
indeed, open, and manifest: such a captivity, faith Cal^^^^, as wherein they
spared not either ^^men, or children, or the ag^d: they took no pity, no
compassion, upon either sex, or age; but all of al sorts, male, and female,
young, and old, they carried away prisoners. What was their end, and purpose in
so doing? Even to s^^t the^ up in Edom: that is, to sell them for bond^^^ues
unto the Idameans.

In Edom] Esau, Jacobs brother, and Isaack^ son by his wife, Genesis 25.21.

red broth, was surnamed Edom, and of him lineally descended the Edomites, or
Id^means, Genesis 36.4^. Of this posterity of Esau, or Edom, the land, which they
inhabited, was called the land of Edo^, or Idumaea; and it was a southern
province of the land of promise, divided, as Theatr. Terrae Sa^ctae.
Adricham, and Observat. lib. 14 cap 13.
Drusius have observed out of Josephus his ^. book of the Jewish antiquities,
into two parts; Idumaeam Superiorem, and Inferior (...) the higher, and the
lower Idumaea. The higher, wherein were two of the cities, mentioned in my
text, Gaza, and Askelon, in the division of the land of Canaan fell to the lot
of the tribe of Judah. The lower Idumaea; commonly known by the name of
Idumaea, fell to the lot of the tribe of Simeon: and this lower Idumaea, I take
to be the Idumaea in my text. Esau pursued Jacob with a deadly hate, so did the
posterity of Esau the posterity of Jacob; the Edomites were evermore most
maliciously bent against the Israelites. Here then appears the heinousnes of
that sin, wherewith the Philistines are charged. It was the sin of cruelty in a
very high degree.

It is a cruel deed to carry away any one from his native country; but him,
that is so carried away, to sell to his mortal enemy, this is a cruelty, then
which there cannot be a greater. Such was the sin of those Philistines, the
inhabitants of Azzah. They sold, whether the Jews, or the Israelites, the
posterity of Jacob, and servants of the living God, to their professed enemies,
the Edomites, with this policy, that being carried far from their own country,
they should live in eternal slavery, and bondage, without hope ever to return
home again.

This very crime of cruelty, is in the prophecy of Joel also chapter 3.6. laid to
the charge of these Philistines: The children of Judah, and the children of
Jerusalem, have ye sold to the Grecians, that ye might send them far from
their border: that is, Gods inheritance, his own seed, and servants, the
children of Judah, and Jerusalem, the cruel and hard hearted Philistines did
mancipate, and sell away for bondslaues to the Grecians dwelling far of, that
with them they might live in perpetual servitude, and slaverie, without all
hope of liberty, or redemption.

Now in this that the LORD calls the Philistines to a reckoning, because they
had sold away his people, though they were their captives, unto infidels: we
may learn this lesson.

It is not lawful to commit the children of believers into the hands of
infidels. The unlawfulness hereof appears by the charge, which Moses gives
the Israelites, Deuteronomy. 7.3. His charge is concerning the Hittites, the
Gergasites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivits, and the
Iebusites, that they should not at al make any covenant with them, nor give
the^ their children in marriage. And why so? Because by such covenants, and
marriages, they might be withdrawn from the true service of God, to the
profane worship of Idols. For so it is said verse the 4. They will cause thy
son to turn away from me, and to serve other Gods.

The danger of such covenants, and marriages, S. Paul knew to be very great,
and therefore from such he dehorteth the Corinthians, 2. Cor. 6.14. Be ye not
unequally yoked with the infidels. He uses the similitude of Oxon coupled
together. The yoke holds them so together, that look which way the one
draws, the other must needs follow.

In like case it is with men. They that fall into familiarity with the wicked,
do couple themselves with them, and so are led out of the way, and made to
work wickedness before the LORD. From this (...), this unequal yoke with
infidels; from conversing with the wicked, the Apostle disswadeth the
Corinthians, and in them us, by sundry arguments drawn ab absurdo. In each
argument there is an Antithesis: two things opposed, the one to the other. In
the first righteousness, and unrighteousness; in the second light, and darkness;
in the third Christ, and Belial; in the fourth the believer, and the infidel;
in the fifth Gods temple, and Idols. Every argument is set down by way of
question.

The first; what fellowship has rigteousnesse with unrighteousness? The answer
is negative: none. The answer may be illustrated by a similitude, Eccl. 13.18.
How ca^ the wolf agree with the lamb? No more can the ungodly with the
righteous:

The second, what communion has light with darkness? The answer is negative:
none. No more then truth has with a lie, as Drusius well expounds the place,
Prove. class. 1. lib. 3.78. Light has no communion with darkness; therefore the
believer ought not to converse with an unbeliever. This consequence is made
good by Ephesians. 5.8. where the Apostle tells the Ephesia^s, that they were once
darkness, but now are light in the LORD. Tenebras vocat infideles, says
Musculus upon the text, S. Paul calls unbelievers, darkness, for their
ignorance of God, and the blindness of their hearts: but he calls the
believers, light, for their knowledge of God, by which their hearts are through
the holy Ghost illuminated. Light has no communion with darkness, therefore
believers are not to have familiarity with unbelievers.

The third, what concord has Christ with Belial? The answer is negative: none.
The oppositio^ between these two, Christ and Belial, is most hostile. Christ
is the author of our salvation; Belial of our perdition: Christ is the restorer
of all things; Belial the destroier: Christ is the prince of light; Belial the
prince of darkness. In such hostile opposition there can be no concord: no
concord between the author of our salvation, and the author of our perdition;
no concord between the restorer of all things, and the destroyer of all
things; no concord between the prince of light, and the prince of darkness:
therefore they that believe in Christ, are not to have familiarity with
unbelievers.

The fourth; what part has the believer with the infidel? The answer is
negative: none. The believer has no portion with the unbeliever; and therefore
he is not to have any familiarity with him.

The fifth; what agreement has the Temple of God with Idols? The answer is
negative: none. There is none indeed. Sacrilega est profanatio: says Comment.
in 2. Cor. 16.6.
Calvin, it is a sacrilegious profaning of God's Temple, to place in it an
Idol, or to use any idolatrous worship therein. We are the Temple of God;
wherefore to infect our selves with any contagion of Idols, in us it must be
sacrilegious. There is no agreement between the Temple of God and Idols;
therefore we are not to have any familiarity with the Idolatrous.

Remember I beseech you: righteousness has no fellowship with unrighteousness,
light has no communion with darkness; Christ is not at concord with Belial; the
believer has no part with the infidel; there is no agreement between the
Temple of God and Idols; therefore may we not enter into familiarity, with the
wicked, profane, and idolatrous; we may not make any covenant with them; we
may not give them our children in marriage. Thus is my doctrine confirmed: It
is not lawful to commit the children of believers into the hands of infidels.
Now to the uses.

The first serves for our instruction; and teaches us so to love the souls
of the righteous seed, that we leave them not resident among Infidels, or
Atheists, or Papists, or any profane wretches: but rather, that to our labor,
and cost, we redeem them out of the Devils tyranny. We must have a singular
care for the children which are borne among us, that they be godly, and
virtuously brought up, and so provided for, that they may do Christ some
service in the Church, and Common wealth.

Our Savior his words, Mat. 18.6. are true without exception; Whosoever shall
offend one of these little ones, which believe in me, it were better for him
that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the
depth of the sea. What measure then are we to look for, if we bequeath our
children to the service of men of corrupt consciences, and wicked affections,
such as will compass heaven, and earth, to make any one the child of
damnation?

A second use may be, for the reproof of such as do bind, and put their
children, the fruit of their bodies, (which they ought to consecrate to the
LORD) into the education of open enemies to the gospel of Christ; most
blasphemous, and abominable Atheists; or most blind and superstitious Papists.
Are not these as much to be complained of, as those, whom the LORD here
condemns for selling of Isreal's seed into the hands of the Edomites? Yes, and
much more. For those sold their enemies, but our men sell their children; those
did it by the law of war, but our men do it contrary to the law of God;
those in doing as they did, did not sin against their knowledge; but our men
in doing as they do, do sin against their conscience.

Unhappy parents, which destroy your children in Popish, and Atheistical
houses! What are you inferior to them, that sacrificed their children unto
Devils? If your selves be righteous, and Christians, cast not away your seed,
your children, the price of the precious blood of Christ. You have made them in
their Baptism, when they were young, to confess Christ: will you make them
now, grown to years, to deny Christ? O, let the words of wise Ecclesiasticus,
chap. 13.1. be precious in your memories: He that touches pitch shall be
defiled therewith: and doubtless your children placed in Atheistical, or
Popish houses, will themselves become Atheistical, or Popish.

Suffer, I beseech you, a word of exhortation in your childre^s behalf. Bind
them to none, but to Christ; put them to none, but to Christians; sell them to
nothing, but to the gospel: commit not your young ones into the hands, and
custody of Gods enemies.

A third use. Is it not lawful to commit the children of believers into the
hands of infidels, for the reason above specified, that they be not withdrawn
from the true service of God? The^ neither is it lawful for you of your selves
to keep away your servants, from the service of God. It is reputed for a
tyranny in Pharaoh, Exodus 5.3, 4. That he would not suffer the children of
Israel to go three days journey into the desert to sacrifice to the LORD,
their God: and how can you free your selves from the impeachment of tyranny,
if you deny your servants to go but one hours journey, to this place, to serve
their God?

Think it not enough, that your selves come hither to perform some duty to
Christ your LORD, and Master; how ca^ you perform your duty to him, if you
deny him your servants? You know what charge is given you in the fourth
commandment; not your selves only, but also your sons, and your daughters,
and your servants, men, and maidens, and the stranger that soiourneth with you,
are to hallow, and Sanctify the Sabbath day with the Lords service.

In this holy work and service of God upon the Sabbath day, regard not what
the multitude, and greater sort of men do. Suppose all the world besides your
selves, would be careless to perform this duty; yet let your holy resolution
be the same with Joshua's, chap. 24.15. I, and my house will serve the Lord.
Thus far of my first doctrine, grounded upon God's dislike with the
Philistines, for selling away the Israelites, his faithful people, into the
hands of the Edomites, an unbelieving nation.

To ground a second doctrine hereon; we are to note, that the Philistines sold
away the Israelites to the Idumaeans, at such time as they were their captives:
and so did add affliction to the afflicted. The doctrine is, It is a very
grievous thing, to add affliction to the afflicted.

Witness the complaint made by the captive Jews against the insolency of the
Chaldeans, Psalm. 137.3. They that led us away captive required of us songs, and
mirth in our heaviness, saying; sing us one of the songs of Sion. They] the
Chaldeans, the Babylonians, and Assyrians, in whose country we were prisoners,
required of vs] scornefully, and disdainefully, thereby to add to our griefs:
they required of us songs] such songs, as we were wont to sing in Sion,
Jerusalem, and our own country before the destruction of the Temple, and our
captivity. They required of us, not songs only, but mirth also] they
scoffingly desired us to be merry, when they saw us so heavy hearted, as
nothing could make us glad. They required of us songs and mirth in our
heaviness, saying; sing us one of the songs of Sion] sing for us, or in our
hearing, some one, or other of those songs, which you were wont to sing in
Sion, when you were at home in your own country.

Intolerable is the hard heartedness, cruelty, and scoffing nature of the
wicked, when they have gotten Gods children into their nets. God cannot away
with such unmercifulness, and want of pity. He reproves it in the
Babylonians, Esai, 47.6. where thus says the LORD, I was wroth with my people,
I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou did
show them no mercy; but thou did lay thy very heavy yoke upon the ancient:
therefore now hear, destruction shall come upon thee. Magna abominatio coram
Deo est, afflicto addere afflictionem; clamatque in coelum vox sanguinis. The
words are the observation of Oecolampadius upon the now cited place of Esai:
It is a great abomination before God, to add affliction to the afflicted; the
voice of blood cries up to heaven for vengeance. Yea, we are assured by Psalm.
102.19. that the LORD looks down from the height of his sanctuary, and out
of heaven beholds the earth, that he may hear, and so take pity of the
sighings, groanings, and lamentable cries of such his people, as are in
affliction.

The time will not suffer me now to trouble you with more texts of Scripture;
let the now alleged be sufficient to confirm my propounded doctrine, that it
is a grievous thing to add affliction to the afflicted.

The uses of this doctrine, I can but point at. One is, to reprove the Nimrods,
and tyrants of this world, which have no pity, no compassion upon the poor,
and distressed. Such in the end shall know by their own lamentable
experience, that to be true, which Solomon has uttered, Prove. 21.13. He that
stops his ear at the crying of the poor, shall cry himself and not be
heard.

A second use is to stir us up to the performance of this our Christian
duty, even to take pity upon all, that are in any kind of misery: if our
neighbors be destitute of aid and help, we may not like wild beasts, lift up
our selves against them, and so tread them under foot. No. How dare we molest,
and trouble them, whom by Gods appointment we are to relieve, and succor? We
are commanded, Deuteronomy. 15.11. to open our hands to the needy, and poor, that are
in our land: to open our hands to them for their help, and succor.

It is not enough for us to abstain from all injury, and harme-doing but
withal must we endeavor to relieve the oppressed.

This service of ours will be acceptable unto God. God for it will give us his
blessing: God will bless us for the time of our being here; and when the day
of our dissolution shall be, that we must leave this earthly tabernacle, then
will the Son of man, sitting upon the throne of his glory, welcome us with a
venite benedicti; Come ye blessed of my father, inherit ye the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundations of the world. For I was an hungered, and
ye gave me meat; I thirsted, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye
lodged me; I was naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I
was in prison, and ye came unto me; in as much as you have done these things
to the needy, and distressed, ye have done them unto me. Come ye blessed of
my Father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundations of the
world.

THE THIRTEENTH LECTVRE
AMOS 1.7, 8. Therefore will, I send a fire upon the walls of Azzah, and it
shall devour the palaces thereof.

And I will cut of the inhabitant from Ashdod.


We are come to the last part of this prophecy, the description of the
punishments, to be inflicted upon the Philistines. The seventh verse does not
much differ from the fourth. The same punishment, which is there threatened to
the Syrians, under the names of Hazael, and Benhadad, is in this seventh verse
denounced to the Philistines, under the name of Azzah. And therefore, as there
I did, so must I here commend unto you three circumstances.

1 The punisher: the LORD, I. 2 The punishment: by fire, I will send a fire. 3
The punished: the Azzites, the inahbitants of that city: the Philistines: upon
the walls, and palaces of Azzah.
The punisher is the LORD, for thus says the LORD, I will send. The note
yields us this doctrine.

It is proper to the Lord to execute vengeance upon the wicked for their sins.
This doctrine I proved at large in my eighth lecture upon this prophecy. Yet
for their sakes, who then heard me not, or have forgotten, what then they
heard, I will by a few texts of Scripture again confirm it unto you: It is
proper to the LORD to execute vengeance upon the wicked for their sins.

This office of executing vengeance upon the wicked for their sins, God
arrogateth and assumeth to himself, Deuteronomy. 32.35. where he says, vengeance,
and recompense are mine. This due is ascribed unto the LORD by St Paul, Romans
12.19. It is written vengeance is mine, I will repay says the LORD. By the
author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, chap. 10.30. Vengeance belongs unto
me, I will recompense, says the LORD. By the sweet singer Psalm. 94.1. O LORD,
God, the avenger, O God the avenger. The Prophet Nahum trebleth the phrase,
chap. 1.2. The LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, the LORD will take vengeance
on his adversaries. These few texts of holy writ do firmly prove my doctrine:
It is proper to the LORD to execute vengeance upon the wicked for their sins.

One use of this doctrine is; to teach us heedfulnesse in all our ways; that we
do not work wickedness before the LORD, and so provoke him to execute his
vengeance on us. Beloved, let us not forget it: though God be good, gracious,
merciful, and long suffering yet is he also a just God, God the avenger, and
punisher. It is proper unto him to execute vengeance upon the wicked for their
sins.

A second use is, to admonish us not to intermeddle in the Lords office. It Is
his office to execute vengeance; we therefore may not do it. If a brother, or
neighbor, or stranger, do wrong us, it is our part to forgive him, and leave
revengement to God, to whom it appertains. To this Christian, and charitable
course, our Savior works us by a strong argument, Matthew. 6.15. If ye do
not forgive men their trespasses, no more will your father forgive you your
trespasses. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven; forgive not, and ye shall
never be forgiven.

Wherefore (dearly beloved) suffer your selves to be exhorted, as the Romans
were by St Paul, chap, 12.19. Dearly beloved, if it be possible, as much as in
you is, have peace with all men; recompense to no man evil for evil: avenge
not your selves, but give place unto wrath, for it is written: vengeance is
mine, I will repay says the LORD. It is proper to the Lord to execute
vengeance upon the wicked for their sins. Here we see, that for the sins
of the Philistines. God resolves to send a fire to devour their walls and
palaces. This was my second crcumstance; the circumstance of the punishment: I
will send a fire.]

Many desolations has God wrought by fire. By fire he laid wast Sodom,
Gomorah, and their sister cities, Genesis 19.24. By fire he did eat up Nadab, and
Abihu, Levit. 10.2. By fire, he cut of the two hundred and fifty men, that
were in the rebellion of Korah, Number. 16.35. By fire he devoured two captains,
and twice fifty men, 2. King 1 10. and 12. Why do I load your memories with
multitude of examples for this point? My text tells you that fire, God's
creature, becomes God's instrument, and executioner of his vengeance for the
sins of Azzah, to consume her walls, and devour her palaces.

I will send a fire] See lect. 8.
By fire in this place, as verse the 4. the learned expositors do understand,
not only natural fire, but also the sword, and pestilence, and famine:
quodlibet genus consumptionis, every kind of consumptio^, every scourge,
wherewith God punishes the wicked, be it hail, or thunder, or sickness, or
any other of God's messengers. So large is the signification of fire in the
metaphorical understanding. The doctrine is,

The fire, (whether natural, or Metaphorical) that is, The fire, and all
other creatures, are at the LORD'S commandment, to be employed by him in the
punishment of the wicked.

A truth heretofore proved unto you, as out of other places of holy writ, so
out of the story of God's visitation upon Pharaoh, and the Egyptians, Exodus 8,
9, and 10. chapters, whereby you know, that frogs, lice, flies, grasshoppers,
thunder, hail, lightning, murraine, botches, and sores, did instrumentally
avenge God upon man, and beasts in Egypt. I stand not now to enlarge this
proof.

The use of this doctrine is; to teach us, how to behave our selves, at such
times as God shall visit us with his rod of correction: how to carry our selves
in all our afflictions. We must not so much look to the instruments as to the
LORD, that smites by the^. If the fire, or water, or any other of God's
creatures, shall at any time rage, and prevail against us, we must remember
that it is God, that sends them, to work his holy will upon us. Here he sent
a fire upon Azzah, to consume her walls, and devour her palaces.

Here you have my third circumstance; the circumstance of the punished: in
these words; the walls of Azzah, and the palaces thereof] Azzah one of the five
provinces, or dutchies of Palaestina, and a city of the same name, as I showed
you in my last lecture. The walls and palaces here mentioned, do signify thus
much; that the city Azzah was well fortified, and beautified with sumptuous
buildings? Yet must Azzah, notwithstanding the beauty of her buildings, and
strength of her strong holds, be devoured with fire. I will send a fire upon
the wall of Azzah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.]

The great city Azzah for all her strong walls, must she be spoiled? The
doctrine to be learned from hence, is: No munition can save that city, which
God will have destroyed.

The reason is; because there is no strength but of God, and from God. For what
are all the munitions in the world to the great God of Heaven, and earth? Psalm.
68.2.
As the smoke vanishes, so do they vanish; and as the wax melts before the
fire, so melt they at the breath of the LORD. The munitions of Edom they fail
before him. Edom, the kingdom of Edom, upon which God stretched the line of
vanity, and the stones of emptines, as witnesses the Prophet Esai, cha.
34.11. It is no more a kingdom; it brings forth thorns in her palaces;
nettles, and thistles in her strong holds. The munitions of Edom are vanished
as smoke.

The munitions of Moab, they fail before him. Moab, the kingdom of Moab, had
a strong staff, and beautiful rod, as speaks Ier. chap. 48.17. but they are
broken. Moab is destroyed, his cities are burnt up, his strong holds are gone.
The munitions of Moab, are vanished as smoke.

The munitions of Israel fail before him. Israel, the kingdom of Israel, was
God's peculiar, and shadowed under the wings of his protection: yet at length
infected with the leprosy of sin, they were spoiled of their strong holds; so
says Hoseah, chap. 10.14. A tumult shall arise among the people, and all thy
munitions shall be destroyed. The munitions of Israel are vanished as smoke.

The munitions of Judah fail before him. Judah, the kingdom of Judah, great
among the nations, and a princess among the provinces, she is now become
tributary, as complains the Prophet, Lament. 1.1. The LORD has destroyed
Lament. 2.2.
all the habitations of Iaacob, and has not spared, he has thrown down in
his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he has cast the^ down
to the ground. The munitions of Judah, are vanished as smoke. Let these few
instances in the states of Edom, Moab, Israel, and Judah, serve for proof of
my doctrine, No munition can save that city, which God will have destroyed.

You will remember the reason of it; because there is not strength, but of God,
and from God.

The use of this doctrine is, to teach us, never to trust in any worldly
help, but so to use all good means of our defense, that still we rely upon
the LORD for strength and success thereby. Beloved in the LORD, we have
learned, that a horse his help is vain, Psalm. 33.17. that man's help is
vain, Psalm. 60.11. that the help of Princes is vain, Psalm, 146.3. that
much strength is vain, 2. Chron. 25.7. that much wealth is vain, Psalm. 49.6.
that all worldly helps are vain, Esai: 30.1. All under God is vanity. Wherefore
now, and all other times, let our trust be only in the name of the LORD, who
has made heaven, and earth. Thus much of my first doctrine grounded upon the
third circumstance of this 7. verse, the circumstance of the punished, No
munition can save that city which God will have destroyed.

Again this overthrow of the walls of Azzah in Gods anger, teaches us thus
much, It is the good blessing of God upon a kingdom, to have walls, strong
holds, munitions, fortresses, and bulwarks, for a defense against enemies.

The reason is, because these be the means, which God usually blesses, to
procure outward safety.

The use is to teach us carefully to prepare such against time of trouble: yet
with this caution, that we rest not in them, but depend wholly upon Gods
blessing.

And here we are to pour out our souls in thankfulness before Almighty God,
for blessing this our country with the strength of walls; of walls by sea, and
walls by land; by sea with ships, and at land with strongholds, castles, and
fortresses; by sea, and land, with men of wisdom, and valor, to bid battle to
the proudest enemy, that dare advance himself against us. Confess we with
David, Psalm. 18.2. The LORD is our rock, our fortress, he that delivers us,
our God, our strength, our shield, the horn of our salvation, and our refuge.
In him we trust, and Psalm. 56.11.
fear not, what man can do unto us.

Yet further. The fire in Gods anger devouring the palaces of Azzah, teaches
us, that, God depriveth us of a great blessing, when he takes from us our
dwelling houses.

This doctrine I commended to you in my eighth lecture upon this prophecy. The
truth is experimentally made good unto us, by that great commodity, or
contentment, that comes to every one of us by our dwelling houses.

The use of this doctrine is threefold. It teaches us, 1. to be humbled
before Almighty God, whenever our dwelling houses are taken from us, 2. since
we peaceably enjoy our dwelling houses, to use them for the furthera^ce of Gods
glory, 3. to praise God continually for the comfortable use we have of our
dwelling houses. Thus far of the 7. verse. The 8. follows.

And I will cut of the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holds the sccpter
from Ashkelon] Ashdod and Ashkelon, were two chief cities of Palaestina. One
of the^, as here it appears, was the place of residence for the chief ruler
over that state. To both, Ashdod and Ashkelon, to the inhabitants of Ashdod,
and the scepter-bearer in Ashkelon, to king, and subject, Gods sore judgment,
even a cutting of, is here threatened.

I will cut of the inhabitant of Ashdod] Of the like judgment in the same
words you have heard before in the 5. verse threatened to the Syrians, I will
cut of the inhabitant of Bikeath-Aven, and him that holds the scepter out of
Beth-eden. The words I then expounded at large: the brief or sum whereof, is:

I] the LORD, JEHOVAH, will cut of] will utterly destroy, and root out, the
inhabitant] not one alone, but all, and every one of the inhabitants, of
Ashdod] one of the five chief cities of the Philistines: And I will utterly
destroy, or root out, him that holds the scepter] the Philistines their
chief ruler; their King, making his residence at Ashkelon] an other of the
five cities of Palaestina. I will cut of the inhabitant of Ashdod, and him that
holds the scepter from Ashkelon.]

In the words I observe, as before, three circumstances.

1 The punisher, the LORD; I. 2 The punishment, a cutting of; I will cut of. 3
The punished, the inhabitants of Ashdod, and the scepter bearer of Ashkelon.
By the first circumstance, (the LORD himself taking vengeance into his own
hands,) you may be remembered of a doctrine, often commended to you in this,
and other lectures.

It is proper to the LORD to execute vengeance upon the wicked for their
sins. From al three circumstances, of the punisher, the punishment, and the
punished jointly considered, we may take a profitable lesson. We see that the
cutting off of the inhabitants of Ashdod, and of him that holds the scepter
from Ashkelon, is the Lords proper work. The lesson which we learn from hence
is, No calamity or misery, befalls any one of whatsoever estate, or degree,
by chance, or at adventure.

This doctrine I handled at large in my tenth Lecture. The truth of it
depends upon this proposition.

The whole world, with all things therein, is wholly and alone subject to the
sovereignty, dominion, and rule of almighty God; by whose providence all things
are preserved, all things are ruled, all things are ordered. These were the
three degrees, by which I told you, you might discern and take notice of the
act of divine providence. The first was gradus conservationis; the second
gradus gubernationis; the third was gradus ordinationis; the first degree was
the degree of maintenance or preservation; the second degree was the degree of
rule or government; the third degree was the degree of ordination or direction.

The first implies thus much, that All things in general, and every thing in
particular, are by Almighty God sustained ordinarily in the same state of
nature and natural proprieties, wherein they were created.

The second thus much, that Almighty God for his unlimited power governs all
things in the world, and rules them, pro liberate voluntatis suae, even as he
lists.

The third thus much, that God of his admirable wisdom ordains, and sets
in order, whatsoever things in the world seem to be most out of order: he
brings all to his chiefly intended end; all do make for his glory.

In this divine ordination, three things do concur: constitutio finis,
mediorum ad finem dispositio, and dispositorum directio. First God appoints
an end to every thing. Secondly he disposes the means unto the end. Thirdly
he directs the means so disposed. From these points thus summarily
rehearsed, I infer my propounded doctrine: No calamity, or misery befalls
any one of whatsoever estate, or degree by chance, or at adventure.

For if it be true (as true it is, and the gates of Hell shall never be able to
prevail against it,) that God by his wonderful providence maintains, and
preserves; rules, and governs; orders, disposes, and directs all
things in this world, even to the very hairs of our heads; it cannot be, that
any calamity, or misery should befall any one of us by adve^ture, by
hap-hazzard, by chance, by fortune.

The Epicure in JOB, chap. 22.13. was in a gross and foul error, to think
that God walking in the circle of heaven, cannot through the dark clouds see
our misdoings, (...) beloved) so (...) God, to (...) and not (...) in the
valleys; (...). We may (...) better things (...) 23. Psal^ 139. that God is
every (...) that there is no evasion from him. No corner in hell, no (...) in
(...), no ca^e in the t^ppe of Carmel, no fishes belly in the bottom of the
sea, no dark dungeo^ in the land of captivity, no place of any secrecy any
where, is able to hide us from the presence of God.

The least moments, and titles in the world, that you can imagine, God his care
and providence reaches unto: to a handful of ^eale; to a cruse of ^ile in a
poor widows house; to the falling of sp^^r^wes to the ground; to the
clothing of the grass of the field; to the feeding of the bi^ds of the air;
to the calving of hindes; to the numbering of the hairs of our heads, and of
the tears, that trickle down our cheeks.

Wherefore (dearly beloved in the LORD) whatsoever calamity or misery, has
already seized upon us, or shall hereafter overtake us, let us not lay it upon
blind fortune, but look we rather to the hand that strikes us. He who is
noted in my text to cut of the inhabitant of Ashdod, and him that holds the
scepter from Ashkelon, he it is, that for our sins brings upon us
calamities, and miseries. Whatsoever calamities, or miseries, do molest; or
trouble us, be we assured that they are Gods visitations upon us for our sins,
and admonishments for v^ to amend our lives.

What remains then, but that in time of misery, and heavines, we lovingly
embrace Gods hand, and kiss the rod, wherewith he smites us? If he smite us
with any kind of cross, or tribulation, our best way is, to turn unto him,
as with a spirit of contentment, and gladness, because so loving a father does
chastise us; so with a sorrowful, and contrite heart, because we have offended
so gracious a father: and thus shall we find comfort to our souls.

THE FOVRTEENTH LECTVRE
AMOS 1.8. And turn mine hand to Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines
shall perish, says the LORD God.


THe last time I began to expound the 8. verse: then I passed over two branches
thereof; And I will cut of the inhabitant from Ashd^d, and him that holds the
scepter from Ashkelon; whence considering the cutting off, of king and subject,
from Ashdod, and Ashkelon, to be the proper work of the Lord, I took this
lesson, No calamity or misery, befalls any one of whatsoever estate, or
degree, by chance, or at adventure.

Now let us proceed to the remainder of that verse.

And turn my hand to Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish,
says the LORD God. Is not God a spirit? How the^ has he hands? The letter
kills, but the spirit give^h life, says S. Paul, 2. Cor. 3.6. An ancient
Augustine de Doctrina Christiana lib. 3. cap. 5.
Father upon those words advises us to beware, that we take not a figurative
speech according to the letter; for, says he, when we take that which is
spoken in a figure, as if it were spoken properly, it is a carnal sense, Neque
vlla mors animae congruentius appellatur; neither is there any thing more
rightly called the death of the soul. If a figurative speech be properly
taken, or if the letter be urged against the spiritual meaning, that, which
was spoken to give life to the inward man, may subvert the faith, and enda^
(...) ^itted, not ad^ (...) ^o err. They (...) touching his o^ (...) days I
will (...) to err. He took it literally which Christ spoke in a f^^^e,
touching man's regeneration, Ioh. 3.3. Except a man be borne again, he cannot
see the kingdom of God. It caused the Disciples of Christ to err. They took
it literally which Christ spoke in a figure, touching the exception of his
Fathers will, Ioh. 4.32. I have meat to eat, that ye know not of.

I hold it to be an error of Nicephorus, and others, to take it after the
letter, (...) if Paul had indeed fought upon a theater with Lyo^^ at Ephes^^^
because he says, ^. Cor. 1^.32. that he fought with (...) Eph^s^^^. For in
the (...) and some Ruinold. Idol. 2.6.6.
(...) of this age, he spoke it (...) to design (...) ^dered assembly (...)
upon the com^^^^^ of the silver smith (...) for d^fence of g^^as Di^^^.

I am assured it is an error of all the Papists, to take it after the letter,
which Christ spoke, Matthew. 26.26. This is my body. There is a figure in the
speech. For in all sacraments, there is a great difference between the signs,
and the things signified. The signs are visible, the things invisible: the
signs earthly, the things heavenly: the signs corruptible the things
immortal: the signs co^porall, the things spiritual and as a reverend Dr.
BILION. B of Winchester of Christian Subjection p^r 4. page 577 edit. Lo^d in
8, 1586.
Father speaks in the person of Theophilus, the signs are one thing, the
truth is not the same, but another thing; and even by plain Arithmeticke, they
be two things, and not one. This is my body. There is a figure in the speech.
He calls the bread his body, by way of signification, by way of similitude, by
way of representation, after the manner of Sacraments, in a sign, not
according to the letter, but in a spiritual and mystical understanding, and
if you respect the precise speech; improperly, and figuratively. I will not hold
you with other like instances. These few already spoken of (...) serve, to make
it pl^i^^, that the (...) ^d^^tting of a T^^^ or Fig^re there, where in gr^^t
reason it ought to be admitted, is a cause of error.

I have given this note in this place (beloved) because the phrase here used in
the person of the everliuing God, ( I will turn my hand to Ekron) being spirit
and life, has been by some mistaken, and applied to a carnal sense. From
hence a^ from other places of holy Scripture, in which other the members of
man's body are ascribed unto God; as the Psalm. 27.8.
face, the Deuteronomy. 8.3.
mouth, the 2. Kin. 19.16.
ears, Ibid. and Zach. 4.10.
eyes, 1. Kin. 8 42.
arms, Matthew. 5 35. and 22.44.
feet, and some other; Tertullian living near unto the Apostles time, was bold
to conclude, that God is a BODY. This his erroneous, and false opinion, died
not with him. It was on foot many a year after him in the time of Arius,
patronised by those Heretics, which by Epiphanius are called Audiani, and by
Augustine, Augustine. de haeres. cap 50.
Vadianis after whom also it was egerly maint^ined by certain Monks of Egypt,
who were there upon called Anthropomorphita. But all these are dead and gone;
their monstrous error lies buried with them. There is no man of any knowledge
now a days so blinded, as to fall into error with them.

It is an axiom in divinity: Quaecunque de Deo corporaliter dicu^tur, dicta
sunt symbolice: whatsoever is spoken of God bodily, that same must be
understood figuratively. Bellarmine says as much, lib. 2. de imag. sanct. cap.
8. Membra, quae tribuuntur Deo in Scriptura, metaphorice esse accipienda, that
those members, which the Scripture assigns unto God, are to be taken in a
Metaphor. Thus far we are yours, Bellarmine. We maintain with you, that the
members attributed unto God in holy Scripture, are to be taken figuratively.
But you build hereupon chafe, and stubble. Should we do the like, it could
never abide the trial of the fire.

To prove a non licet, to be your licet: Licere pingere imagine^ Dei patris in
forma hominis senis, to prove it to be lawful to represent God the Father by
the image of an old man, you draw an argument from those places of Scripture,
which do attribute unto God bodily members. Your conclusion is by way of
question. The Scripture in words attributes unto God all man's members; while
it says, that he stands, he sits, he walks; and names his head, his feet,
his arms; and gives to him, a seat, a throne, a footstool: therefore why
cannot a picture be made to represent God? Why not an image in the shape of
man? Why? It is easily answered.

Because every such picture, or image, or stock (call it as you will) is
censured by Jeremy, to be a doctrine of vanity, chap. 10.8. by Zachary, to
be a speaker of vanity, chap. 10.2. by Habakkuk, to be a teacher of lies, chap.
2.18. and Gods express commandment is against it, Deuteronomy. 4.16. You shall not
make you a graven image, or representatio^ of any figure. A reason of this
prohibition is adioined, verse. 12. and 15. by which it is manifest, that God
simply, and absolutely, forbids any image at all to be made of himself:
For ye saw no similitude in the day, that the LORD spoke unto you in Horeb out
of the midst of the fire; ye saw no similitude, only ye heard a voice.

The Prophet Esai is plentiful in this demonstration, to show how unseemly, and
absurd it is, to Romans 1.25.
turn the truth of God into a lie, as they do, who forsake the blessed
Creator to worship the creature: to turn the Majesty of God invisible, into a
picture of visible man: to verse. 23.
turn the glory of the incorruptible God, to the similitude of the image of a
corruptible man. His vehement expostulation with idolaters to this purpose is
in the 40. chapter of his prophecy, and the 18. verse. To whom will ye liken
God? or what similitude will ye set up unto him? the workman melts an
image; the goldsmith beats it out in gold, or silver plates: the poor, (see
now the rage, fury, and madness of idolaters, though they have not, wherewith
to suffice their own necessities, they will defraud themselves to serve their
idols) the poor chooses out a tree, that will not rot, for an oblation, and
puts it to a cunning workman to prepare an image, that cannot be moved.

The like expostulation the same Prophet ascribes to God himself, chap. 46.5.
To whom will ye make me like, or make me equal, or compare me, that I should
be like him? They draw gold out of the bag; and weigh silver in the balance,
and hire a goldsmith to make a God of it: and they bow down, and worship it:
they bear it upon their shoulders, they carry him, and set him in his place;
so does he stand, and cannot remove from his place.

Remember this, and be ashamed, o ye Idolaters. Esai 40.21.
Know ye nothing? have ye not heard it? has it not been told you from the
beginning? have ye not understood it by the foundation of the earth? God
sits upon the circle of the earth, and beholds the inhabiters thereof, as
grasshoppers, he stretches out the heavens as a curtain, and spreads them out,
as a tent to dwell in. He Esai 40.12.
measures the waters in his fist, counts heaven with his span, comprehends the
dust of the earth in a measure, weighes the mountains in a weight, and the
hills in a balance. God incorporeall, invisible, spiritual, passing al
measure; there is nothing Esai 46.9.
like unto him. No thing. And therefore (O Idolaters) not your old man's image.

For the truth of your antecedent, we stand on your side. It Is very true: the
Scripture in express words attributes unto God many the members, and offices
of man's body. It says of him, that he stands, he sits, he walks: it names
his head, his feet, his arms; it gives him a seat, a throne, a footstool:
but all these, and other like bodily offices, parts, and members, being spoken
of, as belonging unto God, must be understood figuratively.

It has pleased the spirit of wisdom to deal with us (...), to fit the holy
Scriptures to our weak capacities: to use known, familiar, and sensible
terms, thereby to raise up our conceits to some knowledge of the everliving
God. In this regard by the wisdom of the same spirit, among many other
members, Hands, are also ascribed unto God, and that in many places; yet not in
every place to one, and the same sense, and understanding.

It Is noted by the Cent. 13. cap. 4.
Magdeburgenses out of Innocentius, that the hand of God does bear diverse
offices among us: officia creatoris, largientis, protegentis, minantis: the
offices of a Creator, liberal giver, protector, and threatner, Hands are
ascribed unto God, sometime to show, that he is the Creator of all things, as,
Psalm. 119.73. Thy hands have made me, and fashioned me: sometime to show his
liberality to all living things, as Psalm. 145.16. Thou openest thy hand and
fillest all things living of thy good pleasure: sometime to show the care, he
has to protect, and defend the faithful, as Esai. 49.2. Under the shadow of
his hand has he hid me: and sometime to show his readiness to be avenged upon
the wicked, as Esai. 10.4. His hand is stretched out still. But these, and all
other the significations of the hand of God, I reduce to two heads: to the love
of God, and his displeasure: under them comprehending all their consequents,
and effects.

That the hand of God betokens sometime his love, and the benefits redounding
thence to man, man's being, and his well-being, may easily be proved. In the
second chapter of the book of Judges, ver. 15. we read that the Lords hand was
against the Israelites for evil: the collection thence may be, that the Lords
hand is sometime toward some for good. It Is made plain out of Nehem. 2.8.
where the Prophet, to show how ready Artaxerxes was to do him pleasure, says;
the king gave me according to the good hand of my God upon me. I might by many
like instances out of holy Scripture give strength to this position; but it may
seem to be a needless labor. Therefore I proceed.

Now that the hand of God should betoken his displeasure, and the effects
thereof, may be proved as easily. When the Israelites forsaking God betook
themselves to serve Baalim, the hand of the LORD was sore against the^, Judge.
2.15. the Lords hand; that is, his judgment, punishment, and revengement was
sore upon them: the wrath of the LORD was hot against them: he delivered them
into the the hands of the spoilers: they were spoiled sold to their enemies,
and sore punished.

When the Philistines, had brought the ark of God into the house of Dagon, the
hand of the LORD was heavy upon them, 1. Sam. 5.6. the Lords hand, that is, his
judgment, punishment, and revengement was heavy upon them. Psalm. 78.64, 65.
The LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a giant refreshed with wine, he
smote his enemies with Emerods, and put them to a perpetual shame. Of like
signification is the phrase in my text: I will turn my hand to Ekron: my hand
shall be sore against Ekron; I will come against Ekron in Judgment; I will
punish Ekron, I will take vengeance on Ekron.

I will turn my hand] Sometime this phrase betokens the good grace, and
favor of God, as Zach. 13.7. I will turn my hand upon my little ones. My
little ones, (when the shephearde shall be smitten, and the sheep scattered,)
I will recover with my hand, and preserve them for ever: I will gather them
together, I will comfort them, I will defend them: rursus ad pastorem, et
praeceptorem suum reducam, says Ribera: though they be scattered, I will bring
them back again to their own shepherd, and master. There, you see, Gods
turning of his hand upon his little ones, is for good.

Here it is otherwise. God turns his hand to Ekron for evil. This is averred
and justified by the infallible predictions of other Prophets. Zachary, chap.
9.5. foretells, that much sorrow shall betide Ekron. Zephani, chap. 2.4.
says, that Ekron shall be rooted up. Jeremy, chap. 25.20. takes the cup of
the wine of Gods indignation, and gives it Ekron to drink, to make Ekron like
her neighbor countries, even desolate, an astonishment, a h^ssing, and a
curse. So great is Ekrons calamity, threatened in these words of my text; I will
turn my hand to Ekron.

Ekron] Will you know what this Ekron was? You shall find in the book of
Joshua, chap. 13.3. that it was a dukedom in the land of the Philistines, and
1. Sam. 6.16. that there was in this dukedom, a city of the same name; no base
city, but a princes seat; able at one time to give entertainment to five
princes. Against both, city, and dukedom, Gods hand was stretched out. I will
turn my hand to Ekron. Will God smite Ekron, both city and dukedom? We may
take from hence this lesson.

There is no safe being in city, or country from the hand of God, when he is
disposed to punish. The reason is: because there is no place to fly unto from
his presence: None. No corner in Hell, no mansion in Heaven, no cave in the top
of Carmel, no fishes belly in the bottom of the sea, no dark dungeon in the
land of captivity, no place of any fecrecie any where can hide us from the
presence of God. Witness two holy Prophets, David, and Amos. The one, Psalm.
139. the other, chap. 9. You have the reason of my doctrine: the uses follow.

Is it true? Is there no safe being in city, or country, from the hand of God,
when he is disposed to punish? One use hereof is, to teach us to take patiently
whatsoever afflictions shall befall us. Afflictions I call, whatsoever is any
way opposite to humane nature; such as are the temptations of the flesh, the
world, and the Devil: the diseases of the body, an unfortunate husband, or
wife, rebellious children, unthankful friends, loss of goods, reproaches,
sclanders, war, pestilence, famine, imprisonment, death, every cross, and
passion, bodily, or ghostly, proper to our selves, or appertaining to such as
are of our blood, private or public, secret or manifest, either by our own
deserts gotten, or otherwise imposed upon us.

All, and every of these, true Christians will patiently undergo. For they
with their sharp sighted eye of faith, do clearelie see the Hand of God in
every of their molestations: and in great contentment they take up the words of
patient Job, chap. 2.10. Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and not
receive evil?

Here let every afflicted soul examine it self, how it is affected with the
affliction, under which i^ groaneth. If you esteem of your afflictions, as of
God his fatherly chastisements, and so endure them, blessed are ye: Of this
blessedness S. James, chap. 1.12. does assure you: Blessed is the man, that
endures tentatio^: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life,
which the LORD has promised to them, that love him.

Again; is it true? Is there no safe being in city, or country, from the hand
of God, when he is disposed to punish? A second use of this doctrine is, to
admonish us, that we labor above al things to obtain Gods favor, and to
abide in it: so shall we be safe from the fear of evil.

Now for the obtaining of Gods favor, we must do four things. We must 1.
Humble our selves before God; 2. Believe in Christ; 3. Repent of our sins; 4.
Perform new obedience unto God.

The time will not suffer me to enlarge these points. Humiliation, faith in
Christ, repentance, and a new life; these four will be unto you, as Jacobs
ladder was unto the Angels. Of that ladder you may read, Genesis 28.12. that it
stood upon the earth; the top of it did reach to heaven, and the Angels of God
went up it. So may you, by these four, Humiliation, faith, repentance, and
newness of life, as it were by so many steps, and rounds of a ladder, clime up
to heaven.

Here you have no continuing city; you are but strangers, and pilgrims on the
earth; your country is above, the Celestial Jerusalem: there let your hearts
be. As for the afflictions, vexations, tribulations, miseries, and crosses,
wherewith this mortal life of your is seasoned, let them be your joy. They are
sure pledges of Gods love unto you. Even so says the Spirit, Hebr. 12.6. Whom
the LORD loves, he chastneth, and he scourges every son, that he receives.

Thirdly is it true? Is there no safe being in city, or country from the hand
of God, when he is disposed to punish? A third use of this doctrine is, for the
terror of such, as lie wallowing in the filthiness of their sins. Many
there are, wicked wretches, who, if God shall for a time defer the
punishments due unto their sins, are ready to think, that God takes no
notice of their sins. These say in their heart, there is no God.

Against these is made that challenge, Psalm. 50.21. I held my tongue, and thou
thoughtest me like thy self. I] the LORD, who see the secrets of all hearts, I
held my tongue] I did not by my judgments punish thee for the wickedness of
thy steps; I held my tongue, and thou thoughtest me like thy selfe] thou
thoughtest I took pleasure in wickedness, as thou do; but thou shall find,
and feel the contrary.

Strange are the effects wrought in the wicked by the mercies, and long
suffering of God; thereby they grow worse and worse, obdurate, and hardened in
their sins. Yet let them be advised: for the day will come, and it comes
apace, wherein they shall feel the heaviness of that hand, which here was
turned against Ekron: I will turn my hand to Ekron. It follows.

And the (...) of the Philistines shall perish. The Philistines had their
beginning from Castuchim, a grandchild of Ch^^^, the accursed issue of Noah, as
appears, Genes. 10.14. They were seated in a part of the land of Canaan; the
west part, that which bordereth upon the great Sea, the Sea commonly called the
Mediterranean. Their country was called by Ptolemee, and others, Palaestina,
and by the Greeks, Phoenicia. It was a part of that country, which once was
called Terra promissionis, the land of promise; but now Terra sancta, the Holy
land.

The inhabitants in our Prophets time, were professed enemies to Almighty God,
and his beloved Israel. They thought themselves safe from ruin through the
strength of their five dukedomes; Azzah, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. But
vain and foolish, are the thoughts, which possess the wicked. When the God of
all truth shall give his word for a matter, shall man presume to doubt of the
event? Here God sets his word upon it, that there shall be an utter overthrowe,
not only of Azzah, Ashdod, Ashkelon, and Ekron, but of Gath also, and all the
villages belonging thereunto: for the remnant of the Philistines shall perish,
says the LORD God.

Ait Dominus Iehovah] says the LORD God. This is the conclusion of this
prophecy, and it redoubleth its authority, and credit. Authority and
credit sufficient, it has from its very front, verse the 6. Thus says the
LORD: it is here redoubled; says the LORD God.

Says the LORD God] has the LORD God said it, and Number. 23.19.
shall he not do it? has he spoken it, and shall he not accomplish it? The
LORD, JEHOVAH, the strength of Israel, is not as man, that he should lie, nor
as the son of man, that he should repent. All his words, yea all the titles
of his words, are Yea, and Amen. Matthew. 5.18.
Heaven and earth shall perish, before one jot, or one title of his word shall
escape unfulfilled, Dominus IEHOVIH, the LORD has said it, that the remnant of
the Philistines shall perish. Out of doubt then must it come to pass. And so
is it.

The first blow, which the Philistines received toward their overthrow after
this prophecy, was given them above threescore years after by Ezechias, that
good King of Judah, of who^ the Prophet Esai, chap. 14.29. foretells the
Philistines, that he should be unto them as a cockatrice, and a fiery flying
serpent. This Ezechias smote the Philistines unto Azzah, and the coasts
thereof, from the watch tower unto the defensed city. This is plain, 2. King
18.8.

A second blow was given by Tartan, one of the captains of Sennacherib, or
Sargon, King of Assyria, who came up against Ashdod, and took it. This is
plain, Esai 20.1.

A third blow was given them by Pharaoh Neco: and he smote Azzah, Ashkelon, and
other places. This is it which the Prophet Jeremy says, chap. 47.5. Baldness
is come upon Azzah, Ashkelon is cut up, with the rest of their valleys. In a
word; God has from time to time raised up his men of war, in due time to
extirpate, and raze out the Philistines from the face of the earth, that
according to the tenor of this prophecy, there might be no remnant of them.

The remnant of the Philistines shall perish] Here may we observe a difference
in Gods punishments; he punishes the reprobate, and he punishes his elect:
but differently: the reprobate to their utter excision, and extirpatio^; not so
the elect. For of them, there is upon the earth evermore a remnant, that shall
be saved: as it is intimated by the Prophet Esai, cha. 1.9. Except the LORD of
hoasts had reserved unto us, even a small remnant, we should have been as
Sodom, and like unto Gomorah. You see a remnant reserved, though a small one.
Yea sometimes there is a reservation of so small a remnant, as is scarsly
visible. As in the days of Eliah, who knew of none, but himself. I only am
left, says he, 1. King. 19.14. Yet God tells him, in the 18. verse, of seven
thousand in Israel, which never bowed their knees to Baal. Hitherto belongs
that, Joel. 2.32. In mount Sion, and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the
LORD has said, and in the remnant, whom the LORD shall call.

Ierem. 25.34.
Howl ye wicked, and cry, and wallow your selves in the ashes, for your days
of dispersion, and slaughter are accomplished, and ye shall fall like the
Philistines, every mothers child of you: the Ierem. 46.10.
sword shall devour you: it shall be satiate, and made drunk with your blood,
there shall not be a re^nant of you left.

But you, the elect and chosen children of God, your Father, take unto you
Esai. 61.3.
beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of gladness for the
spirit of heavines; rejoice ye, and be glad together. Let the prince of
darkness, and all the powers of hell, assisted with the innumerable company of
his wicked vassals upon the earth, join together to work your overthrow, they
shall not effect it. For God, even your God, will reserve unto himself a
remnant.

This remna^t, is the chaste Spouse of Christ, the holy Catholic Church,
enriched from above with all manner of benedictions. Extra cum nulla est salus;
whosoever has not her for his Mother, shall never have God for his Father. Of
this remnant, and Catholic Church, notwithstanding the challenge of Romish
Idolaters, we (beloved) are sound, and lively members. Happy are the eyes,
which see, that we see, and enjoy the presence of him, whom we adore: happy are
the ears, that hear, what we hear, and the hearts, which are partakers of
our instructions. No nation under heaven has a God so potent, so loving, so
near to them, which worship him, as we of this Island have.

The many and bloody practices of that great Antichrist of Rome, so often set
on foot against us, and still defeated, are so many evidences, that our souls
are most precious in the sight of God. He, he alone has delivered us out of
the Lions iaw, to be a holy remnant unto himself. Now what shall we render
unto the LORD for so great a blessing? We will take up the cup of salvation, and
call upon his name.

THE FIFTEENTH LECTVRE.
AMOS 1.9, 10. Thus says the LORD, For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for
four, I will not turn to it, because they shut the whole captivity in Edom,
and have not remembered the brotherly covenant.

Therefore will I send a fire upon the walls of Tyrus, and it shall devour the
palaces thereof.


THis blessed Prophet Amos, sent from God in embassage to the ten revolted
tribes, does first thu^der out Gods judgments against neighbor countries; the
Syrians, the Philistines, the Tyrians, the Edomites, the Ammonites, the
Moabites. Which he does for certain reasons, given in my sixth lecture: that he
might be the more patiently heard of his country men, the Israelites: that they
might have no cause, to think much, if God should at any time lay his rod upon
them; and that they might the more stand in awe of the words of this
prophecy.

When they should hear of such heavy judgments to light upon their
neighbors, they could not, but enter into a consideration of their own
estate; and thus reason within themselves. Is it true, which this Amos says?
Will the LORD bring such heavy judgments upon the Syrians, Philistines,
Tyrians, and other of our neighbors? In what a fearful estate are we in
then? They seely people never knew the will of God; and yet must they be so
severely punished? How then shall we escape, who knowing God's holy will have
contemned it?

Of the (...) the Syrians, and Philistines, you have (...) lectures. Now in the
third place do foll^^ the Tyrians, ver. 9. and 10.

For three transgressions of Tyrus, etc. These words containing a burden some
prophecy against Tyrus, I divide into two parts.

1 A preface, Thus says the LORD. 2 A prophecy, For three transgressions of
Tyrus, etc.
In the prophecy I observe 4. parts.

1 A general accusation of the Tyrians: For three tra^sgressions of Tyrus, and
for four. 2 The Lords protestation against them: I will not turn to it. 3 The
declaration of that grievous sin, by which they so highly offended. This sin
was the sin of unmercifulness, and cruelty, expressed in two branches. 1 They
shut the whole captivity in Edom. 2 They remembered not the brotherly covenant.
4 The description of the punishment to befall them for their sin, in the 10.
verse. Therefore will I send a fire upon the walls of Tyrus, and it shall
devour the palaces thereof.
The preface gives credit unto the prophecy, and is a warrant for the truth of
it. Thus says the LORD] The LORD, JEHOVAH, whose throne is the heaven of
heavens: and the sea his floor to walk in; and the earth his footstool to
tread upon: who has a chair in the conscience, and sits in the heart of
man, and possesses his most secret reins, and divides betwixt the flesh and
the skin, and shakes his inmost powers, as the thunder shakes the wilderness
of Cades. This LORD, JEHOVAH, so mighty, so powerful, shall he say a thing,
and shall he not do it? shall be speak it, and shall he not accomplish it? The
LORD, JEHOVAH. the strength of Israel is not as man, that he should lie, nor as
the son of man, that he should repent. All his words, yea all the titles of all
his words, are Yea, and Amen. Heaven and earth shall perish, before one jot,
or one title of his word shall escape unfulfilled.

Thus says the LORD] Out of doubt then must it come to pass. And because it
is the LORD, that speaks, it is required of us, that we harken to him with
revere^ce. Thus briefly of the Preface; whereof I have more largely spoken in
two former lectures, my sixth, and twelfth lectures upon the third, and sixth
verses of this chapter. In which, these very words are prefixed for a Preface
to two prophecies; the one against the Syrians, the other against the
Philistines. I proceed to the present prophecy against the Tyrians. It Is much
like the two former, both for words and matter. In regard whereof I shall be
short in many of my notes.

For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for foure] Here is nothing new, but the
name of Tyrus. This Tyrus is called in the Hebrew text (...) *
Tzor: whence came the name Sar, and Sarra in Ennius, Poenos Sarra oriundos; he
notes the Carthaginians to have their beginning from Sarra, which is Tyrus.
Tyrus was a very ancient city; it was says Drusius, Vetustissimarum vrbium
parens, as it were, the mother of very old cities. Pliny not. hist. lib. 5.
cap. 19. says, that out of Tyrus came the founders, and first inhabiters, not
only of Carthage, but also of Leptis, Vtica, and Gades, the city well known to
our modern navigators by the name of Calis Malis, and of late years conquered
by some worthies of our English nation.

The ancient glory of this city Tyrus, is blazed abroad to the whole world,
by Ezechiel chap. 27. Glorious was Tyrus: 1. for her situation, 2 for her
riches; 3. for the frame, and beauty of her buildings; 4. for her shipping; 5.
for her power in martial affairs; 6. for her marchandising; 7. for her great
esteem, and report with foreign nations. The Prophet Esai in like sort
blazeth out her glory, chap. 23.7; 8. He says of her: that her antiquity is
of ancient days; that she is the crown of the Sea; that her merchants are
Princes, and her chapmen the nobles of the world. So glorious a city was this
Tyrus.

Here she is accused of disloyalty to the God of heaven, in the very same
words, wherein Damascus, and Azzah, are formerly accused: Damascus, verse. 3.
and Azzah, verse. the 6. For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for foure] And
the Lords protestation upon this accusation is the same, I will not turn to
it] It is as if the LORD had thus said: If the inhabitants of Tyrus had
offended but once, or a second time, I should have been favorable to them,
and would have recalled them into the right way, that so they might be
converted, and escape my punishments: but now, for as much as they do daily
heap transgression upon transgression, and make no end of sinning, I have
hardened my face against them, and will not suffer them to be converted, but
indurate and obstinate, as they are, I will utterly destroy them.

Albertus Magnus understands by these three transgressions, three sorts of
sins; peccatum in voluntate, peccatum in consensu; peccatum in opere: sin in
will, sin in consent, and sin in action: and by the fourth transgression he
understands, cordis indurationem, induration, and hardness of heart; which he
defines to be pertinaciam per^^acendi in peccato, a pertinacie, or stubborn
resolution to persevere in same, wherein the sinner lies wallowing, void of
shame, and all liking of goodness.

I do rather approve Wincklemans judgment, who by these three, and four
transgressions of Tyrus, understands pride, disdain, luxuriousnes of meats
and drinks, costlinesse of garments, wanton lusts, and other like sins,
incident to mart towns, and towns of great trade. That such were the sins
of Tyrus, witness that her sharp, and grievous reprehension, Ezech. 28.

For these three and four, many transgressions and sins, the LORD protests
against Tyrus, I will not turn to it: I will take no pity on them; but will
do unto them according to their works. For three transgressions of Tyrus and
four, etc.] Here are you to be remembered of a doctrine more then once,
heretofore commended to your Christian considerations.

Many sins do pluck down from heaven the most certain wrath, and
vengeance of God upon the sinners. God is of pure eyes, and beholds not
iniquity: He has laid righteousness to the rule, and weighed his justice in a
balance. The sentence is passed forth, and must stand uncontrollable, even as
long as sun and moon: Tribulation and anguish upon every soul that does evil.
The soul that sins, it shall be punished. God makes it good by an oath, Deuteronomy.
32.41. That he will whet his glitering sword, and his hand shall take hold on
judgment to execute vengeance for sin. His soul hates and abhors sin; his
law curses and condemns sin; his hand smites and scourges sin. Sin was
his motive to cast down angels into Hell; to thrust Adam out of Paradise; to
turn cities into ashes; to ruinate nations; to torment his own bowels in the
similitude of sinful flesh. Because of sin he drowned the old world, and
because of sin ere long will burn this. Thus do many sins pluck down
from Heaven the most certain wrath, and vengeance of God upon the sinners.

One use of this doctrine was; to teach us heedfulnesse in all our ways, that
we do not by our many sins provoke Almighty God to high displeasure.

A second use was; to move us to a serious contemplation of the wonderful
patience of Almighty God, who did so graciously forbear these Tyrians, till
by three and four transgressions, by their many sins, they had provoked him
to indignation. These things I have heretofore labored to lay unto your hearts.

Now follows the third part of this prophecy, wherein you have the
declaration of that grievous sin, by which the Tyrians so highly offended:
the sin of unmercifulness, and cruelty; expressed in two branches.

1 They shut up the whole captivity in Edom. 2 They remembered not the
brotherly covenant.
1 They shut up the whole captivity in Edom] The exposition of these words I
have formerly delivered unto you in my twelfth lecture, and my meditations upon
the 6. verse. There the Philistines are condemned for carrying away prisoners
the whole captivity, to shut them up in Edom: and here are the Tyrians
condemned, for shutting the whole captivity in Edom. The sin seems to be the
same in both; the Philistines, and the Tyrians. Both did shut up the whole
captivity in Edom; that is, as Joel chap. 3.6. speaks; they both did sell
away the children of Judah, and the children of Jerusalem unto the Grecians,
that they might send them far from their borders. God his peculiar
inheritance, his own seed, and servants, the children of Judah, and Jerusalem,
were by the cruel, and hard-hearted Philistines, and Tyrians, mancipated, and
sold away for bondslaues to the Grecians, dwelling far of, that with them
they might live in perpetual servitude, and slaverie, without all hope of
liberty, or redemption.

Arias Montanus notes a difference betwixt that sin of the Philistines, and
this of the Tyrians. The Philistines carried away prisoners the whole
captivity, to shut them up in Edom. They did, as they thought, but what they
might do lawfully, by the law of nations. The Jews were their captives, and
prisoners, conquered by a strong hand in open hostility, and for this respect
they shut them up in Edom; they sold them to the Grecians, to be by them
transported to the Idumaeans. But these Tyrians had no such prete^se of excuse.
They did not with a strong hand, in open hostility, conquer the Jews, and so
take them prisoners, but did surprise them by deceit, and treachery, as they
lay at Tyrus for traffic, and intercourse of merchandise, and thus surprised
they shut them up in Edom; they sold them to the Grecians, to be by them
transported to the Idumaeans, far from their own country, even to Italy.
For it is a constant tradition in all Hebrew histories, that a great part of
the Italian nation, specially those that dwelt at Rome, had their beginning
from the Idumaeans. But I will not prosecute this opinion.

They shut the whole captivity in Edom] They spared not, either women, or
children, or the aged; they took no pity, no compassion, upon either sex, or
age; but all of all sorts, male and female, young and old, a whole and perfect
captivity, they delivered up into the hands of the Edomites. The Edomites were
the posterity of Esau, who was named Edom, as the Israelites were the posterity
of Jacob, who was named Israel. Esau pursued Jacob with a deadly hate: so did
the posterity of Esau, the posterity of Jacob. The Edomites were evermore
most maliciously bent against the Israelites.

Now behold the foulness of this sin, wherewith the Tyrians are here
charged. It was the sin of cruelty in a very high degree. It is a cruel deed
to detain any one unlawfully from returning into his native country: but him
that is so detained, to sell away for a bondslaue to his mortallest enemy,
this a cruelty, then which there cannot be a greater. Such was the sin of
these Tyrians. They sold the Jews, Jacobs posterity, and God his servants, to
their professed enemies, the Edomites, with this policy, that being carried
far from their own country, they might live in eternal slaverie, and
bondage, without hope ever to return home again.

They shut the whole captivity in Edom] The Tyrians are here disproued, for
delivering up Gods inheritance, a believing nation, into the hands of profane
Edomites. And it may remember you of a lesson, heretofore commended to your
Christian considerations.

It is not lawful to commit the children of believers into the hands of
infidels.

The reason is, that they be not withdrawn from their holy faith, religious
worship, and service of God.

1 This doctrine serves for our instruction. It teaches us, so to love the
souls of the righteous seed, that we leave them not resident, among infidels,
Atheists, Papists, or other profane wretches, but rather that to our own cost,
and labor, we redeem them out of the Devils tyranny.

2 It serves for the reproof of such, as do bind and put their children (the
fruit of their bodies, which they ought to consecrate unto the LORD) into the
education of open enemies to the gospel of Christ; most blasphemous, and
abominable Atheists, or most blind, and superstitious Papists.

3 Since it is not lawful to commit the children of believers into the hands of
infidels, for the reason above specified, that they be not withdrawn from
their holy faith, religious worship, and true service of God: then neither is
it lawful for us to keep away, or send away our servants from the service of
God.

Let no man say unto me, such a man's servant, and such a man's, are employed in
temporal affairs at the time of divine service, and why should not mine be
likewise? (Dearly beloved) a good Christians part is, to be of like resolution
with Ioshuah, chap. 24.15. Howsoever all the world besides shall be affected in
this business, yet to resolve for himself and his family, as Ioshuah did for
his; I and my house will serve the LORD. I do but touch these points, because
I have heretofore in this place more at large insisted upon them.

Now follows the second branch expressing the sin of the Tyrians, their sin
of unmercifulness, and cruelty.

They have not remembered the covenant of brethren. For this time I note that
men may be called brethren six manner of ways. 1. By nature, as Jacob and
Esau. 2. By kindred, affinity, or alliance, as Abraham and Lot. 3. By nation,
or country, as all Jews. 4. By religion, as al Christians. 5. By friendship,
as Solomon, and Hiram, King of Tire. 6. By calamity, or misery, as many poor
distressed people, who have not wherewith to support their weak natures.

The covenant of brethren here mentioned, some do refer to that league of
amity, which was concluded between King Solomon, and Hiram, King of Tire,
recorded, 1. King. 5.12. Some do properly understand these words, to signify
that natural league, which should have been between Jacob and Esau, natural
brethren, and their posterity in lineall descent, the Jews, Israelites, and
Edomites. Understand it which way you will: the Tyrians were both ways
blameable. First they remembered not the covenant, made between their King, K.
Hiram, and King Solomon. Secondly they remembered not the covenant, made by
nature between the Jews, Israelites, and Edomites, brethren lineally
descended from two natural brethren, Jacob, and Esau. From both expositions
arises profitable doctrine.

First, is Almighty God here displeased with the Tyrians, because they did ill
entreat the Jews, and Israelites, not remembering the ancient covenant
between Hiram, their King, and Solomon, King of Israel? Hence we may take this
lesson, Ancient leagues are not rashly to be violated.

(...), breakers of leagues, truces, and covenants, are, Romans 1.31. ranked
among such, whom God in his secret judgment has given up (...), to a
reprobate sense. Foederum tutor, and vindex Deus est; God is, as it were, a
tutor, or protector of leagues, and severely revengeth himself upon the
breakers of them.

The Gentiles of old by the light of nature did acknowledge as much; and
fearful examples in all ages do prove as much. I will instance, but in few.
Ioshuah made a league with the Gibeonites, and swear that he would suffer them
to live, Josh. 9.15. long after, Saul, and his bloody house slew some of them.
Hereat was the wrath of the LORD kindled, and for this cause he punished the
people with three years famine, and was not appeased with the land, till
seven of Saules sons were delivered up into the hands of the Gibeonites, to
be hanged up in Gibeah, 2. Sam. 21.1.

Zedechiah, king of Judah, made a covenant with Nabuchodonosor, king of Babel,
and swear 2. Kings 24.17. and 2. Chr. 36.13. and Ierem. 52.2
subjection to him. But Zedechiah notwithstanding his oath, took part with the
kings of the Egyptians, Idumaeans, Moabites, Ammonites, and Tyrus against
Nabuchodonosor, what follows this breach of his oath and covenant? Even utter
ruin to himself, his kingdom, the city of Jerusalem, and the glorious temple
there, 2. Chron. 36.17.

Vladislaus, King of Poland, and Hungary, concluded a peace for ten years with
Sultan Amurath, the sixth king of the Turks. Vladislaus took his oath upon the
holy Evangelists, and Amurath his, (by his ambassadors) upon their Turkish
Alcora^. Knolles Hist Turc. p. 289.
This was the most honorable peace, that every Christian Prince had before that
time made with any of the Turkish Kings, and most profitable also, had it been
with like sincerity kept, as it was with solemnity confirmed. Vladislaus page
292.
absolved from his oath by Cardinal Iulianus the Popes Legate, and agent in
Hungary, breaks the concluded peace, and page 297.
invadeth a fresh the Turks dominions. The Turk ioines battle with him at
page 297.
Varna in Bulgaria; and beholding the picture of the crucifixe in the displaied
ensigns of the Christians, pluckes out of his bosom, that writing, wherein
the late league between him, and Vladislaus, was comprised; and holding it up
in his hand with his eyes cast up to heaven, says: Behold, thou crucified
Christ; this is the league, thy Christians in thy name made with me, which they
have without cause violated. Now if thou be a God, as they say thou art, and as
we dream, revenge the wrong now done unto thy name, and me; and show thy power
upon thy periurious people, who in their deeds deny thee, their God. What
followed hereupon? The victory was the Turks. Vladislaus lost his life there,
and eleven thousand Christians besides. The success of this great and bloody
battle of Varna, fought the 10. of November 1444. does it not plainly show,
that God cannot away with league-breakers?

These few instances of Saul, Zedechiah, and Vladislaus may suffice for the
clearing of my propounded doctrine, Ancient leagues are not rashly to be
violated.

The use of this doctrine is, to admonish all subjects to be very respective,
and mindful of that league, and covenant, which they have by their solemn
oaths made, and confirmed to their Kings, Princes, and other governers:
according to that exhortation made by S. Paul, Romans 13.1. Let every soul be
subject to the higher powers. It is not a bare, or naked exhortation; it is
backed with a good reason, For there is no power but of God; and the powers
that are, are ordained of God: it follows in the second verse. Whosoever
therefore resists the power, resists the ordinance of God. Whosoever they
are that resist power, men in authority, princes, rulers, and governors, they
resist God, and God will confound them; their infamy shall remain upon
perpetual record for a spectacle to all posterity. What else means the
Apostle in the same place, where he says: They that resist, shall receive to
themselves judgment?

And here (dearly beloved) I beseech you to beware of Romish Locusts, I mean
Jesuits, and Seminary Priests, who are sent from beyond the seas to inveigle
you, and to make you unmindful, or at least careless, of your covenant,
confirmed by your sacred oaths, with your redoubted sovereign. They will tell
you that your king is an Heretic, because he maintains not their Romish,
new, and vpstart religion: and will thereupon go about to persuade you, that
you are not to keep your faith with him. It is a Devilish doctrine. They have
learned it from Martin the fifth, one of their holy Popes, Cochlaeus Hist.
Hussit. lib. 5. Rainold. These. 42. page 188. Margin.
who in his Epistle to Alexander, Duke of Lituania, says; Scito te peccare
mortaliter, si servabis fidem datam haereticis: Know, says he, that thou
sinnest mortally, if thou keep thy oath made with heretics.

If upon this persuasion you will not be drawn to break your oath, which you
make a conscience of; then will they further tell you, that the Pope has
already given you absolution, and a dispensation for your oath. Pope Cause. 15.
qu. 6. c. Nos Sa^ctoru^. Nos eos, qui excommunicatis fidelitate and sacrame^to
constricti sunt, Apostolica autoritate sacrame^to absolvinus.
Gregory the seventh of that name, says; we by Apostolical authority do
absolve all from their oaths, which they have given to persons excommunicate.
The words are in Gratians decree cause. 15. qu. 6. c. 4. We by Apostolical
authority do absolve all from their oaths, etc.

But who are excommunicate by Romish exposition? I will tell you out of the
great lawyer Panormitan, not they only, against whom the sentence of
excommunication is pronounced. For says Extra de Iudiciis Cap. Cum in homine.
Cum est crimen notorium, nulla est opus declaratione sente^tiae
excommunicationis.
Panormitan, when the Heresy is publicly known, there needs no
pronuntiation of the sentence of excommunication. And who are such heretics,
as against whom there needs no pronuntiation of the sentence of
excommunication? Lib. 1. de justa punit. Haeretic.
Alfonsus de Castro, and Instruct. Sacerd. lib. 1. cap. 19. Qui intelligens
aliquam sente^tiam express ab ECCLESIA damnatam, eam retinuerit, Haereticus

To let the Jesuit, will tell us: that whosoever maintains any doctrine,
condemned in the Church of Rome, he is to be accounted an obstinate Heretic.

Well then; all Protestants, Princes, and subjects, maintaining true Christian
doctrine, such as is condemned in the Church of Rome, are in Popish account,
obstinate Heretics, and therefore ipso facto, already excommunicate: there
needs no pronuntiation of the sentence of excommunication against them.
Whereupon it follows, that in every kingdom, where the King is a professed
Protestant, the subjects are already absolved from their oath of allegiance.

I will not in this auditorie further enlarge this point. A point I grant,
fitter for the convent of the profound, and learned, then for this place.
Wherefore I shut up this point, beseeching you to suffer a word of exhortation.

Pius the fifth, and all succeeding Popes shall absolve you from your oath of
allegiance, yet (dearly beloved) believe them not. Peter, and the Apostles,
Act. 5.29. do put you in mind, that it is better to obey God, then men. And
God in his holy word commands you to be subject to the higher powers, as you
have already heard, Ro^. 13.1. to honor the King, 1. Pet. 2.17. to submit your
selves to all manner ordinance of man for his sake, whether it be unto the King
as unto the superior, or unto other governors, verse. 13. You have taken your
oath of allegiance, and sworn obedience to your King; break not this your
covenant with him, that Gods wrath break not forth in fire against you, as it
did against these Tyrians, for not remembering the covenant of brethren.

Thus far by occasion of the first exposition of these words They remembered
not the covenant of brethren, that is, they remembered not the covenant, made
between their King, K. Hiram, and the King of Israel, King Solomon.

Now somewhat of the other exposition. They remembered not the covenant of
brethren; that is, they remembered not the covenant made by nature between the
Jews, Israelites, and Edomites, brethren lineally descended from two natural
brethren, Jacob and Esau. They knew full well, that the Jews and Israelites
were the issue of Jacob, and the Edomites of Esau; they knew likewise, that the
Edomites bore a mortal hatred toward the Jews, and Israelites; yet sold they
the Jews and Israelites, unto the Edomites; and are therefore here said not to
remember the brotherly covenant.

The man that conspireth mischief, and destruction to his brother, is a
monster in nature, worthy to be pursued with eternal detestation: and
whosoever abhors not from consenting to such a wickedness, but gives
furtherance, or countenance thereto, he is holden in the same impiety. The
Edomites sought the destruction of the Jews and Israelites, and the Tyrians
did further them in their bloody designs; the Tyrians therefore are partakers
with the Edomites in the sin of unmercifulness. Which sin is here laid
unto their charge in these words, They remembered not the brotherly covenant.
Hence we may take this lesson, It is a thing very distastful, and unpleasing
unto God, either for brethren to be at variance among themselves, or for others
to countenance them in their quarrels.

Our assent to this truth, the light of nature within us, does extort from us.
Of the first part of my proposition, wherein I avow it, to be a very
distasteful thing unto God for brethren to be at variance among themselves, I
shall have fit opportunity to entreat, when I shall come to the 11. verse of
this chapter, where Edom is reproved for pursuing his brother with the sword.

Of the other part, wherein I do affirm it, to be an vpleasing thing to God
for any to countenance brethren in their quarrels, I will by Gods assistance,
speak at this time very briefly.

It is a thing very distasteful and unpleasant unto God, for any to countenance
brethren, in their quarrels. The advice is good which S. Paul gives, Ephesians.
5.11. Have ye no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but eve^
reprove them rather. What are the works of darkness, but the works of the
flesh? Now in Galat. 5.19. in the Catalogue of the works of the flesh, we find
hatred, debate, wrath, contention. With these therefore we must have no
fellowship, we must reprove the^ rather.

Must we have no fellowship with the^? Must we reprove the^ rather? What says
old Adam? What says flesh and blood to this? Our Gallants of this age can
entertain no such advise: that it may be fulfilled, which our Savior Christ
foretold of the end of the world, Luke 21.10. and 16. Nation shall rise
against nation, kingdom against kingdom, a father against his son, a
brother against his brother, a kinsman against his kinsman, and a friend
against his friend.

A fitter remedy for this malady I find none, then to imitate blessed
Abraham. There grew a debate between his servants, and the servants of Lot;
their heardmen could not agree. What does Abraham in this case? As the manner
of Masters is now adays? No; he breaks not out into choler; he says not: my
servants are abused; my cousin LOT his servants do seek to crow over them, and
to rule the roast, as they list. This is an injury to me their master, and a
shame to suffer it. So a man may be made a fool indeed, and counted a wretch,
and a dastard of no reputation. Never will any man care to serve me, if I
stick not better to my men, then so. Such language, as the world now goes, is
very rife among us.

But Abraham spoke not so. Grace was in his face, and mildness in his words.
For thus spoke he unto his nephew Lot* Genesis 13.8. I pray thee, let there be no
strife between thee, and me; neither hetweene thy heardmen and my heardmen;
for we are brethren. We are brethren; I pray let there be no strife between us.
Let us be mindful of the covenant, wherein nature has united our affections;
we are brethren: the bond of brotherhood and consanguinitie, let it moderate
our passions: why shall we jar, and be at odds between our selves? Are we
not brethren?

An excellent pattern of imitation, for all estates, high and low; rich, and
poor; one with another. Noblemen, Gentlemen, Yeomen; all, whosoever may say
they are brethren, either in nature, or in Christ, and religion, have in
Abraham a pattern for their imitation. We must abstain, not only from raising
strife, and debate our selves, but also from fostering and cherishing it in
others. Such was Abraham's choice. He would not maintain his servants against
Lots servants: he took it to be far more credit for him to have unity, and
good love, then the bitter effects of the contrary.

Among the beatitudes Matthew. 5. the seventh is; Blessed are the peacemakers.
Blessed are they, who love concord, regard peace, seek it, and ensue after it.
Blessed are they who bestirre themselves to cherish, and maintain peace, and
concord between others. Blessed are they, who do their best to reunite in
love, such as are fallen out, to make an end of quarrels, and dissentions.
Blessed are the peacemakers: the reason is annexed; for they shall be called
the children of God, that is, they will by their love of unity, and concord,
make it appear unto the world, that they are the sons of God.

From whence it follows by an argument from the place of contraries: Accursed
are makebates, for they shall be called the children of the Devil. Cursed are
they, who are of themselves quarrelsome, and contentious. Cursed are they, who
bestirre themselves to cherish, and maintain strife, and debate in others.
Cursed are they who do their best to set at variance, such as have long lived
in peace, and unity. Cursed are makebates; I annexe the reason; for they shall
be called the sons of the Devil, that is, They will by their love of strife
and debate, make it appear to the world, that they are the sons of the
Devil.

Now (dearly beloved in the LORD) I beseech you to remove far from you all
cogitation, and thought of strife, variance, and debate; and to remember your
brotherly covenant. Know ye, that the bond of one body, one spirit, one hope,
one God, one faith, one baptism, is as far above the bond of one father, one
mother, one village, one house, and the like, as the spirit is above the flesh,
spiritual things, above carnal, and God above man.

I will shut up this point, with the exhortation of S. Peter, 1. ep. chap. 3.8.
Be ye all of one mind; one suffer with another; love as brethren; be
pitiful; be courteous; render not evil for evil, nor rebuke for rebuke: but
contrariwise bless ye; bless I say, and know that you are thereunto called,
that ye should be heirs of blessing. Thus far of the third part of this
Prophecy. Now follows the fourth.

Verse. 10. Therefore will I send a fire upon the walls of Tyrus, and and it
shall devour the palaces thereof. This is a particular denunciation of a
conquest, and desolation against the city Tyrus, for her sins. According to
this prediction it came to pass says Drusius, either in the war of
Salmanassar against the Tyrians, or in the war of Nabuchodonosor. Yet this he
affirms not. Nabuchodonosor besieged Tyrus three years and three months,
and then took it: so says Winckleman out of Josephus, lib. 1. contra
Appionem: the Latin copies of Josephus, which I have seen, make mention of
the continuance of this siege for thirteen years.

The Greek copy has nothing of the continuance of it. For therein I read
only; that when Thobalus was king, Nabuchodonosor besieged Tyrus. This was
about the year of the world, 3345. Tyrus after this was reedified, and did
flourish. But she was in her pride again besieged, and taken by Alexander the
great in the year of the world, 3632. And long since, A.C. 1290 she was
sacked, and levelled with the ground, by Alphix then Sultan of Egypt. Thus has
Gods hand been strong and prevailing against Tyrus, according to the tenor of
this prophecy. The very words whereof, you have heard before expounded, in the
fourth, and seventh verses of this chapter.

Now I pray you only recount with me such heads of doctrine as heretofore have
been observed out of these words: Therefore will I send a fire, etc. Wherein
three circumstances are to be observed. 1. The punisher. 2. The punishment. 3.
The punished.

The first circumstance is the punisher, the LORD: For thus says the LORD, I
will send] The doctrine is, It is proper to the Lord to execute vengeance upon
the wicked for their sins.

The second circumstance is the punishment, and that is by fire: I will send a
fire] The doctrine is, The fire, and all other creatures are at the Lords
commandment, to be employed by him in the punishment of the wicked.

The third circumstance is the punished, the walls and palaces of Tyrus: I will
send a fire upon the walls of Tyrus, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.

First, must the glorious city Tyrus be destroyed? The doctrine is: No munition
can save that city, which God will have destroyed.

Secondly, must the Walls of Tyrus be devoured with the fire of Gods
displeasure? The doctrine is, It is the good blessing of God upon a kingdom,
to have walls, strong holds, munitions, fortresses, and bullwarkes for a defense
against enemies.

Thirdly, must the palaces of Tyrus be consumed with the fire of Gods anger?
The doctrine is, God depriveth us of a great blessing when he takes from us
our dwelling houses.

Of these doctrines, and their several uses, I have heretofore in this place
at large entreated. Wherefore let this which has been now spoken, suffice for
my present exposition of this prophecy against Tyrus.

THE SIXTEENTH LECTVRE
AMOS 1.11, 12. Thus says the LORD, For three transgressions of Edom, and for
four, I will not turn to it: because he did pursue his brother with the
sword, and did cast of all pity, and his anger spoiled him evermore, and his
wrath watched him always.

Therefore will I send a fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the palaces of
Bozrah.


IN this burdensome prophecy against Edom I observe two parts.

1 A preface. Thus says the LORD. 2 A prophecy. For three tra^sgressions of
Edom, etc.
In the Prophecy I observe four parts.

1 A general accusation of the Edomites: For three transgressions of Edom, and
for four. 2 The Lords protestation against them. I will not turn to it. 3 The
description of the sin, by which they offended, in four branches. 1 He pursued
his brother with the sword. 2 He cast of all pity. 3 His anger spoiled him
evermore. 4 His wrath watched him always.
4 The declaration of the punishments to be inflicted upon Edom, verse the 12.
Therefore will I send a fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the palaces of
Bozrah.
The preface, Thus says the LORD, challenges your attention. The two first
parts of the Prophecy, the accusation of the Edomites, and Gods protestation
against them, in these words: For three transgressions of Edom and for four, I
will not turn to it, may give you occasion to recount, and remember a
doctrine, already the third time recommended to your religious considerations.

Many sins do pluck down from heaven the most certain wrath and vengeance
of God upon the sinners. Mel satietatem gignit. It is an old saying: A man may
eat too much honey. What? One lesson so often? No variety? I could answer with
a Greek Proverb; (...): that good and wholesome lessons may well be commended
to you twice, and thrice, many times, and yet should you not dislike it.

But for the present I proceed to the third part of this prophecy, wherein
is described Edoms sin. Of this part are four branches.

1 He did pursue his brother with the sword] wherein observe 1 A pursuer: Edom.
2 The pursued: His brother. 3 The manner of pursuit; With the sword. Edom did
pursue his brother with the sword.


Edom] Esau, Jacobs brother, and Isaacs son by his wife Genesis 25.21.
Rebekah, for selling his birthright for a mess of red broth, was surnamed
Edom, Genesis 25.30. and of him lineally descended the Edomites, or Idumaeans,
Genesis 36.43. Esau pursued Jacob with a deadly hate; so did the posterity of
Esau, the posterity of Jacob: the Edomites were evermore most maliciously bent
against the Israelites. Edom is the pursuer, in his own person, and in his
posterity.

The pursued is Edoms brother, Jacob, surnamed Israel, and his posterity, the
Jews and Israelites.

Edom pursued his brother with the sword] Bello, and armata manu, by war, and
bands of soldiers, says Drusius. Esau hated his brother Jacob, because of the
blessing, wherewith his father blessed him, and thereupon in heart vowed his
death. For thus thought Esau in his mind, Genesis 27.41. The days of mourning for
my father will come shortly, then will I slay my brother Jacob. Jacob to
assuage his brother Esau's fiercenes, fled Genesis 27.44.
to his uncle Laban in Mesopotamia, with whom he lived Genesis 31.38.
twenty years: which time expired, Jacob upon God his admonishment returned
into the Genesis 31.3.
land of his fathers. A man would have thought twenty years time sufficient
for any one to have forgotten, or at least to have disgested a displeasure.
Twenty years were not enough for Esau; so immortal was his hatred. After
twenty years, as Jacob returned from Mesopotamia, Esau went against him with
four hundred men, Genesis 33.1.

This inexpiable rancour, and hatred, ended not in Esau. His malicious
posterity retained it. Witness the churlish answer given to Moses his
ambassadors, Number. 20.20. Moses being to conduct the Israelites from Egypt to
the promised land, desirous to bring them the nearest way, sent to the King of
Edom for leave to pass through his country: I pray thee let us pass through
thy country: we will not go through the fields, nor through the vineyards; we
will not drink of the water of thy wells; we will go by the Kings high way:
we will not turn to the right hand, nor to the left, until we be past thy
borders: we will go the high way. If I and my cattle drink of thy water, I
will then pay for it: I will only, without any harm go through on my feet.
Moses the meekest man upon the earth, thus meekely besought the King of Edom
for passage through his country. Could he obtain it, think you? No. The
inveterate hatred, wherewith Esau was possessed, residing in his posterity,
caused a denial to so honest a petition. The King of Edom with much people,
and with a mighty power, rose up against Moses, and the Israelites.

Long after this, in the days of Ahaz, King of Judah, were the Edomites better
minded toward Jacobs posterity? The sacred story 2. Chron. 28.17. tells us,
that then also the Edomites were up in arms against the Jews; some of them
they slew, and some they carried away captives. He therefore, the Psalm. 89.14.
establishment of whose throne, are righteousness, and equity, Almighty God,
does here justly challenge Edom for pursuing his brother with the sword. The
lesson which hence I would commend to you, is, It is a thing very distasteful,
and unpleasing unto God for brethren to be at variance among themselves.

Our assent to this truth the light of nature within us, does extort from us.
By natures light the very Heathen have acknowledged one God, and him the author
of unity, and friendship; as Plato in his Lysis. From the same parents, one
father, and one mother, as from one seed, one root, one beginning, by natures
ordinance do spring Plutarch. de amore fraterno.
two, three, or more brethren, not for discord, or contrariety; but that being
many, they might the better, one help another.

That brother that warreth with his brother, in Plutarch his judgment, does
voluntarily Ibid.
cut of a member of his own flesh. All Xenophon. lib. 2 de dictis and fact.
Socr.
enmity breeds within our souls a thousand tormenting passions; but
especially that enmity which a man bears toward his own brother, as that,
which is most prodigious, and unnatural.

When Socrates saw Chaerephon, and Chaerecrates, two brethren iarring and
warring each with other, he said unto them: you do now, as if the hands,
which were created to help one the other, should hinder, and hurt one the
other: or as the feet, which were framed to bear one another burden, should
supplant one the other: or as the ears, which are coauditors of mutual good,
should wax deaf to hear good one for the other: or as the eyes, which like
Caleb, and Joshua, are fellow spies in this Microcosme, this little world, and
land of men, for the good each of other, should look a squinte at the good
each of other. You will grant it to be very unnatural, either for the hands,
or for the feet, or for the ears, or for the eyes, one to strive against the
other. Much more monstrous will the strife between brethren be; because the
aid, which one of them may and should give unto the other, does far exceed
the cooperation of the hands, the supportance of the feet, the coaudience of
the ears, the providence of the eyes.

Thus far have I led you in Natures school. May it now please you to hear
the same things out of the school of Grace? There Solomon has this lesson:
Two are better then one; for if one of them fall, the other will lift him up;
But woe unto him that is alone; for he falls, and there is not a second to
lift him up. The words are Eccles. 4.9, 10. The Hebrews refer those words to
married couples: but Solomon speaks it generally: and thus you may expound it:
Two are better then one, two brethren are better then one: for if one of them
fall, the other will help him up. If he fall into sickness, into want, into
any kind of distress, eriget, and allevabit eum frater, his brother will be a
succor to him. But woe to him that is alone. (...), is an old saying, one man,
is no man; woe to such a man; woe to him that is alone; for he falls, and
there is not a brother to lift him up.

Indeed one brother helping another is like a defenced city (as Septuagint.
Vulgat. Hieron. Gloss. Lyran. Hugo Card.
some read it) and their counsails are like the bar of a palace, which is
vnpregnable, Prove. 18.19. and if one overcome him, two shall stand against him,
Eccles. 4.12. So natural is their unity, and strong their coadiuvance, which
nature has framed double for mutual assistance.

The place cited out of the Prover. 18.19. Mercer. Lavater. Bibl. Angl.
some read otherwise; A brother offended is harder to win, then a strong
city, and their contentions are like the bars of a palace. And then the
meaning is: The angers of brethren, one of them toward another, are so sharp,
and vehement, that they can no more easily be subdued, the strong defenced
towns conquered; nor more easily be broken, then most strong bars. Which
exposition teaches us, that there is no strife matcheable to the strife among
brethren. According to the proverb: Fratrum contentiones acerbissimae; most
bitter are the contentions of brethren.

Examples poetical, historical, and Divine, do speak as much. The implacable
hatred of Atreus against Thyestes, Eteocles against Polynices, Romulus against
Remus, Bassianus against Geta, Cain against Abel, and Esau against Jacob, are
they not as trumpets, to sound out this truth? To this purpose might I allege
the King of Argiers, the kingdom of Tunes, and Ottomans family, many a
brothers hand embrued, and washed in his brothers blood; but seeing it is
grown into a proverb, Irae fratrum acerbissima; most bitter are the
contentions of brethren, it needs no further proof.

Against such monstrous, and prodigious contentions, the Holy Ghost would have
all Christians well armed; and for this end gives us in holy writ many
wholesome lessons. Let a few serve this time. In the first Ep. of S. Ioh. chap.
2.11. we are taught that whosoever hates his brother, he is in darkness, he
walks in darkness, he knows not whether he goes; darkness has blinded his
eyes: and chap. 3.15. that whosoever hates his brother, is a man slayer: and
chap. 4.20. that whosoever hates his brother is a liar, if he says he loves
God. The reason is annexed; For how can he, that loves not his brother, whom
he has seen; love God, whom he has not seen? And this commandment we have
of CHRIST, that he that loves God, should love his brother also.

In the book of Proverbs, chap. ^6.19. we read of six things, which the LORD
hates, and of a seventh, which his soul abhors: that seventh is, verse
the 19. The man that raises up contentions among brethren. Now if God do
abhor with his soul, the man that raises up contentions among brethren, how
does he like of the contentions themselves? My propounded doctrine stands good,
It is a thing very distastefull, and unpleasing unto God, for brethren to be at
variance among themselves.

Now let us see, what uses do offer themselves to our considerations out of
this doctrine.

First it may serve for a just reproof of these our last, and worst days,
wherein by experience we find true that same Dr. King B. of London upon Ion.
lect. 15.
paradoxe, in common reason hardly to be proved, namely: that not friends only,
or kinsmen, but brethren also, when they fall to enmity, their hatred is
greater, then that betwixt mortal foes. It is come to pass according to
Christ his prophecy, Matthew. 10.36 A man's enemies shall be they of his own
house: A man's enemies indeed, and his enemies to purpose, to work him most
harm, shall be they of his own house.

May not many now a days complain, yea cry out, with David, Psalm. 55.12. If
mine enemy had done me this dishonor, I could have borne it: if mine
adversary had exalted himself against me, I would have hid my self from him;
but it was thou, O man, my companion, my guide, my familiar: we took sweet
counsel together; we walked in the house of God, as friends. Yet have thou
done me this dishonor; yea, thou have exalted thy self against me.

Of all the vials of the wrath of God powered down upon sinners, it is one of
the sorest, when a man is fed with his own flesh, and made drunk with his
own blood, as with sweet wine. So the Prophet Esaias speaks, chap. 49.26. The
meaning is, as a chief B King. Ibid.
pillar of our Church expounds it; when a man takes pleasure in nothing
more, then in the overthrow, and extirpation of his own seed: when he
thirsts not for any blood, but that which is drawn from the sides of his
brethren, and kinsmen. Never was there more eager and bitter contention
between Turk and Christian, then now a days there is between Christian and
Christian, a brother and a brother.

All we, who have given our names to Jesus Christ, and vowed him service in our
baptism, we are all brethren, we are fratres vterini, brethren from the womb,
(...), we have one father, and one mother; one father in heaven, and one
mother; the holy Catholic Church, militant upon the earth. But it fares with
us, as it did with Simeon, and Levi, Genesis 49.5. We are brethren in evil; the
instruments of cruelty are in our habitations. They in their wrath slew a man:
and what do we? If our wrath be kindled against our brother, we will not
stick, Edom-like, to pursue him with the sword; we will make our sword to be
fed with his flesh, and drunk with his blood.

Think not (dearly beloved, you of the other sex,) think not your selves
exempt from this reproof, because in it I have not made any mention of
sisters; for under the name of brethren I meant you also. My speech was unto
Christians; and in Christianisme diversity of sex makes no difference. So
says the Apostle, Gal. 3.28. Male, and female, all are one in Christ. To you
therefore this reproof of brethren at variance, does also appertain. If you
lay violent hands upon any, your husbands, your children, or other; or if with
your tongue, (which the holy Spirit, Ps. 57.4. calls a sharp sword,) you are
given to vex them of your own house; or shall backbite, or sclander any; know,
that, Edom-like, you do pursue your brother with the sword. And take, I beseech
you, my propounded doctrine, as belonging unto you also, It is a thing very
distastefull and unpleasing unto God, for brethren to be at variance among
themselves.

A second use is, to work in us brotherly kindness: that virtue, whereby
every good Christian embraces the Church of God, and the members thereof, with
the bowels of love. This brotherly kindness, S. Peter, 2. Ep. 1.7. commends
unto us, as whereto we ought to give all diligence.

David, Psalm. 133.1. styles it with the sweet name of Unity; Behold how good,
and comely a thing it is, for brethren to live in unity. And therefore
commends it by two similitudes: in the one showing the sweetness and
pleasantnes of it; in the other, the fruit, and profit which comes by it.

First, it is like that precious ointment, which was powered on the head of the
high Priest, and ran down upon his beard, and so to the borders of his
garments. Behold the sweetness and pleasantnes of unity. That sweet perfume, and
ointment, that holy oil powered out upon the high Priest, and his garment, was
not only pleasant and delightful to himself, but did also yield a sweet
smelling savor to all that were about him. So is it with unity. Is not only
pleasant to them, who do religiously esteem and keep it, but to others also,
which are about them.

Secondly, it is like the dew of Hermo^, which fell upon the mountains of
Sion; where the LORD appointed the blessing, and life for evermore. Behold the
fruit, and profit, which comes by Unity. The dew, and wet, that fell down
from heaven upon Hermon, and Sion, made those hills, and the plain countries
near them, fertile: so does Unity bring with it great fruit, and profit. It
makes them, among whom it is sincerely observed, it makes them, through Gods
blessing fruitful, and plentiful in good works toward God, and in him, and
for him, toward men, and one of them toward another. This unity, concord,
brotherly love, mutual consent and agreement, if it be unfeigned, has the
promises both of this life, and of that to come: of peace, and quietness in this
life, and of eternal ioies in the life to come.

One of the notes by which we may be assured of God his special love, and
favor, is the love of our brethren. Now that we deceive not our selves in this
love, S. Job. Epist. 1. gives us three rules to direct us.

1 Christian brotherly love must not be for any worldly respects or
considerations, but principally for, and in God. We must love our brethren
principally, because they are the sons of God, and members of Christ. This rule
he intimates, chap. 5.1. Every one, that loves him which begat, loves him
also which is begotten of him: that is, whosoever loves God the Father, he
loves also the sons of God; his natural son Christ Jesus, and his sons by
grace and adoption, all Christians,

2 Christian brotherly love must not be outward in show only, but inward in the
heart. This rule he gives us, chap. 3.18. Let us not love in word, nor in
tongue only, but indeed, and in truth.

3 Christian brotherly love must be not only in time of prosperity, but when
most need is. This rule he gives, verse. the 17* Whosoever has this worlds
good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his compassion from him,
how dwells the love of God in him?

Let these rules (beloved) be your direction. Love ye every one that is
called a Christian, not because he is rich, or in authority, but because he is
a Christian, the son of God by grace, and adoption. Love ye him, not outwardly
in show only, but inwardly, in heart, in deed, in truth. Love him not only in
his prosperous and flourishing estate, but in his greatest need; and be ye
assured that the special love and favor of God, will be your shield, and
protection.

Three things there are, that do rejoice God, says Ecclesiasticus, chap. 25.1.
The unity of brethren, the love of neighbors, a man and his wife agreeing
together. The first, which is the unity of brethren, according to my former
construction, compriseth the other two. All Christians are brethren in Christ,
a neighbor to a neighbor, a husband to his wife, a wife to her husband. For,
as I said, in Christ there is no difference of sex; there is neither male, nor
female; all are brethren in Christ; and therefore that neighbor, that loves
not his neighbor; the husband, that is at ods with his wife; the wife, that
agrees not with her husband; they are guilty of the breach of brotherly love.

That exhortation made by S. Paul to the Romans, cha. 12.10. concerns all
of you, all, of both sexes, without any difference: Be ye affectioned to love
one another with brotherly love. I conclude this point with the same Apostles
words, 1. Cor. 1.10 and 2. Cor. 13.11. Now I beseech you brethren, by the name
of our LORD Jesus Christ, that ye speak all one thing, and that there be no
dissentions among you: Be of one mind; live in peace, and the God of peace
shall be with you.

Thus far of the first branch in the description of Edoms sin, and of the
doctrine grounded thereupon: The doctrine was: It is a thing very distastefull,
and unpleasing unto God, for brethren to be at variance among themselves.

It was grounded upon these words, He did pursue his brother with the sword. It
follows.

And did cast of all pity] or after the Hebrew text, did corrupt his
compassions, which reading is expressed in the margin of our Church Bible, and
the Geneva translation. The English translation set out by Tyndall reads it
otherwise: He destroyed his mothers womb, and Winckleman reads it: and
violaverit vterum, and violated, or abused the mothers womb: both do allude to
the Greek edition of the Septuagint (...), he did violate the mothers womb;
which reading may have reference to the nativity of Jacob, and Esau, borne at
one birth of their mother Rebekah. And then the meaning is, that the Edomites,
Esau's posterity, neglecting that bond, and knot of brotherhood, and
consanguinity, did exercise rigor, and cruelty against the Israelites, Jacobs
posterity: or it may have reference to a savage and outrageous cruelty, as if
the Edomites were here noted for ripping up mothers wombs, or women with
child, in Israel. That such cruelty was used by the Ammonites, it is plain by
the 13. verse of this chapter. But this text in the original, does not faste^
this blame upon the Edomites, and I love not to force my text. I will not
trouble you with other expositions.

The original (...) ^^rrupt his compassions] The sense and meaning is w^ll
^^nd^ed and delivered in our received English Bibles; He did cast of all pity.
Is Edom here condemned for corrupting his compassions? for casting of all
pity? The lesson hence to be commended to your Christian considerations, is
this, Unmercifulness is a sin hateful unto God.

I could bring you many places out of holy writ for the confirmation of this
doctrine. But two only, or three, and they but touched, shall serve for this
present. In Job 6.14. the unmerciful are noted to have forsaken the fear of
the Almighty. In Romans 1.31. among such, as God has given up to a reprobate
mind, to commit things worthy of death, the unmerciful are named. In James,
2.13. a punishment is denounced to the unmerciful; There shall be judgment
merciless, to him, that shows no mercy. These few texts of Scripture do
plentifully establish my doctrine.

Unmercifulness is a sin hateful unto God. If any will ask me, what is
this unmercifulness, whereof I now speak; my answer shall be out of the
learned. Out of Apud Aquin 22. qu. 118.8.3.
Isidore, that it is one of the nine daughters of covetousness. Out of 22. qu.
159 1. 2. 2.
Aquinas, that it is the withholding of a deed of charity, and an 22. qu.
118.8.3.
obduration, or the hardening of the heart against mercy: Out of Comment. in
hunc locu^.
Mercer, that it is a breach of natures law, and an abolishing of all
kindness. And so I come to make some use of this doctrine.

The use is to stir us up to the exercises of humanity, and mercy. I will not
now make any long declamation against inhumanitie, and unmercifulness; yet my
text requires that I speak somewhat to it. There was a time, when
righteousness seemed to be taken up into the clouds, and the earth to be void
of it. It was in the days of the Prophet Esaias. He then cried out, chap. 45.8.
O ye heavens send the dew from above, and let the clouds drop down
righteousness. The time is now, when love seems to be taken up into the
clouds, and the earth to be void of it. Now may we cry out. O ye heavens
send the dew from above, and let the clouds drop down Iou^; that the (...)
ob^rlis^^ Nabals of this present generation, may now at length know, that they
are not borne for themselves only, but for their poor neighbors also. Your
poor neighbors, who stand in need of you, by very prerogative of mankind,
have an interest in your succor, and service.

But it may be that some are so far from all humanity, that this prerogative
of mankind will not move them, to do any work of charity. Such hard hearts
let them hear what the law is, Deuteronomy. 15.7. If one of thy brethren with thee be
poor, within any of thy gates in thy land, which the LORD thy God gi^eth thee,
thou shall not harden thine hearts, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother:
But thou shall open thy hand unto him, and shall lend him sufficient for his
need.

I know, flesh and blood will object: Shall I lend my neighbor sufficient for
his need? I soon exhaust my substance, and live in w^n^ my self. I reply. O
thou of little faith, why fear thou? Look back upon the blessing of God;
rely upon it: he through his benediction will make thee large reco^pense.

Of this thou may be assured, if thou will have recourse to the fore cited
chapter, Deuteronomy 15.10. There art thou infallibly promised for thy alms deeds
done to the needy, that the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works,
and in all that thou put thine hand to.

My exhortation is no other then that of the Prophet Esai, chap. 58.7. Deal
thy bread to the (...) bring the poor wanderer to thine house: If thou see
him naked, cover him, he is thine own flesh; hide not thy self from him. Thy
liberality will bring thee great advantage: whereof thou will not doubt, if
thou consider the ^ext verse, Thy light shall break forth as the morning; thy
health shall grow speedily thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory
of the LORD shall embrace thee. See thou not an heap of blessings one upon
another?

Look into the book of Psalms. In the beginning of the 41. Psalm. many a
sweet promise is made thee co^ditionally, that thou (...) LO^D shall deliver
thee in the (...) preserve thee alive; he shall bli^^ (...) upon (...) earth;
he will not deliver thee to the will of thine (...) will strengthen thee upon
thy bad of sorrow, and will (...) of thy sick^^^se.

I might weary you, and my self, in the pursuit of this point. Here I stop my
course, with recommendatio^ of one only place. and that a very rem^^keable one,
Prove. 19.17. He that has mercy upon the poor, ^^deth to the LORD; and the
LORD will recompense (...), that which he has given.

Behold and ^ee, how gracious and good the LORD is. If you show pity, and
compassion upon the poor, God will reco^pense you to the full* yea in the
largenes of his mercies, he will reward you plentifully.

It w^^ gr^^e ^xhortation of a Tobitto his son Tobias cap. 4.7.

Use it, I beseech you in the bowels of our LORD, and Savior Jesus Christ. Be
ye not like Edom in my text, Corrupt not your compassions, cast not of al
pity; suffer ye one with another; love as brethren; be pitiful, be
cour^^ous: do ye good to all men, and faint not: great shall be your reward
in heaven.

This your service will be acceptable unto God. God for it will give you his
blessing. God will bless you for the time of your being here; and when the day
of your dissolution shall be that you must leave your earthly tabernacles, then
will the Son of man, sitting upon the throne of his glory, welcome you with a
VENITE BENEDICTI, Come ye blessed of my Father; inherit the kingdom prepared

THE SEAVENTEENTH LECTVRE
AMOS 1.11, 12. And his anger spoiled him evermore, and his wrath watched him
always.

Therefore will I send a fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the palaces of
Bozrah.


IN my last l^cture I began the exposition of the third part of this prophecy,
which is a declaration of Edoms sins in four branches. The two first I
passed over the last time. The first branch was; He did pursue his brother with
the sword. Thereon I grounded this doctrine, It is a thing very distasteful and
unpleasing unto God, for brethren to be at variance among themselves.

One use of this doctrine was, a just reproof of the want of brotherly love in
these our days.

A second use was an exhortation to brotherly kindness.

The second branch was; He did cast of all pity. Thereon I grounded this
doctrine, Unmercifulness is a sin hateful unto God.

The use I made of it, was to stir us up to the exercises of humanity, and
mercy. Which meditation ended, I ended that Lecture. Now come I to the third
branch in the declaration of Edoms sins.

His anger spoiled him evermore] or, In his anger he spoiled him continually.
The preposition is not expressed in the original, but is well understood, and
supplied by some expositors, to this sense: Edom, furious, and angry Edom, does
evermore vi aperta, with open violence, attempt the spoil of Israel: and if
open violence prevail not, intus simultatem alit; within him he fostereth and
cherishes privy and secret malice, such as of old was harbored, and settled
in old Genesis 27 41.
Esau's heart. Edom in his anger spoiled him continually.

Spoiled him:] The word in the original is from the root (...) which says
Mercer, forarum proprium est, is proper and peculiar to wild beasts and it
signifies Rapere, discerpere, to spoil ravenously; to rent, or tear in
pieces. Thus is Edom compared to some truculent, or savage beast; some
devouring Lion, some ravenous Wolf, some fierce Bear, or the like, that
hunteth greedily after their prey. The comparison is: As a Lion, a Wolf, a
Bear, or some other cruel beast, hunteth greedily after his prey, and when he
has gotten it, teareth it in pieces, and so devoureth it: so does Edom; he
hunteh for his brother, as with a snare, or net; and having once enclosed him,
he throws him headlong into utter desolation: and this he does in the
bitterness of his anger; In his anger he spoiled him evermore.

This clause is otherwise rendered by the old Latin Interpreter, and tenuerit
vltra furorem suum; He possessed his fury beyond measure, longer then was
meet he should. An exposition followed by many of the learned, and of late
writers, by Brentius, and Mercer. In Matthews Bible it is well expressed; He
bore hatred very long: the meaning is; He constantly, egerly, obstinately
persisted in his anger, and held it fast; as a savage beast holds fast his
prey.

Both readings, this, and the former; this: He bore hatred very long, and the
former: In his anger he spoiled his brother evermore, both do appeach, and
accuse Edom of rash, unadvised, evil, and sinful anger. The doctrine which
hence I would commend to your Christian considerations is this, Every child of
God, ought to keep himself unspotted of anger; of rash, unadvised, evil, and
sinful anger.

I say, of (...), evi^^, and sinful anger. For there is a good kind of ang^r;
^^^ger praise worthy; an anger, to be embraced of every one of you. Whereto the
Prophet David exhorted the fait^full of his time, Psalm. 4.4. Be angry, and sin
not. And S. Paul^ his Ephesians, chap 4.26. Be angry, but sin not. You may be
angry, and not sin. Christian religion does not make me^ to be (...). It makes
them not void of passion, and senseless. You may be angry. But your anger must
lie down by, and wait upon reason, and virtue, as a shepherds dog lies by,
and waits upon his master the comparison is Great Sermon. de Ira
Basils. As the dog does, so must your anger do: your anger, commanded by
virtue, and reason, must accuse, bark at, and bite vice, and all vicious
wolves in man's shape. Well said the heathen Philosopher in his fourth
Academicke, that Anger is the whetstone of fortitude, if it be tempred, and
ruled by reason.

To this purpose speaks mellifluous Bernard Ad Guido nem Abbate^ de tribus
fontibus.
Ep. 69. Not to be angry, when there is just cause of anger, is to be unwilling
to mend, or correct sin. This good anger where of I now speak, you may call
Indignation, or zeal, which is nothing else, but a just commotion of anger,
for the breach of some of Gods comma^dements: as when God his holy Name is
reproached, or our harmless neighbors are unjustly wronged: when some
grievous injury is done either against God, or against our innocent neighbors.

To justify you, in this anger, there are many examples in holy Writ: I will
make bold to commend a few unto you. Moses, a very meek man Number. 12.3.
above all that were upon the earth, was possessed with this indignation, and
zeal. The Exodus 32 9.
stiffenecked Israelites upon Moses his long absence from them, (for he was
absent Exodus 24.18.
forty days and forty nights) they made themselves a molten calfe for their
God. This Idol they worshipped; they offered sacrifice unto it. Hereat Moses
his wrath waxed hot. In this his wrath the two table of the testimony, which
were Exodus 32.16
Gods work, and Gods own writing, were broken in pieces, and he caused to be
slain of the people in one day about three thousand men, Exodus 32.28. Elias
was possessed with this indignation, and zeal, when he slew of Baals Prophets
to the number 1. Kings 18.19.
of four hundred, and fifty, 1. King* 18.40. Elizeus was possessed with this
indignation, and zeal, when he cursed the two and forty children, torn in
pieces by Bears, 2. King. 2.24. Paul was possessed with this indignation, and
zeal, when he struck Elimas the sorcerer with blindness, Act. 13.11. In a
word, Christ himself was possessed with this indignation, and zeal, when with
a scourge of small cords he drove out of the Temple buyers, and sellers, with
their sheep, and oxen, and the mony-changers, Ioh. 2.13. You have seen Moses,
Elias, Elizeus, Paul, and Christ himself angry: their anger was a good
anger. I thus describe it,

A good anger, is a Godly, and reasonable desire of just revenge, stirred up in
us by a true zeal of justice, whereby being displeased as well with our own
sins, as with other men's, we covet after a lawful revenge, that the persons
may be saved, that Gods wrath may be appeased, that the kingdom of Christ, and
his glory, may be promoted. My description I thus explicate.

A good anger, is a Godly and reasonable desire of just revenge, stirred up in
us by a true zeal of justice:] I say, a true zeal; because there is also a
false zeal; when some men do pretend Gods glory, and indeed intend nothing
less. This true zeal directs our anger against men's vices, not their
persons: we must love the man, but be angry at his sin: not at his sin only,
but at our own also: we must detest our own sins, as well as other men's: and
lawfully vindicate as well other men's sins, as our own: and all this, that our
selves and others may be saved; that Gods wrath may be pacified; that the
kingdom of Christ, and his glory, may be advanced.

I will not now examine, whether this good anger has at any time affected your
hearts, to the beating down of sin. Whether you have with connivencie,
patience, and silence endured God his commandments to be violated, his holy
name by vain and fearful oaths to be blasphemed, the Sabbath to be
profaned, parents to be dishonored, murders, adulteries, or theftes to be
committed, your neighbors to be wronged, and other like sins to be acted:
whether you have with connivency, patience, and silence (...) such foul
demeanours, which you should in (...) have reproved, and ^^^ed; I leave to the
p^^^ ^o examination of your own hearts. Only let me tell you, there is a judge
in heaven that will one day call you to (...) for these things. My text now
admonishes me, to speak somewhat of ^collanger: whereof Edom is here accused
by the suffrage of Almighty God: In his anger he spoiled his brother evermore.
My doctrine was, Every child of God ought to keep himself unspotted of anger.

My proposition is to be understood of rash, unadvised, evil, and sinful
anger. Which the Austen of our time, learned Comment. in Ephesians. 4.
Zanchius thus describes;

Evil anger is ^^t unjust, and unreasonable desire of revenge, stirred up in
us by a sense of some injury done us, or through the vice of impatience in us,
whereby being displeased at men, rather then at their vices, we wish vengeance
to betide them, respecting our own wilful lusts only, and not at all, either
the safety of our neighbors, or any public good, or the glory of God.

The species, or kinds of this anger, according to Orthodox. fid. lib. 2. c.
16.
Damascene, are three. The first he calls (...), or (...); you may call it,
choler, it is a hasty anger, and of short continuance. The second he calls
(...); you may call it angrynes; it is a more permanent anger, of more
continuance. The third he calls (...); you may call it wrath; it is a settled
anger, watching opportunity to work revenge.

These three kinds of anger S. Paul condemns for evil, under the names of
(...), and (...). Anger, bitterness, and wrath, Ephesians. 4.31. Let all
bitterness, anger, and wrath, he put away from you. Our Savior Christ, Math.
5.22. admonishes his disciples, if not of three kinds, yet of three degrees of
anger. 1. Whosoever is angry with his brother without cause, unadvisedly, he
shall be culpable of judgment. 2. Whosoever says unto his brother, Raca, he
shall be worthy to be punished by the Council. 3. Whosoever shall say fool,
he shall be worthy to be punished with Hell fire.

The first condemns the anger in the heart, when a man is inwardly moved, and
concealeth it. The second condemns the anger in the countenance, when a man
by his face, and gesture, is discovered to be angry. The third co^de^neth the
anger in speech, when a man by foul, and bitter speaking, manifests himself
to be angry. You see diverse kinds of anger.

GREGORY the great, Moral. lib. 5. cap. 30. applies them to men's persons. He
reckons up four sorts of men, subject to these evil angers. 1. Some are
soon angry, and soon pacified. 2. Some are slowly angry, and slowly pacified,
3. Some are soon angry, and slowly pacified. 4. Some are slowly angry, and
soon pacified. Al those do sin in their angers, but not al equally. Some more,
some less grievously, yet all do sin. And therefore that the glory of God may
be propagated, and the good of our neighbors furthered, I beseech you, receive
into your devout hearts my propounded doctrine, Every child of God ought to
keep himself unspotted of anger.

If you demand a reason hereof, I must repeat unto you God his holy
commandment: Thou shall do no murder In the name of murder, are inhibited
all the kinds of anger above specified; the anger that lurketh in the heart,
the anger that shines in the countenance, the anger that is manifested in
words; whereto I add that anger that breaks into action. If you wound, or
but strike your neighbor; if you speak bitterly against him; if you look
frowningly at him; if you hate him in heart, or be unadvisedly angry with him,
you are before Almighty God guilty of murder. And for this cause, every child
of God ought to keep him self unspotted of anger.

An other reason of this doctrine may be drawn from the foul effects of
anger. The Peter de La Primadaye.
author of the French Academy par. 2. chap. 55. thus discourses of them. Anger
is a vice, that has wonderful effects in the body, and such as are very
unbeseeming a man. For, first of all, when the heart is offended, the blood
boileth round about it, and the heart is swollen, and puffed up, whereupon,
follows a continual panting, and trembling of the heart, and breast. And
when these burning flames, and kindled spirits, are ascended up from the heart
unto the brain, then is anger come to his perfection: from hence comes,
change of countenance, shaking of the lips, and of the whole visage, stopping
of speech, and terrible looks, more meet for a beast, then for a man.

Lactantius has the like discourse in his book de Ira Dei, c. 5. Ira, cum in
animum cuiusquam incidit, velut saeva te^pestas tantos excitat fluctus, vt
statum mentis immutet, ardescant oculi, os tremat, lingua titubet, dentes
concrepent, alternis vultum maculet, nunc suffusus rubor, nunc pallor albescens.
When anger (says he) is fallen into the mind of man, like a sore tempest, it
raises such waves, that it cha^geth the very state of the mind; the eyes wax
fiery, the mouth trembles, the tongue faltereth, the teeth gnash, and the
whole countenance is by course stained, sometimes with redness, sometimes with
palenes.

Basil in two sermons of his, one preached before the Lacizians, the other De
Ira homil. 38.
else where, is plentiful in this point. The man that is indeed, and
thoroughly angry, differs nothing either in the manner of his look, or in the
affection of his mind, from him, that is possessed with Devils. His blood
boileth about his heart; the whole proportion of his visage is altered; you will
not take it to be the same face: his eyes look not as they were wont, but are
fiery and staring; he whets and grindes his teeth, like the foaming boar; his
countenance is wan, of color black, and blew, stained, and dyed as with
blood: his body swells; his veins wax big; his voice is unpleasant; his speech
inarticulate: you will have much a do to understand him.

A servant of Mich. de Montaigne Ess lib. 2. c. 31 ex A. Gellio.
Plutarches, a lewd, and vicious fellow, for some faults by him committed,
was stripped naked to be whipped. Being under the whip, he vpbraided his
master, and objected to him, how he had often heard him say, that it was an
unseemly thing for a man to be angry; and that thereof he had written a book;
and that yet now contrary to his own sayings, and writings, all plunged in
rage, and engulfed in choler, he caused him so cruelly to be beaten. To whom
Plutarch with an unaltered, and mild settled countenance, said thus: What?
Whereby do thou judge I am now angry? Does my countenance, does my voice,
does my color, or does my speech give thee any testimony, that I am either
moved, or choleric? Me thinks, mine eyes are not staringly wild, nor my
face troubled, nor my voice frightfull, or distempered. Do I wax red? Do I
foame at the mouth? Does any word escape me, whereof I may repent hereafter?
Do I startle, and quake? Do I rage, and ruffle with anger? For, to tell thee
true, these are the right signs of choler; these are the tokens of anger.

You may say (beloved) that they are the effects of anger. The forecited father
Basil, may be your warrant, who further tells you, that unbridled tongues,
unguarded mouths, unstaid hands, contumelies, foul language, railing words,
unjust blows, and the like enormities, are the sons, are the fruits, are the
effects of evil anger. And in this respect also, every child of God ought to
keep himself unspotted of anger.

Now to make some use of this doctrine. Shall I say, that this evil anger is a
reigning evil among you? Your consciences must needs bear me witness, it is
so. Now may I charge some of you, as Ezechiel charged the house of Israel,
chap. 11.6. Many have you murdered in this place, and you have filled the
streets with the slain. For as often as you have been angry unadvisedly one
with another, so often have ye murdered one another. O! what an account are
ye one day to make before Christ's tribunal, even for this one sin; unless
in this your day you wash it away, with tears of penitencye. Tremble
therefore, stand in awe, and sin no more so. Examine your own hearts, not
now only while you hear me, but also when you are gone from hence, even upon
your beds of rest.

Solomon exhorts you, Eccl. 7.11. Be thou not of an hasty spirit to be angry.
His reason is: For anger rests in the bosom of fools. St Paul exhorts you,
Romans 12.9. Dearly beloved; avenge not your selves, but give place unto wrath.
His reason is: For it is written, vengeance is mine, I will repay says the
LORD. St James exhorts you, chap. 1.19. My dear brethren be slow to wrath.
His reason is: For the wrath of man, does not accomplish the righteousness of
God.

You know the Law; and its fulfilled in one word, this: Thou shall love thy
neighbor, as thy self. This is taught you, Gal. 5.14. Suffer your selves to
be exhorted in the words following, verse. 15. If ye bite and devour one
another, take heed least ye be consumed one of another. In the 20. verse we
read of hatred, debate, emulations, wrath, contentions, seditions; and are
assured by the 21. verse, that if we do such things, we shall not inherit
the kingdom of God.

Wherefore (to shut up this point with St Paul's words, 1. Cor. 1.10. and 2.
Cor. 13.11.) I beseech you, by the name of the LORD Jesus Christ, that ye
speak al one thing, and that there be no dissentions among you. Be of one
mind; live in peace, and the God of peace shall be with you.

Thus far of the third branch in the description of Edoms sin, and of the
doctrine grounded thereupon. The doctrine was, Every child of God ought to
keep himself unspotted of anger. It was grounded upon these words, His anger
spoiled him evermore.

And his wrath watched him alway] This is the Geneva translation. His fury
watches him evermore, so Tremellius. The meaning is, Edoms wrath, or fury,
was so implacable, so far from being abated, or assuaged, as that, it
evermore watched Israel, to do him a mischief. In the Church Bible you have a
different reading; His indignation he kept always; and in Matthewes Bible, he
kept indignation always by him. The reading is agreeable with the vulgar
Latin; and is admitted by Oecolampadius, by Calvin, by Drusius. By Brentius
also; but that for indignation, he has fury. He kept his fury always. The
meaning is: the indignation, or fury, which Edom had conceived against his
brother, was permanent, it would not be remitted, there was no end of it. The
word in the Hebrew rendered by wrath, or indignation, or fury, signifies iram
vehementiorem, and exaestua^tem, omnemque modum praetereuntem, a very vehement,
a boiling anger, exceeding all measure, or according unto others, it signifies
furorem inflammantem, and pervadentem ignis more: a rage like fire, burning
whatsoever it meets with.

We now see, what it is, for which the LORD, in this last branch, reproves
Edom, or the Idumaeans. It is their implacable, unmeasurable, and endless
anger; wherein they practiced nothing but wiles, how they might entrap, and
subvert the Israelites. The lesson, which from hence we are to take for our
further instruction, is this, Whosoever, once provoked unto anger, does for
ever hold it fast, and cherish it, he is not at any hand approved by God.

I will not spend many words in the proof of this proposition, since it
stands good by my former discourse. You have alrea-heard, that every child of
God ought to keep himself unspotted of anger; and that, either in respect of
its foul effects, or in respect of Gods holy commandment against it. Now is
there any of you so devoid of Christian understanding, as to think, or
imagine, that God will at any hand approve that, against which he gives his
commandment? I assure my self, there is none. Well then, I thus infer;
whosoever is spotted with evil anger, he is not at any hand approved by God:
therefore, whosoever once provoked unto evil anger, does for ever hold it fast,
and cherish it, he is not at any hand approved by God.

For further corroboration of this doctrine give ear, I beseech you, to the
blessed Apostles words, Ephesians. 4.26. Let not the sun go down upon your
wrath. Some do thus paraphrase these words Guerricus sermon. in dic Purificat.
Augustine. enarrat. in Psalm. 25.
Christus qui est sol iustitiae, mentem vestram irascentem non deserat, qui cum
ira nunqua^ habitat. Christ the sun of righteousness, who loves not to make
his habitatio^ there, where anger has its residence, let him not forsake your
angry minds. Christ may not dwell where anger is. If therefore you are desirous
that Christ should dwell in you, you must cast away all anger from within you.

Let not the sun go down upon your wrath] There is another exposition
usually given of these words, to this sense: Since such is our estate in this
our warfare; such our weakness, infirmity, and frailty, that anger may
quickly take hold of us, and possess us; we must carefully take heed, that
we give it not too much respite, or entertainment. Our anger must not be ira
pridiana, a yesterdaies anger. We must cast it from us speedily, antequam
occidat lux ista visibilis, before this visible sun, the sun that makes our
day, be set; ne nos deserat lux illa invisibilis, that the invisible sun,
the sun of righteousness, and true light of our hearts, forsake us not. It
is the holy Spirit, that speaks out of the Apostles mouth. Let not the sun
go d^^ne upon your wrath.

There is nothing more adverse, or opposite to our bounden duty of charity,
and our own salvation, then perseverance in wrath. It lets us from doing
good to those with whom we are angry: it hinders our devotion in prayer, and
makes the wrath of God to light upon us. So true is my propounded doctrine,
Whosoever once provoked unto anger, does for ever hold it fast, and cherish it,
he is not at any hand approved by God.

This doctrine thus delivered against perseverance in anger, may serve for a
just reproof of such as do bear perpetual ill will to any nation. To hate a
Spaniard, a French man, or any other countryman, because he is of such a
country, or of such a nation; this is here reproueable.

Again it may serve to restrain such, as do think it lawful, perpetually to
hate them, of whom they have received an injury. Such me^, would they but
recount with themselves, and recall into their minds, how many, and how grievous
injuries they have done unto God, in transgressing his holy commandments; and
how, yet notwithstanding, God is still propitious, gracious, and bountiful
unto them: surely, were they true Christians, sealed by God his holy Spirit to
the day of redemption, they would remit of their hatred; yea they would wholly
abandon it, and cast it far from them: according to the exhortation of S.
Paul to the Ephesians, chap. 4.31. in whose words (beloved) suffer your selves
to be exhorted: Let all bitterness, and anger, and wrath, crying, and evil
speaking be put away from you, with all maliciousness. Be ye courteous one
to another, and tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's
sake forgave you.

Sweet Bernard in his book of the manner of living well ( Sermon. 36.
concerning hatred) thus sweetly speaks unto his sister: Soror in Christo
amantissima mihi, etc. My most loving sister in Christ, hear what I speak
unto thee. If in any thing thou have grieved thy sister, or caused her to be
sorrowful, satisfy her: if thou have sinned against thy sister, repent before
her: if thou have scandalized, or offended any one of Gods handmaides, ask her
forgiveness. Go on with speed to reconcilement: sleep not, till thou have made
satisfaction; rest not till thou return in peace. Thus did devout Bernard
exhort his virgin-sister.

The good father (no doubt) had regard to the words of his, and our Savior,
Jesus Christ, written, Matthew. 5.23, 24. If thou bring thy gift to the altar,
and there remembrest that thy brother has ought against thee; leave there
thine offering before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy
brother, and then come, and offer thy gift. First be reconciled to thy brother:
Be reconciled. What is that? Reconciliatio (says Gillebert super Cantica sermon.
32.
one) est iterata animorum dissidentium conciliatio, Reconciliation is a renewed
agreement of dissenting minds.

This is it, into the commendation whereof the sweet singer of Israel breaks
out, Psalm. 133.1. Behold how good, and comely a thing it is, for brethren to
dwell even together? If either profit or pleasure can allure you; then behold]
consider well, and weigh seriously how good] how profitable, and necessary; and
how comely] how pleasant, and excellent, a thing it is; for brethren] not only
natural brethren, but brethren in Christ, all the sons of God, the members of
his Church, and partakers of the self same doctrine, and life in Christ; to
dwell even togither] not only in one house, but specially to be of one
affection, and consent: to maintain between themselves brotherly love and
mutual consent. Behold how good, how comely a thing it is, for brethren to
dwell together in unity. It is as the sweet perfume and ointment, that holy
oil, which was powered upon the head of the high Priest, and ran down upon his
beard, and so to the skirts of his garment: it is as the dew of Hermon, which
fell upon the mountains of Sion. Both these resemblances, recommending unto
us, the pleasure, and profit of unity, brotherly love, and concord, I commended
unto you in my 16. Lecture upon the first chapter of this prophecy: and
therefore now I say no more of them.

S. Paul, 1. Cor. 12. treating of spiritual gifts, and their diversity; there
reckons up the word of wisdom; the word of knowledge; faith; the gift of
healing; the doing of miracles; prophesying; kinds of tongues; the
interpretation of tongues: and shows how all these are wrought by the same
spirit, who distributeth to every man severally, as he will. Then urging this
several distribution by way of interrogation, (Are all Apostles? Are all
Prophets? Are all teachers? Are all doers of miracles? Have all the gifts of
healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?) he exhorts the
Corinthians to covet after the best gifts; and concludes his Chapter thus: I
will yet show you a more excellent way.

This more excellent way is the way, which now I show you, beloved. This way is
love. O strive ye to walk in it. Let the remainder of your days be spent
therein. Know ye, that whatsoever good parts ye have, or whatsoever good
works ye do, it avails you nothing, if you have not love. Look but to the
beginning of the 13. chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthians. There
shall you find it verified, what I have said unto you. Though you speak with
the tongue of men and Angels, and have not love, yet are you as sou^ding
brass, or a tinkling cimbal. Though you have the gift of Prophecy, and know
all secrets, and all knowledge, yea, if you have all faith, so that you can
remove mountains, and have not love; yet are you nothing. Though you feed the
poor with all your goods, though you give your bodies to be burned, and have
not love, yet it profits you nothing.

My exhortation must be unto you in the same blessed Apostles words, cha. 14.1.
of the same Epistle; Follow after love. And I shut up this exercise with a
sweet Fathers sweet meditation; Bernard. sermon. 9. in Coena Dom.
Charitas te domum Domini facit, and Dominu^ domum tibi. Love, it makes thee a
house for God, and God a house for thee: according to that, 1. Ioh. 4.16. God
is love, and he that dwells in love, dwells in God, and God in him. A happy
artificer thou art, sweet love, that art able to frame for thy self such a
house, as God is. This house is not built of mortar, and brick, nor of stone,
nor of wood, nor of silver, nor of gold, nor of precious stones. It exceeds
and far surpasses silver, and gold; in comparison of it precious stones are
vile, and of no reputation.

This house is an everlasting house, before all ages, before all times; it
contains all things, it comprehends all things, it creates all things, it
gives life to all things. In this house the blind receive light, the lame
strength to walk, the crooked straitnes, the weak health, the dead their
resurrection: there is none wretched in it, all therein are blessed: for they
are entered into their Masters joy. Into which joy, that we may in due time
enter, let us, follow after love, we know that God is love, and that whosoever
dwells in love, dwells in God, and God in him; Now God grant, that we may
all dwell in him.

THE EIGHTEENTH LECTVRE.
AMOS 1.12. Therefore will I send a fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the
palaces of Bozrah.


I Am now come to the last part of this prophecy against Edom: which is, the
denuntiation of Gods judgments against Edom, for his sins, expressed in this
12. verse.

This 12. verse does not much differ from some precedent verses in this chapter
4, 7, and 10. The same punishment which in the 4. verse is threatened to the
Syrians, under the names of Hazael, and Benhadad; and in the 7. verse to the
Philistines, under the name of Azzah; and in the 10. verse to the Tyrians,
under the name of Tyrus, is here in this 12. verse denou^ced to the Edomites,
under the names of Tema^, and Bozrah. And therefore as in the forenamed verses
I have done, so do I in this, recommende unto you three circumstances.

1 The punisher: the LORD. I will send. 2 The punishment: by fire. I will send
a fire. 3 The punished: the Temanites, and Bozrites, the inhabitants of both
cities: I will send a fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the palaces of
Bozrah.
The punisher, is the LORD; for, Thus says the LORD; I will send. The doctrine
naturally arising hence is this.

It is proper to the LORD to execute vengeance upon the wicked for their
sins. This truth has heretofore once, and again, been confirmed unto you.
The less need have I now to insist upon it. Yet may I not pass it over
unsaluted. It is proper to the LORD to execute vengeance, etc.]

This office of executing vengeance upon the wicked for their sins, God takes
upon himself, Deuteronomy. 32.35. Where he says, Vengeance and recompense are mine.
This is confessed to be God his due by S. Paul, Romans 12.19. It is written,
vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the LORD, and by the author of the
Epistle to the Hebrews, chap. 10.30. Vengeance belongs unto me, I will
recompense, says the LORD; and by the sweet singer of Israel, Psalm. 94.1. O
LORD God the avenger, O God the avenger. The Prophet Nahum, chap. 1.2. to the
terror of the wicked, proclaims it: God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth:
the LORD revengeth: even the LORD of anger; the LORD will take vengeance on his
adversaries, and reserveth wrath for his enemies.

These places are so many pregnant proofs to make good my propounded doctrine:
namely, that, It is proper to the LORD to execute vengeance upon the wicked for
their sins. Many are the uses of this doctrine.

The first. It may lesson us to look heedfully unto our feet, that we walk
not in the way of sinners, to partake with them in their sins. Sins are not
tongue-tied; they cry unto the LORD for vengeance. We read in holy writ of
four sorts of sins, which above other, do cry unto God, and do call for his
great, and quick vengeance.

The first is Homicide, murder, or manslaughter; whereof Almighty God, Genesis
4.10. thus speaks unto Caine; The voice of thy brothers blood cries unto me
from the earth.

The second is Sodomie, the sin of Sodom, the sin against nature, a sin
not once to be named among Christians. Whereof thus says the LORD unto Abraham,
Genesis 18.20. Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorah is great, and because their
sin is exceeding grievous, I will go down now, and see whether they have
done altogether according to the cry, which is come unto me.

The third is oppression of the poor; widows, fatherless, and strangers.
Oppression of the poor cries; Psalm. 12.5. Now for the oppression of the
^^^die, and deep sighs of the poor, I will up says the LORD, and will set
at liberty him, whom the wicked has snared. Oppression of the widows, and
the fatherless cries, Exodus 22.22. Y^^ shall not trouble any widow, nor
fatherles child: if you vex, on trouble such, and so he call and cry unto me,
I will surely hear his cry. Then shall my wrath be kindled, and I will kill
you with the sword, and your wives shall be widows, and your children
fatherless. Oppression of strangers cries; Exodus 3.7. The LORD said unto
Moses, I have surely seen the trouble of my people which are in Egypt, and
have heard their cry, because of their taskmakers; and verse the 9. N^m lo the
cry of the children of Israel is come unto me, and I have also seen the
oppression, wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. Thus is oppression, whether
it be of the poor, or of the widows, or of fatherless children, or of
strangers, a crying sin: and this was the third.

The fourth is, the keeping back of the laborers hire. Whereof St James,
chap. 5.4. thus witnesses. Behold the hire of the laborers, which have reaped
your fields, (which is of you kept back by fraud) cries; and the cries of
them which have reaped, are entered into the ears of the LORD of hoasts.

You see (dearly beloved) four crying sins; murder, Sodomie, oppression,
and the detaining, or keeping back of the poor laborers wages. These are
crying sins, and they cry aloud to the ears of Almighty God, and do call
for vengeance, to light upon the doers of them.

But what of other sins? Do not they cry also? Are they dumb? No, says
Gregory, Moral. 5. cap. 8. Omnis namque iniquitas, apud secreta Dei iudicia,
habet voces suas. Every iniquity has a voice to discover it self before God
his secret judgments. Not a voice only, but feet also, yea and the wings too,
to make way into Heaven for vengeance.

Dr. King B. of London upon Ion. lect. 2
Every sin is of ^ high elevation; it ascends above the top of Carmel, it
aspireth, and presses before the Majesty of Gods own throne. God complains
of Niniveh, Ion. 1.2. Their wickedness is come up before me. He tells
Sennacherib, 2. King. 19.28. and Esai, 27.29. Thy tumult is come up into mine
ears. The Prophet Oded, 2. Chron, 28.9. says to the Israelites of their rage,
that it reaches up to heaven.

You see as well a sublimitie, and reach of sin, as a loudness, and
vocalitie of it. As it has a voice, so has it feet, so has it wings; as it
cries, so it runs, so it flies into heaven; and all to fetch down
vengeance against us, the miserable, and wretched actors of it.

Our wickedness what it is, and in what elevation of height, whether it be
modest, or impudent; private, or public; whether it speaks, or cries,
stands or goes; lies like an aspe in her hole, or flies like a fiery
serpent into the presence of God; your selves be judges. Recall to your
remembrances the judgments of the LORD.

The anger of the clouds has been powered down upon our heads both with
abundance, and with violence: Psalm. 93.3.
The floods have lifted up; the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods
have lifted up their waves; the waves of the Sea have been marvailous. Her
surges have broken down her walls, yea have gone over her walls; to the loss
of the precious lives of many of our brethren. The arrows of a woeful
pestilence have been cast abroad at large, in all the quarters of our realm,
even to the emptying, and dispeopling of some part thereof. Treasons against
our King, and country, mighty, monstrous, and prodigious, have been plotted
by a number of Lions whelps, lurking in their dens, and watching their hour
to undo us.

All these things, and other like visitations, have been accomplished amongst
us for our sins, and yet we amend not. Yea we grow worse and worse. We
fleet from sin to sin, as a fly shifteth from sore to sore. We tempt the
LORD, we murmr, we lust, we commit idolatry, we serve the flesh, we sit
down to eat, and rise to play: of bloodshed, of blasphemy, and rage against
God, of oppression, of extortion, of fraud against poor laborers of anger, of
bitterness, of wrath, of strife, of malice, public, infamous, and enormous
sins, we make no conscience; we commit them with greediness; we draw them
on as with (...), we glory in them, as if we had even sold our selves to
(...) before the LORD.

LORD! whether will we? (...) we frozen in our sins, and grow^^ (...) Que
(...) c^^^^ittie, tot facit passus ad infor^^^, says Pet. de pal^. de These. N.
par. aestival. enarr. 2. in Dom. 16. Tri.
one: Look how many sins a man commits, so many steps he goes toward
Hell. Yea, say I, for every sin, we commit, we deserve to be thrown headlong
into Hell fire?

What shall we do, then and brethren? what shall we do? Our LORD God tells
us, what is best, Ezech. 18.30. Return, and cause others to turn away from al
our transgressions; so shall not iniquity be your destruction. and verse 31.
Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby you have transgressed, and
make you a new heart, and a new spirit; for why should you die? and 32. I
desire not the death of him that dies, says the LORD God; return you
therefore, and li^^. Can there be a sweeter invitation?

Come therefore join (...) heart, and stand together: and Ezech. 18.27.
t^rne we (...) and do we that, which is lawful, and right, that we may save
our souls alive. Come let us verse. 28.
turn away from all the transgressions, that we have committed; so shall we
surely live, we shall not die. And this we will the sooner endeavor to do,
if we imprint in our heart^ my propounded doctrine, It is proper to the LORD
to execute vengeance upon the wicked for their sins.

Thus much of the first use; which was, to lesson us to look heedfully to our
feet, that we walk not in the way of sinners, to partake with them in their
sins. I proceed.

Is it true? Is it proper to God to execute vengeance upon the wicked for their
sins? Here then in the second place we are admonished, not to intermedle in
the Lords office. It is his office to execute vengeance. We therefore may not
interpose our selves. If a brother, a neighbor, or a stranger has done us any
wrong, we must forgive him, and must leave revengement to God, to whom it
appertains. We must leave revengement to God, to whom it appertains, and
forgive our enemies. What? Forgive our enemies? How can flesh, and blood endure
it? Well, it should be endured and many reasons there are to induce us to so
Christian an office.

The first is; The forgiveness of our own sins. Whereof thus says our Savior,
Luke 6.37. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven. Per. de Palu. sermon a^stiv.
enarr. in Do^. 22. Ttin.
Ideo libenter debemus dimittere parvum, vt Deus dimittat nobis magnum; we
ought willingly to forgive unto our neighbor a small matter, that God may
forgive us our great offenses. Look, what grace, and indulgence, we show unto
our neighbors, the like will God show unto us. What else is said, Luke 6.38?
With what measure you mete, with the same shall it be measured to you again.
Whereof I cannot give a plainer exposition the^ in our Saviors words, Mat.
6.14, 15. If ye do forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will
also forgive you. But if ye do not forgive men their trespasses, no more will
your Father forgive you your trespasses.

A second reason why we should forgive our enemies, is, that when we make our
prayers unto God, we, our selves, may be heard. For God hears not the
prayers of such, as do abide in ra^cour, and will not forgive their enemies.
It Is well said of an Augustine.
ancient: Qui non vult dimittere fratri su^, non speret orationis effectum.
Whosoever he be, that will not forgive his brother, let him not hope for any
good success in his prayer. Ambros.
Another says: Si inturiam non dimittis, qua tibi facta est; orationem pro te
non facis, sed maledictionem super te inducis. If thou forgive not the injury,
which they neighbor has done thee, when thou prayest, thou make not any
prayer for thy self, but do bring a malediction, or curse, upon thy self.

The most absolute, and excellent platform of prayer, that ever was made, and
is by the maker thereof, our LORD, and Savior, Jesus Christ, commended unto us
for our daily use, confirms this point unto us. The fifth petition therein,
is; that God would be pleased to forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them,
that trespass against us. Wherefore as in all sincerity we desire our selves
to be looked upon with the eyes of grace and mercy, from heaven, without any
fraud, or hollownes, or dissimulation in the LORD: so are we taught by that
clause, our selves to deal with others; so truly, so honestly, so heartily,
so sincerely, and unfeignedly forgiving ever, as we may boldly say: so LORD, do
thou to me, as I to others. Now if these hearts of ours be so sturdy, and
strong in their corruption, as that they will not relent, and yield to forgive
such, as have trespassed against us, how can we look that our prayers should
take effect?

A third reason, why we should forgive our enemies, is, that our good works
may be acceptable unto God. Let a man every day do as many good works, as there
are stars in Heaven; yet as long as in heart he bears hatred to his enemy,
God will not accept any one of the^. Ma^^^ no^ acceptatur, nisi aute discordia
ab animo pellatur, says Gregory, thy gift is no ways acceptable unto God,
unless thy heart be first freed from discord. Let no man circumvent himself,
seduce himself, deceive himself. Augustine. sermon. 5. de S. Stephano.
Whosoever hates but one man in the whole world, whatsoever he offers to God
in Good works, all will be lost. Witness S. Paul, 1. Cor. 13.3. Though I feed
the poor with all my goods, and though I give my body, that I be burned, and
have not love, it profits me nothing. If then, we would have our good works
pleasing unto God, we must be reconciled to our neighbors. Our blessed Savior
Jesus Christ, so advises us, Matthew. 5.24. Go thy way, first be reconciled to
thy brother, then come, and offer thy gift.

A fourth reason, why we should forgive our enemies, is, that our souls may
live: for by hatred, and rancour, we slay our souls. S. Ioh. ep. 1. chap. 3.
verse 15. avoweth it; that he, whosoever hates his brother, is a manslayer.
Homicidiest, scilicet propriae animae, says Pet. de Pal. vbi supra.
one, he is a murderer of his own soul. An exposition not absolutely to be
disallowed, for as much as it follows in the same verse; Ye know that no
manslayer has eternal life abiding in him. The life of the soul is love;
therefore he that loves not, is dead. So says the same blessed Apostle, Ep.
1. cap. 3. verse 14. He that loves not his brother, abides in death. And
greater is the damage by the loss of one soul, then of a thousand bodies.
The whole world in respect of one soul, is not to be esteemed. This is proved
by our Saviors question, Marc. 8.36. What shall it profit a man, though he
should win the whole world, if he loose his own soul?

A fifth reason, why we should love our enemies, is the rejoicing of Saints, and
Angels. To love our enemies, is an infallible sign of our conversion. Now we
know by Luke 15.7. that there shall be joy in Heaven for one sinner, that
converteth: and verse the 10. that there is joy in the presence of the Angels
of God for one sinner, that converteth.

Thus whether we respect the reioicing of Saints, and Angels; or the life of
our souls; or the acceptance of our good works; or the fruit of our prayers;
or the forgiveness of our sins; we must love our enemies: after St Stephen
his example, Act. 7.60. LORD lay not this sin to their charge: after S. Paul
his example, 1. Cor. 4.12, 13. We are reviled, and yet we bless: we are
persecuted, and suffer it: we are evil spoken of, and we pray: after Christ's
example, Luke 23.34. Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.
Add hereto Christ's commandment, Math. 5.44. Love your enemies; bless them
that curse you; do good to them that hate you; and pray for them that hurt
you, and persecute you. Leave ye vengeance to the God of vengeance; so shall
ye be the undoubted children of your heavenly Father. And thus far of the
second use; which was to admonish us, not to intermeddle in the Lords office of
executing revengement. A third follows.

Is it true? Is it proper to the LORD to execute vengeance upon the wicked for
their sins? Here then in the third place, is a treasury, of comfort, and of
terror: of comfort to the Godly, of terror to the wicked. For though the LORD
do use the wicked, to correct the Godly; yet will he in due time overthrow the
wicked with a large measure of his judgments, and free the godly. Gods holy
practice in this kind, must be hereof a warrant unto us.

The Israelites were kept in thraldom, and bondage, many years by the
Egyptians. The Egyptians, they were but the weapons of Gods wrath; wherewith
he afflicted his people. They were Gods weapons. Were they therefore to escape
unpunished? No. Witness those ten great plagues which at length God wrought
upon them, and their fearful overthrow in the red sea, at large set down
in the book of Exodus, from the 7. chapter to the 14. This was it, which God
said to Abraham, Genesis 15. verse. 13, 14. Know for a surety, that thy seed
shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, four hundred years, and
shall serve them; notwithstanding the nation whom they shall serve, will I
judge.

Ahab, the most wicked of the Kings of Israel, who sold him self to work
wickedness in the sight of the LORD, and his accursed wife, Iezebel, were Gods
instruments to afflict Naboth, with the loss of his life and vineyard. Ahab
and Iezebel, were Gods instruments: were they therefore to escape unpunished?
NO. Witness both their ends. The end of Ahab, recorded, 1. King. 22 38. In the
place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, did dogs lick the blood of
Ahab also. And the end of Iezebel; registered, 2. King. 9.35. She was eaten up
with dogs all saving her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands.

It was a part of Daniel his afflictions, to be cast into the den of Lions;
his accusers unto Darius were the instruments, of this his affliction. These
his accusers were the Lords instruments, for this business. Were they
therefore to escape unpunished? No. Their fearful end is set down, Dan.
6.24. By the commandment of King Darius, they with their wives, and children,
were cast into the den of Lions; the Lions had the masterie of them, and
brake all their bones in pieces, yer ever they came to the ground of the den.

Here might I recall to your remembrances, other judgments of God of this
quality, written down in the register of God's works, his holy word. How,
and what, he rendered to Haman, to Sennacherib, to Ioachim, to the Ammonites, to
the Chaldeans, and other wicked worldlings, for their hard measure offered to
the godly: though they were therein Gods instruments. But I must hasten; and
the aforementioned instances of the Egyptians, of Ahab, and his wife Iezebel,
and of Daniels accusers, are sufficient to work terror to the wicked, and to
the godly comfort: and to assure us, when the LORD shall show himself from
heaven, with his holy Angels in flaming fire, that then to the wicked, whose
behavior to the godly, has been proud, and dispiteous, he will render
vengeance and punish them with everlasting perdition. Thus far of the first
circumstance, and doctrine thereupon.

The second circumstance is the punishment. I will send a fire] By fire in this
place as verse. 4, 7, 10. learned expositors do understand, not so much a
natural fire, as a figurative fire. For in the name of fire, they understand
the sword, pestilence, and famine, quodlibet genus consumptionis, every kind of
consumptio^; quamlibet speciem excidij, every kind of destruction; be it hail,
or thunder, or sickness, or any other of Gods messengers. So large is the
signification of fire, taken figuratively. The doctrine arising hence, is this.

The fire ( whether natural, or figurative) that is, the fire, and all other
creatures, are at the Lords commandment, to be employed by him in the
punishment of the wicked. This doctrine has heretofore been commended, and
confirmed unto you.

The use of it, is, to teach us how to behave our selves, at such times as God
shall visit us with his rod of correction: how to carry our selves in all our
afflictions. We must not so much look to the instruments, as to the LORD that
smites by them. If the fire, or water, or any other of Gods creatures shall at
any time rage, and prevail against us, we must remember that it is God, that
sends them, to work his holy will upon us. Here he sent a fire upon Teman,
and upon Bozrah to devour her palaces. For thus says the LORD: I will send a
fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.

Here have you the third circumstance; the circumstance of the punished: Teman
and the palaces of Bozrah. Teman was the metropolitan, the chief city of
Idumaea, so named from Teman, who was son of Eliphaz, the son of Esau, Genesis
26.10, 11. Renowned and famous was Teman for her wisdom; witness the prophecy
of Obadiah, verse. 8, 9. and Ierem. 49.7. whereby, it is credible, she omitted
no opportunity, no means, to make her self strong by bulwarks, and
fortresses, against whatsoever incursion; or siege of enemies. Yet could she
not hereby be secured against the day of Gods visitation; when for the
complement of her sins, God should lay his heavy rod upon her. What the wit of
man could invent for safety, no doubt, but Teman had it. But what can man's wit
do against the Almighty. Behold here, in my text, thus says the Almighty: I
will send a fire upon Teman. And can all the water of the huge Ocean, quench
the fire of the Almighty.

This resolution of the LORD for the overthrow of Teman, is excellently set
down by the Prophet Obadiah, ver. 8, 9, 10. Shall not I, in that day says the
LORD, even destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding from the mount
of Esau? And thy strong me^, O Tema^. shall be afraid, because every one of the
mount of Esau, shall be cut of by slaughter. For thy cruelty against thy
brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and thou shall be cut of for ever. The
Prophet Jeremy to this purpose, chap. 49.7. brings in the LORD of heasts
thus questioning with Edom: Is wisdom no more in Teman? Is counsel perished
from their children? Is their wisdom vanished? As if he had said; the
wisdom of Teman is become foolishness; their counsel is nothing worth. And
why? But because as my text says; God will send a fire upon Teman. The
doctrine hence arising is, No wisdom, no counsel, no humane invention can
save that city, which God will have destroyed.

The reason hereof, is: because there is no strength, but of God and from God.
The use is: to teach us, never to trust in any worldly help, but so to use all
good means of our defense, that still we rely upon the LORD, for strength,
and success thereby.

Again this fire of the LORD is sent to devour the palaces of Bozrah. This
Bozrah was also a metropolitan, and chief city, seated in the confines of the
lands of Edom, and Moab: and therefore in holy writ it is sometime attributed
to Edom, sometime to Moab. Here to Edom. Prodigious was the fear, and great
the pride of Bozrahs heart. She dwelt in the clefts of the rock, and kept the
height of the hill. But was she thereby safe? No. For thus says the LORD unto
her, Ierem. 49.16. Though thou should make thy nest, as high as the Eagle, I
will bring thee down from thence. This judgment of the LORD against Bozrah, is
denounced with an Ecce of admiration, verse. 22. Behold, he (the LORD) shall
come up, and fly as the Eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah, and at that
day shall the heart of the strong men of Edom be, as the heart of a woman in
travel. Will you have it confirmed by an oath? Then look back to the 13.
verse. I swear by my self says the LORD, that Bozrah shall be wast, and for a
reproach, and a desolation, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be a
perpetual desolation. Thus elegantly is Gods fearful judgment against Bozrah
described by the Prophet Jeremy; which our Prophet Amos thus delivers, A fire
shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.

Bozrah, great Bozrah, she who dwelt in the clefts of the rock, and kept the
height of the hill, must she be devoured by fire from the LORD? Must she
become a reproach, a desolation, a curse, a vastity? We may hence take this
doctrine, It is not the situation of a city upon rock, or hill, that can be a
safeguard to it, if Gods unappeasable anger break out against it, for her sins.

The use of this doctrine is the same with the former; even to teach us, now,
and at all other times; to put our trust only in the Name of the LORD, who has
made heaven and earth. It Is neither wit, nor wisdom, nor strength, nor height
of Teman, or of Bozrah, or of all the best defensed cities in the world, that
can save us in the day of visitation. Wherefore let our song be, as David's
was, Psalm. 18.2. The LORD is our rock, and our fortress; he that delivers
us; our God, and our strength; in him will we trust: our shield; the horn also
of our salvation, and our refuge.

Thirdly, in that the LORD sends his fire into the palaces of Bozrah to
devour them, we may learn this doctrine, God depriveth us of a great
blessing, when he takes from us our dwelling houses.

A truth experimentally made good unto us by the great commodity, or
contentment, that comes to every one of us, by our dwelling houses. The use
is: to teach us. 1. To be humbled before Almighty God, whenever our dwelling
houses are taken from us. 2. Since we peaceably enjoy our dwelling houses, to
use them for the furtherance of Gods glory. 3. To praise God day by day for
the comfortable use we have of our dwelling houses. Thus is my exposition of
the prophecy against Edom ended.

THE NINETEENTH LECTVRE
AMOS 1.13, 14, 15. Thus says the LORD, For three transgressions of the
children of Ammon, and for four I will not turn to it, because they have ripped
up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border.

Therefore will I kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the
palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, and with a tempest in the
day of the whirlewinde.

And their king shall go into captivity, he, and his Princes together, says
the LORD.


THis blessed Prophet of Almighty God, in this his prophecy against the
Ammonites, observes the same order, as he has done in two precedent
predictions, the one against the Syrians, verse the third, fourth, and fifth,
the other against the Philistines, verse the sixth, seventh, and eighth. As in
those, so in this are three parts.

1 A preface, Thus says the LORD. 2 A prophecy, For three transgressions,
etc. 3 A conclusion, verse the fifteenth, Says the LORD.
The prophecy consists of four parts.

1 A general accusation of the Ammonites: who are here noted, as reproueable
for many sins: For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for
four. 2 God his protestation against them for their sins; I will not turn
to it. 3 A particular declaration of one sin, which with others procured this
prophecy. This sin was the sin of cruelty expressed in these words: Because
they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead: and amplified, by the end
of so foul a fact: That they might enlarge their borders. 4 A denuntiation of
judgment, which was to come upon them, deservedly, for their sins, ver. 14,
and 15. This judgment is set down,
First in a generality, verse. 14. Therefore will I kindle a fire in the wall
of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.

Secondly with some circumstances: as, that it should be full of terror, and
speedy. Full of terror, in these words; With shouting in the day of battle.
Speedy, in the words following: With a tempest in the day of the whirlewinde.

This judgment is further amplified, by the extent of it. It was to fall upon,
not only the meaner sort of the people, but upon the nobility also, yea, and
upon the King himself. Which is plain by the 15. verse. Their King shall go
into captivity, he, and his princes together.

These are the branches, and parts of this prophecy. I return to the Preface.

Thus says the LORD] JEHOVAH. This great, and most honorable name of God we
have many times met with. We have heard what the Cabalistes, and Rabbines, out
of their too much curiosity have thought of it. With them it is nomen (...), a
name not to be pronounced, not to be taken within our polluted lips. They call
it Tetragrammaton, a name in Hebrew of four letters; of four letters (...),
by an excellence; because the name of God Alsted. Lex. Theol. cap. 2. page 76.

goodness sovereign; in wisdom wonderful; in power Almighty; in counsels

authority to his prophecy; Thus says the LORD.

Has the LORD said, and shall he not do accordingly? has he spoken it, and
shall he not accomplish it? Balaam confesses unto Balak, Number. 23.19. God is
not as man, that he should lie; nor as the son of man, that he should repent.
Indeed says Sam. 1. Sam. 15.29. The strength of Israel, will not lie, nor
repent; for he is not as man that he should repent. All his words, yea all the
titles of his words, are Yea, and Amen. Verily says our Savior, Matthew.. 5.18.
Heaven and earth shall perish, before one jot, or one title of Gods word shall
escape unfulfilled.

Thus says the LORD] Amos is here a pattern to us, that are preachers, of the
word of salvation. We must ever come unto you, with Thus says the LORD, in our
mouths; we may not speak either the imaginations of our own brains, or the
vain persuasions of our own hearts. We must sincerely preach unto you Gods
gracious word, without all corruption, or depraving of the same. This is it
whereto S. Peter exhorts us, 1. ep. chap. 4 11. If any man speak, let him
speak, as the word of God. For if we, yea if an Angel from heaven, shall
preach otherwise unto you, then from the LORD'S own mouth, speaking in his
holy word, (...): Let him be accursed; let him be had in ^^^^ntion,

This note, beloved, does also concern you, that are the auditors, and
hearers of Gods word. For if we, the preachers thereof, must always come unto
you, with Thus says the LORD, the^ are you to hear us with reverence, and
attention. And this, for the authority of him, that speaks. It is not you
that speak, says our Savior, Jesus Christ, to his blessed Apostles, Matt.
10.20. but the Spirit of your Father, which speaks in you. And again, Luke
10.16. He that hears you, hears me. S. Paul commends the Thessalonians,
1. ep. chap. 2.13. for that, when they received of the Apostles of Christ, the
word of the preaching of God they received it, not as the word of man, but, as
it was indeed, as the word of God. Well therefore did S. James chap. 1.21. thus
to exhort the Jews; Receive with meeknes the word, that is grafted in you,
which is able to save your souls.

God spoke unto Israel in a vision by night, Genes. 46.2. and said, Jacob,
Jacob, Jacob answered, I am here. He was pressed and ready with all ^^^ient
attentio^ to hear, what his God should say unto him, and to follow the same
with all faithful obedience. Such readiness well becomes every child of
God, eve^ at this day in the Church, where God speaks. Thus must he think
within himself. It is thine ordinance, o LORD, by thy word preached, to
instruct me concerning thy holy will: I am here LORD, in all humble fear, to
hear thy blessed pleasure, what this day it shall please thee to put in the
mouth of the preacher to deliver unto me: I am here speak on LORD, thy servant
hears.

If a Prince, or some great man of this world, shall speak unto you, you will
attend and give ear unto him with your best diligence: how much more then
ought ye so to do, when the King of Heaven, and LORD of the earth, calls
upon you by his ministers? Thus far by occasion of the preface, Thus says
the LORD.

For three transgressions of the children of Ammon and for foure] Whether these
children of Ammon, wore distinguished from the Ammonites, as Drusius would
prove, 2. Chron. 20.1. and as R. David avoweth, filij Ammon, nusquam vocantur
Ammonitae, the children of Ammon, are no where named Ammonites, I hold it
needless to dispute in this place. It is one of doubt, that these children of
Ammon, or Ammonites, did lineally descend from Ben-ammi, who was Dots son,
begotten in meest upon his younger daughter, Genesis 19.38. Lot was Abraham's
brothers son, Genesis 14.12. Whereby it is evident, that the posterity of them
both; the children of Israel, and the children of Ammon, the Israelites, and
the Ammonites; were linked together by affinity, and alliance. The more to
blame were those Ammonites, without all respect of kindred, to exercise such
cruelty, as they did, against the Israelites, for which cause Almighty God
here sent his blessed Prophet, to thunder out his threats against them.

For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for foure] In the front
of this prophecy, you have the general accusation of these children of Ammon:
For three transgressions, and for foure] Three of these transgressions, if you
will believe Albertus Magnus, are Cruelty, Avarice, and persecution: the
fourth is, an obstinate pertinacie, a constant stubbornness, ever to dwell in
those sins. Again three of these transgressions, are a coveting of other
men's goods, an unlawful seeking for those things that are not our own, and a
hardness of heart to retain them so sought for: the fourth is, the insatiable
desire of a covetous man.

Many are the expositions of the learned upon these words, three, and four
transgressions. The most natural, proper, and significant I take to be, if by
three and four; a finite and certain number, you understand a number infinite
and uncertain. God as often as he will forgiueth, though we sin ten
thousand times. It is but a custom of the Scripture, thus to speak. God
waits for us twice and thrice, that is, a long time, to see, if we will
return from our evil ways unto repentance: but the fourth time, that is at
length, when he sees us persist in our impenite^cie, he reproves us, casts
us away, and leaves us in our sins. Thus have you the general accusation of
the children of Ammon, for their many sins, for which the LORD'S protestation
against them follows.

I will not (...).] Those (...) are diversely rendered by expositors by the
author of the vulgar Latin, and by Gualt^r: No^ convert (...); I will not turn
the Ammonite: that is, I will not recall the children of Ammon to the right way:
they shall run on to their own perdition. By Calvin: Non ^rocipropitius, I will
not be favorable to the Ammonites. By Mercer; Non parcam ei: I will not spare
the Ammonites. According to their deserts so shall it be unto them. By Iunius:
Non avertam istud: I will not turn away the punishment, wherewith I have
resolved to punish them. I am the LORD, I am not changed.

The sum is: if the Ammonites had offended but once, or a second time. I
would have been favorable to them, and would have recald them into the right
way, that so they might be co^verted, and escape my punishments: but now
whereas they do daily heap transgression upon transgression, and make no end
of sinning, I have hardened my face against them, and will not suffer them to be
converted; but indurate and obstinate, as they are, I will utterly destroy
them. For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will
not turn to it] Here are you to be remembered of a doctrine, sundry times
heretofore commended to your christian considerations, Many sins do pluck
down from heaven the most certain wrath and vengeance of God upon the sinners.

God is of pure eyes, and beholds not iniquity. He has laid righteousness to
the rule, and weighed his justice in a balance. The sentence is passed forth,
and must stand uncontrollable, even as long as the sun, and moon:
Tribulation and anguish upon every soul that does evil. The soul that
sins, it shall be punished. God makes it good by an oath, Deuteronomy. 32.41. That
he will what his glittering sword, and his hand shall take hold on judgment,
to execute vengeance for sin. His soul hates, and abhors sin; his law
curses and condemns sin; his hand smites and scourges sin. Sin was
his motive to cast down Angels into Hell; to thrust Adam out of Paradise; to
turn cities into Ashes; to ruinate nations; to torment his own bowels in the
similitude of sinful flesh. Because of sin, he drowned the old world; and
because of sin ere long will burn this. Thus do many sins pluck, etc.

One use of this doctrine is: to teach us heedfulnesse in all our ways; that we
do not by our many sins provoke Almighty God to high displeasure.

A second use is, to move us to a serious contemplation of the wonderful
patience of Almighty God, who did so graciously forbear these children of
Ammo^, til by three and four transgressions, by their many sins they
provoked him to indignation. These things I have heretofore labored to lay
unto your hearts.

Now therefore I proceed to the third part of this prophecy: wherein you
have the declaration of that grievous sin, by which the children of Ammon so
highly offended. This their sin, was the sin of cruelty: expressed in these
words: Because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead: and amplified
by the end of so foul a fact; That they might enlarge their border.

They have ripped up women with child of Gilead, that, etc.] Women with child:
the word in the original is (...) and is Pagnin. in (...). Mercer. Calvin.
rendered by some, mountains; by some, cities fortified, and high as
mountains: as if the meaning were; either, that the Ammonites had made for
themselves a passage into the territories of the Gileadites, through the
mountains, that lay between them; (a thing not impossible: for we read of
Annibal, that Livius. lib. 21.
he with fire, and vinegar made way through a great rock upon the Alps, for
his army, and carriage,) or, that the Ammonites had vanquished, and subdued
the fortified cities of the Gileadites, to the enlarging of their borders. But
I retain our English translation; women with child: as very agreeable to the
Hebrew (...).

They have ripped up women with childe] Immane facinus: surely this was an
outrageous cruelty: yet such as has it is parallel: we read of the like in 2.
King. 8.12. Elizeus telling Hazael, king of Syria, of the evil that he should
do the children of Israel, says: Their young men thou shall slay with the
sword, and shall dash their infants against (...) pieces their about with
child. The like cruelty (...), king of Israel, exercise against the inahbitants
of the city Tiphsah, and her borderers, eve^ unto Thir^za, as appears; 2.
King. 15.16. He ripped up all their women with child? Hoseah also, chap. 14.1.
thus prophecieth against Samaria. Samaria shall be desolate: for she has
rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword; their infants shall be
dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped. You see (dearly
beloved) that this outrageous cruelty of ripping up women with child,
mentioned in my text, was not altogether unusual. The women, upon whom this
cruelty was practiced, are here said to have been of Gilead.

Of this land of Gilead I have heretofore largely spoken in my seventh Lecture
upon this prophecy, occasioned by the 3. ver. of this chapter, where it is
objected to the Syrians of Damascus, that they threshed Gilead with threshing
instruments of iron. The^ I showed; that the land of Gilead, was possessed by
the Reubenites, Gadites; and half tribe of Manasseh, Number. 32.33. Whereby it is
plain, that the Gileadites were Israelites. Here the^ these women, with whom
the Ammonites dealt so barbarously, as to rip them up, when they were great
with child, were of Jacobs posterity: they were Israelites, the lot, and
portion of Gods own inheritance. For so prodigious a cruelty, we see Almighty
God is here resolved to be avenged on the children of Ammon. The doctrine
arising hence is this, Cruelty is a sin very hateful unto God.

This doctrine I have heretofore out of this place, confirmed unto you: it is
also plainly grounded upon my text: and therefore I pass it over.

The use of it is, to work in us the love of clemency, and mercifulness. You
may be many ways guilty of cruelty. If you fight with, or beat your neighbor,
or maime his body, Levit. 24.19, 20. If by any means you procure the death of
your neighbor, Genesis 4.8. If you use your neighbor discourteously, or make him
your laughing stock, or taunting recreation, Levit. 19.14. If you use any of
Gods creatures hardly, Deuteronomy. 22.6. If you do wrong to strangers, Exodus 22.21.
If you molest fatherless children, and widows, Exodus 22.22. If you be too
severe in punishing your servants, or children, Deuteronomy. 35.3. If you wrong the
poor, either by lending him your money upon Usury, Exodus 22.25. or by not
paying him his hire, Deuteronomy. 24.14. or by not restoring his pledge, Exodus 22.26.
or by withdrawing your corn from him, Prove. 11.26. If you offend but in the
lest of these, you are guilty of cruelty, and do transgress Gods holy
commandments, the sixth commandment, wherein you are forbidden to do murder.

Wherefore (beloved in the Lord) put you on the tender bowels of mercy, and
compassion: let cruelty be far from you. My exhortation unto you, and
conclusion of this point, shall be in the words of S. Paul, Coloss. 3.12.13.
Now as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercy, kindness,
humblenes of mind, meekenes, long suffering: forbearing one another, and
forgiving one another; if any man have a quarrel to another: as Christ forgave
you, even so do ye.

These words of my text; They have ripped up women with child of Gilead, do
yield us another profitable doctrine. They, that is, the children of Ammon,
professed enemies to God, and godliness, have raged against the Gileadites,
Jacobs posterity, the lot, and portion of Gods inheritance, even to the ripping
up of their women with child. The doctrine is, God often humbles his chosen
children, under the rod of the wicked. This truth appears in Lot, sore
pressed upon by the Sodomites; Genesis 19.9. in the Israelites, hardly dealt with
by the Egyptians; Exodus 1.11. in the seaventy brethren, sons of Ierubbaal,
persecuted by Abimelech, most of them to the death; Judge. 9.5. in Jeremy,
twice evil entreated; first beaten, and put in the stocks by Pashure, Ierem.
20.2. and a second time beaten, and imprisoned by Zedechias his nobles; chap.
37.15. in the three children, cast into the fiery furnace, by Nabuchodonosor,
Dan. 3.21.

Many like examples might be extracted out of Gods holy register, for proof
of this point: which also may be made further to appear unto you, in those
bloody persecutions after Christ his death, by the Roman Emperors, who devised
strange torments to keep down religion, and religious professors, men and
women. They plucked of their skins quick: they boared out their eyes with
nimbles: they broyled them alive on gredirous: they scalded them in boiling
liquors: they enclosed them in barrels, through which great nails were driven,
and therein they tumbled them down mountains, till their own blood so
cruelly drawn out, had stifled and choked them in the barrells: women's
breasts, were Jeared of with burning irons, their bodies were rent, and their
ioints racked.

Sundry other, and as strange kinds of torments, were endured by the faithful,
in the time of the ten first persecutions in the primitive Church. This is it
which S. Peter has epist. 1. chap. 4. verse. 17. The time is come, that
judgment must begin at the house of God. Yet let not the faithful hereat be
discouraged. It is for their good. Job, an upright, and a just man, one that
feared God, and eschewed evil, upon his experience of the afflictions which he
endured under the rod of Gods correction, chap. 5.17. says: Behold, blessed is
the man whom God corrects: therefore refuse not thou the chastning of the
Almighty. For he makes the wound and binds it up; he smites, and his hands
make whole. And thus from my doctrine, I proceed to the uses. I will but point
at the^.

Is it true (beloved?) Does God often humble his chosen children under the rod
of the wicked? It may first show us, how great Gods anger is for sin, that he
punishes it so severely even in his dearest children, and thereby may work in
us a loathing, hatred, and detestation of sin. Never more need then now, to
smite our breasts, and pray with the publicane, O God, be merciful unto us
sinners.

Secondly, it may teach us not to measure the favor of God toward our selves,
or others, by the adversities, or crosses of this life. Here we see, that the
women of Gilead, of the race of Israel, Gods own lot, and inheritance were
most barbarously and cruelly ripped up by the Ammonites. Yet are we not to doubt,
but that Gods favor was great toward them, even in this severe punishment.

Thirdly, it may make us, pour out our souls in thankfulness before
Almighty God for our present estate, and condition. It is not with us, as in
the days of Gilead, we are not threshed with threshing instruments of iron;
our women with child are not ripped up. Our days are the days of peace; our
King is a king of peace. Peace is in our ports; peace in all our borders, and
peace within our walls. Psalm. 144.12.
Our sons do grow up as young plants; our daughters are as the polished
corners of the temple. Our garners are full, and plenteous with all manner of
store. Our sheep bring forth thousands, and ten thousands. Our oxen are strong
to labor. Here is no invasion, no leading into captivity, no complaining in
our streets.

Are not the people happy that are in such a case? Yes says the Psalmist,
Psalm. 144.15. Happy are the people that are in such a case. The case you see is
ours. The God of peace, which makes an Psalm. 46.10.
end of war in all the world, and breaks the bow, and knappeth the spears
asunder, and burns the chariots with fire: he does now protect us from
war, and slaughter. Quid rependemus? What shall we render unto the LORD, for
all his benefits toward us? We will take the cup of salvation, and praise his
holy name. O our souls, praise the LORD; for he only makes us to dwell in
safety. Thus far of the cruel fact of the Ammonites, in ripping up the
women with child of Gilead. This their fact is amplified by the end, wherefore
they did it; They have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might
enlarge their border.

That they might enlarge their border? What could such cruelty against
innocent and harmless women, further them to the attaining of such an end?
Very much. For hereby it might come to pass, that there should not be any
offspring of the Gileadites to inherit, and possess the land; so might the land
without any resistance become the possession of the Ammonites.

This is by a prophetical contestation touched, Ierem. 49.1. Unto the children
of Ammo^ thus says the LORD; Has Israel no sons? or has he no heirs? Why
then has their King possessed Gad; and his people dwelt in his cities? So
might this our Prophet Amos here contest, and make complaint: Has Gilead no
sons? Has Gilead no heirs? Why then have the Ammonites possessed Gilead?
why have they dwelt in the cities of Gilead? The answer is plain out of my
text; the Ammonites have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, they have left
them no sons; no heirs. And so they possessed the land of Gilead; so have
they enlarged their borders. We see now the meaning of our Prophet: He
obiecteth to the Ammonites, not only that they did cruelly rip up the women
with child in Gilead, but also, that they did it for this end, that they might
enlarge their borders. The doctrine is, That nation, which is not content with
her own borders, but invadeth her neighbor countries, sins grievously.

The Ethnickes of old, taught but in Natures school, did hold it for a wicked
act, detestable, and inexpiable, to remove a neighbors land-markes. In which
respect the old Romans worshipped Terminus for a God. Terminus which
signifies, a bound, limite, mere, buttle, or land-marke, was in their account
a God, God of their bounds, limits, or marks of their several fields,
meadows, and pastures; and such a God, as should not give place to Jupiter
himself. To this Terminus they held a feast in February, and called it
Terminalia, as Austine witnesses in his books de Civitate Dei, Lib. 5.21. and
lib. 7. c. 7. Now if the heathenish, blind, and superstitious Romans, trained
up in natures school, did so highly esteem of the preservatio^, and
maintenance of bounds, and limits: how are we, trained up in the school of
Grace, to esteem thereof? In the school of Grace a law is give^, Deuteronomy. 19.14.
Thou shall not remove thy neighbors mark. To obey this law we are charged
upon a curse, Deu. 27.17. Cursed be he, that removes his neighbors mark. It
is Gods own ordinance that bounds, and limits, and marks are appointed to every
man's possessions. This may be gathered out of, Deuteronomy. 32.8. The most high [GOD,]
divided to the nations their inheritances: he separated the sons of me^: he
did set the bounds of nations. The meaning is: the LORD pitched the bounds of
kingdoms, at such time as it pleased him, that the nations should be divided
asunder. Yet we see how the covetous ambition, and insatiable desire of some
Princes in the world, have put al out of order, how there is nothing so holy,
that can stay them from incroaching upon the bounds of their neighbors, and
next borderers.

Se^nacherib King of Assyria was a stout offender in this kind. He boasted of
his invasions and victories upon his neighbor countries. But, that other
princes may take example by him, he was made a peculiar example of divine
judgment. For as he transgressed the bounds of his neighbor princes to their
overthrow, so did his own sons transgress the bounds of nature, to the
loss of his their fathers life. As it appears by Esai 37.38. As Sennacherib
was in the temple worshipping Nisroch his God; Adramelech, and Sharezer, his
sons, slew him with the sword. And by my text you see, what judgments God
threatens to the Ammonites, for their unlawful practices to enlarge their
borders. So my doctrine is established; The nation, that is not content with
her own borders, but invadeth her neighbor countries, sins grievously.

The use of this doctrine may concern us here assembled. As princes ought to
hold themselves contented with their own bounds, so ought every private man
also. God has also separated their possessions one from another, to the end
that al might live, and communicate one with another, and that there might be
no confused disorder.

But (beloved in the Lord) how do we stand to this order, set by Almighty God?
Do we not seek daily to pervert it? God would have it kept most holy; but we
care not for it. Our covetousness carries us away; we would still be greater.
We join house to house, and field to field, as it is in Esai. 5.8. that we
may be placed by our selves in the midst of the earth. Were our Fathers so
ambitious? They were content with such bounds, as their ancestors left them;
but we must have them altered, if not enlarged. The divinely-inspired David
tells us, Psalm. 37.3. that if we dwell in the land, where God has placed us,
we shall verily be fed. We should learn of S. Paul, Philip. 4.11. in
whatsoever state we are, therewith to be content. Knowing it to be true, which
the same Apostle avoweth unto Timothy, Ep. 1. chap. 6. ver. 6. that Godliness
is great gain, if we will be content, with that we have. Thus much of the 13.
verse.

THE TWENTIETH LECTVRE
AMOS 1.14, 15. Therefore will I kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it
shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, and with
a tempest in the day of the whirlewinde.

And their king shall go into captivity, he, and his Princes together, says
the LORD.


HEre we have the denuntiation of the judgments of God against the children
of Ammon for their sins. This judgment is in the 14. verse set down, 1. In
a generality. 2. with some circumstances.

First, in a generality; Therefore will I kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah,
and it shall devour the palaces thereof.

Secondly with some circumstances, as that it should be, full of terror, and
speedy, and of large extent.

Full of terror: with shouting in the day of battle.

Speedy: with a tempest in the day of the whirlewinde.

Of large extent. For it was to fall upon, not only the meaner sort of the
people, but upon the nobility also, yea and upon the king himself, which is
plain by the 15. verse. Their king shall go into captivity, he, and his
princes together.

First let us weigh this judgment of God, as it is set down in a generality,
I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces
thereof. This judgment for substance is no other, then that which you have
heretofore heard out of this chapter to have been denounced from Almighty God
against the Syrians, Philistines, Tyrians, and Edomites. Against the Syrians,
verse. 4. I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the
palaces of Ben-hadad. Against the Philistines, ver. 7. I will send a fire upon
the walls of Azzah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof. Against the
Tyrians, ver. 10. I will send a fire upon the walls of Tyrus, and it shall
devour the palaces thereof. Against the Edomites, verse. 12. I will send a fire
upon Ternan, and it shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.

Between those denunciations, and this, you see no great difference. In those,
Thus says the LORD, I will send a fire: in this, Thus: I will kindle a fire. I
will send a fire, and I will kindle a fire: the substance in both is the same.
And therefore as in those I have done, so do I in this; I commend to your
Christian, and religious considerations certain circumstances.

1 Of the punisher; the LORD, I will kindle. 2 Of the punishment; by fire, A
fire. 3 Of the punished: The walls of Rabbah, and the palaces thereof.
These circumstances are in this judgment of God, as it is set down in a
generality: The first circumstance concerns the punisher: the LORD; for thus
says the LORD; I will kindle a fire. The note yields this doctrine, It is
proper to the LORD to execute vengeance upon the wicked for their sins.

This truth has been often confirmed unto you. Diverse are the uses of it.

1 It may lesson us to look heedfully unto our feet, that we walk not in the
way of sinners, to partake with the^ in their sins. Sins are not
tongue-tied; they cry alowd unto the LORD for vengeance.

2 It may admonish us not to intermedle in the LORDS office. It Is his office to
execute vengeance. We therefore may not interpose our selves.

3 It may serve for a comfort to the Godly, against whom the wicked, have
behaved themselves prowdly, and dispiteously. God in due time (...) such their
behavior, will render vengeance unto them, (...) them with everlasting
perdition.

The second circumstance concerns the punishment; which is by fire: I will
kindle a fire] By fire here we are to understand, not so much a true, and
natural fire, as a figurative, and metaphorical fire. The sword, pestilence,
and famine; quodlibet genus consumptionis, every kind of consumption, quaelibet
species excidij, every kind of destruction; hail, water, thunder, sickness, or
any other of the executioners of God his wrath for the sins of men, may be
signified by this name Fire. The doctrine, The fire (whether natural, or
figurative) that is, the fire, and all other creatures, are at the Lords
commandment, to be employed by him in the punishment of the wicked.

Of this doctrine heretofore. The use of it is, to teach us, how to behave our
selves at such times, as God shall visit us with his rod of correction: how to
carry our selves in all our afflictions. We must not so much look to the
means, as to the LORD, that works by them. If the fire, or water, or any
other of Gods creatures shall at any time rage, and prevail against us, we
must know: that God by them works his holy will upon us. Here we see, he
resolves to kindle a fire upon the wall of Rabbah, for thus says the LORD; I
will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah and it shall devour the palaces
thereof.

There was a city of this name (Rabbah) in the country of Moab, called
Rabbath-Moab. So says Drusius. But the Rabbah in my text, was a city in the
country of the Ammonites; called, 2. Sam. 12.26. Rabbah of the children of
Ammon: where it is named the city of the kingdom. For it was their
metropolitical, and chief city. In the verse following it is called the city of
waters, because it was situate near unto the river Ieboc.

The destruction here threatened to this city, is likewise denounced by two
other Prophets; Jeremy, and Ezechiel. In Jeremy, chap. 49.2. Thus says the
LORD: I will cause a noise of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites, and
it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burnt with fire. Cry
ye daughters of Rabbah; gird you with sackecloath: mourn, and run to and
fro by the hedges: for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and
his princes likewise. And Ezechiel, chap. 25.5. I will make Rabbah a dwelling
place for Camels: and the Ammonites a sheepcoate.

By which two places of Jeremy, and Ezechiel, the meaning of my Prophet is
opened. Here in the person of God he says: I will kindle a fire in the wall of
Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof. It is, as if he had said. The
Ierem. 7.34.
voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness shall cease to be heard in Rabbah;
the noise of war shall be heard there; and I will make it a dwelling place
for Camels, a sheepecoate, an heap of desolation.

Must Rabbah, the chief city of the kingdom, be measured with the line of
desolation? It yields us this doctrine, It is not the greatness of a city that
can be a safeguard unto it, if God his unappeasable wrath break out against
it, for its sins.

For confirmation of this doctrine, I need not send you to the old world, to
behold the ruins of cities there. There may you see the city which Caine
built, (Genesis 4.17.) and whatsoever other cities were erected between that
time, and the flood; you may see them all swept away with the flood. After the
flood you may see Sodom, and Gomorah, with other cities of that plain;
overthrown with brimstone, and fire from the LORD out of Heaven, Genesis 19.24. I
need not present you with other like desolations of cities, towns, or
villages, wrought by Almighty God in the days of old.

This one chapter, and first chapter of this prophecy of Amos, yields unto us
plentiful proof for this point. Here have we seen desolation upon
desolation, not the shaking only, but the overthrow of four states; namely of
the Syrians, of the Philistines, of the Tyrians, and of the Edomites. In the
state of the Syrians, we have seen the ruins of the house of Hazael, and of
the palaces of Ben-hadad, and of Damascus, and of Bikeath-Aven, and of
Beth-eden, and of Aram, verse. 4.5. In the state of the Philistines we have
viewed the rubbish of Azzah, and the palaces thereof, of Ashdod also, of
Ashkelou, and of Ekron, verse. 7.8. In the state of the Tyrians, we have beheld
the wast done upon the proud (...) verse. 10. In the state of the Edomites, we
(...) considered the destruction of Teman, and Bozrah, verse. (...) which do
evidently and strongly proclaim unto us the truth of my propounded doctrine:
namely, that, It is not the greatness of a city, that can be a safeguard unto
it, if God his unappeasable (...) break out against it, for it is sins.

One use of this doctrine, is, to lesson us, that we put not any confidence in
any worldly help; but that so we use all good means of our defense, that
still we rely upon the LORD, for strength, and success thereby.

A second use, is, to put us in mind of the fearful punishments which God
lays upon (...) for sin. He devoureth their cities, throws down their
strong holds, and spares them not. Has God dealt thus with strong cities, and
shall poor villages escape?

If the secure worldling shall here object, that our days, are the days of
peace, that our King, is a King of peace, that peace is in all our ports, in
all our quarters, in all our dwelling places; and that therefore there is no
need to fear the subversion either of our cities, or of our villages: to such
I must answer in the Prophet Esaies words, chap. 48.22. There is Esai 57.21.
no peace to the wicked, says the LORD. No peace to the wicked. For though
God, the Romans 15.33.
God of peace, which Psalm. 46.9.
makes an end of war in all the world, and breaks the bow, and knappeth
the spear asunder; and burns the chariots with fire, does now protect us
from foreign invasion, and hostility, yet being Amos 3.13.
Deus exercituum, a God of hosts, he has armies of another kind at command,
to work the sudden subversion, and overthrow of all our dwellings.

Hereof has God made good proof in these our days. To say nothing of his
arrow of pestilence, which is grandis terror mortalium, the great terror of
men, as being Deaths chief pursuivant and sumner, who in Job 18.14 is called
Rex Terrorum, the King of fears; to say nothing of this arrow, how it has for
these This Sermon was preached A. D. 1610. Ian. 13.
seven years roved up, and down, to marks far, and near, from city to
village, and from village to city, to the killing of many thousands of our
brethren and sisters, and yet is not put up into the quiver: to say nothing now
of this arrow, because it strikes men's persons, and spares their houses: will
you be pleased to look back upon those swellings of waters, which of late, A.
Chapter 1607.
within these four years, brake out into the bosom of the firm land in
diverse parts of this Realm? Then must you acknowledge with me, that God has
an army of waters, whereby at his pleasure he can overthrow our dwelling houses.

Beloved, I could here make report unto you from beyond the seas out of
Germany, of strange and marvailous inundations, deluges, and overflowings of
waters; how about A. C. 1595. Ianson. Gallobelg. Tom. 3. lib. 12. p. 172
this time fifteen years in the plains near unto Colen, Mentz, and
Franckford, by a sudden flood, non modo horrea, and stabula, nullo firmo nixa
fundamento, sed firmissima etiam aedificia, not only barnes and stables, which
had no firm foundation, but the surest and strongest edifices, and buildings,
were violently carried away.

I could tell you of much more harm of that years flood; how in Ianson ibid.
page 180.
Berenburg, a town upon the river Sala in the principality of Anhalt, Ibid.
p. 183.
Centu^ sexaginta aedes funditus eversae fuerunt; One hundred and threescore
houses were utterly overthrown.

But what need we go so far for examples of this kind, whereof Almighty
God has sent home unto us such plenty. Reflect we our eyes upon our own
harms; upon the harms done to many of our neighbors in the late
forementioned flood, to the overthrowing and breaking down See the Report of
floods in England An Ch 1607.
of whole towns and villages, yea of See, Woeful news of floods. C. 1. a.
26. parishes in one M^nmouth shire.
Shire, and we cannot but grant it for a truth, that God has his armies of
waters, whereby at his pleasure he can overthrow our dwelling houses.

But what is this to some of us, who are seated upon an hill, far enough from
any dangers by inundations, or overflowings of waters? Beloved in the LORD of
such mind were they of the old world, who did eat, and drink, and married
wives, and gave in marriage, unto the day that Noah went into the Arc. But
what bec^me of them? Our Savior Christ will tell you, Luke 17.27. The (...),
and destroyed them.

But God has made a covenant with man, and will remember it; That there shall
be no more waters of a flood, to destroy all flesh, Genesis 9.15. It is true:
there shall be no more waters of a flood to destroy all flesh; that is, there
shall be no more an universal flood, to cover the face of the whole earth:
there shall be no more generale diluviu^ invnd tus, and obruens vniversam
terram. But here is no exemption for particular cities, no not for particular
provinces, or countries.

Almighty God, who once did break up the fountains of the great deep, and
did open the windows of Heaven, Genesis 7.11. he is the same God still; Almighty
still; his arm is stretched out still. He can at his pleasure command the
clouds, and they shall pour forth abundance of waters, to the washing away of
our dwelling houses.

But say: he will not come against us with his army of waters: yet being Deus
exerci^^^, a God of boastes, he has armies of another kind at command, to
work the sudden subversion, and overthrow of all our dwellings.

I yet present you not, with lightning, with thunder, with winds, with
earthquakes, wherewith the LORD of Hoasts, the mighty one of Israel, has laid
wast, and made desolate many the habitations of sinful men: my text presents
you with fire; and let it suffice for this time.

Say, I beseech you, is it not a fearful thing, that instead of the fatness
of the clouds, of the greater and smaller rain, of the sweet dewes of heaven,
of comfortable shewers which God has engendered in the air, and divided by
pipes to fall upon the earth in their seasons; our grounds should be withered,
our fruits consumed, our temples, and our buildings resolved into cinders? yea
and sometimes our skins, and bones too, molten from our backs? Yet (beloved)
this sometimes comes to pass, when fire, one of the executioners of Gods
vengeance; is sent upon us for our sins.

What became of Sodom and Gomorah, and other cities of that plain? Were they
not turned into ashes by fire from the LORD? The story is known, Genesis 19.24.

But what need old stories to confirm so plain a matter; whereof we have
daily, and lamentable experience? Do not the grievous complaints of many of
our neighbors undone by fire, seeking from our charitable devotions some small
relief, make good proof hereof? Dearly beloved, learn we by their example
to cast away from us all our transgressions, whereby we have transgressed, and
to turn unto the LORD our God, lest delighting and treading in the wickedness
of their ways, we be made partakers also of their punishments. It is neither
care, nor policy, that can stay Gods revengeful hand, when he brings fire in
it.

To this purpose memorable is the example of a country man of ours, who in K.
Edwards days was a professor of the true religion; that religion, which by
Gods goodness we do this day profess. This man in the Fox, Martyrolog. page
1893.
Acts and Monuments of our Church is named A Smith dwelling at WELL in
Cambridge shire.
Richard Denton, and is there noted to have been an instructour of one Of
Wishich in the i will of Elie. Sometime Constable of WELL and dwelling there.
William Wolsey in the same his holy religion. Not long after in Queen Mary's
days, when fire, and faggot were the portion of true professors, Wolsey was
apprehended, and imprisoned. In time of his durance he sent commendations to
Denton his instructour, withal demanding by his messenger, why he tarried so
long after him, seeing he had been his first instructour in the Scriptures.
Dentons answer was, I cannot burn.

Cannot burn? You see his policy: he halted between God and man; he
dissembled the profession of his Christian faith, because forsooth he could not
burn. Well. Queen Mary's days were soon at an end; and God caused the light
of the Gospel to shine again under the peaceable government of Queen
Elizabeth. The did our dissembler think himself safe enough from any flame of
fire. But behold the haxd of God. His house was on fire; and he with two others
ventring to save some of his goods, perished in the flame. Thus you see policy
prevails not, when Gods revengefull hand brings fire with it.

And think you that c^re will help? What? Care against the LORD? Far be it
from us (beloved) so to think. Let us rather make our humble confession, with
king Nabuchodonosor, Dan. 4.31, 32. that the Most High lives for ever: that
his power is an everlasting power; and his kingdom from generation to
generation: that all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing to
him: that according to his will he works in the army of heaven, and in the
inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, nor say unto him; what
do thou? None can stay his hand.

This is it which before I noted: namely, that, It Is neither care nor policy,
that can stay Gods revengefull hand, when he brings fire in it: as here it is
threatened unto Rabbah: I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah. Thus far
by occasion of my first doctrine, which was, It is not the greatness of a city,
that can be a safeguard unto it, if Gods unappeasable wrath break out against
it, for its sins.

And it was grounded upon these words: I will kindle a fire in the wall of
Rabbah.

It Is further added of this fire, that it shall devour the palaces of Rabbah.
Which branch repeated in each of the precedent prophecies (as verse. 4, 7, 10,
12.) has formerly yielded us this doctrine.

God depriveth us of a great blessing, when he takes from us our dwelling
houses. This truth is experime^tally made good unto us, by the great commodity,
or co^tentment, that comes to every one of us by our dwelling houses. The use
whereof is, to teach us. 1. To be humbled before Almighty God, whenever it
shall please him by water, by fire, by wind, by lightning, by thu^der, by
earthquakes, or otherwise, to overthrow our dwelling houses. 2. Since we
peaceably enjoy our dwelling houses, to use them for the furtherance of Gods
glory. 3. To render all hearty thanks unto Almighty God, for the comfortable
use we have of our dwelling houses. Thus far of the commination, or
denuntiation of judgment, as it is set down in general.

The special circumstances, whereby it is further notified, or illustrated, do
concern, partly the punishment, and partly the punished. Concerning the
punishment: it is full of terror, and speedy. First, full of terror, in these
words; With shouting in the day of battle.

With shouting] in classico, says Brentius: cum cl^ngore, says Drusius; that
is, with the sound, or noise of trumpets. The Septuagint do read (...), the
vulgar Latin, in ululatu: Mercer cum vociferatione; Gualter, cum clamore;
Calvin, cum clamore, vel Iubilo: that is: with a cry, with a great cry, with a
vociferatio^, with a shout, such as soldiers do make, when on a sudden they
surprise a city.

In the day of battell] in die belli. The like phrase we have, Psa. 78.9. where
it is said of the children of Ephraim, that being armed and shooting with the
bow, they turned back, in die belli, in the day of battle. David confesses,
Ps. 140.7. O LORD God the strength of my salvation, thou have coverd my head,
in die belli, in the day of battle. Salomo^ says, Pro. 21.31. The horse is
prepared in die^ belli, against the day of battle. So here the LORD threatens
against Rabbah, a shouting in die belli, in the day of battle.

This day of battle, is that day of war, and time of trouble, mentioned by
Job, chap. 38.23. We see now the purpose of our Prophet in using these words,
With shouting in the day of battle. It is to proclaim war against Rabbah
the chief city of the Ammonites, and consequently against their whole
kingdom. This proclamation is more plainly delivered, Ierem. 49.2. Behold the
days come says the LORD, that I will cause a noise of war to be heard in
Rabbah of the Ammonites: and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters
shall be burnt with fire. From this proclamation of war made by our prophet
Amos as in the Lords own words, saying; I will kindle a fire in the wall of
Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of
battle, we may take this lesson, God sends war upon a land for the sins
of a people.

For proof of this truth let us look into the word of truth. In the 26. of
Levitic. ver. 25. thus says the LORD unto Israel: If ye walk stubbornly
against me; and will not obey me, then I will send a sword upon you, that shall
avenge the quarrel of my covenant. And Ierem. 5.15. unto the house of Israel,
thus says the LORD; Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far. You hear
the LORD speaking in his own person, I will send, I will bring, as here, I will
kindle. Will you any other witness?

Then hear what Moses tells the Israelites, Deuteronomy. 28.49. The LORD shall
bring a nation upon you from far, from the end of the world, flying as an
Eagle: a nation, whose tongue thou shall not understand, a nation of a fierce
countenance, which will not regard the person of the old, nor have compassion
on the young: the same shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy
land, until thou be destroyed: and he shall leave thee neither wheat, nor wine,
nor oil, nor the increase of thy kine, nor the flocks of thy sheep, until
he have brought thee to naught. By this speech of Moses, we plainly see that
war, and all the evils of war, are from the LORD: that war is Cominaeus
Hist. lib. 1. cap. 3.
one of the accomplishments of Gods judgments, and that it is sent by God upon
a land for the sins of the people, as my doctrine goes. Let us now make some
use of it.

Is it true, beloved? Does God send war upon a land, for the sins of a
people? How then can we look, that the happy peace, which we now enjoy, should
be continued among us, since by our daily sinning we provoke Almighty God unto
displeasure?

Let the consideration hereof lead us to repentance. Repentance, the gift of
God, the joy of Angels, the salve of sins, the haven of sinners, let us
possess it in our hearts. The Angels of heaven need it not, because they sin
not: the Devils in Hell care not for it; for their judgment is sealed. It only
appertains to the sons of men; and therefore let us, the sons of me^,
possess it in our hearts: that is, let us truly, and unfeignedly, forsake our
old sins, and turn unto the LORD our God, so shall this blessed peace, and
all other good things be continued among us.

But if we will persist in our evil ways, not regarding what the LORD shall
speak unto us, either in his holy word, or by his faithful Ministers, we may
expect the portion of these Ammonites, that God should kindle a fire in our
Rabbahs, our best fenced cities, which shall devour the palaces thereof, with
shouting in the day of battle. Thus much of the terror of this judgment.
Now follows the speed in the next circumstance.

With a tempest in the day of the whirlewinde] Suiting hereto is the reading of
Mercer, cum tempestate in die turbinis: and that of Tremellius: cum procella in
die turbinis, with a storm, or tempest, in the day of the whirlewinde. Calvin
has, in turbine in di^ tempestatis: in a whirlewinde in a day of tempest:
Brentius, in turbine, and in die tempestatis; in a whirlewinde, and in a day of
tempest: Gualter, cum turbine in die tempestatis, with a whirlewinde in a day
of tempest. And this reading Drusius rather approves, then the former.

Take which you will; the meaning is one, and the same. Namely that the war,
here denounced to the Ammonites in the former clause, should come upon them,
tanquam turbo in die tempestatis, like unto a whirlewinde in a tempestuous, and
stormy day. Turbine nihil celerius: a whirlewinde comes suddenly, and with
speed; so was this war to come upon the children of Ammon. Thus have we the
meaning of our Prophet: let us now take a view of such doctrines, as may from
hence be taken for our further instruction.

First, whereas the punishment, here threatened to the Ammonites, is to come
upon them with a whirlewinde in a day of tempest, in a tempestuous, and stormy
day, we may learn, that, Storms, Tempests, Whirlewindes, and the like, are
the Lords creatures, ready at his command to be employed by him in the
avenging of his quarrel against sinners.

(...), the primary, and principal efficient cause of storms tempests,
whirlewindes, and the like, is God. God as he is the sole maker totius
vniversitatis rerum, of this world, and all that is in it; so is he also a most
free, and omnipotent ruler of the same. He alone is able to raise tempests, and
at his pleasure to allay them again. Who raised the storm, that endangered
the ship wherein Jonah was? was it not the LORD? Yes. For so it is written, Ion.
1.4. The LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty
tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. Neither was this
tempest ca^^^ed, till rebellious Jonah was cast out of the ship into the Sea,
(...) it appears, ver. 15.

Well therefore is it ^^^ll of the Psalmist, Psalm. 148.8. of fire, and hail,
and snow, and vapors, and stormy winds, that they execute Gods word; they
are all ready at his commandment, to execute, what he will have them to do.
Winds and tempests, they depend not upon chance, or blind fortune; but on the
sovereign power of the Almighty Creator. So true is my doctrine, Storms,
Tempests, Whirlewinds, and the like, are the Lords creatures, ready at his
command, to be employed by him in the avenging of his quarrel against sinners.

One use of it, is for our instruction. Whosoever he be, that walks by
land, or passes by sea, if winds, storms, or tempests do hinder his
purpose, or disquiet him in his enterprise* he must assign it to the
providence of Almighty God.

A second use serves for reproof of such, as are of opinion, that witches,
sorcerers, coniurers, and the Devil can Grynaeus in Ion. cap. 1.4 lect. 13.
pro libidine sua, at their pleasures, raise up tempests. It is nothing so.

Nothing so? Why then does S. Paul, Ephesians. 2.2. call the Devil, the prince,
that rules in the air? I answer, S. Paul calls the Devil, the Prince that
rules in the air, not because he ca^ at his pleasure raise te^pests, but
because he the^ does it, when God gives him license. I easily grant, that
witches, sorcerers and coniurers by the help of the Devil can raise storms
and tempests in the air, though K. James, Daemonolog. lib. 2. cap. 5. page 46.
not universally, yet in such a particular place, and prescribed bounds, as God
will permit them so to trouble.

Arch B. Abbot in Ion. lect. 3. page 51.
The Devil and his factours work their exploits only by limitation, and by
leave; for they depend upon the LORD; and as if they were tied in a chain,
they cannot exceed one hairs breadth of that which is granted unto them.
Witness the story of Job. The Devil could not raise a wind, to overthrow the
house, wherein Job's children were, but by leave from the LORD, as it
appears, Job. 1.12.

And this may be our comfort, that Satan, the Devil, that 1 Pet. 5.8.
roaring Lion, who walks about, seeking whom he may devour, has Esai 37.29.
a hook put into his nostrils, and a bridle in his lips, and is bound Iud. 6.
with everlasting ch^ines, so that he cannot hurt us, no not so much as by
raising of a tempest, unless Almighty God for our sins do let him loose.
Wherefore let us commend our selves wholly to the protection of the Almighty,
and he will Esai 49.2.
hide us under the shadow of his hand. For it is he only, that makes us to
dwell in safety. Thus much of my first doctrine.

Again, whereas the punishment here threatened to the Ammonites, was to come
upon them as a whirlwind in a tempestuous, or stormy day, that is, speedily,
we may from hence take this lesson.

The destruction of the wicked comes suddenly upon them. This truth is a
vowed by David, Psalm. 37.2. Where to persuade the godly not to fret, or he
grieved at the prosperity of the wicked, he brings this reason: They shall
soon be cut down like grass, and shall wither as the green herb: which in
other words, verse. 20. of the same Psalm, he thus delivers: They shall
perish, and shall he consumed, as the fat of lambs; even with the smoke
shall they consume away. They shall be consumed at the fat of lambs:] there is
utter destruction for them; they shall be consumed as smoake] there is the
suddenness of their destruction.

The state of the wicked is very ticklish, and uncertain. For as it is, Psalm.
73.18. God has set them in slipperie places, and casts them down into
desolation. Their end is there described to be wonderful, sudden, and
fearful; Quomodo vastabuntur? Subito deficient, consumentur terroribus. How
shall they be destroyed? They shall quickly perish, they shall be consumed with
terrors.

Solomon speaks to this purpose, as plainly as may be, Prove. 6.15. The
destruction of the wicked shall come speedily: he shall be destroyed suddenly
without recoverie. He shall be destroyed suddenly without recoverie] that is,
to speak in my prophets phrase, He shall be destroyed, as if he were carried
away with a whirlewind in a tempestuous, and stormy day: or in Solomon's phrase,
Prove. 1.27. Their destruction shall come like a whirlewind.

The (...) in this point. (...) this, which has (...) ^ay se^ne for the
^stabl^shment of my propo^^ (...) ^^ine, that, The (...) of (...) wicked (...)
suddenly upon them.

One use of this doctrine is, to admonish us, that we give all diligence, to
walk in the LORDS ^ay, the sanctified and holy way, the way of perfection,
that we be not reputed among the wicked, and so partake with them in the
s^^lenesse of their downefalls.

A second use is to minister a word of comfort. Do the wicked prosper, and
increase in riches? Is pride a chain unto them* Is cruelty their garment? Do
their eyes stand out for fatness? Have they more then heart can wish? Art thou
mean while in trouble? Art thou in want? Do they oppress thee? Do they
wrong thee? Yet be of good comfort. Say not, I have cleansed my heart in
vain, in vain have I washed my hands in innocence: but co^^^^ thy way unto
the LORD, trust in (...), wait patiently upon him: ye^ a (...) while, and the
wicked shall not appear: thou (...) book (...) his place, and ^^alt not f^^de
(...) For sudden destruction shall befall him, he shall be carried away as with
a whirlewind in a ^^^pos^uous and stormy day. Thus much of the 14. verse.

IN my last lecture, I began the exposition of the fourth part: the
commination, or denunciation of judgment: and then I noted, that this
judgment was set down, first in a generality: Therefore will I kindle a
fire, etc. verse. 14. and secondly with some circumstances, as that it should be
full of terror, and speedy, and of large extent.

Full of terror: With shouting in the day of battle.

Speedy: With a tempest in the day of the whirlewind.

Of large extent. For it was to reach unto, not only, the meaner sort of
people, but to the nobles also, yea unto the King himself, verse 15. Their
king shall go into captivity, he, and his Princes together. Of this
judgment, as it is delivered in a generality, as also of the terror, and
speediness of it, I discoursed in my last exercise. The extent was left
untouched; whereof at this time.

Their King shall go into captivity; he, and his Princes together] King and
Princes, both, must into captivity. What shall become of the Priests? They
shall be carried away too. The Septuagint in their translation do expressly
affirm it, (...); the Kings of Ammon shall go into captivity, and (...)
their priests, and (...) their princes. Their King shall go into captivity,
their priests, (...) ^od this the Prophet ^^^^mie precisely (...) where
thun^ring in^^^t the threats of (...) the children of (...), he says: Their
King (...) go into captivity, and his priests, and his princes likewise.

The vulgar Latin, and S. Hierome, for their King, do read Melchom. Melchom
shall go into captivity, And what is Melchom? It is the same with Milchom,
with Molech, with Moloch. Diverse words, of one signification; though
differing in sound, and termination.

Be it Melchom, or Milchom, or Molech, or Moloch; all is one. It Is but an
Idol. So it is called by the author of the vulgar Latin, Levit. 18.21. De
semine tuo non dabis, vt consecretur Idolo Moloch. Thou shall not give thy
children, to consecrat them, to offer them to the Idol^ Moloch. It is the (...)
of the Ammonites. So it is called, 1. King. 11.5. where it is said of o^^
Solomon, perverted by his wives, that he followed M^lchom the abomination of
the Ammo^^^^* and ver^ (...) an high place (...) Moloch, the (...) of the (...)
of Ammon. It is the God of the children of A^^^. So it is called, verse. 3.3.
where it is given for ^^^a^on, why the (...) would rent from Solomon the
kingdom of Israel, because he forsook the LORD and worshipped Milchom, the
God of the Ammonites.

You see what Melchom is. It is the God of the Ammonites; not the true God; for
he is the God of all the world; but the God of the Ammonites; an abomination,
an Idol.

Yet did they worship it. But how? Moses tells you, Deuteronomy. 12.31. They burnt
their sons and daughters with fire, and offered them to their Gods. This
abomination of the Painyme nations, hateful to the living God, spread it
self, even to the corrupting of the Lords people. For to the children of
Israel, and to the children of Judah, it is objected, Ier. 32.35. That they
built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of Ben-hinnom, to cause
their sons, and their daughters to pass through the fire of Molech. And the
expostulation of God with the house of Israel, Ezech. 20.30. lays this home
unto them: Are ye not polluted after the manner of your fathers? Commit ye
not whoredom after their abominations? For when you offer your gifts, and make
your sons to pass through the fire, you pollute your selves with your Idols.

It is registered among the praises of good king Josiah, 2. King. 23.10. that he
defiled (or put down, and destroyed) Topheth, which was in the valley of the
children of Hinnom, that no man should make his son, or his daughter, pass
through the fire of Molech.

By this which has been spoken, you see what Melchom is and how it was
worshipped. An Idole-God worshipped with the effusion of the blood of
innocents; men's sons and daughters were consecrated unto it through fire.

So have you two readings of my text: one, Their king shall go into captivity,
he, and his Princes together: the other, Melchom shall go into captivity, etc.
Let us now see, what profitable doctrines may be taken from either, for our
further instruction, and the reformation of our lives.

The first reading is according to the Hebrew, Their king shall go into
captivity, he, and his Princes together: according to the Septuagint, Their
king shall go into captivity, their Priests, and Princes likewise. The doctrine
arising hence is, When God punishes a nation with captivity for their sins,
he spares neither Priest, nor Prince, nor King.

That captivity is an effect, or punishment of sin, I have heretofore made
plain unto you, in my 11. Lecture upon this first chapter of Amos. Solomon
says it, 1. King. 8 46. When a people sins against the LORD, and the LORD
is angry with them, the LORD delivers them up to be carried away prisoners
into the la^d of their enemies. It is affirmed, 1. Chron. 9.1. That the
Israelites were carried away to Babylon for their transgressions. And Deuteronomy.
28.41. among the curses threatened to such, as will not obey the voice of the
LORD their God, Captivity is reckoned. Thou shall beget sons, and daughters,
but shall not have them: for they shall go into captivity. Look back but to
the fifth verse of this chapter: there shall you find it denounced against the
people of (...) And why (...) their three and four tran^, (...) and specially
for ^hre^^^g (...) ^^^^shing inst^^^^ of (...) as you have heard out of the
third verse. Thus you see again that captivity is an (...) or punishment of
sin.

This punishment rests not upon the meane^ sor^ of the people, it ^eacheth to
the highest (...) the Priests, to the Princes, to the King himself. Of
Priests, and Princes, c^ryed away into captivity, you will make no doubt, when
you see the feign proved of Kings. Yet may you know, by 2. King. 17.27. that
the king of Assyri^, when he had vanquished Hoseah, king of Israel, did carry
into captivity the priests of Israel.

You understand of Priests ^^^ied into captivity: see now the like of Kings,
and Princes See the 2 King. 24.14. It is a very eminent place. There it is
affirmed of Nabuchodonosor King of B^b^l, that (...) all Jerusalem, and all the
princes, and all the (...) captivity; and in the verse following, that he
carried (...) king Ioh^iachim ( king of Judah) into Bab^l, (...) this king (...)
this kings wives, and this (...), and the ^^^gb^y of the land (...) he away
into captivity from Jerusalem (...) And all the (...) of (...) even seven
thousand, and ^^pe^^^ers, and lockesmithes a thousand, all that were strong,
(...) did the king of Babel bring to Babel captives.

I could tell you of the like misery befallen other kings of Judah; of king
Manasseh. ^. Chro. 33.11. how he was taken by the ^^ast of the king Asshur,
(...) in f^r^^ris, was ^^^^d in chains, and was carried to Babel. And of king
Z^dekiah, 2. King. 25.5. how he was taken in the deserts of Jericho by the
army of the Chaldees, had his eyes put out, was bound in chains, and carried
unto Babel.

But what need I amplify this point? By the places already brought you see my
doctrine established: namely, When God punishes a nation with captivity for
their sins, he spares neither Priest, nor Prince, nor King.

Is it true, beloved? Does God punish a nation with captivity for their sins?
Let us make this Christian use of it, ^^en to pour out our souls in
thankfulness before Almighty God, for his wonderful patience toward us. The
sins of such nations, as have been punished with captivity, were they more
heinous in Gods eyes, then ours are? Dearly beloved, far be it from us to
justify our selves. Let the example of the proud Pharisee be a warning to us.
He for all his smoothe prayer registered, Luke 18.^1. O God I thank thee that I
am not as other me^; extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this
Publicane: I fast twice in the week, I give tithe of all, that ever I
possess:] for all this his smooth prayer, he found no favor with God. No
marvel. For his heart was swollen with pride: with pride toward God, toward
his neighbor, and in himself.

Gratias ago, O God I thank thee] there was his pride toward God: Non sum
sicut cateri, I am not as other men] there was his pride toward his neighbor:
Ieiuno his in sabbato, I fast twice in the weeke] there was his pride in
himself. O God I thank thee] He is not reprehended for giving thanks to God,
but for his proud, and presumptuous boasting of himself.

The great Patriarch Abraham prays leave to speak unto the LORD, and gives a
reason of his request, Genesis 18.27. I am but dust, and ashes: so lowly was
Abraham conceited of himself, when he was to speak to God. But this Pharisee
puffed up, and swollen with pride, boasts as though he were not made of the
same mould with other men: O God I thank thee I am not as other men, etc. But
leave we the Pharisee in his pride: he is not to be a pattern of imitation for
us.

The Publicane is he, whom we must follow. Gerit typum omnium poenit entium:
all, that will truly repent, must take him for an ensample. He stood a far
of, would not lift up so much as his eyes to Heaven, smote his breast, and
said, O God be merciful to me a sinner. He stood a far of I B. King in Ion.

not daring to approach to God, that God might approach to him. He would not
lift up his eyes to Heaven] for he knew heaven to be the seat of that Majesty,
which by sinning he had provoked unto displeasure. He smote his breast] as the
arc of all iniquity; as it were punishing himself, (...) to punish him. And
(...) hear, and trembling tong^^; he called up (...), and find, O God be

This Publican^ is set for a (...) unto us. We must with him confess our

himself, and he died a miserable death, cons^^ed of worms, ^. Match. 9.9.
Herod^ Agrippa exalted himself, and the Angel of the LORD smote him; so was
he also eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost, Act. 12.23. It is out of all
controversy; Omnis, qui se exaltat, humiliabitur: every one, that exalt^^^
himself, shall be brought low.

Let the consideration hereof (beloved) work in us a vigilancie to keep the
proud Devil under, that we swell not up through a vain persuasion of fleshly
righteousness, that we lift not up our Peacocks feathers, nor extol our eye
lids, through a conceit of our own deserts, but in all humility pray we ever
with the Publicane; O God be merciful unto us sinners; and ascribe we unto him
all laud, and praise, for suffering us (notwithstanding our manifold sins)
every man to dwell 1. King 4.25
under his vine, and under his figgetree, to live in our own land in peace,
free from all fear of being led into captivity. Thus much of my first use.

A second follows. My doctrine was, When God punishes a nation with
captivity for their sins, he spares neither Priest, nor Prince, nor King.

Will you have a reason hereof? Hear then what Elihu says, Job 34.19. God
accepts not the persons of Princes, he regards not the rich, more then the
poor? He accepts no man's person says S. Paul, Gal. 2.6. No man's person?
Then neither the person of the Priest, nor of the Prince, nor of the King. If
these sin like others of the people, these shall be punished, as well as
others; and if others be carried into captivity, these must into captivity also.

The use of this doctrine is to admonish the great, and mighty ones of this
world, that they presume not to sin against the LORD, as if they were
privileged by their greatness, and might. No privilege can serve their turns,
when they must Job 21.20.
drink of the wrath of the Almighty. Then shall they be as Job 21.18.
stubble before the wind, and as the chafe, that the storm carries away.

Consider this all ye, who take your selves to be mighty among your
neighbors; ye, whom God has blessed with this worlds good above your
neighbors. Think not, your wealth or authority can protect you, when Gods
sore displeasure shall break out against you for your sins: but rather let
it ever be written in your hearts, what is written, Wisd. 6.6. The mighty shall
be mightily tormented. And remember what is added in that place: He that is
Lord over all, will spare no person, neither shall he fear any greatness: for he
has made the small, and the great, and cares for (...) the s^^or^^al. And
hence arises a (...) use.

It is to minister a word of comfort to the inferior, and poorer sort of
people. If the mighty shall Amos 2.6.
sell the righteous among you for silver, and the poor for shoes; if they Amos
2.7.
gape over your heads in the dust of the earth; if they Esai 3 15.
grind your faces; if by violence, and oppression they Habak. 1.4.
compass you about; yet be ye of good comfort: God, the judge of al,
accepts no persons. He in his good time will avenge your causes, be your
oppressors never so mighty; for when he punishes a land for the sins of a
people, he spares neither Priest, nor Prince, nor King.

There is a fourth use of this doctrine. It is to warn us not to set our
hearts upon the outward things of this world, for as much as God will not
respect us for them. Neither Priest, nor Prince, nor King, can stand before the
displeasure of Almighty God. And shall a mighty man, shall a rich man stand?
No. Psalm. 68.2.
As the smoke vanishes, so shall he be driven away; and as the wax melts
before the fire; so shall he perish at the presence of God.

Wherefore (dearly beloved in the LORD) let us only, and earnestly seek after
such things, as may make us accepted with God; as righteousness, peace, and
joy in the Holy Ghost. For whosoever in these things serves Christ, he is
acceptable to God. says S. Paul, Romans 14.18. Thus far by occasion of my
first doctrine: which was, When God punishes a nation with captivity for
their sins, he spares neither priest, nor prince, nor king.

And it was grounded upon the first reading of the words of my text; after the
Hebrew thus, Their King shall go into captivity, he, and his princes
together: after the Septuagint thus, Their Kings shall go into captivity,
their priests, and Princes likewise.

I commended unto you another reading out of the Vulgar Latin: Melchom shall
go into captivity, he, and his princes together: and I told you in the
beginning of this exercise what Melchom was. I said it was the same with
Milchom, or Molech, or Moloch; an abomination of the Ammonites, their Idol,
their God, to whom they yielded divine worship, and consecrated their children
through fire. All this I made plain unto you out of the sacred Scriptures. The
doctrine, Neither Melchom of the Ammonites, nor any other Idol of any other
people, can save themselves in the day of captivity, much less can they save
the people; that do trust in them, and worship them.

First, they cannot save themselves.

Secondly, nor them, that put their trust in them.

They cannot save themselves. For what is become of Succothbenoth the God of
Babel? of Nergal, the God of Cuth; of Ashima, the God of Hamath? of Nibhaz and
Tartack, the God of the Avims? of Adrammelach, and Anammelech, the God of
Sepharvaim? Their names indeed remain upon record, 2. King. 17.30, 31. but
themselves are vanished, they are come to naught. Hezekiah, King of Judah, he
who brake in pieces the brazen serpent, which Moses made, because his people
offered incense to it, he put down those Idol Gods; he took away their high
places, he brake their images, he cut down their groves, 2. King. 18.4.

What is become of Ashtoreth the Idol of the Zidonians? of Chemosh the Idol of
the Moabites? of Milchom the abomination of the children of Ammon? Their names
indeed remain upon record, 2. King. 23.13. but themselves are vanished, they
are come to naught. Josiah, King of Judah, that good King, he put down those
Idol Gods, he brake their images in pieces, he cut down their groves, and
filled their places with the bones of men, 2. King. 23.14.

I could here repeat unto you many other Idols and Idol Gods, whose names are
particularly recorded in the register of Gods holy word, which also are
vanished, and come to naught. But the time will not suffer me. Let it suffice,
what is spoken in a generality of the Kings of Assyria, 2. Kings, 19.18. that
they did set on fire the Gods of the nations.

Gods? And yet set on fire? True. But they were but Idol Gods; and therefore
could not help themselves. Not help themselves? Why not? The reason is given
in the same place: for they were no Gods, ((...) Idol God is no God) they were
no Gods, but the work of man's hands, even wood and stone: therefore the kings
of Assyria destroyed them. The very same reason is delivered in the very same
words, by the Prophet Esai, chap. 37.19. They were no Gods, but the work of
men's hands, even wood and stone, therefore the Kings of Assyria destroyed them.

The holy Prophets are very zealous in Gods cause against those Idols. Esai,
chapter 41.29 says, they are all vanity, their work is of nothing, they are
wind, they are confusion. Ierem. chap. 10.15. says, They are vanity, they are
the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish. I
should weary my self; and your attention, would I produce, whatsoever the
Prophets of the LORD have spoken, to the vi^ifying, and debasing of Idols. This
which I have already delivered out of Esai, and Jeremy and from out the second
book of Kings, does make good the former part of my propounded doctrine,
namely, that neither Melchom of the Ammonites, nor any other Idol of any other
people, can save themselves (...) the day of captivity.

Can they not save themselves in the day of captivity? much less can they
save the people that do trust in them, and worship them; which was the second
part of my doctrine.

And it is pregnantly confirmed out of the 46. chapter of the prophecy of
Esai, verse. 7. where the Prophet out of his zeal for the LORD of hoasts
against Idols and Images, assures all people, that though they cry unto Idols,
and Images, yet can they not answer them, nor deliver them out of their
tribulations. Jeremy likewise, chap. 11.12. lets the cities of Judah, and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem to understand, that though they cry unto their Idols
and Images, yet they shall not be able to help them, in time of their trouble.

Add hereto what S. Austine says in his soliloquies, or heavenly meditations,
chap. 5. An Idol (or an Image) it is 1. Cor. 8.4.
nothing; it has Psalm. 135.16, 17 and Psalm 115.5, 6, 7.
ears, and hears not; a nose, and smells not; eyes, and sees not; a
mouth, and speaks not; hands, and feels not; feet, and walks not; and
all the proportion of members, and yet lives not: and what help can be
expected from such an Idol? such a Nothing? My doctrine stands firm,

Neither Melchom of the Ammonites, nor any other Idol of any other people, can
save themselves in the day of captivity, much less can they save the people,
that do trust in them, and worship them.

Now let us see, what use we may make hereof for our further instruction, and
benefit.

First this doctrine serves to reprove all Papists, for their blind
superstition in worshipping their Idols and Images For what do they make of
their Images, but mere Idols, while they fall down before them, and do them
reverence with capping, with kneeling, with knocking, with creeping, with
crossing, with kissing, with lighting of candles, and with other like beggarly
trash, and trumperie, as is yet this day in use in the Church of Rome with
great observation?

The time was, when this Church of England subjected it self to that of Rome,
and was drunken with the wine of her fornication. Then were the people of this
land defiled with Idols. No Parish Church, but was polluted with Images. Then
was Gods providence, and due honor, neglected. For the cure of diseases, not
God, but Saints, were invocated, and sought unto. For the plague Rainold. Idol.
1 6 7.
S. Sebastian, for the pox Homilies Tom. 2. Sermon. 3. against peril of
Idolatry F. 8. b.
S. Roch, for the falling evil S. Cornelius, for sore eyes S. Raphael, for the
toothache S. Apolonia, for other crosses, and afflictions S. Hippolytus, S.
Christopher, S. Catherine. Every artificer, and profession had a special
Saint, as a peculiar God. Scholars had S. Nicbolas, yea and S. Gregory:
painters S. Luke, shipmen, S. Marie, Soldiers wanted not their Mars, nor
lovers their Venus, eve^ among us Christians. Yea our beasts, and cattle had
their Gods too. S. Loy was the horseleech, and S. Antome the swineheard. If
sometimes we remembered God, yet as if we doubted of his ability, and will to
help, we used to join to him another helper. The young scholar was wont to
begin his learning with; God, and S. Nicholas be my speed. For such as neezed
the prayer was: God help, and S. John. And for the stumbling horse, God, and
S. Loy save thee.

May not now a God^y man justly for zealous indignation cry out: O heaven, O
(...), O fea^ what madness and wickedness against God were our forefathers
fallen into? They took delight in the service of stocks, and stones, the
works of their own hands: they worshipped, and served the creature above the
Creator, which is blessed for ever.

But what profit had they of such their worship? Found they any help in the
day of visitatio^? No. Those Images themselves could not help themselves; and
how then could they help their worshippers? Themselves were broken down, and
removed from out our churches; and their worshippers are removed with them. In
their steed the light of the glorious gospel of God now shines in our
churches; now is superstition exiled, and the true service of God is come in
place: and Christ for his mercies sake touch us, and give us feeling, and make
us thankful for this so great a blessing. Thus have you the first use. A second
follows.

It serves for a reproof to us also. For though we have cast of the yoke of
Romish superstition, and have kept our selves unspotted of the adoration, and
worship of Images, yet are we not free from Idolatry; but are many ways
stained therewith. Whatsoever this world has, visible or invisible, outward or
inward, if it displace God of his right, by carrying our heart, and hope after
it, it is our Idol.

Thus is gold, silver, or our money an Idol; if we make it, our hope, or say to
the wedge, thou art my confidence, Job. 31.24. In this sense S. Paul, Coloss.
3.5. calls covetousnes, Idolatry, and Ephesians. 5.5. he calls the covetous
person an Idolater.

Thus is our substance an Idol: if as Job speaks, chap. 31.25. We rejoice,
because it is great, or because our hand has gotten much. Like those, Habak.
1.16. Who did sacrifice to their nets, and burn incense to their flues: where
all they are taxed for Idolaters, who because their portion is increased, and
their meal plenteous by such instruments, and helps, as they use in their
trades of life, do forget the right author of their wealth, and arrogate all
to themselves, and their serviceable means.

Thus is our wit, and understanding an Idol, when we ascribe unto the^, our
getting of riches, of gold, and silver into our treasures, like the prince of
Tyrus, Ezech. 28.2. who with this conceit exalted in heart, brake out into
that most blasphemous challenge: I am a God, and I sit in the seat of God in
the midst of the sea. Such is the Idol of the Politicians (shall I call them?
or Atheists) of this age: who take themselves to be wiser then Daniel, as the
prince of Tyrus did: and are persuaded that Moses, and the Prophets, are not so
able to instruct them, as they themselves.

Thus is our strength an Idol, if we boast of it, as Sennacherib did, Esai.
37.24. who bragged what great matters he had done by the multitude of his
chariots; but touching the true LORD of hoasts, as if he were less then
nothing, he vau^teth to Hezekiah, king of Judah, verse. 10. Let not thy God
deceive thee.

Thus is our belly our God, when walking after the lusts of our flesh, we serve
not the LORD Jesus Christ, but our own bellies: as S. Paul speaks, Romans
16.18. Of such speaks the same Apostle, Philip. 3.19. Many do walk, as
enemies to the cross of Christ, whose end is damnation, whose God is their
belly, whose glory is their shame, who mind earthly things. Whose God is their
belly.

Thus (beloved) you see what Idols are yet remaining among us, and how we are
defiled with them. What remains, but that we suffer our selves to be exhorted
in the words of Barnab^s, and Paul, to the men of Lystra, Act. 14.15. that we
would turn (...), from those vain Idols, to serve the living God.

Thus far of my second doctrine, which was, Neither Melchom of the Ammonites,
nor any other Idol of any other people can save themselves in the day of
captivity, much less can they save the people, that do trust in them, and
worship them.

Which doctrine I grounded upon the second reading of my text: Melchom shall go
into captivity, he, and his princes together.

Now follows the third general part of this prophecy against the children
of Ammon, (...) Says the LORD.

This is the conclusion of this prophecy; and in redoubleth it is authority,
and credit. Authority and credit sufficient it has from it is very front, and
preface, verse. 13. Thus says the LORD. It is here redoubled: Says the LORD.

Has the LORD said it, and shall he not do it? Has he spoken it, and shall he
not accomplish it? The LORD, JEHOVAH, the strength of Israel is not as man,
that he should lie, nor as the son of man, that he should repent. All his
words, yea all the titles of all his words, are Yea and Amen. Heaven and earth
shall pass, before one jot, or one title of Gods word shall escape
unfulfilled. JEHOVAH, the LORD says, whatsoever our Prophet Amos has here
denounced against the Ammonites. It is the LORD that says it: Amos is but the
LORDS Minister; the words are the LORDS. Whence we may take this doctrine, The
author of holy Scripture, is neither man, nor Angel, nor any other creature,
how excellent soever, but only the living and immortal God.

This truth may likewise be grounded upon the preface to the ensuing prophecy:
And therefore (since my hour is almost spent, and your attention welnigh tired,)
I put of the handling of this doctrine, till God give me opportunity to speak
again unto you. Mean time, let this which has been delivered unto you, non
meis viribus, sed Christi misericordia, not by any strength of mine, but by the
mercy of our LORD Jesus Christ, serve for the exposition of this first chapter.

1. Tim. 1.17. Unto the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise
God, three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, be honor, and glory, for
ever, and ever. Amen.
