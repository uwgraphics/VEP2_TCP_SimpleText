I Hard a voice from heaven says saynct John sayng.

Blessed are the dead that dye in the Lord, for they from hens forth shall
rest from their labors, and their works follows them (...). 31.
Favor is dysseitfull, and bewtye is a vain thing, but a womman that
fearythe the Lord, she is worthy to be praised. (...) (...)
tha^ ^n this life (...) lyu^ here,
who fautes have few, or full of crym
in the same kind, they do apper^
and dyinge well, this is sertayn^
to ill they cannot, turn again.
Therefore ye end, does well declar^
who do Immeryt, to have praise
and also those, that vertouse are
which walked still, in godly ways
for as they dye, so shall the rise
this is the saying, of the wise.
If our fathers, deserved fame
for that they hated, virtuous foe
doubtless good women, do the same
if in their paths, like wise the go
amongst which holiest, that are go^ne
I cou^pte Darothye (Wynnes) for one
^
and ta^y^^ here, a tym^ and space
that now is spent, and she is gonne.
whose Corpus is laid, in the grave
^ this world, unworthy to have
For as the Lord first, gave her life
^o rated also, was her race
^ when death came, which endith strife
she yeldyde straight, unto him place
as one full fyxed, in her mind
after this life, much joy to find
Thus is she dead, to live again
in that life, that lasts ever
high in the heuens, where is no pain
amongst the holy, saynctes together
happy therefore, was her good channce
whom God of heaven, does so aduaince.
Though she now, be carried hen^^
and clotes of claye, closed out of sigh^^
cease shall I not, my diligence
for to set forth, this worthy wighte
whose body thuogh, hit lie obscure
yet shall her Fame, always induer^
In worstershere, there, did she dw^^^
the town to name, is called Droitewich
whose virtuous, did so much excel
now she is gone, their lives non such
for this I dare, be bold to say
A Phenyxe she was, in that country.
Give ear my friends, and herke^ more
of this meke Matrone, I discriue
for whom good people, much deplore
whose pere is few, in earth alive
and though this world, did her a noy^
yet wone she has, now lasting joy.
Gods word she did, truly profess
those life accordid, with the same
^^erfore all men, can say no leasse
^^t she deserves, eternal fame
and there to think her, well worthy
^mongest the saints, numbered to be
(...) ^^gement she was, full up right
and heryses, clean did detest
^^e hild on Christ, the God of might
^is parfict way, still coumptinge best
^^ough death therefore, did her assail
^et could hit not, her heart once quayle
When papists did her much deride,
^et would she not, to them incline
(...) follow such, that wanderyd wide
^orsakinge christ's, precepts deuyne
^er unto ever, she did stand
(...) would not byld, upon the sand.
For after she christ's word, once knew
(...) papists church, she never came
^
a^^ ^^^ed was, what ever did fall
never to bow, her knees to Baal
Therefore full many: a sharp show
she did sustain, in Maryes days
when tyrants would: with force procu^^
her for to walk: in Romyshe ways
yet might they not: her once remove
so fervent was, to God her love.
She with her house, one God did cri^
thryse every day, with great desire
that he would of, his own mercy
onse again, yet quench the fye^
whose voice he hard, and did the sa^^
even for the glory, of his name.
A myrrour and mother, of godlin^^^^
she was in bringinge, up of youth
her childrens lives, do it express
of whose bereft, they may have ruth
her (...)
^
for her womanlye, shamfastnes
^^r perfect chaste, and puer life
faithful lyppes, cane hit express
those that knew her, maid and wife
^^ose Fragra^t, name declares nolesse
^^ecyous oyntmentes, much to pass.
All idelnes, she did abhore
^^d loved well, good excersyse
^^r works God bleast, and sent her store
which truth imbraste, and hated lies
^erfore of her, may by this brute
^e as the tree, such is the fruit
Her care was most, to help the poor.
^here in she did, right fare excel
(...)alms that was, daily at her door
^^e people their, did know full well
God they cry, daily therefore
^end them now, such frindes in store.
^
sainge she would come, to beggarye
but yet the Lord, that saw the deed
did always help her, in her neade
How many syke, she did releaue
great marvel were it, now to tell
and what to prisoners, she did give
all that country, she did presel
she loved so, Christ's members here
that nothing was, for them to dear
Abhore she did, to have excess
and porcyon, to eat alone
but gave there of, the Fatherles
as one fulll of, Compassion
therefore the scriptures, does witness
her soul shall never, feel darkness.
Her mouth to wisdom, opened she
her Langwage was, the law of grace
her (...)
^
yet here is fruits, of gods elect
Now when ye christ, in her last days
did vysyt her: with much syknes
and proved her faith, sunderye ways
to make her to, his own lyknes
she past not then, for aney loss
but meklye with Christ: kyste the cross.
Her sycknes did, continewe long
like unto Iobes, or Tymothee
yet in her passions, spalmes she song
where in she had, felycyte
which tokened, she was christ's own
in whom such paciens, he had sown
Her heart was, infatigable
through faith which she: stayed upon
that nether welthe: nor pain was able
her to remove, from Sion stonne.
but still in faith, endured she
as one the, Inuysyble see.
From tope to toe, she felt great pain
as Lazerous, that blessed man
which she full meklye, did sustain
although her friends, forsook her than
with out all, mourmuration
agenste Gods sweet, correction.
And as Christ's great Ignomyne
did harden still, the Jews mind
so did her sharp, aduersytye
move the wicked, fautes to find
thynkinge her accurssed to be
when yet with God, most blessed was she
For this her self, persuade she did
yt though God here, her Faith did try
yet at the last he would her rydde
and bring her to felycytye.
where she is now, I dare well say
in everlasting, myrthe and Joy
If that Marie Chose, the best part
which Christ bad keep, in memory
saying from the same, she did not starte
her Fame therefore, shall never dye
amongst the Blessed, Femynyne
though the wicked, there at repyne.
If Dorcas, lyberallyte
be left in writing, to her praise
then is this worthy, that degree
that ever walked, in her ways
for to the poor, she was alone
none such I know, now she is gone
If that Lydda, Comendyd be
for Joy she had, of holy men
this bi^g grafte, of the same tree
should we now cease, to praise her than
in whom such grace, there did abound
that few her like, can now be found
Her (...)
(...), take he^e^
behold and look well, in thi^ Gra^^
which I present, here unto you
Oh follow her, and do the same
and God will give you, praise and fame
As she thus has, played her part
and now rests in Gods own hand
so death will stryke us, with his darte
whose power no flesh, can with stand
God garunt therefore: to each degree
so happy in life, and death to be.
Well I do hope, that she shall onse
though line of life, be now out raste
rise and reuyue, both flesh and bones
and so in heaven, with Christ be plaste
thus leave I her, in lasting Joys
and for the same, give God the praise.
Amen.
