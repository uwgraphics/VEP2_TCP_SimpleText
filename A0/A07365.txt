THE XII. WONDERS OF THE WORLD.

Set and composed for the Violl de Gambo, the Lute, and the Voice to Sing the
Verse, all three jointly, and none several: also Lessons for the Lute and Base
Violl to play alone: with some Lessons to play Lyra-wayes alone, or if you
will, to fill up the parts, with another Violl set Lute-way.

Newly composed by John Maynard, Lutenist at the most famous School of St.
Iulians in Hartfordshire.

Eight parts in one upon one Plaine-song, begin and end where you will, so as
you do come in a Semibriefe one after another.
Oh follow me Tom John and Wilcok three knaves in A knott follow me hooe

TO HIS EVER-HONOVRED LADY AND MISTRESS the Lady Ioane Thynne, of Cause-Castle
in Shropshire, Nestors years on earth, and Angels happiness in Heaven.
Madame.
WHat at first privately was intended for you, is at last publickely commended
to you. This poor play-worke of mine, had its prime original and
birth-wrights in your own house, when by nearer service I was obliged yours. I
am humbly-bould to present it to your Ladyships view and protection (if you
will daigne to make happy by your Patronage so mean a work) both for your
well known love to the Science, and your many many favors conferred upon my
undeserving self, the lover and admirer of your Virtues. The powrefull
persuasion of that nobly-disposed Gentlewoman Mrs. Dorothy Thynne, your
virtuous Daughter, whose breast is possessed with an admirable hereditary love of
Music, and who once labored me to that effect, has not a little emboldned
me hereunto. If there live any good thing in me, only your Onely-Selfe is
firstly interessed in the same, I being doubly bound, by your bounty on the
one side, and my duty on the other. Accept then, Gracious Lady, with
vnwrinkled brow, the affectionate, though weak deuoyre of him that strongly
desires to do you service. I know it is not able Eagle-like to look with an
undaunted eye against the brightfull Sun of your matchless judgment;
wherein notwithstanding, if your Clemency shall allow it ^^^uourable room, I
fear not the vnequallest front of the sowrest Critic.

Thus lowly-laying both it and my self, the worthless Author at your
Worships service, I beseech Him that is the Giver of all things, to grant
unto you, and your virtuous Daughters, a full confluence of united Happiness
here, and glory eternal hereafter.

Your Ladyships in all humble service John Maynard.

A Wonder. The Courtier. I
CANTVS.
^ LOng, long have I liude in Court, yet ^ ^ learned not all this while, To
sell poor suitors smoke, nor where I hate to smile: ^ ^ Superiors to adore,
