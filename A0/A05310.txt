the mynisters and hedes thereof, to whom we have given great co^fydence, and
specially to their profane Cerymonyes, decres, tradycyons, fantasyes, and
dremes, engendered and spionge up by the usurped head thereof, very Antecrystes
bysshoppes of Rome, which many years has been called popes as in this present

The first part and dyfference of this book.
FFyrst ye shall understand how the church of Rome / was first infecte with
treasure and possessions. As first by the Emperor Constantyne / the great and
his successors? Pepyne / Charlemayn / lowys de bonere. And by diverse other
princes. How be it it was engendered / and gadred / under the shadow of
polecy, through feigned holiness. Whereof sprang great infexions, and thereby
was ingend^ed many wicked children / as Pride, Pomp, Arrogansy, Herisy,
Auctoryte of Kings, and Princes, suppressynge subjects with great tyranny /
without mercy, shame or pety, after y^ which things there followed great
abusyons and debates, in cou^ceylles generalles. And thus of all these foresaid
iniquites engendered great sysmes and diuysions, seperacyons, and impedymentes,
with percyalytes, among christen Regyons whereof sprange great euylles,
trybulacyons inco^uenyences, persecutyons, through all chryste^dom. And thus
through these enormytes, and Inco^uenyences, it was expedyent for diverse
Kings, and Princes to assemble diverse councelles and congregacyons of wise
and prudent persons, and faithful christen Rulers, and gouerners, the which
counceles does more plainly appear in the first part of this present book and
specially in the.vii. first sysmes.

Of the first sysme and deuysyon / that began in the church of Rome, with
persecucyons and deuysyons, that arose through the possessions that constantyne
the emperor gave to the Bishop of Rome Syluester and his successors.
IT is a comune experience / and dayle seen and hard / that none evil is
engendered but through some evil and malyuolent person / as it appeared plainly
by one Nouatus an heritike priest and cardynall of Rome / which was y^ first ye
inuiolated ye church of Rome through his detestable abusio^s and ypocrysy for
he pretended none other / but to obtain y^ dignyte of the sea of rome under
his feigned holiness / that was through Rygore, and ambysyon. Thus under his
false and subtle pretense was raised up two anty papis against the holy
bishop saint Cornelis / the one was y^ said Noua^us at rome: the other
nicostratus in africa / and so was expulsed the said Nouatus, from y^
knowledge of the church of Rome / and named him self (vnmaculat clean without
spot) and al his diciples and thus they a bode in their appostasy / as men that
denied the faith catholyke / and not worthy to come again to the cryste^
Relygyon according as Christ's dycyples did preach and teach the Gospel. For
the which error it was thought expedyent to assemble a counsel in Rome
of.40. Bysshoppes, In the which cou^ceyl the said Nouatus was condemned /
which was the first counceyll that was assembled in the church of Rome / except
in the prymatyue church by the Appostles, and Discyples, of Christ. Thus
abode Cornelis a Romayn in y^ see bishop suffryng great tribulacions and
persecucyons / through the sysmes of the two foresaid antypapes / n^uatus and
Nycostratus cardynalles / and perforse put Cornelius to exyle / and so
afterward he was put to y^ Crown of marterdome under the tyrant Decyus
emperor and he rayned bishop of Rome.ii. years and.iii. days and so he gave
his power and auctoryte to steven and thus the sea of Rome lived many years
after Christ's passion in great perfeccyon / symplyci^e and holiness replet
with grace and virtue / until the time that Co^sta^tyne poisoned holy
perfeccion with temporal possessions / which he gave then to the church of Rome
and so rayned after Cornelius / Fabyan the first the.xxi. bishop of Rome /
which cristened Phillip the first Emperor of y^ name of ye nacio^ of Arabye /
who began to raygne Anno dn^i.cc.xlvi. which when he dyed gave al his
treasours, and possessions, unto ye said Fabyan bishop of Rome / the which
Emperor dyed under Decius the Tyrant / and so because that Decius the tyrant
could not obtain King Phyllyppes, treasours which was given to Fabyan bishop
of Rome. Then Decyus caused great persecucyon through all the world among
christian people, which was ye.vii. persecucion after Nero the great tiraunt and
so in this persecucyon Fabyan was put to death by cruel martyrdom with the
first and the.xxi. martyr bishop of Rome / following Saint Peter / and under
y^ said decyus dyed martyrs, Sebastian, saint Agatha, Appolonia with many other
ye were innocent of the treasours that fabyane, had which was y^ special
cause of this cruel persecucyon of christ's flock.

And so this cruel tyranny contynewed many years by detyns and his successors
/ and so after Detyns successid Ualeryan gallus which began the.viii.
persecucion / under whom dyed Sextus bishop of rome the first of that name
(also) Laurens his deacon which distrybuted the goods of the church to the
pore according to y^ law of God also saint Ypolyt with diverse other martyrs
dyed under him. And after him Aurclianus emperor borne i^ Dalmace, the.xxxii.
emperor founder of Orleaunce in France. And y^ city of Geneue upon the lake
in sauoy / he persecuted the.ix. persecucion on Christ's flock or region
through cristendom to pytefull to suffer.

THe.x. persecucion was most cruely used through Dioclesian and Maximyan
Emperors borne in Dalmatiq^ which persecucyon endured.x. years, which
Dioclesyan caused him self to be honored like a God in kyssyng his fete as
popis of late days has use princes and christian rulers to do which was
abhomynable before God, and man, and this said Dioclesian persecuted over all the
Oriental parts of ye world and Maximian in likewise in y^ occident parts /
and tyranny upon christ's chosen children was so horrible and unmerciful like
bochers of bestes / that it was to exec^eble in the sight of all people /
impossyble for pen to wryt for in the space of a month in y^ pa^tes of England
and France was put to death.xvii. thousand christian people / in so much that y^
faith of christ was almost in England and france extynckit that no man durst
show him felfe a christian man for fere of death and tyranny / and all books of
Christ's faith brent that might be gotten / so after this cruel persecucyons
the devil enemy to al ma^kynd engendered many heresies as Sabellyans that
denied yt Ihesus Christ was not the sone of God and also ye herytykes called
Manekis put forth two questyons / one good y^ other evil / whereupon was gadred
a great counceyll in Antioch against Paul the samosetha^ bishop which denied
the virginite of the virgyne Mary mother of christ. In the which counceyll
and business was assembled.xviii. bysshoppes in the cite of senesse in the
country of naples.

All this persecucyon endured unto y^ time of Constantyne y^ great emperor in
which time was martyred and put to death for Christ's faith all these saints
Marcellyn, Marcell, Melchiades, bishops of Rome, Also Agnes, Anastase,
Barbara, Crispyn, and Crispian, Crystofer, Cosme, and Damyan, Kateryne, Luce,
marget, George, maximilia^, quintyn, Blase, Mauryce, Uincent, and many without
nombre whose names are written in the book of life.

Here follows the occasyon of the sismes and enormytyes that came of the
donacyon and gifts of Constantyne to the church of Rome.
THus have you hard how the fylthy treasours y^ Fabyan held Christ's church
/ was infected first with by the covetous mind of Fabyan bishop of Rome /
which held the treasours of Phyllyp king which dyed under Decyus the tyrant
/ which Decyus cruelly persecuted all crystendome for with holding the said
tresory of king Phyllyp / and so afterward the foresaid No^atus and Nycostratus
was proved false prophets and antipapes openly to their great rebukes and
shame by a general counceyll / and yet after this there ^ose again through
all Christ's church great dyscordes / trybulatyo^s / and persecucyo^s through
the infexions / pride and of arrogansy / ye arose in the church of Rome through
the treasours and gifts of co^stantyne and of his successors / where through
sprange.xxiii. great sysmes in contynuaunce i^ crystes church through these
possessions temporal abused.

Of constancius father of constantyne.
COnstantyne was sone to the daughter of claude. Emperor the second of his
name, and the said Constancius married Helene queen of England herefor to the
Crown of England / by whom was conceived and borne constantyne / the great /
the year of our Lord God.ccc.viii. which Constantyne was emperor of all the
occident parts and after ward emperor of all the world.

And thus after his great wars Cyuyle he being yet a pagan and a persecutor
of christian men / as his predecessors were / from the which tyranny God of
his wonderful works converted him to ye faith by Siluester bishop of Rome
which was fled and hyd him self for dred of death in mountens and woods.

Of Siluestre the first which tryumphed over the church mylyta^^t of Rome /
through great possessyon^ and treasours which the emp^rou^ Constantyne
enpoysoned (...) church first withal.
SIluester the.xxxiiii. bysh^p borne i^ Rome, was esteemed a man of holy life
which had great grace given to him in co^uertyng many to the faith, as
specylaly constantyne the great / by whose dylygence and preaching the said
syluester caused him to sease of his cruel tyranny upon christian people /
commanding (...) destroy all ydoles temples / and set up Crystes churches /
and so worshipped the cross and passion of christ over all the world
universal / to the great joy of all cryste^dome and straytly he commanded
that no persecucion should be done over christian men in no regyon / which was to
al crystendome a wonderful s^d ayne mutacyon and change y^ in a little while
before ye no man so hardy ye durst be known to be a christian man for fear of
persecucyo^ of death / in somoch they were hated over all / that no body would
suffer a cryste^ man (ones known) abyd i^ no place but lived in great dred and
in secret places.

Thus by the prouysyon of God syluestre was taken in like honor with kings
which was as many have opinion and say it was by the subtyl craft of the
devil / which is and ever was the auncyaunt ennemy of mankind which could
find none other poison to destroy the perfexion of holy bishops / which were
xxxii. that dyed holy martyrs for crystes faith before Syluester / and thus y^
devil supposing to have a great part of crystendome / through riches, power,
dignite, pride, and heresy, and sismes, ye should spring / and did in deed
afterward / unto this day experience leads us to much And some holds
opinion, and writes that at this tryumphe was herd a voice horrible in the
air saying / Hodie venenum i^ ecclesia semiau^, yet I can not assure this for
a truth but as some writers have written.

This noble Prince Constantyne in love and zelus mind to siluester / through
the wonderful suffraunce of God / and blinded with worldly vanytes, caused
Siluester the bishop to be clothed with purple sylkes and raiment imperyal
most like a King or a Prince in somoch he took his crown imperial and set it
on his head / yet notwithstanding Siluester with humble countenance would not
take it, but utterly refused it and would not use nor take upon him to were it /
but a simple myter of fustian / the which is yet used among the bishops and
cardinals of Rome to this day / notwithstanding though Siluester would not
take upon him the emperyall Crown yet the bishops of Rome of late days have
taken upon them vsurpacyon and hye auctoryte three crowns of gold facyoned hye
and sharp copped, rich with stones and perle as the box of a great lapydarye
oryental for truly it is to be wo^dered on such superfluyte to be worn on any
such holy persons / head for Christ our redemptour used no such vain glory /
for i^ this cause Platyne y^ great writer of stores master of the roulles in
Rome / whcihe mocketh this abusyo^ in y^ time of Adria^ y^ first which was
called paul y^ proud a venecyan / which gloryfy^d i^ him self in such like
rich apparel eue^ as a god in earth (and would so be called) among people in
earth i^ his arrogance and pride and thus would y^ said Paul use him self
gloryfyed every year of Iubely / before all y^ world and before y^ Pilgrims and
did use him to were y^ manner and facion raiment / of women in those days like
the customable weryng that Bishops did use, and yet moreover saint Austyn
says de verbis domini / in reproach of the arrogance and pride of popes /
which would be called Gods saying thus. (Qui vult videre deus cum sit homo
non imitatur illum qui cu^ deus esset pro illo factus est homo.)

Thus to proced of Siluester though he with holy and simple countenance
refused the rich crown emperyall of Constantyne / yet he would not refuse of
Constantyne ye great possessyon gifts and rentes y^ he gave with the hole
city of rome, which was no small possessyon as diverse writers makes mencyon,
as does Laurence valla the great orator.

This Syluester caused to assemble the first great general council at Nycene
and Bythena purposly against the herysies of Aryen which greatly increased,
whose errors was in the distynctions of the three persons in Trinite. And in
this cou^ceyl was present.xxxviii. Bysshoppes assembled,

Of the second scisme and dyuysion that was in y^ church of rome, shortly
after the donacion of Co^stantyne. And of the herysies that fell in this time
by the first pope heretykes, and shameful sysmatykes.
AFter the donacyon of Constantine followed two bisshoppes of Rome pesyble and
just men in their office without sysme or dyscorde among crystes flock / the
one was named Mark, the other July. In whose time y^ heresies of the Aryans
increased more and more, which turned the heart and mind of Constance the sone
of Constantyne y^ then rayned. And so he began the.xi. persecucyon upon christian
people. And put Julius in exyle out of rome, whose place succeeded Liberius, and
Felyce together, which enuyed each other, who should have the sea of Rome, so in
contynuau^ce Liberius y^ heretyke through the favor of Constans opteyned his
purpose to be bishop of Rome, And enjoyed the sea of Rome, the space of.xlii.
years and.vii. months and three days / notwithstanding he was noted to be the
first pope heretyke and sysmatyke. And supporter of the Aryans artycles,
through his abhomynable glorious dygnyte pleasyng the mind of the Emperor
Constantyne the younger infecte with the said heresies / which was the most
abhomynablest and cruel heresies y^ ever was, worse then the seckte of Maho^met
/ for the Priests Aryans persecuted other christian bishops and catholyke
people without pety, or mercy, in Affryque and Spain. Thus was Felyxe y^
bishop of Rome put to death i^ this persecucio^ / the.xiiii month of his
reygne / and after this rose other heresies called Donastytes which baptized
y^ criste^ again / as our late Anna baptystes used and as the enmonyans
heretykes ye said that Jesus Christ in his Godhede was not equal with God the
Father by dyuyne nature / but only by grace / and the massedonyas heretykes /
denied the holy Ghost to be equal with the Father, and the Sone, and thus
these heresies arose y^.xii. persecucyo^ through the commandment of Julian y^
appostata emperor that was first a criste^ man and after fell to Ydolatry /
which persecucyon arose by evil example and sismes / that he saw in Christ's
church.

Here follows ye.iii. sisme of ye church of Rome in which time Rome was
destroyed by ye gootes.
SHortly after the second sysme ye third followed / bytwe^ Bishop Damascus
borne in Spain and Ursysinus cardynall and deacon his ennemy / which was his
open chalenger / to battle in arms within the church wherthrough / were many
men slain one both parts, so inconclusyon Damascus overcame and vaynqueshed
vrsysyne y^ antipape / which was afterward content with the bysshoprycke of
naples.

Thus is apparent to all the world / what desolacyon and myschefe ensued upon
the possessions that was given to the bishops of^Rome by Co^stantyne and his
successors what with violence of war and persecucyon of tyranny upon christian
people, alas what pety was this to se ye see of Rome so pyteously brought i^
such a name by Damascus bishop / and this man was y^ first bishop of Rome
that enterpressed deeds of arms and war for his dignyte / yet
notwithstanding he is at this day acepted and taken for a holy glorious
confessou^ / yet was he accused for adultrye and this man was the first that
auctorysed saint Ieromes works and in his time Rome was taken / and destroyed
by Alarych King of gootes the which engendered great slander in the christian
church in somoch that y^ paynymes greatly reproched the christen relygyon for
such shamfull enormytes in somoche that many christian Kings and Princes
withdrewe the^ from seruinge of God / and so fell from y^ faith where upon
saint Austen compiled and wrote the book called (De ciuitate dei) and thus
through this sysme the devil ready to al myschefe engendered another sort of
heretykes called Pelagyans / whose opynyons was that man might meryt without
the grace and gift of God / and that no man should pass upon baptyme / for the
which error was assembled a cou^ceyl general in the cetye of Car^age and
there were assemble.cc.xviii. prelates where, as saint Austen was one of them
and sheued well his science virtue and learning.

Of the.iiii. sisme / and tribulacions befell in christ's church / and of y^
great counceylles against y^ great heresies that then raygned which co^tynewed
fyfte years.
THus between the third sysme and y^ fourth was but four pesyble bysshoppes
of Rome, which were Syryake Anastase first, Innocent y^ first / and zosynus
after whose death began the.iiii. sysme and deuisyon in the church / that is
to wet between Bonyface the first and eulalyus cardynall priest. The cause of
their dyuysyon was that y^ clarge ware departed in to two parts and sorts /
in the which time the Emperor Theodosius being at Mallan with his wife were
banyshed and shortly after Boniface was revoked again and so made bishop of
Rome only / after that unto y^ fyfte sysme began the heryses of Predestynacyo^
y^ which affyrmed y^ no person aueyled to do any good works but every person
to do his pleasure for god had predestynated every man to be saved and dampened
at his pleasure and in this season was assembled a counsel at Co^stantynople in
the time of gratia^ Emperor and theodose and damascus bishop of Rome against
the error of the macedonyans.

So following not long after was assembled y^ third great counceyll at Ephese,
by the commandment of Theodose before wryte^ and bishop Telestyn against y^
heresies of the Nestoryans / which held opinion / that the virgyn marye was not
mother to the sone of God and in this opinion was many countres sore infected
with / as France, Spain, Affrique, with many other small domynyons / in
which time Ursula and her company suffered death and martyrdom at Colone.

And in this season was assembled the iiii. general counceyll in Calsydonye in
Asia the less end / the which was assemble ccccc.xxx. bishops by y^ auctoryte
of bishop Leo the first of yt name / and Marsu^ then emperor This assemble
was to co^uicte the heryses of Eutycyanes abbot of Constantynople who held
opinion that Christ had taken humanyte upon himself and yt he had i^ him but
one nature that was pure dyuynyte / the which heryses was fordone by y^ said
counceyll / and shortly after began another sysme called Archefallyke / yt is
to wit without a head / which denied all Canons of the said counseyll.

And this time befell a great mischyfe in Rome that Anastasius then second
bishop of that name / borne in Rome became an herityke and was named the
second bishop abhomynable in Rome / for he favored the opynyons of yt
nestoryans as Lyberius bishop did before written took the opinyons of the Arians
and this Anastasius was the first that gave out curse upon any Emperor or
King, and in sin this cursed Bishop dyed full of misery, in somoch yt his
bowelles fell from him syttyng at the s^ole of eysment as stores make me^cyon
and he raygned one year and.xxiiii. days.

Of the.v. sysme and counceylles gadred for the unity of the church / and
destruccyon of diverse herysyes.
THe.v. sysme of the church of Rome began the year.494. this sysme began
between Symachus and Laurence the cause of this dyuisyo^ was that the clargye
could not agree in their voices / which of these two should hold the sea of
Rome for the which rose great dyuysyon and dyssencyon in two pertes among the
Romans / and in fine agreed to assemble a counceyll at Rauenna in y^ presens
of Theodore King of Gotes / In the which counceyll they agreed that Symachus
should be bishop through Theodore y^ King / which bishop was at Sardyne /
and Laureus was made bishop of Nucerre thus was fynyshed the.v. sysme.

Of the.vi. sysme of the Churches.
THrough the foresaid bishops was the.vi. sysme first with in four yers some of
y^ clargy of Rome sediciuos persons and lovers of new tidings with help of
two senators conspyred to depose Simacus bishop and would have put in Laure^s
before written / here upon the King Theodoryke being sore agreued / he set one
Peter Altyne to keep the sea of Rome for him self and chased the foresaid two
bishops in exyle / and so in co^clusyon the said Symacus assembled a cou^ceyl
of.vi. score bisshops and they purged himself clean of all things / there
laid against him for the which he abode still bishop of Rome, and yet
notwithsto^dynge there was such dyscorde and vprorers among the Romans / ye
oftentimes many were slain in the streets both Priests and men of law / in
somoch ye one Faustus a great man of power set a dyreccion among the senators
/ or else had followed greater ruin / thus may ye se what virtue or debates
arose by ye possession and gifts that Constantine gave to y^ church of Rome.

The.vii. sysme of the church of Rome.
IN this time raygned Emperor of Constantynople Iustyniane the second of that
name / in whose time was Seresinus borne in Surrey. Anno xp^i.706. Against the
which arose an Antypape which held byforse the dygnyte of Rome / whose name
was Diascorus / thus began the.vii. sisme in the church of Rome / with great
persecucyon and trybulacyon in Rome / which continewed a great season unto the
time of Gregory the second of that name / borne in Rome with another named
Sygysmond, through whose enormytes the faith of Christ began sore to decay in
the oryent parts / and through this horlay burlay the bishops of Rome took
courage / and lyfted up their horns / y^ is their power against the Emperors
more then ever was seen / for this Gregorye and Anastase were the second
abominable bisshops that raygned in Rome after Anastase / which was so bold
to exco^munycat his Emperor Leon y^.iii. of his name y^ which cause was y^ he
would a put down the worshippyng of images through al crystendome saying it
was ydolatry hated of god / and the pope wtstonde it beforse wherthrough arose
great bands of co^panyes and of persyalytes between Emperors and bisshops /
wherthrough oftimes sysmes has been renewed and thus during this sysme and
discord / arose out of Afrique a great army of Sarazyns and entered into spain
/ and wone the Realm of Granado / and so kept it by force ^yl with great polecy
and forse of Princes and Kings wane it again / also in this time was a great
army of Sarazyns in France / which were reculed byforse of arms by Charles
Prince and Martyr and in this time of Gregory began the Lent of forty days to
be fasted / y^ which Lent Melchiades, predecessor of saint Siluester strongly
withstode and defended / because thereby might engender great corrupcion and
infexion universally among christian people. As wytnessed then the counceyll of
Physycions expert.

And in this time of contynuau^ce of malice in the Church, one Constantyne
bishop of Rome usurped the sea of the papasy by force, and by money, whose
eyes were perforce put out, and so put i^ prison in a monasterye, by the which
he is named the.v. abhomynable bishop of Rome. And in this time began the
nacyon of Turkys, that came out of Tartary who enuayed sore the parts
oryentall And so mynysshed sore chrystendome. And this heresies did increase
more and more, where through they were enforsed to assemble the.vii. counceyll
at Consta^tynople for the (...) and worshyppynge of Images in the Church
which many said it was Idolatrye, and for certain other Articles that the
Greek church had against the holy ghost.

Here follows the second part of this book, which treats of the.v. first
counceylles holden by the church Gallicane at Orlyaunce. And the third was
commanded by king Clowys, the first christian king in France.
THe noble (...) makes mension that Clowys the first christian king of France
/ which was between the.iiii. and ye.v. sysme then reigned. And this king was
ye first christian that assembled a general counsel i^ Orliau^ce. Anno. dn^i.486.
Raynyng yt time at Co^sta^tinople y^ emperor zeneme. And at y^ time sat in y^
apostolyk see (...) y^.iii. of y^ name And about (...) time rayned king Artur
of England and he sent a presydent to that counsel at orliau^ce one named
Mellanius, which he sent for a good purpose for the wealth of the church.

Of the council Germanik, holden in the time of Charlemayn the great.
This Charlemain rayned emperor over Almayne, France, and Ytaly, which
assembled this counceyll in a cite in Germanya called Herbypolys in the time of
Adryan the first bishop of that name / as Platyne writes y^ which cou^ceyll
the Greeks called the great Sinoda, and there was condemned the opinion of the
Felycyans the which said that no Images ought to be in the church, and
shortly after Pope Leo y^ third of y^ name came into France to Charle main /
complaining of three Priests which had done him great vltrage and dyspleasure
/ y^ one named Pasculis the other Pri^isserius / y^ third called Ca^pulus / ye
which with many of their opinion drove out of Rome the said Adryan with all his
affynyte for going on precessyon and syngyng the Lateny which Gregory
instytuted and ordained before for the which Charlemayn was sore displeased /
and so at the said Adryans request Charlemayn raised a great army and went to
Rome / to set Adryan bishop in his see again / wherthrough he had the name of
the Empire of Rome / which he gave to the sea of rome and great possessions and
richesse / as his father Pepyn did before him as diverse such successors has
syas continued and augmented.

Of a great cou^ceyll holden at Aquis Granu^ in y^ time of Emperor Lowys de
bo^nere sone to Charlemayn which lies buried in Aquis granu^.
OF this cou^ceyll writes Platyne historyograffer / yt there were assembled all the Princes and counceylles under y^ power and domynyon of Lowys de bo^nere the
which Lowys at this connceyll gave Lotere his sone part of his Empire / and
crowned him king of Ytaly / and Pepyn his second sone he named him king of
Acquitayne / and Lowys his third sone he named king of Bauarye / and at this
counceyll y^ Infydelles and Sarasyns labored for Peace which was granted /
and at the which cou^ceyll was compyled a great Book of Laws and
co^stytucyons for ecclesiastical ceremonies and orders / which were straytly
kept which book was made and compyled by Amalarius a man florysshynge in
Learning in that time / and at this time of Lowys y^ good King and Emperor /
he perceiving the abominable pride that exceded in bishops of Rome and other
prelates of ye Church / as among Priests / and other mean sort / such
Pomp, and Raiment, so presyous / and rych, and superfluous withal and to much
gasynge and glysterynge / set with Ge^mys, perle, and stone / like Kings and
Princes, and on their Fyngers rich Rings and so this good King commanded
this pride and glory to be fordone / and caused a more sadder and a sympler
facyon and manner of raiment used and worn and thrusted down al their pride
and pomp / and caused yt no bishop nor prelate should were but one Ryng of
Gold / which should serve for his singne and seal, and so they were contented
and agreed / also as Platyne writes the bishop of Rome Steven y^ fourth of
that name borne in Rome / and successor of Leo the third being at the said
counceyll fled from the Romans and came into France to king Lowys the good
King at Orlyaunce / and was there honorably received and at his return gave
him ayed and strength to return to Rome / and he gave him a cross of so great
valor that was inestymable to judge, which was sent as an offrynge to saint
Peter.

Of the coursed and wicked cou^ceyll that was holde^ at Campyne by the prelates
of France against the said good king Lowys.
THere was about this time a detestable and wicked counceyll and a permysyous,
which was gadered by evil auctoryte * * * * * of the wicked prelates of
France / which conspyred against their good King Lowys / because he set a
dyreccyon and good order against their dishonest living pomp, pride, and
abhomynacyon, and superfluytes as before was written / and thus this wicked
counceyll of prelates conspyred a great insurreccyon and army of much people /
as the sone against the father and friend against friend / and so took the good
King Lowys, and put him captyue at seysons in a strong hold. And to this
conspyrese was agreed, pope Gregory y^.iiii. of his name because he was not
benefyciall to the Church of Rome at that time, and for redressyng many
enormytes. And not so benefycyall as he was to other Bishops before. And as the
orator Raphael of voluntary testyfyeth of this wicked counceyll and company
assembled without auctoryte. And so there these traitors condemned this good
king without auctoryte / and deposed him from all arms and out of his dignyte
emperyal and dyspoyled him of his Kings raiment and put on him a monks kole
in derysyon.

O cursed and wicked Pharysyans / repleat with treason and ypocresy sacerdotall
/ how can ye conspyre so great abhomynacyon and cruelty against so good a
king / for redressynge your Antecristian living / pomp and pride / suerly
this is not your first cruelty for ye began with the head yt was our savior Jesus
Christ whom ye shamfully crucyfyed and put to death.

And thus continued the good king Lowys captyue indesolacyon among his
enemies / till God provided for him through good cou^ceylles / and justice
divine of Kings and Prelates that he was restored to his original title
emperor and King of France again.

Of the cou^ceyll of Troyes in Champane / holden by the king Lowys that
stutted in his speaking.
IN the time of this Lowys / sone of Charles came in to France / John^ bishop
of Rome the.viii. of that name borne in Rome / And escaped out of the prysons
and captyuyte of the Romans which hated him because he would have crowned this
said Lowys y^ s^utter Emperor of Rome / for the Romans would rather have had
Charles his brother king of Germanye / and not only for this cause he fled
but because of two earls which would have taken from him the patrymonye of the
Church / and in this cause he did curse the^ / and so came for socour in to
france and there abode a.xii. months / and desired the help of the King /
which could not come / because he lay secke at Towers notwithsta^dynge within
short time after he recovered his sykenesse / then he and the bishop met
together in Troyes in Champane and there assembled a counceyll of the church
Gallycane.

And thus at this said counceyll were determined many holy decrees / and there
they confyrmed a bishop to be Pastore over the country of Flaunders / which
was a wild Forest for to make Colys / and full of maryse as Platyne writes /
which afterward was replet with people and towns / wherthrough it is to be
coniectured they be under the dioses of Tornay as yet remains.

Yet furthermore at this said cou^ceyll this said John^ bishop gave the crown
empire to king Lowys the stut^er and alled him august, yet would not he grant
to crown his wife Queen / and so after this counceyll fynyshed / John^ bishop
the.viii. of that name returned to Rome / to war on the Sarasyns which were
entered in to the partys of Italye.

Of two cou^ceylles holden at Raynys one against another one by the kings and
the other by the bishop of Rome.
Against these counceylles the bishop Benedict the.vii. of that name / caused
to assemble another counceyll at Raynes in the which Arnulphus was restored to
the byshoprych of Rayns and the usurped bishop deposed / which was after
Archbysshop of Reuenna and syns bishop of Rome by craft and means of
Diabolyke science wherein he was expert / yet notwithstanding he ended his
days myserably,

Of a great cou^ceyll general assembled at Cleremo^de in Auernea / i^ the time
of Phyllyp the first of that name, Emperor king of France, there present
Urbanus y^ second bishop of that name in Rome / in the which cou^ceyl was y^
great vyage of Godfroy debullyon set forth upon the sarasyns / where by the
faith of Christ was largely increased in Turkey.
THis holy bishop of Rome Urban the.xii. of that name Abbot of Clunye a black
monk and Cardynall of Hostyensis, was moved with pity and compassyon through the
lamentable complayntes of the worthy pylgr^me Peter the heremyte borne at Men's
/ the which came lately from the holy land. And so informed Urban of the
mys^ry and po^erte, and seruytude that christian people were in there with the
patryarke Simon in Jerusalem. So this complaynt herynge Urban, moved with
co^passyon and prepayred with all dylygence for succor and delyuerau^ce of
them there being in the thraldom and danger of Sarasyns, turkys, and Infidels,
which cryste^ people lay in this thraldom from the time of Hiracle, which was
the year of our Lord god.cccc.lxxx. or there about as platyne writes.

And shortly after Urban was in so great trouble and veracyon among the
Romans, that they were feign to fly out of Rome, and came in to France. And
there was assembled through his coming a great counceyll of all the Prelates
of the Church catholyke which was holden in the city of Cleremount in
Ouernia. And some stories says that Phillyp ye first of that name assembled
another counceyll against ye Hollandes. And so when the great counsel of Urban
the bishop of rome was assembled in the holy Ghost / this said Urban made an
excellent and elygant Oration to that assemble. And there thereof breyfly and
sentenciously I gadred as follows concerning the vyage to Jerusalem for the
delyueraunce and captyuyte of the christian people.

All ye honorable audyence here assembled ye shall understand yt I which
have taken on me unworthy this entendeth to set good order and reformacyon in
all thing according to the catholyke Relygyon of Christ.

It is not unknown to you what ingerys and loss has been of late days in
crystendome by Sarasyns and Infydellys without mercy or pytie / with great
wars and battayllys / for the which remedy is there none but by force of
armies / wherefore to redress it as we and you be very C^tristyans stand fast
in the fayeth / and let us seek remedy for this pyteous tyranny that christen
people do sustain, and Remember the great dylygence that your predysessours
has had in this behalf in times paste, And spetyally ye nobles of France,
which has always sustained against the Infydelys, also you Germayns and
Saxons and Polax, Bohemys, and hungaryon and English nacyon ye should not
suffer this tyranny upon Christen people so pyteously also ye Italyons should
remember what pains and tyranny your predycessoures friends of late days has
suffered by them also ye venecyans and ye of Dalmase and of Hystrye / and al ye
bourderars of the Ardryatyque sees which have always valyantly defended the
malyse and power of the Sarasyns / now apply your self withal other princes to
withstand this cruel Infydellys or else ye shall se your children / your wyfes
/ your goods / and lives, utterly destroyed by cruelty, wherefore awake all ye
valiant personage and we humbly desire you in y^ mercy of God / put on your
armies and sprede forth your standards and Baners and set forth your
co^paynyes with great courage / and God yt is most puysau^t shall be with you and
send his omnypotent power to ayed and strength you in all your ways and to
confound all that shall withstand you.

How by the means of this oracyon made by Urbanus bishop of Rome through it
all Princes on this side Constantinople took great courage and enforsed the^ to
assemble great armies on all parts to go upon the sarasyns / and so to
Jerusalem.
ANd thus as soon as Urbanus had fynysshed his oracyon all that were there
present / arose and said with one voice this is the will and pleasure of God /
and therewith Urban blessed them all saying this blessyng / I give you as
long as ye shall endure this Journey / and ye shall understand y^ in this
assemble and cou^ceyll was many noble worthy Princes and barons, and noble men
the which many of them sold their lands, hoping to prospere in this Journey
to y^ hye honor and seruyse of God / whereof is made mencyon i^ diverse
crownacles more at large / in the which journey god fray of Bullyon was the
chief of that enterprise / and thus was fynyshed the counceyll of Cleremont.

Of the cou^ceyll of Troyes in Champayne by bishop Pascall y^ twelfth for y^
reformacyons of y^ Church.
AFter this great cou^ceyll arose the.17. sisme in the church / in the time of
Paschall bishop of Rome the.12. of that name borne in Italye before a monk and
so successor of Urbanus / which came into France for to have reformacyon of
diverse abuses y^ was the^ in the Church far from al good facyon and order
whereon he caused a counceyl to be assembled general / wherein was reformed many
things / and specially he deposed many prelates and benefysed me^ / which were
necligent and unlearned from their pastoralyte and curyous / and admytted such
as were able for such promocyons and to preach and give example of living in
Christ's church.

Of the counceyll holden at Rayns by Calixte bishop of Rome / brother to y^
earl of Burgoy^gne / in y^ which cou^ceyll Henry the fourth Emperor was
accoursed and exco^municat.
AFter this Pascal rayned gyles the second of y^ name borne in Italye in whose
time fell the.18. sysme in y^ which suffered many trybulacyons and persecucions
as ye shall find in the time of Henry the fourth Emperor which created an
antypape named Benedictus / y^ which antypape pope Gyles drove out of Ytalye /
and so fled into France.

And so in the absent see of this said Gyles possessed the sea bishop of
Uy^nne named Guy of Burgongne, which was in y^ holy land of Jerusalem when
Godftay de Bullyon, the which Guy was taken and accepted for a man of an
acceptable life, whose name was afterward called Calixtus the.ii. but yet as
storys says y^ the foresaid Gylys was he y^ coursed Henry the emperor in y^
cou^ceyl and not this Calyxt / for he was nigh a kyne to y^ emperor Henry
which married Ma^de daughter to the king of England and this said curse was
given by Gyles Bishop because of the reformacyon of the pride and pomp that
then was usurped among prelates and priests / as well in dignytes and their
auctorytes / as in excess of gorgyous apparel and a raiment also partly as
Platyne writes it was for y^ supporting of an Antypape named Burdyn a
spanyard / as here after in the third part here of shall make mensyon and so
was Calyxt made bishop and stauled in Rome byforse and caused y^ emperor
Henry to be beseged, the ^yte of rayns where he was acursed.

Of the second cou^ceyl holden at Cleremond / and of a another holden at Rayns
in Champayne almoost in one time.
INnocent y^ second bishop of Rome and borne in y^ same City held war and
battle against Roger normunde King of Naples / * * * * * and y^ sone of Roger
vaynquyshed this bishop Innocent i^ plain Batyle / and took him and his
cardinals prisoners / yet notwithstanding this prince Wyllyam e^treated him
and his cardynalles gently and honorably / and in contynuaunce he set them at
lyberty like a noble man.

And this time indurynge was a another bishop of Rome named / Anacletus, by
whom y^ foresaid Innocent was chased out of Rome / and this was y^.xviii. sysme
as ye shall plainly se in the last part of this book.

And thus in that time by the aduysement of king Lowys y^ gross was holden
two counceylles in France / in the which was the foresaid Innocent present /
these cou^ceylles were holden at cleremont i^ Ouernya / and the other at rayns
in Champayne in the which cou^ceylles were determined diverse decrees and by
the which Innocent overcame his adversary annacletus his antipape and so he
returned to Rome again and possedyd his see.

Of the counceyll of Uezelay / which was kept in Burgonye and kept in the
time of king Lowys the younger / wherein was provoked the second Journey upon
the infydellys.
During the time of the.19. sysme of the which ye shall perceive more at large
in the third part of this book / so this time Engenius the.3. of that name
bishop of Rome borne in Pisa in ^ ^alye / who was disciple of saint Bernard
the white monk / and this man also fled in to France aparte for socoure for
the great murmr and furye, y^ he had of the Romans / and part for to
cou^ceyll and to mocion criste^ Princes to war upon the infydellys the which
had taken a great city called Edessa Mesopotania in grecya.

For the which cause king Lowys y^ younger sone to gross Lowys / y^ which
endeueryd himself with great dilyge^ce toward this journey and assembled a
great cou^ceyl of prelates and pryncis in the city of vezelay in Burgone, and
through the cou^ceyll and advise of saint Barnarde with other / this young Lowys
vowed to go on this journey and he required to help the christian people that
were there / so sore oppressed of the infydellys / insomoch that after him
followed his wyffe with great no^bre of people. And with them conradus king of
romans, Alfonce king of Spain Richard the first of England with great
nombre of knights and barons which was the second passage universal y^
crystendome made to the holy Land of Jerusalem.

And as Platyne says this Eugenius and saint Bernarde was the cheyf setters
forth in this counceyl, for this army, And so returned to rome quyetly.

Of the third council holde^ in Ouernya and of two other councelles one at
Towers another at Dygyon.
THus the.xx. sysme of y^ church was against bishop Alysaunder the third of
that name, borne at Senys, the year of our Lord.M.lxxx. and this sysme and
dyuysion endured in the church.xvii. years / against.iiii. Antypapes that then
rayned and were suffered by y^ emperor frederyke called Barbarouse / and so
this Alyxsau^der fled out of Rome for socoure unto king Phillype augustus who
then assembled a cou^ceyll in Cleremonde in Ouernya against the foresaid
Frederyke / for mayntenynge of victor Antypape / by the which varyaunce and
dyuysyon in crystendome, in this mean season Jerusalem was won by ye soul
dan Saladyne / which was never yet recovered to this day this was the year of
Christ.1184. and so this emperor Frederyk would feign a brought to pass a
unity and concord / and would have had this co^^ceyl at Dygyon i^ Burgony where
they should amet with king Phyllype, and the king of Boheme, and king of
Scotts and should have had the said antypape Uictor / which he brought all to
pass byforce of arms, or else not.

But yet this Alexsaunder bysshup of Rome would not consent to come there / for
he had that place in susspecke and so gadered a another counceyll at Towers, and
thus y^ emperor Frederyk / in spyte and displeasur returned in to Almayne /
and sent Uictor his antypape in to ^talye and thus was al things in more
pertur bacyon and unquietness the^ it was before, thus al christian people may se
what myschefe and vengeance has been through y^ obstynacy of wicked bisshops
of Rome over all crystendome and ever will be until the hand of God put
remedy.

Of two cou^ceylles in france holden in Paris in Phyllyps time / and of the
disi^e of Salandyne.
IN the time of this phyllip august / came Enbassatoures queen Isabel from the
king of Jerusalem which came for socour for the christian prisoners y^ Saladyne
solda^ had in captyuite / whereupon was gadered a counsel at Paris to no
purpose, but for the socour of christian me^ for the king Phillyp had as then
great war against Hew duke of Burgone and other.

And thus this said Phillyp sent enbassatours to king Richard curedelyon
desyring him of ayed in this cause to the which he granted with good will and
so / shortly after he assembled a great army on both partys of France, and
England, and went on a croose against the ennemys of cristendome / but the
foresaid king Richard could not obtain his purpose for he was slain before a
Castle or he came to Jerusalem / and notwithstanding his sone took that
Journey / on him and for the mayntenaunce of this was paid all the hole rentes
of the churches / and monestaryes in France which was called y^ subsedy of
Salandyne and after this foresaid company followed Frederyke emperor with a great
puyssau^ce / which was called y^ third general viage in to the holy land.

Of another cou^ceyl holden in France by a Legate of the bishop of Rome
against king phillype augustus.
THus another cou^ceyll was holden against Pyyllype after his return by y^
legate of Innocent y^ third of that name / and there was y^ king Pyllype
enterdyted and all the Realm for forsakyng of the Queen / which was the
bishops kynswoman and herupon the King armyd him and raised a great army /
and he exyled all the bishops that consented to the curse / and put them in
Prison and from their benefyces etc.

Of the counceyll holden at Paris / against the albygens.
IN y^ time of Lowys father to saint Lowys then Gregory the.ix. rayned Anno.
Dn^i.1226. then came in to France a legate from the Bishop / which legate was
named Romanus and there was gadred a cou^ceyll they concluded to war upon the
herytykes Albygoys / which was in y^ cou^^re of Auynion, in Prouau^ce, and
Languedock, which were repleat with great vyllany and herysyes, and so the
King went upon these countries and subdued them, and in retournyng home he
dyed.

Of the first cou^ceyl holden at Lions in the time of saint Lowys king / and
of Innocent bishop of Rome the.4. of yt name borne in Genys.
THe which bishop came into France for soco^r for case that the Emperor
Frederyk persecuted him / Anno Dn^i.1246. and y^ Emperor was syted to appear
at this counceyll and came with a great company / and at turayne he returned
home again for his ennemies were entered into his country.

This debat continued long time the space and time of three bishops of Rome
successyuely / y^ was Honorius the.3. the other Gregorye / and Innocent before
written / and thus through y^ cruel obstynacy of these bishops there arose
great mischeffe and dissencion through al cristendome, and so thereby was
engendered great war in all crystendom in the which time of wars was lost
Constantinople and so at this cou^ceyl was nothing concluded through the great
ruin that fell in crystendome / by these foresaid bishops of Rome one after a
another.

Of the second counceyl of Lions / in the time of Gregory the tenth / and in
y^ time of king Phyllyp sone to saint Lowys.
THe year of grace.1232. rained king Phillip sone to saint Lowys / who
assembled a another counceyll at Lions whereunto came Gregorye bishop the tenth
borne in Plesaunce / this King Phyllyp was the first y^ gave y^ bishop a
guard of men of armies / also he gave him.3. strong Places for his sauegard
about Lion / and to this counceyll came the emperor Michel paleolog of
Constantinople / for the Reformacion of the greek church / which had fallen
the.xiii. time in to Ruin, and yet would not be reformed.

Of another counsel holden at Paris, in the time of king Phillyp the fair /
against y^ bishop bonyface the eight which used great tyranny against y^
Clerge.
PHyllyp the fair a prudent and virtuous king began to raygne.1286 and in his
time possessed the sea of Rome Boniface the.viii. successoure of Celestyne
the.v. which was a wise and a virtuous man the which Bonyface craftily deceived
/ and this bonyface was of the nature and facyon of the Italyans / as
arrogaunte, and fyerse, which nothing considering the beneficial gifts yt his
predecessors had received in France / as ye shall here more at large.

This said Bonyface the.8. sent as strayte a commandment unto the king of
France by an enbassade a fyerse bishop / how that the said King should in
contynent without delay go^ and prepayre in all have a great nauey and an army
also, to go into the holy Land / the which y^ said King could not bring to
pass / forcause of great wars yt he had at yt time against y^ Flanders
nacio^.

And thus this said Arrogau^t bishop seeing yt he could not obtain his
purpose / began to threten and rebuke y^ king rygoryously saying that in case
that he would not fulfill his message / he would cause him to fle out of his
Realm / and for because y^ this bishop enbassatour used himself so
rygorously / against y^ King / the King took hye displeasure and straytly
commanded him to prison.

After this tydinges came to this foresaid Boniface the.viii. Coloryk, proud
and arrogant above mesure, And sent straight an Archedeacon Embasadour
co^maundyng the king phyllyp the fair that he should not enterprise to take
nor raise no money Subsidy upon the church, the which subsydie he was
enforced to do for the great wars that he was charged with at that time / for
his defense. And the said archedeacon dyscharged the said king for the
Inprysoneme^t of the said bishop, that he should be exyled all y^ iurisdixion
of Rome. And that it should be auctorysed in Rome, for ever his disobedyence and
so taken / nomynated as an Herytyke, and a sysmatyke, also y^ said Archdyacon
syted him with diverse other Bishops / and prelates of the Clergy to come unto
Rome parsonally by a certain day / and disanulled all the Preuylages of
grauntes and pardons given by his predycessours of the sea of Rome.

This was an extreme rygoure in the presens of all his barons and counceyll
which was so dysdaynous and proudly spoke by the said enbassatour / without
any seueryte or of good order / and if the King were moved or abashed it was
no marueyle / and so co^mau^dynge with sober aduysement yt the first
Enbassatour the bishop should be set at lybertye / and that in all the have
with further deliberacyon he should depart his Realm / and so in short time
after he assembled a great counceyll of Bishops / and barons / in the which
the King opened all the vltrages and abhomynacyons yt the foresaid Innocent the
eight used against him / and openly there expressed how shamfully and craftily
this Boniface / came by the sea of Rome, and turned him to the Clargy and to
y^ Lords temporal saying, of whom hold ye your Lands and possessions but of
me / wherefore I will ye / ye henseforth not so hardy to send or pay any money
or treasour / to y^ court of Rome / and hereupon caused all brydges, portys,
and passages, to be stopped and kept / and thus Boniface y^ bishop of Rome
cursed him / and co^spyred great malice and ingeris against y^ King and
procured great enuyte against him by certain Princes / and shortly this was
the fine and conclusion of this debate was thus.

The King seeing y^ importunat malice of this Antecryst bishop / y^ King
caused.200. men of armies conduted by two subtyle and wise persons / and they
which went to yt town of agnane / where the Bishop lay in Naplys / and took
him there in and brought him prisoner to Rome / where he dyed myserably for
doloure and cursed mind within.24. days after, and his epytaphe was such
like as he deserved as follows.

Intrauit vt Uulpes, regnauit vt Leo, mortuus est vt cauis, yt is in English
he entered as a Fox, and rained like a Lion, and dyed as a Doge.

Of a another cou^ceyll holden in france at Uyenne. Anno Dn^i.892.
THe auctour found in old auncyaunt Lybrary a Book at Lions / wherein was
written, that from the time of Formosus bishop of Rome / began the.ix. sisme
which shall be more leargely treated of, in y^ third part of this book, and so
by the commandment of Lowys King otherwise called Lowys le balbe through
the counceyll of his wife / assembled a counceyll in the church of saint
Saluatour where were gadered two legates of Rome, the one named pascal / the
other John^ / and the archebysshop of Uyenne / and Aurelyan archebysshop of
Ualencie / with many other prelates, and learned men of the Clergy, and yet at
this time the priests were married / and at this counceyll was decreed this
act word for word.

Ut presbiteri non in villis / sicut quibusdam consuetudinis est (morentur) et
feminas suas secum in domibus suis habitare non permittant, exceptis quas
canonicas permittit auctoritas / that is in english. That priests which dwelt
in Cities, and in Towns, of custume having their wyfes with them dwelling
should no more so be suffered (but only those) as should be permytted and
suffered by the auctoryte of the holy Canons.

Of a another general cou^ceyl holden at Uyenne in Dolphyne.1312.
AFter y^ Ignomynyous and shamfull death of Bonyface before written y^.8. of that
name bishop of Rome, succeeded Benedictus y^ eleventh borne at Taruyse in
Italye a blake Friar which was amoderat parsone / nothing like his
predycessour for he assoyled Phillip king of France of yt sensurys of the
church which bishop Bonyface surmysed against him and so this good bishop
rayned but eight months and.17. days after whom rayned Clement y^.v. a
gasken borne, archbysshop of Burdux which was chosen by the Cardynallys
resydent for the tym, ethe year of our Lord, at the instaunce of king Phyllyp
la bell.1305.

Thus shortly after this said Clement assembled a great company of Cardynalles
and Bishops, to no little cost and charge to all y^ church of France / and
so came to Lions with great pomp, and wordly glory, where met with him many
cardynalles of Italye / where as he was corwned with great pomp and Royalty /
at the which coronacion was king Phyllyp la bell with his brother Charles and all
the princes of France / and in all this pomp and royalty, befell a great
sudden myschau^ce / where as a great nombre of people were slain in the fall
of a great old wall where as much people were assembled for to behold this
great pomp and ryalty / in the which fall was ^layne the duke John^ of Brytanye
and the king sore hurt, and the new bishop smyten from his Horse / in so much
y^ his crown fell from his head / and lost the rychest stone there one called a
Carbuncle / esteemed worth.vi.M. duccates, and thus after this mysfortunat
aduentour this said bishop Clement departed from Lions / and came to Auygnyon
where as he abode / and there removed the Sea appostolyque from Rome unto
Auignyon / the which see appostolike removed abode there the space.lxxiii.
years after before it was removed to Rome again.

The syxt year after the foresaid Clementis coronacyon which was the year.1311.
in the month of Noue^bre was assembled a great general cou^ceyl universal
through all crystendome in the City of Uyenna i^ Dolphyne / where as was
assembled above.300. prelates of diverse cou^tres through all crystendom / and
this cou^ceyl was partly gadered at king Phillips req^st to reprove ye foresaid
boniface an herytyke and a sismatyke / which was his cruel ennemy and to
disanul his acts and decrees / howbeit it came not to pas though clement
bishop promised him the cou^ceyll would not consent thereunto / yet
notwithstanding it was judged / said and declared that his acts / and decrees
against y^ King, were nowght and unjust and of no valor.

Also at this cou^ceyll was utterly destroyed all the rules and wrytynges of
the Templers and brent them and all their possessions given unto y^ order of
saint Iohn^s in Jerusalem the which we call the knights of the Rodes.

Also at this cou^ceyll the gray Friars were at great dyuysyon within them
selves for y^ which was decred many acts and decrees in y^ canon book called
Clementynys / compyled by this said Clement bishop of Rome / also at this
cou^ceyll was great counceyll for to recover the holy Land / but it nothing
auayled also some hystoryans hold opinion yt this bishop Clement kept two
other cou^ceyls in France to destroy the herysyes that were in valdoyes, and
pyemont, and sauoye, this fynyshed y^ great counseyll of Uyenne.

Of a counceyll holden at Auynyon.
AT the time of the.xxi. sysme / ye shall here more largly of in y^ later end of
this book / and so this cou^ceyll of Auynyon began by Johan bishop of Rome
the.xxii. of y^ name a graye Friar / in whose time arose an Antypape by y^
mayntenaunce of the emperor Lowys of Bauaria / the which antypape held a
counceyll in Italye / where as he declared y^ said John^.xxii. of that name to
be an herityke / and this said Antypape and his company held opinion y^ Christ
and his discyples were pore and yt they had nothing pryue nor common, the which
was proved the countrary in this counceyll of Auynyon.

Of two cou^ceyllys holden in France at Paris in y^ time of king Charles the
syxth forcause of a great dyssencyon that was in the church in the two and
twenty sysme.
SOme men will think that king Phyllyp la bell did, for a polecy cause
Clement to move the sea appostolyke from Rome, and so to be kept at Auynyo^,
but al things pondered it turned his country to much trouble / ruin / and
grefe / as long as it was there-holden the space of.lxxiiii. years / for as soon as the sea appostolike was moved to Auynyo^ by Clement, then succedyd
John^ the.22. of that name Anno.1327. of our Lord and in his time rayned Lowys
de Bauaria / and Frederyk duke of oystryche which had great war together by
this mean / also king Phyllyp de valoys father of king John^ y^ was prisoner
in England through y^ cause y^.xxi. sisme of y^ which ye shall here more of in
y^ last part of this book and through this forsaid cause arose also an Antipape
i^ Italye named Nycolas y^ third which was supported by the emperor / Lowys
de Bauarya.

Also yet further inco^uenyenses arose by this mean yt this said Bishop
preached and supported diverse visions, fa^tasyes, and dremyes of contemplacyon
/ which was of little faith / ye which diverse doctoures in dyuyne withstode
and proved the contrary / and yet furthermore this said bishop oppressyd y^
realm of France with imposycyons / donacyons / and decimis / and subsides / and
expectatyues with other inuencyons / such as y^ court of Rome could well
co^tryue, in so much that no learned man of Paris could obtain any benefice,
but they were polled and pylled by cardynalles and curtysians under the^ of
auynyo^ through y^ which pyllage and abhomynable living it was generally
called the whore of babylon / for their great pyllage / riches, pomp, and
pride, in somoch they had the half of all the benefyces in France and this
abhomynacyon was sore resysted by the university of Paris.

After this shamful ruyngne y^ sete appostolyke was removed to rome again Anno
Dn^i.1376. in y^ time of Gregorye the eleventh borne in Lymogys / and he was
not long without great preiudyce and flaunder by the.xx. sisme moved by Urbane
the.vi. Neopolitane borne / which Urbane caused.v. Cardynallys of France to
be drowned / and in this season was two bishops in crystendome / the one in
Rome and y^ other in Auynyon / in somoch that people were so a mased and
troubled that they cold not judge nor know which of them was in y^ just and
in right auctoryte / and this sysme endured.40. years which was more troblous
and dangerous then any y^ ever befell afortyme / and thus befell evil upon
eyull so the Bohemis became as y^ time required far from the faith / and
utterly denied and disspysed the Romans.

Thus was all crystendome vexed, and troubled with these two bishops which
continued many years successyuely from bishop to bishop after the death of
Urban y^ which held his see at Rome after whom succeeded Innocent the.7. and
after him succedyd Augelus a Uenecyan whom was named Bonefacius the.ix. and
thus after Clement.vi. y^ dyed in Auygnyon / succedyd Benedictus.xiii. whose
errors were worse the^ were before for this Benedictus was very obstynat. By
this occasyon was Charles sore moved and vnquyeted through these sysmes / and
sent noble enbassatours unto Auynyon to y^ bishop which was only for the
concord and unity of cristes Church / but it little auayled for they returned
without answer.

That seeing the king assembled at Paris a great counceyll of all his princes
and barons with the prelates and the best learned me^ of his realm / where as
they co^sulted together yt both bisshops should be deposed / whereupon the duke
of bauarye and y^ duke of Burgone went to the by^shop at Auynyon to discus this
message with a noble power / and when the bishop understood what was their
coming and wherefore / for fear to consent fled away secreatly out of Auynyon,
and left them alone without farewell or leave taken / and returned in to his
natyue cou^trye / whereof these dukes were abashed and so returned to Paris
again pensive where y^ King lay / and after this they held another cou^ceyl
in the same City in the time of charles y^.vi. for this union of the church to
y^ which this bishop y^ fled would not co^se^t nor be co^fyrmable.

Of other two cou^cellys in France the one at lions y^ other at burges by the
commandment of charles y^.vii. al to abolyshe this said sysme.
AFter the great cou^ceyl of co^staunce which was assembled in Almayne by the
advise of sygisemundus / with the assystaunce of.v. pryncypall christian nacyons
/ that is to wet germany / France / England / Spain / and Italye / for to
extyrpe these sismes in the church and to depose three bishops sysmatykes yt
was Gregorye the.xii. Alexau^der the fyfth and John^ the.23. and after these
was Martyne the fyfth of yt name created Bishop at this said counceyl / with
the hole consent of all crystendome which counceyl continued four years / and
at this counceyl was condampned the bohemys, herysyes, and confounded and in
this time rayned the puissaunt king Charles of France / which held another
counceyll for the susteynynge of Pragmatica sanxio this was so Anno 1438.

Shortly following Anno.1447. began a new discord called the.xxiii. sisme for
y^ dignyte bytwe^ Eugenius a venecia^ and Felyx sometime duke of Sauoy / y^
which dyuysyon endured the space of xvi. years / until Nycolas the.vi.
agen^uoy / and for this purpose king Charles the seventh assembled a great
counceyll at Lions where at was concluded and fynyshed this sysme and this was
the common voice. Lux fuit in mundocessit / Felix / Nicolaio. In this article y^
king Charles the seventh prefered his decrees and acts of Pracmatica, sa^xio,
and after him rayned Lowys king the leuenth of that name in whose time rayned
in Rome bishop Pius the twelfth and this Lowys / held a another great
counceyll at Orlyaunce for the mayntenaunce of y^ Pracmatica sanxio / wherein
Pius bishop was agreued.

Of two counceyllys holden in france the one at towers the other at lions Anno
Dn^i.1510. that lasted two years.
IT is to be understand that at the last cou^ceyl holden at Basyll, which was
Anno.448. that then was the city of Lion named by the said cou^ceyll most
profitable and necessary be kept there from ten year to.x. years a general
cou^ceyl and so succedyd king of France after Lowys the.xi. Lowys the.xii. a
noble and a wise prince / which held two cou^ceyls in his time in whose time
rayned in Rome Julius bishop the second / whose arts of ruin needs not my
pen to write / for his holy living is manyfestly known of a great many now,
yet living y^ has experyence of his cruel acts, thus is fynysshed y^
second part of this book / and thus to this the third part I will begin at
the later end of this first book which mensioneth of the.vii. sisme and I will
begin this third book with the eight sysme and so end and finish this little
book as follows.

Here begins y^ third book of this process and first of the.viii. sisme
and so proceeds to y^ last showing what ini^te and mysery befell i^ the
church of rome and i^ other places.
THe emperor Lowys y^ gentle king of France, sone of charlemayne arose
the.viii. sisme in y^ church between Eugenius bishop of Rome / the.ii. of y^
name borne in Rome / and zozinus antipape, which wrought through diverse
cardinals great displeasures / yet was this Eugenius a good man and a wise, and
so anon after the taking of Rome by the Sarasyns / there followed great euyllys
throghe all the world and specially in france / wherein the Normans and the
frysya^s entered first, and exersysed their cruelty, and shortly after, Ione
the woman bishop of rome borne in england possessed the sea of Rome with
great sclaunder to the Romans and to the sea appostolyke.

Of the.ix. sysme what befell in that time.
Shameful, cruel, and sclaunderous out of measure was this.ix. iysme * * * *
and endured long time, which began in the time of lowys the emperor, the
stutter, the which occasion was this.

The bishop John^ the, viii, in Rome borne, which fled in to france for
refuge and socour, the which was a man cruel and nothing pyteous but
malyciously entreated formosus bishop, and so this formosus for fere and
danger of the foresaid John^ the.viii. bishop, he fled in to france. But
afterward by constraynte of excomunycacyo^s he was enforsed to return again
to his bysshopryche at rome, called port romayne and afterward was he degraded
and deposyd, and made a seculer priest again to his formal state, and sworn y^
he should not i^ nowyse return to his bysshoprych. yet not wtsto^dyng
afterward he was absolved by Martyn bishop of Rome the, xii, of y^ name, and
in short time af^ y^ said formosus bought (...) papalyte y^ which another
pretended to (...) a romayne (which could not as at that time obtain it / yet
notwithstanding afterward he obtained his purpose through a conspyrasy /
mortal against y^ said Formosus / and so came in to France to king Lothayr /
and thus this said Formosus kept y^ po^tifycalite of Rome / five years and a
half, in the which time he did nothing worthy to be in memory, but engendered
enemies, the which was revenged of him after his death.

After this Formosus bishop, succeeded Steven the.vi. of that name, there was
but one bishop bytwen them both which was named Boniface the.vi. borne in
Tuskayne / which rayned but.36. days. And so this foresaid Steven the vi.
with all his power abolyshshed and condemned all the Decrees and acts of
Formosus. And y^ next bishop that succedyd did clean contrary, and stablysshed
and confyrmed them in their own formal estate again / whose name was Romanus.
And in lykwyse did Theodorus and John^ the.ix. bishop / whereby arose great
perturbaunce and busynes among the people of Rome / for cause some held of
one party, and some of the other. And so all this hurly burlye was in fault
(none) but for lack of good virtuous bishops of Rome, but they were all
poisoned. And yet after this succedyd Sergyus before named y^ came again out of
France, which was worse the^ any of y^ other before him.

This Sergyus the third bishop of that name, returned again in to Italy, by
the aid and socoure of king Lowys the third, the which lowys deposed
Chrystofer bishop the, viii. that after formosus usurped the papalyte / the
which Chrystofer was infected with sysmes that was between leo the.v. of that
name and him and so this foresaid Sergius to be avenged of the forsayde
formosus, In his furye against all humanyte / caused the body of formosus to be
dygged out of his grave / and clothed him agay^e in his pontyfycalibus, and so
caused the hangman to smite of his head and so threw his body into the River of
Tyber, yet some stories wryt that his body was taken up again pryuely and
buried by fyssher men.

This said sergius had a sone named Johan the.x. of that name bishop of rome /
which succedyd him but not dyrectly / for there were two that possessed the
dygnyte before him, whose names were Anastas the.iii. and landolphus. This said
Johan the.x. was little better then his forefather sergyus. Not withstandyng he
was a great warrior and a good man of arms, for he drove the sarasyns out of
Calabre / by the aid and help of Alberyke marquis of Tuskan / So in
conclusyon this wicked John^ bishop only to have the name and renown of this
said vyctory against y^ sarazyns caused the men of war of Alberyke to stop
his mowthe with a cusshon / and so smodred him to death / this trewely was a
pytefull case to se y^ see appostolyke / so repleat with bishops of iniquite
as sto^yes of y^ time does wryt more at large of their ambysyon, pride, and
iniquyte, in the which season / the Hongaryons wrought great vengeauncys / and
dyspleasurs against the church of Rome and the patrymonye of the Church /
which was only the just punyssyon of God.

What befell in the time of the.x. and the.xi. sisme by y^ power of the emperor
Otton y^ first of y^ name.
John^ the twelfth of y^ name bishop of Rome / and also borne there, the
which before was called Octauyan through the puyssaunce and tyranny of his
father Alberyk, he used his papalyte very evil for he was a man of evil life,
without chastyte / he companyd with women openly without shame / for y^ which
abhomynacyon two cardynalles dyscret and wise persons complained unto Otton
emperor of germany / who rained Anno.962 ye shall understand that the mean
season or Otton the Emperor came / this foresaid Ingnomynyous Bishop
Johan, was advertised of this co^playnte by the Cardynalles to the Emperou^ of
him and caused the^ to be taken, and of the one he caused to cut of his nose,
and the other his brestys. And so shortly after king* Otton came to Rome and
there held a counceyll against the said bishop of Rome. In the which
counceyll he was condemned, and deposed for his wicked and cruel life, yet
after this just judgment he was taken again in the act of adulterye with a
man's wife whose husband slew him with the deed doing.

After the deposytyon of this said Johan the, xii. king Otton caused a bishop
to be chosen called Leo the eight. And shortly after the absence of Otton the
emperor / The wicked Romans, sedytions inconstaunt, chased this Leo bishop
out of Rome, and set up an antypape, who was named, Benedictus / the.v. for the
which cause themperoure Otton shortly after beseged Rome / and so what for the
war and famyne / the Romans were constrained to yield and set the foresaid Leo
in his see, and auctorite and so put to exyle their antipape Benedict / which
fled in to Almayn thus were these two sismes fynysshed before wryte^.

Of the.xii. sisme abolyshed by Otton the third Emperor.
BY the auctoryte of y^ emperor Otton y^ third Anno dn^i.993. was created
bishop of rome / gregory y^ v. borne in saxonia i^ Almayn and so after the
departing of the emperor Otton from Rome, a certain senatoure rich and
repleat with covetous named Cresse^sius, set up y^ bishop of pleasau^ce of the
nacyon of Greece for money, and so this Gregorye seeing and dredynge the fury of
the Romans / and their vyolence with all fled into Almayne / toward the
emperor Otto^ / who brought him again by strong hand / though this senator
with the greek bishop antypape with Cressencyus by force and strenght kept them
within the Castle angel / yet that notwithstanding they were taken / and
Cressencyus was byhedyd for his covetous enterprise / and the antypape had both
his eyes put out, and well worthy for his ambycyous preesthode.

Thus was the bishop Gregorye restored to his dignyte in Rome again / and he
was y^ first that decreed and made / ordinances for y^ elexcion of the Empire
Anno dn^i.1002. to y^ intent y^ the elexcio^ imperyall should always remain and
contynew among the Princes of Germany, which contynueth to this day only but
of suffraunce, and so after Gregorye held the sea appostolyke / Syluester the
second the which was expert in the art Magyque, and Nygromn^cy, which is a
deuyllysh and a da^pnable science / y^ which Gregory dyed shamfully as
stories makes mension as in the second part of this book it does partly
appear.

Of the.xiii. and.xiiii. sysmes in the time of two bishops of Rome / the one
the uncle, the other y^ Nephew / in whose time Jerusalem was taken by the
sarasyns and of y^ horyble operacyons of these two bishops.
THe knowledge of these dyuysyons and sysmes be so confuse and odyous that I
would they were passed under scylence / notwithstanding he that seeks for the
sweet breers / must oftymes pass through sharp thorns and crowked breers and
or we come to the swet carnel / we must pas through the hard shell / thus
after these things before resyted I must show unto you the residewe as mine
auctour writes sucsentyfly as I may and can understand. Thus have ye seen y^
through evil and auarycyous bishops of Rome / was the cause and occasyon of
al sismes discordes, and euylles that befell through the world, and in like
manner y^ good meke and crystyan bishops / was y^ occasyon of peace, unity, and
concord, ouerall crystendome* / as we have written in the second part of this
book.

Thus after y^ this foresaid Siluester the second dyed / which gave himself
to the Devil to come unto his said dignyte papal / whom God may save by his
merry and grace / and in so succeeded in the space of.xii. years / but three
peasyble bishops of Rome / after this succeeded Benedictus the fyfth borne in
Tuskay / which began to enter in much trouble, for when the emperor henry y^
first of that name was deed / which was in the year of our Lord.404. which
stood in great favor with the said emperor because he did crown him in his
see / which benedictus was cast out by force from his dignite by the Romans /
and so they set in another in his place yet notwithstanding Benedictus / made
his agreement with his ennemies / and afterward chasid his ennemies out of his
place / and so he was restored to his dignyte again / thus fynysshed the.xii^.
sysme.

And as stories does specefy / which remains that after the death of the said
Benedictus / it was fantasyed that the spryte of the said bishop Benedictus /
the.vii^. appeared unto a bishop in asolytarye place upon a great horrible
blake horse / and this Bishop demanded him, why and wherefore he rode on such
a black horse / he answered because he was in great torments / and prayed the
Bishop to take certain treasours that he had hyd in diverse places / where as
he showed him where they lay / and y^ he should destry buit the^ to the pore
people / for all the alms I gave i^ my life time little profytes me because I
gat my treasour with extor^yon / and rapyne which did as y^ vysyon said and af^
he forsook y^ glory of these world and be came a relygyous man soletary.

After this benedictus the.viii. succeeded Benedictus y^.ix. between who^ was
the bishop John^ the.xx. and this Benedictus the.ix. was worse then his uncle
/ as appears for he was y^ occasion of the.xiiii. sisme and division in y^
church of Rome for the Romans saw y^ he was of small reputacyo^, and of little
valor deposed him from his dignite, and set up in his place John^ y^
archbysshop of Sabyn / which was called Syluester y^ third / and about 49.
days after they chased him out also because he was less then and an ydeot,
yngnoraunt and unprofitable, but yet ye shall understand he perceiving this /
sold his papasy to John^ / for ready money / who was then a^chedeaco^, of saint
John^ port latyne / which afterward was called Gregorye the.vi. for y^ which
sclau^ders and rumor among y^ Romans then Henry y^ second of y^ name son
to Conradus y^ rained Anno.1039. who came into Italy with a great army puisau^t,
where he assembled a great cou^ceyl general / and so deposed these.iii.
sysmatykes bishops y^ is to wete / Benedictus the.ix. syluester the third and
Gregorye the.vi. and he created bishop of Rome, y^ bishop of Baynbergh in
Almayne, who was named clement the second / who was poisoned by his successor
Damascus the second of y^ name also. And thus to com to our purpose of the
foresaid Benedictus / the.ix. which was the cause of much evil in the.xiiii.
sysme / and sold his papalytye some stories hold this fantasy / or opinion of
him after his death / was that he appeared in facyon of a strange and wonderful
lykenes monstrous and horrible / of whom was demanded the occasyon of this
wonderful form / and state might signefye / he made answer that through the
just judgment of God / he was thus condemned to be eternally / for because
he lived so bestially in y^ sege appoholyke, and thus through y^ perturbacions
of the wicked bisshops, the turks and sarasyns oppressed so cristendome and
lost the holy la^d with jerusalem An.1012. y^ time.

Of the.xv. sysme appesed by the emperor Henry the third.
THis time rayned emperor Henry the third in almayne the which was
Anno.1057. began the.xv. sisme and dyscorde in the Church / y^ cause hereof was
that after the death of besshop Nycolas / the second borne in Sauoy / was elect
the bishop of Luke borne in Myllane, this man was chosen by y^ Cardynalles of
Rome / and they named him Alexau^der the second / this bishop had a good and
virtuous name where as he was resydent / and after his elexcyon y^ cardynalles
came to him to accompanye his person to Rome.

And so anon after his coming to Rome / certain bishops Lumbardye could
nor agree with him / because he would not of their band and affynyte / whereupon
began the.xv. sysme / because some held opinyon and said that he entered by
symony (this pre^^ted) they thought to have one of their affinyte mete for
their purpose / through the inuestigacion and counceyll of gylbert bishop of
parme in lomba^dye, so these companyons cardynalles held fast together as
burres in a cluster (and obtayn^d against henry the.iii. emperor to chose an
other bishop of rome in his place to their own purpose and mind. And herupon
the Emperor and they accorded and so these cardynals entered in to lu^bardye,
where they g^dred a counceyll among them selves, whom was co^sulted to chose
one named Cadollus borne in parme, marvelous rich puyssaunt and peryllous to
the which all Italy were agreed,

This is cad^llus chosen in the place of the papal see, as an antypape and so
in short time drew himself toward rome with a mighty power / and a great
army of lu^bardys, against alexander bishop of Rome who was acco^panyed with
a great army of romans in likewise to withstand him / and inconclusyon this
batailles encou^tred, the which was sturdy, strong, and sharp, under the
mountain gold / where as was slain pytefully much people / but in fine the
victory turned on Alexaunders side / and so returned Cadollus vaynqueshed /
yet notwithsta^dynge he lost not his courage / but or it was a year passed /
through secret conspyresyes of some of his affynyte / the which secret
company he obtained by many within Rome / which ran sodaynely unto armies,
and so by Cincius saneofo the prouest of Rome / conuayed Cadollus in to the
castle angel / and so finally byforce of his enemies he was feign to yield /
and pryuely bought his life of certain souldyers / for.vi.c. marks and was
^orssed and flede and so to please the emperor Henry the.3. which favored y^
said Cadollus / he caused a cou^ceyl to be assembled at mantua to the which
came the said emperor and Alexaunder bishop of Rome / and there Alexaunder
pourged him before all that noble presence to be clean of y^ crime of symony /
and of ambysyon / and so the one forgave the other of all grudg^s and thus
fynyshed the.xv. sisme.

Of the.xvi. sisme which arose by a bishop of Rome / a black moncke / which
b^gan to lift up his horns, against the power of y^ emperor, whereof arose
great evil and rumur.
Within a little and short time after the.xvi. sisme followed much like / the
other / for after the death of Alexaunder the second succedyd Gregory the (...)
borne in senys in touskayne by the p^ocurement of y^ said black monk legal in
france / which in contynent after the elexcyo^ began a great discord /
between the bishops of Rome, and y^ emperor, which engendered great debates
and myscheuous euylles innumerable over all crystendome as it shall appear
herafter.

For in the time that this foresaid emperor was busyed / and had great to do
with his wars against the Saxons his enemies, this foresaid gregory bishop
of Rome / which was co^fyrmed by the Emperor / for at that time no bishop
could be in Rome / without the full consent and confyrmacyon of the emperor and
thus began this Gregorye the.7. to sporne with an arrogaunt mind / inhybytynge
the emperor to meddle with any ecclesiastique auctoryte / upon pain of the hye
sensuris and curse of the church of Rome, nether that he should give nor admyt
bysshoprych, nor benefyce within his Empire / for they made pretens that the
Emperor did sell the dignytes of the prelacy in his Empire / the which this
arrogau^t Bishop would have the sale of y^ merchandise himself as other of
his predycessours had done in times past of auncyaunt institucyons / and of
right and old customs.

These things were strange news to the emperor Henry / but that time he
feigned with a fair cou^tenau^ce / because of y^ great business y^ he had that
time i^ the wars of y^ saxons / yet notwithsta^dynge this arrogaunt bishop
left not his purpose but procedyd against him, and sent forth curses and
exco^munycatyons against certain bishops that held with the emperor / thus
in short conclusyon the emperor had vyctory of the saxons, and assembled in
contynente a general counceyll in the city of wormys upon the ryne / and
there was concluded, that through all his Empire that none so hardy should
supporte any Cardynall nor mayteyne court nor co^systory that partayned to the sea of Rome, nor to any of his assystens, and thus they should forsake them and
obey his commandment and iniunceyons in Almayne.

Uery long and tedyous it were to this abbreuyacyo^ / to excyte and set forth
the wonderful feats of war, with dyfferences and alteracyo^s and
appoyntementes y^ were and happened between this gregory the seventh and henry
y^ third emperor of almaine, gregori gave out a great curse against
the emperor and his bi^shops / and the emperor created another bishop named
Clement before called gylb^rt archbysshop of Raue^na / and he was created and
elected by a counceyl in Germany / and this bishop Gregory gave his tytyle to
the duke of saxon named Radulphus / but thus in conclusyon after.iiii.
bataylles faughten / he was co^uye^ and slain by the said emperor Henry the
fourth. And after these vyctorys and cru^l bataylles / this said emperor sent
first his son Henry y^ fourth to Rome to subdue the pride of this arrogau^t
bishop gregorye the.vii. and of his adhere^ces / and in this time / was there
dame mehault countess of Mantua / which was an Appostasa / an ypocryte /
sturdy / and ha^dy / more then became any woman / which resysted the emperor in
y^ bishop of Romes cause / which was also overcome (...) slain, and thus
this foresaid emperor came to Rome byforce / and he brought with him clement his
antypape / and there consecrated him and was intronysed or crowned / and so the
bishop Gregory y^.7. which was the very occasion of all this mischefe and
evil was beseged and afterward escaped by the hands of Guyschard y^ normande
prince of poylle / which conuayed him / yet notwithstanding he lived not
long after (for dolor and sorrow) and this gregorye was he y^ made many new
and strange co^stitucions, he ordained that prestes should have no wives, and
that they and their wives should not dwell together, and y^ no man should here y^
mass of h^ y^ held or keep a co^cubine, and he ordained y^ no person should
ete flessh on ymber days, and also y^ none should ere flesh on y^ saterdayes,
and troth to say this Gregory was to arroga^t and rigorus as storys writes,
thus by y^ death of gregory y^.7. the 16. sisme was almost abolysshed but not
all hole, for his successor named vyctor the.iii. abbote of the mount cassyn
would gladly have sustained the same opynyons which his predycessour held
against y^ emperor but he was soon constrained to y^ contrary which dyed
other by preuy sycknes or by poison / and after him succeeded vrbanus the
second which meddled nor enterprysed little of these foresaid matters, and so
this man came in to france, where was holden a great counceyll general at
cleremount in auernia, wherein he moved al chryste^dome to have war / against
the infydelys and to recover Jerusalem with the holy land / by whose mocyo^
was gadred universally through all chrystendome the greatest army that ever
went i^ to the holy land / and godfray de bullyon was the chief captain thereof
as apperethi^ the second part of this book.

Of the.17. sysme which arose by certain quarelles y^ the bishops of Rome
moved against y^ emperors.
PAscal the second of his name borne in tuskane was no les then a dyscyple of
Gregorye the.7. which succeeded urban the.2. yet he did no less then his
predycessours did / for he began his quarrel against y^ emperor supportyng the
papal dygnyte / so this matter hangyng Godfroy de bullio^ with al other cryste^
princes held strong war and batayls against y^ sarasyns in surrey, in y^
which time they conquered Antioch and Jerusalem Anno d^i.1099. which was.492.
years after the sarasyns wan it first in the time of Heracle emperor.

After this y^ forsaid pascal some what hye minded holding hye countenance
against Henry the fourth of that name emperor, he sent his army against
gilbert / called Clement antipape elect in Almayne by the emperor henry the
third and this army was well enforsayd and strengthed by Roger le Norma^de
Prince of Sycyl / which sent him many men of armies, and also a thousand
ouncys of gold to maintain his souldyers with al thus was this antipape for
lack of help constrained to fle the city y^ he lay in, and flede to save
himself into the hands of Richard de Cha^payne of Napl^s, and so after in
short time he dyed for sorrow and dyspleasure. This Rychard Earl of Champayne
in Naples, which favored this said antypape gylbert called Clement, he set up
an other antypape named al^ertus, borne beside Naples, which within short time
was deposed / and the inhabitants of Rome / chose another whose name was
Theodorus, the which within a houndred and.v. days revoked his auctorite and
became an hermit and so the third was chosen called maginus, a cytazyne of
Rome / which took the title and auctoryte of the bishop of rome at Raue^na /
which was afterward over thrown by the romans.

And after al these things yet the foresaid Pascal bishop the second of that
name recovered sertayne lands of the church of Rome / byforce of armies and so
he came into France to reform the church.



Into France came this said Pascal the second in y^ time of king phyllyp the
first, and gathered a counceyl attroy in champayne / and it appears in the
second part of this book / for the reformacyon of the church / and so after
this said counceyll he returned toward Rome / whereas Henry the fourth was
come before him / to be crowned emperor / where as this emperor took prisoner
this said bishop Pascal / and all his cardynallys, prelates, and curtasans /
and so set them at liberty again / when he had recovered his right and
title / that was taken from his predycessours for admyttyng / the fre Elexcyon
of bishops of Rome / and the first fruytes universal of the bishops and
prelates and benefysed men / to be at the Emperors pleasure, as his right and
title was and after y^ emperors departing they revoked all that they granted
/ and thus was business new to begin again.

Of the.xviii. sysme
THe.xviii. sisme began bytwe^ Gelasius the second bishop of Rome, borne in
Gaiectan, successor of the said Pascal the second / and another antypape
called Benedictus a spanyard elected by Henry the fourth because of his title
of elexcyons inuestures of the spyrytualtye, so this said Gelasius came in to
france / and dyed at Clugny / and in his place was chosen bishop of rome
calixtus y^ second archbysshop of Uyenne in Dolphyne / and thus Benedictus
before named antypape, which held himself strong in Italy in the spyte of the
said Gelasius bishop / and Calixtus his successor did in lykwise withstand
Gelasius to his power but shortly in conclusyon he was vaynquyshed in plain
batayl / and taken by the ayed of the french men / and the captain of them /
as the cardynall of sen^ Grisigone / and so set this Benedictus upon a camel
and trussed his vysage / toward the camylles tail, and so was led to rome in
dispyt tryumphau^tly with shame, thus fynyshed the.18. sysme.

Of the.xix. sisme.
THus after the death of Calixtus of Burgony / Honorius the second of that
name borne in Ymola in Italy succeeded the papasy / the which kept it peasybly
the term of.v. years and died / and after him succedyd Innocent the second of
y^ name borne in Rome / i^ whose time began the.xix. sisme, and the occasyon
there ^f was for raysyng wars against Roger le Normande / which was called
king of naples / which withstode him with all his power / and so between them
both was much murder and blood shede on both parties, but in conclusyon this
said bishop innocent was vaynquyshed in battle raygned* and taken prisoner by
Wyllyam duke of Calaber / sone to the said roger king of Naples, and yet was
he honestly entreated, and afterward delivered. And so in the mean season
that this Innocent the second the foresaid bishop was prisoner / the romans
chose another called Peter of Lion son of a mighty rych cetezyn of Rome / and
he was called Anacletus, for the which elexcyon / Innocent was inforsed to go
into France for socours / and at Cleremonde assembled the second counceyll /
and another at Rayns i^ Champayne in the time of king Lowys le gross / and
from thense he came to Lyege / where as he found y^ king of romans Lothayre
the second of that name, who promised him assyste^ce with all his power / and
thus what by the help of the emperor Lothayr and the french men, he returned
the second time into Italy, with great power, which was Anno dn^i.113^. and
thus was Innocent restored to his papacy again, and Anacletus the antipape was
deposed, and spoiled of all his treasure and reliqus of the Church to pay the
soldiers withal, wherefore he died for sorrow and dyspyte.

In certain time after y^ bishop eugeny the third of y^ name borne in pysa
and before a monk of saint Barnardes, one of his discyples / which came in to
France for two purposys, the one was for the Ingerys and dyspleasurs of the
Romans, the other was to monysh the king Lowys to move war upon the turkys
in the holy Land / as it is more plain in the second party of this book and
gathered a cou^ceyll at vezelay, after y^ which time he returned to rome again
peasible with the help of y^ king Lowys.

Of the.xx. sisme which was in y^ tym^ of the emperor Frederyke the first of
his name, called Barbarousse and this sisme endured.xvii. years.
Even of the same root and presyde^ce y^ before time has grown / y^ is to say
for couetyse / which always rayned in y^ see appostolyk / such like causes
engendered this.xx. sisme / that is to wit only / for admyttynge the clergy
in to benefyces and possessions / and who should have the first fruytes /
which began in the time of Frederyke barbarousse Emperor / which was a
marvelous man and prince of slaueny / who married in the countess of Bourgonye
/ and because he had perc^yueraunce and knowledge what ingeris and
displeasures, his pre^^ss^ssours had in time passed with the bishops of Rome
by vyolence and unjust cause / he conceived so greatyre, and displeasurs /
against the^, for it that he scourged them in such wise that there was never
sen^ so great dyuysion between the Empire and the bishops of Rome / in somoch
y^ the consequence was yet well worse that followed / for in the beginning of
the raygne of this said Emperor, which began to raygne Anno.1154. this sisme
was begone between Alexaunder the.3. borne in senis, chosen and elect by the
souerau^ce of.xxiii. cardynallys / and an other named Octauyan a romayne /
which was chosen by.3. cardynallys special and named him victor.

So this Alexau^der thynking to have good right / made a friend by an
enbassetou^ unto the emperor Frederyke barbarous which as y^ time lay sege
before the city of Cremona in lumbardy / and that he should set adirexion among
these a^^ypapes, the which Emperor to set a v^yte and concord commanded
them both to mete with him at pay^ie, and there he would mete with them / unto
the which Alexsander would not consent, for the which cause he abse^ted him
self th^s and so incontyne^t frederyke without auctoryte assembled a cou^ceyl
at pauye, where the said Octauyan was present, and there was decreed y^ he
should posesse y^ see appostolyke and was confyrmed ma^g^e the will of alexander
y^ third. And i^ these causes the said Alexsau^der exco^munycated the emperor
frederyk barbarous, and so frederike took up y^ patrymonie and profytes of
saint Peter / otherwise called the profytes of y^ church, for y^ which cause
this alexander fled from rome into france, in the time of phylip augustus, and
there assembled the third counceyll at cleremound in auernia as we have
expressed in the second part of this book, in the which cou^ceyll Alexander
the third named by vyctor antypape, excomunycated octauian emperor, and in
this time y^ emperor discomfited millan and dertome, because they were
rebellyo^s, and after sent an enbassade^ to king Phyllyp to find the mean to
destroy this sysme then in the church.

The place of this apoyntme^t was co^se^ted to be at dygyo^ in burgoyne / which
was Indyffere^t for both princes / for y^ emperor frederyk lay on y^ borders
of burgoyne which came thither with a noble company with his queen and the king of
boheme and with y^ king of scotts and their Antypape with them named vyctor with
a great no^bre of me^ of war with the^ yet would not Alexander come there
saye^g y^ / y^ place was not indyffere^t for his person nor yet co^uenye^t to
keep such a cou^ceyll which only pertayned to his auctoryte / wherefore this
unworthy Emperor with his antypape full of ire and thretnynges / returned into
Almayne with great displeasure and so when the forsayde antipape was deed / there
was created three antipapes successively one after the other, and by this mean
Alexsau^der was feign to fly out of rome to Uenyse in a strange habyt, and i^
all this time was war through al chryste^dome and al by y^ occasyon of these
sysmes and errors y^ arose by these antipapes, and stoborne bishops of Rome /
and fynably the city of Jerusalem was lost again in this season and wone by
the turks, and sarasyns, also the said Emperor made that time a great vyage
in to Turkey / and a prosperous, and victorious, unto his death the which was
great pity / for he was drowned in bathtynge himself in a river / which was a
great desolacyon to al his army / and a dyscomforte to al crystendome so
soudayne a chance.

Of the.xxi. sysme / which was in the time that the court and see of Rome was
holden at Auynyon.
CLement bishop the.v. of that name borne in burgony was the first that mo^ed
the sea of Rome to Auinion, as I have wryt^^ plain in the second part of this
book / and after the death of him, the sea of Rome / stood vacant the space of
two years / three months, and.xvii. days. For because y^ cardynalles could
not agree at that elexcion and counceyl of carpentras / in so much that they
fell together and fought / in the which arroure was slain two of the chefyste
Cardynalles / and this hurl burley, in short time after they gathered a
cou^ceyll at lion, and they held their co^claue within the black freres called
our lady of conforte, where as they concluded to have John^ the.xxii. of y^
name borne in Cauors Anno dn^i.131^. and some writers say that he was chosen by
king Lowys, and Phyllyp his brother kings of France / and his brother
countye of poyeters.

After the coronacyon of y^ said John^ the.xxii. of y^ name, he kept his
resydence in Auynyon, and for his first act he exercysed a marvelous justice
/ against Hew bishop of caours / the which bishop was taken with a co^spyrasy
/ against the bishop of Rome / John^.xxii. for the which he was degraded / and
delivered to the hangman / and cruelly put to death so in this mean season
Lowys de bauaria king of romans over came in batayl duke Frederyke of
Ostrich, which took upon him because he had y^ corone of myllan he would
usurp thempyre of Rome without auctoryte / against the which John^ bishop
aforesaid / withstode with great indignation / with diverse censurys and curses
against y^ said king of bauaria, which was called nycolas the.v. which caused
the.xxi. sysme which seassed not unto y^ boniface count de Pisa took prisoner
this said antipape / the which raised a great decyme through all the church of
France under color to goo against the sarasyns with a hole cross, for the
which was money gathered and he did pretend nothing less / and in this.xxi.
sysme among the valdays and y^ commons of Lion / arose and engendered many great
heresies.

Of the two and twenty sisme longest incontynuaunce / and most sclaunderous
among all other / for through it / the land of Boheme became full of
heresies.
THis.xxii. sisme continued forty years / in the which season was many bisshops
of rome one against another / which was so obscure and crafty that al y^
clargy in crystendome were troubled therewith / to judge to whom partayned the
right and just title and who should possess the just patrimony of saint peter /
called these appostolyke / some said the one / and some opinion of the other,
by the which dyuysion the bohemes fell in great decay and heresies / as then it
was taken and called because partly it prete^did against y^ usurped maiesti of
y^ bisshops of rome and against their fylthy deceytfull c^uy^ousnesse invented
for their own lucre for money / and pylled and robbed all the world many years
/ and clean against all gods law and holy scripture / as now it is
euydently perceived, that the light is at his lybertye, and not darkened as it
was then, and these be the here syes y^ the Bohemes held as then, was that y^
bishop of Rome / was a bisshope of no hyer preeminence / then other bishops
be / each for his particular dyoses / also they held that there was no
purgatory to be remitted by their power / also that it was vain and
unprofitable to pray for souls ons passed this life, but held opinion that it
was a profit invented by the covetousness of Priests only for lucre / also
y^ images of Christ and of saints, were not to be worshypped nor to stand in
sight, for it was Ydolatry / and also that all the orders of F^eres beggars was
not of God / but invented by the deuyllys craft / also that no priest nor
bishop should possess no temporalytes another in auctoryte nor in iurisdiccion
/ these were great heresies / as y^ time required, as now many may have
experyence.

And so to proceed and come to our purpose of the.xxii. sysme / it began the
year of our Lord a.1378. y^ was anon after the court of Rome / was removed
from auynion to Rome again, by the mean of bishop Gregorye y^ eleventh of
that name borne in Limogis / as I have written more plainly in the second part
of this book / where as I wrote of two cou^cellys holden at Paris / in the time
of king Charles the syxt.

Thus that I may come directly / and follow the courses of these sysmes / Ye
shall understand that in the year above written / the.xxii. sisme began in the
time of Gregory the.xi. the which removed y^ ^ee appostolyke from Auynion unto
rome, then at y^ time the cardynallys were divided in two bandys, or partys,
and so the cardynallys of Italy set up Urban the.vi. borne in naples / and the
French cardynalles, set up Robert of Geneua / who was called Clement the.vii.
and he kept his see in auignion because of this sysme, thus al cristendome was
divided in two partys by the wilfulness of these two monstrous Antypapes /
being a strau^g sight as it were a man to have two heddes / and so this sysme
infected the oryent parts of Italy, Almayne, Hungory, which gave obedience to
Urba^ the.vi. on the other part France, spain, England, held with Clement
the.vii. which was the occydent part.

In the time of this great dyuysyon / Lowys duke de aungeoy, which favored
bishop Clement the.vii. which held his auc^orite in auynyon, and so entered
into Italy with.xxxi. thousand horse men of armies / party for the Realm of
Naples, and also to socoure queen Ione against king Charles of Hungry, as well
as for the dyfference that was between the two bishops aforesaid antypapes,
and to thend to give clement the hole auctoryte, but in conclusyon, this said
duke of aungeoy son of king John^ y^ was prisoner in England fell sick and
died within the space of two years in the land of polonya, before he had
fynysshed his said wars, for the which this said french men departed thense
into france again, and this foresaid bishop Urban, yet could not live in
peace with Charles king of Hungry and of naples, but was constraynt to flee out
of Rome, to Gennes by see where as in y^ passage he caused to be drowned.v.
Cardynallys / which were great friends of this said clement in auynyon, and
did favor him greatly, and thus this foresaid queen Ione sold auinion and the
cou^ty of venyse, unto Clement the.vii. but some stories wryt y^ they changed
for y^ tribuit, which y^ realm of naples ought to y^ church of rome.

For to return and write yet further of bishop Urban the.vi. and of the.xxii.
sysme ye shall understand that this said bishop as stories do wryt was / a
very perverse man, the which took great pleasure to sow disce^tions / and
debatys among christian princes sooner and raither then to set peace, unite, and
concord, the which dyscordys and debaytes were not apeased long after his
death / and thus long endured this sysme / and so in his place was chosen
Boniface the.ix, borne in Naples / y^ which was not above.30. years of ^ege,
and this bishop boniface was he that usurped, and took the auctoryte from y^
Romans / and so transported it / and brought it to the set of the bishops of
Rome / and so fortefyed the castle aungel against the Romans / also this
boniface began to raise y^ exactions upon the (...) / for all benefycys through
all chrystendome (only except y^ realm of England) and in his time was the
gerat Iubelee universal.

So on the other part after the death of ^lement the.vii. was chosen another
bishop Antypape at Auynyon / by the consent of the Cardynallys of France
called the bishop of the moon / after named benedictus the.xiii. against whom
was holden a counceyl in France as it is written in the second part of this /
the which enforsed and enlarged this sysme the which perceuered and continued
unto the counceyl of Constaunce during / the which time this said benedictus
of the moon supported his obstynat pleasure, and so co^tynued in his
wylfulnesse unto the end of his life.

Thus when Boniface the.ix. was deed in Rome before written / the cardynallys of
Italy chose another bssshop of Rome called Cosmian of Perouse, who was named in
the sea of Rome Innocent the vii. and after him succedyd gregory the xii. a
venecian, sometime called Angelus be corario / thus worse and worse was the
sisme, for yet all this while rayned in auynyon Benedictus of the moon / which
held his full auctorite as an antipape unto whom came as enbassatoure / the
duke of burgonye and of berry and orly^unce / from king Charles the.vi. the
which king desired this bishop of the moon / to be persuaded from certain
points / the which he usurped, and that he might be set in his right and just
auctorite / and also y^ the bishop Gregory the.xii. his fellow should do in
likewise, unto the which this bishop of y^ moan would make no auswere / but
fled secretly into spain for fere of losing of his dignite and so y^ barons
returned with displeasure without answer / and there this Bishop held a
counceyl at perpignan / and there held him sure in a strong castle / called
Paniscolle.

Thus when the christian princes / and cardynallys saw that none accord nor
appoyntement could come to pass / between these two / papystes bishops of
the sea of Rome / but contention and strife, and that none would come to the
right / though they had promised it before / so then was there gathered and
assembled another general counceyll at Pysa in Italy y^ year of grace of our
lord.1408.

In the which cou^ceyl was a syted personally to appear / both the papystes
bisshops solemply according to their estate yet for all this they little
regarded this apperaunce, but held it as a scorn indyrysion / the one as well
as y^ other / for the which they were both deprived and deposed, and in their
places chosen Alexsander the.vi. borne in the isle of Candye / a friar minor /
the which lived not after full.v. months / and dyed in bollone le grass /
and after his time gregorye the xii. which held him in Austrych, yet
notwithstanding he thought not himself there not in suretye / but he
returned again into Italye, and there held him in the city of Armyne under
y^ proteccion, of a baron named charles y^ evil hedyd.

In this time all y^ possessours of the church of Rome were ready in an uproar
and in armies toward batayl / for this Alexsaunder the.v. which had frendys
as y^ king of Naples / with diverse other so this alexsaunder lived not long /
but after him was chose^ bishop a cardinal of naples named Balthazar ^ossa /
which was afterward intytuled / John^ the xxiii. and so in this time was in
crystendome.iii. antipapes / the one at Bollon^^ grass / the other in Armyne /
the.iii. in the castle of Panyscole in Spain / yet notwithstanding for the
deposition of these two bishops at the counceyl that is to say of Gregorye
the.xii. and y^ foresaid Bene^ict of y^ moan / all christian nations consented
unto / except some of Spain and the ^ynge of Skottes, the which fa^oured the
said Benedictus of y^ moan.

And thus after this foresaid counceyl which was gathered against Gregory
the.xii. which came not personally / to this counceyl / but sent his debytes
duke les evil heddyd / lord of Armyne with other procuratours / and so
contented to resygne the right and just title / that he held from the emperor /
and yielded up his dignyte papal in Rome / and put it into the hands of the
counceyl / and so fynably he was there created legate / and marquys de Ancona
where he dyed not long after for sorrow.

Thus was these two stoborne antypapes consumed / so yet rests the third
ydoll and antypape / that is to wit Benedictus the.xiii. surnamed the bishop
of the Moon / the which put this said good emperor Sigismundus to much
unquietness and pain / for after the foresaid ydolles antypapes were deposed /
and y^ this of the moon would not come to no appoyntement nor concord / by no
perswasyon, then this said Sigismundus the emperor went personally to the King
of England / and so returned by the king of France / and all this was to
set unite in the christian church and concord whereof he had good answers, and
from thens went to Narbone to Fardinandus king of Aragon / for the same cause,
all this was to persuade the styffe obstynacye of the bishop antypape of the
moon, the which fury could not be overcome by no manner of ways and thus this
said emperor returned again to the counceyl of constance, where as he
depryued and deposed the said evil bishop of the moon, and so was there chosen
by the consent of all Chrystendome, bishop Martyne the fyfth of the noble
house of collonyois, a man esteemed of synguler virtue and prudent moderat and
just Anno domini, M.cccc. and.xvi, and thus came peace in to the church and
so ended this.xxii. cursed sysme.

This bishop of the moon incontynente after he was deposed by a hole
general councey^^ and depryued of his papalyte, And so seeing that all his
friends were constrained to forsake him, thus in conclusyon he dyed in his
obstynacye in the castle of panyscoll, And in his restament charged his
Cardynalles to chose an other ydoll antypape in that place, to succeed him /
named clement the.viii. borne in barfylonne, and as the storye says he lyted
reioysed of his dygnyte / for the foresaid bishop Martyne the fyfth held and
kept the sea / and auctoryte papal honorably / for all christian pr^nces and
dukes held with him as they had chosen him at Constau^ce / and so fynably this
Clement the eight gave up his dignyte / and became bishop of Maior^.

Of the three and twenty sysme.
Between Felix the fyth and Eugenius the fourth / followed the three and twenty
sysme / and this said Eugenies had great pleasures in wars / he was a
venecyan borne / as Platina historial writes of his life, which propryete is
very strange among meke and good bisshops, for in his wars he syted the
Dolphyne of France, which afterward was lowys the eleventh king of France
of that name, that he should come with a great company of men of armies to raise
and trouble the counceyl of Basyle against Felix his adversary, y^ was chosen
by the said counceyll whose name was Ame duke of Sauoy sometime an holy
heremyte / and thus shortly to conclude this.xxiii. sysme that which was
between Felix and eugenie which continued.xvi. years till the death of of
eugenius / whom succeeded N^colas the.v. borne in the town of sarasanne / in
y^ lordshyp of luke sone to a physytien who was chose^ Anno.1447. and at this
time the church was in diuysion in three parties for the one allowed Eugenius /
and the other Felix / and some neither of both and were not content with the
one nor with the other / and inconclusyon it was determined by the emperor
Fredericus the.iii. that felix of sauoy should be constrained to give his
dignyte and profit to the said Nicolas / and this felyx was content to be come
Cardynall / and Lega^ appostolyke over al countries to se peace and unity
universal / and thus ends the.xxiii. sysme / and yet notwithstanding al
decrees and acts / which the said Felix did in his papalyte / was confyrmed
to be good / and so dyed in good estymacyon and holiness. etc.

Of the.xxiiii. sysme / which contyneweth to this day as we have had, and have
experyence of.
ANd so brefly to proceed / and conclude / the.xxiiii. sysme began in calixtus
days whereof I make no mencyon / because mine auctoure leueth there at the
xxiii. ^^sme as he then having no delight nor pleasure to write thereof, because
the abuses and abhomynable vices / and enormytes be to tedius to wryt /
specially of the arrogau^t abhomynacyons, sysm^s, bataylles, blood sheddes,
luxury, symony, buggerys, treasons, poisons, with in numerable vices, to much
abhorryng all Civil living, and vrbanyte / what shall I say there is so many
now lyu^ng that which have experyence of the ly^e and acts of some of these
antecristyans bisshops of Rome following, and specyal^y Julius the second,
that I can wryt no more of pope holy living and ypocrytall deceyt and
dissymylacyon and extorsi^n and so to proceed.

After Nycolas rayned Calixtus the third / who rayned.iii. years. Anno
dn^i.1455. then rayned in england Henry the syxth crowned in France.

After him rayned Pius the second. Anno dn^i.1458. in Henry the.vi. time.

sysme which long has endured, and yet more largely shall appear to the hye
honor of God / and to the great tranquilite of all christian regyons / for the
which let us all give lauds and prayer to god, that antechryst may be known
apparently in his own nature and kind in the ^yes and hearts of all christian
people / and that he may be utterly confounded with all his assystence and
adherentes tradycyons and sects, thus fynysheth this little abbreuyatyon, and
follows the conclusyon of the auctor.

Here follows the co^clusyon of this book.
IT is to be understand that things concerning prophesyes and things to
come, we have no certain determynatyons nor yet just judgments of, as
concerning the veryte and truth, yet it is written y^ the world according to
scryptures shall fynysshe by fire elymentall. Also it is written in scripture /
as the appocalypsis witnesses, that before that time Antechryst shall apere
before al people and shall be known, and after the antechryst openly known /
shall the great and horrible sysme appear / the twenty and four yt which so
long has been hyddyn before the people / for the which crystyen kings and
princes shall be in enforsed / and constrained to set to their power to resyst /
and to s^t reformacyon in the church catholyke universal, as it has been
reuelated by inspyracyons and reuelacyons dyuyne / as appears by the appostles
/ prophets / sybylles / saints / ancient astronomyers, and metamatisians,
whose inspyracions has set forth a great part of the coming of such like
things.

Yet notwithstanding al such prophesyes and pronostycations / as has been
written / yet remains stories and wrytynges of diverse and of many other holy
persons dyuyne / which had reuelacyons / as these auctours following boccase /
saint vincent / de valentia / abbat Ioachym of calabre / raymundus lullius
reuelacyons of saint Brigit beside certain pagans / which I make no mention of
/ yet notwithstanding I would ye no person should obstynatly stand fa^te in
any like proph^syes and sayenges as an ar^icle of scripture nor to give faith
there unto none otherwise / then the catholyke church will it admit / and so
a^ all such sente^syes written and set forth in la^yne / to the intent y^ all
people may perceive of whense they be and of whom and so follows now the hole
substance of all things / that is before written penned and declared by the
most noble orator master Alayn charter / which wrytcth this sentensyes word
^or word in the end of his book called L^xil, whereof I do translate but a
part which is expedyent / and serves for this time.



In old times past was decreed in ye latyne church now called Rome as
concerning y^ sacreed ordinance of maryege with y^ dignite of priest hode,
which* was pretended under y^ color of clennesse and chastity without spot,
yet notwithsta^di^g now is allowed y^ statute of co^cubynage / which is clean
co^^rary against al statutes decreed by gods laws or of clean living / but
rather following al sensualy^e and bodily lusts and pleasures / and it is to
be judged y^ the makers of such statutes or decrees were more apt unto au^^ice
and covetousness through the procuracyon of symony with diverse other vn^efull
ways stryfull with process corrupt as by benefyces prelacions spyrytual /
which ar defiled and spotted with wordly cures busynes temporal / and thus
largely writes stories of the greek church and the latyne also as concerning
the ambylyon and dishordinau^ces of priests and relygyous persons / and men of
the clargy / which was only the cause of the seperacion of the people of
boheme, and also of other nations of the churches of Rome / what shall I mean
of Boheme / none other then al christian regyons / for the prelates of the church
with their adherentes has so abhominably and fylthily enfected not only them
selves or their estate, but al crystendome / y^ they have given occasyon to be
disdayned of all christian people / both great and small / and to be holden as
strangers dishobedyent to the holy catholyke church of christ through the
baroynesse / who were clean desti^ute of their dyewty of cle^e and holy
mynistracyon and living / and have set fur^h and used all unlawful tradycyons
and vain lu^uryous works of ba^dry and for^ cac^on / I may not wryt so large
with my (...) as I culde / only for to utter to much their abhomynacyon for
man's eres to here or iyes to read.

And if I should say all that I think I should say plainly the ex^esse and
fatness of the goods temporal meddled with the hot sulfure of envy / with the
hete of ambycyon and lechery / has made them ready to put the fire into the
Church / but this matter is of to deep inuestigacyon / and y^ determinacio^s
doubtful, though there be experyence and proffe thereof ynowgh / so with this I
hold my peace / but yet I pray unto him, which consecrated our mother the holy
church with his blood (that which I do think follow not) pity has caused me to
wryt this, wherefore pray we all to god, that al christen princes may perceive
their dyewty regal / and to set forth gods word prosperiously universal
according to gods will / and to reform all such enormytes and s^smes /
which antechryst has deceived us by which we may avoid to y^ hye honor of God
and tranquyl lyte of all christen regyons. Amen.
