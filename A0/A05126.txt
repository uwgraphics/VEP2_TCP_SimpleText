A TRVE DESCRIPTION OVT OF THE WORD of God* of the visible Church.
AS there is but Genes 1. 1. Exo. 20 3,
one God and Father of all, one Lord over all, and one Spirit: So is there but
1. Tim 2. 4. Phil. 2, 25. Ephe ^. 18. John 8. 4^
one Truth, one Faith, one Salvation, one Church, called in one hope, joined
in one profession, guided by one Deuteronomy. 6. 25. Rom 10, 8. ^, Tim. 3, 15 John 8,
51 1. John ^. 3. 4. etc.
rule even the Word of the most high.

This Church as it is universally understood, conteyneth in it all the Genesis
17. 1, Pet. 1. 2, Revela. 7. 9. 1. Cor. 10 ^ John. 17, 10.
Elect of God that have bin, are, or shall be: But being considered more

every one here has fredome and power (not disturbing the peaceable order of
the Church) to (...) his complaints and griefs, and freely to reprove the
transgresions and errors of an^e without exceptions of persons.

Here is no John. 10. 1.
intrusion or cli^ing up an other way into the sheepefolde, then Acts. 1. 23.
and 6. 3. and 14 23.
by the holy and free election of the Lords holy and free people, and that
according to the Lords holy and free people, and that according to the Lord
Ordinance, humbling them selves by fasting^ and prayer before the Lord,
craving the direction of his holy Spirit, for the trial and approving of his
Gifts, etc.

Thus they orderly proceed to ordination by fasting and prayer, in which 1.
Tim. 4. 14. and ^. 22.
action the Apostles used layinge on of hands. Thus has every one of the
people interest in the election and ordination of their officers, as also in
the administration of their offices upon Luke 17. 3. Romans 16. 17 Col. 4. 17.
transgression, offense, abuse, etc. having an especial care unto the
inviolable order of the Church, as is aforesaid.

Likewise in this Church they have holy Mat. 5. 19 1. Ti. 1. 18.
laws, as limits and bonds, which, it is lawful at no hand to transgress.
They have laws to direct them in the choice of every officer, wat kind of
men the Lord will have. Their Pastor must be apt to Deuteronomy ^3. 10 Mal. 2. 7.
1. Tim. 3. ^.
teach, no young Scholar, 2. Ti. 2. 15
able to divide the word aright, Tit 1. 9. 2. Tim. 4. 2
holding fast that faithful word, according to doctrine, that he may be able
also to exhort, rebuke, improoue, with wholesome doctrine, and to convince
them that say against it: He must be a man that loves goodness: he must be
wise, righteous, holy* temperate: he must be of life Tit. 1. 7. 8
on reproueable, as Gods Steward: he must be generalie well reported of, and
one that rules his own household under obedience with al-honestie: he must be
modest, humble, meek, gentle, and loving: he must be a man of great Numb. 1^.
7. Isay. 50. 4. Iere 3. 15. Eze. ^^. 18. Acts 20.
patience, compassion, labor and diligence: he must always be careful and
watchful over the flock whereof the Lord has made him overseer with all
willingness and chearefulnes, 1. Pet. 5. 1. 2 ^ 3* 4,
not holding his office in respect of persons, but doing his duty to every
soul, as he will answer before the chief Shepherd, 1. Tim. 2. 20 1. Tim. 3.
etc.

Their Doctor or Teacher must be a man apt to teach, able to divide the word
of God aright, Titus. 1. 2. Tim. 2 15.
and to deliver sound and wholesome doctrine from the same, still building upon
that sound ground work, he must be mighty in the Scriptures, 1. Cor. 1, 17
and 2, 4. (...).
able to convince them gainsayers, and carefully to deliver his doctrine pure,
(...)
sound and plain, not with curiosity or affection, but so that it may edisie
the most simple, approving it to every man's conscience, he must be of life
unreprovable, one that can govern his own household, he must be of manners
sober, temperate, modest, gentle and loving, etc.

Their Elders must be of wisdom and judgment: endued with the Spirit of GOD,
able to discern between cause and cause, Numb. 11. 24
between plea and plea, 2. Chro 19. 8 Acts 15. 1. Tim. 5.
and accordingly to prevent and redres euilles, always vigila^t and intending
to see the statutes, ordinances and laws of God kept in the Church, and that
not only by the people in obedience, but to see the officers do their
duties. These men must be of life likewise unreprovable, governing their
own families orderly, they must be also of manners sober, gentle, modest,
loving, temperate, etc.

Their Deacons must be men of honest report, having the mystery of the faith
in a pure conscience, Acts. 6. 2. 1. Tim. 3. and. 9
endued with the holy ghost: they must be grave, temperate, not given to
excess, nor to filthy lucre.

Their Releeuers or Widows must be women of 60, years of age at the least, 1.
Tim 5. 9. 10.
for auoydinge of inconveniences: they must be well reported of for good
works, such as have nourished their children, such as have bin harberous to
strangers: diligent and serviceable to the Saints, compassionate and helpeful
to them in adversity, given to every good work, continuing in supplications
and prayers night and day.

These Officers must first be duly proved, then if they be found blameles,
^. Tim. 3. 10
administer, etc.

Now as the persons, gifts, conditions, manners, life and proof of these
officers, ^. Cor. 1^. 12 1^.
is set down by the holy Ghost: So are their offices limited, severed, and
diverse:

The Pastors office is, Leuit. 10. 10 11.
to feed the sheep of Christ in green and wholesome pastures of his word,
and lead them to the still waters, Number. 1^. ^.
even to the pure fountain and river of life. Ezekiel 44. 23. and ^4. 33.
He must guide and keep those sheep by that heavenly sheephooke and
pastoral staff of the word, Psalm. 23. John ^1. 15.
thereby drawing them to him, thereby lookinge into their souls, even into
their most secret thoughts: Thereby discerning their diseases, and thereby
curinge them: applying to every disease a fit and convenient medicine,
according to the quality and danger of the disease, Acts 20. 1 Pet. 5. 1.
and give warning to the Church, Zacha, 11. 7
that they may orderly proceed to excommunication. Revel. 2^. 2.
Further, he must by this his sheepehooke watch over and defend his flock from
ravenous beasts and the Wolf, Luke 12. 42.
and take the little foxes, 2. Cor 10. 4. 5 Heb. 8. 12.
etc.

The Doctors office is already set down in his description: Ezech 33. 1.
His special care must be, 1. Cor. 11. 19
to build upon the only true grounde-worke, Ioh. 10. 11. 22
gold, silver, and precious stones, Leuit. 10. 10
that his work may endure the trial of the fire, and by the light of the same
fire, Ezech 44. 24.
reveal the Timber, Hay, Mal. 2. 6,
and Stubble of false Teachers: he must take diligent heed to keep the
Church from errors. ^. Cor. 3. 11
And further he must deliver his doctrine so playnlie, 1. Cor 1. 7.
simply, 2. Tim. 4. 16 and 6. 20.
and purelie, that the church may increase with the increasing of God, Ephe. 2.
20.
and grouwe up unto him which is the head Christ Jesus. Heb. 6. 1.


The office of the Auncientes is expressed in their description: Numb. 11. 16
Their especial care must be, Deus. 16. 18
to see the ordinances of God truly taught and practiced, 2. Chro. 19. 8
asweell by the officers in doing their duty vprightlie, Exodus 39. 42
as to see that the people obey willingly and redilie. 1. Tim. 3. 15
It is their duty to see the Congregation holilie and quietly ordered, 2.
Tim. 1. 13
and no way disturbed, 1. Cor. 11. 16 and 14. 33.
by the contentious and* disobedient, froward and obstinate: Gal 2. 5. 5.
not taking away the liberty of the least, Colos 1. 16.
but upholding the right of all, wisely iudgginge of times and circumstances:
Acts 20.
They must be ready assistauntes to the Pastor and Teachers, 1. Pet. 5. 1.
helpinge to bear their burden, Romans 1^. 8.
but not intruding into their office.

The Deacons office is, Acts 6.
faithfully to gather, and collect by the ordinance of the Church, the goods
and be^euolence of the faithful, and by the same direction, dilige^tlie and
trustilie to distribute them according to the necessity of the Saints. Romans
12. 8.
Further they must enquire and consider of the proportion of the wantes both,
of the Officers and other poor, and accordingly relate unto the Church that
provision may be made.

The Relieuers and Widows office is, 1. Tim. 5. 9.
to minister to the sick, lame, weary, and diseased, such helpefull comforts
as they need, by watching, tending and helping them. Further, Romans 12, 8
they must show good example to the younger Women, in sober, modest, and
godly conversation, avoiding idleness, vain talk, and light behavior.

These Officers, though they be diverse and several, yet are they not severed,
Luke. 9, 46.
least their should be a division in the bodle, John. 13. 12,
but they are as members of the body, having the same care one of another, ^.
Cor. 12. 12 ^ 25. ^8.
jointly doing their several duties to the service of the Saints* and to
the edification of the Body of Christ, Ephe, 4. 11. 12. 13. 16.
till we all meet together in the perfect measure of the fullnes of Christ,
by whom all the body being in the mean while, thus coupled and knit together
by every joint for the furniture thereof, according to the effectual power
which is in the measure of every part, receives increase of the body, unto
the edifing of it self in love: neither can any of these Offices be wanting,
without grievous lamenes, and apparent deformity of the body, yea violent
injury to the Head Christ Jesus.

Thus this holy army of saints, is marshalled here in earth by these
Officers, Romans 12,
under the conduct of their glorious Emperor CHRIST, 1. Cor. 12.
that victorious Michaell. Thus it marches in this most heavenly order,
Revel. 14. ^. 2
and gracious array, against all Enemies both bodelie and ghostly. Revel. 12.
11,
^ Peaceable in it self as Jerusalem, terrible unto them as* Cant. 6. ^.
an Army with banners, triumphing over their tyraimie with patience, their
cruelty with meekenes, and over Death it self with^dying. Thus through the
blood of that spotles Lamb, and that Word of their testimony, they are more
then Conquerours, Romans 8, 38, 39.
brusing the Head of the Serpent: yea through the power of his Word, they have
power to cast down Satan like lightning: Luke 10. 18. 19.
to tread upon Serpents and Scorpions: to cast down strong holds, and every
thing that exalts it self against GOD. Mat. ^6, 18.
The Gates of Hell and all the Principalities and powers of the world, Rom 1.
^3. 39.
shall not prevayle against it.

Further, Mat. 16. 19.
he has given them the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, That whatsoever they
bind in earth by his word, John. 10, (...).
shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever they loose on earth, Mat. 18. 18.
shall be loosed in heaven.

Now this power which Christ has given unto his Church, John. 20. 23.
and to every member of his Church, to keep it in order, Mat. 16. 16. and 18.
18.
he has not left it to their discretions and lusts to be used or neglected
as they will, Deuteronomy 12. 32
but in his last Will and Testament, Revel. 22. 18.
he has set down both an order of proceeding, and an end to which it is used.

If the fault be private, Leuit, 19. 17. 18,
private holy and loving admonition and reproof is to be used, with an inward
desire and earnest care to win their brother: Mat. 18. 15.
But if he will not hear, Deuteronomy. 19. 15
yet to take two or three other brethren with him, whom he knows most meet
for that purpose, Mat. 18. 16.
that by the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word may be confirmed: And
if he refuse to hear them, then to declare the matter to the Church, which
ought severely and sharply to reprehende, gravely to admonish, and
lovingly to persuade ^he party offending: showing him the heynousnes of his
offense, and the danger of his obstinacy, and the fearful judgments of the
Lord.

All this notwithstanding the Church is not to hold him as an enemy, ^,
These. 3, 15.
but to admonish him and pray for him as a Brother, proouinge if at any time
the Lord will give him repentance. For this power is not given them to the
destruction of any, 2. Cor. 10. ^ and 1^. 10.
but to the edification and preservation of all.

If this prevail not to draw him to repentance, Mat. 18. 16.
Then are they in ^he Name and power of the Lord JESUS, with the whole
Congregationn, reve^entlie in prayer to proceed to excommunication, casting
him out of the covenant and protection of the Lord, for his disobedience and
obstinacy, 1. Cor. 5. 5.
and committing him to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the
Spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus, if such be his good will
and pleasure.

Further, Mat. 18. 17.
they are to warn the whole Congregation and all other Faithful, 1, Cor. 5.
1^.
to hold him as a Heathen and a Publicane, and to abstain them selves from
his society as not to eat or drink with him, etc. unless it be such as of
necessity must needs, as his Wife, his Children and Family: yet these (if
they be Members of the Church) are not to join to him in any Spiritual
exercise.

If the Offense be public, 1. Tim. 5. 20
the party is publicly to be reproved, Gal, 2. 14.
and admonished: if he then repent not, Io^^ ^7 19.
to proceed to excommunication, vt supra. 2, Cor. 7. 9.


The repentance of the party must be proportionable to the Offense, Leuit. 19
18,
viz. Pro. ^0. 12.
If the Offense be public public: Romans 12. 19. and (...). 10 and 14. 1.
If private, private: humbled, submisiue, sorrowful unfeigned, giving glory to
the Lord. Gal. 6. 1. 2. Mark 9. 50, Ephe. 4, 29. Mat. 18. 15. Lam 5. 15. 19. ^0.


There must great care be had of Admonitions, that they be not captious, or
curious finding fault where none is. Neither yet in bitterness or reproach, for
that were to destroy and not to save our brother: but they must be carefully
done, with prayer going before, they must be seazoned with truth, gravity,
love and peace.

Moreover in this Church is an especial care had by every Member thereof,
Luke. 1^. ^.
of Offenses: The Strong ought not to offend the Weak, Pro. 10. 12.
nor the weak to judge the Strong: Romans 14. 12. ^ ^9.
but all graces here are given to the service and edification of each other in
love and long sufferinge. Gal. ^. 2.


In this Church is the Truth purelie taught, and surely kept: Gen, 1^.
here is the Couenaunte, the Sacraments, and promises, Isay, 44. 3.
the graces, the glory, the presence, the worship of God, Gal. ^ 23.
etc. and ^. 1^. Isay. 60. 15. Deuteronomy, 4. 13 Isay. 56. 7 1. Tim. ^ 15. Isay. 5^.
^.


Into this Temple enters no unclean thing, Isay 52. 1
neither what so ever works Abominations or lies, Ezekiel 44. 9.
but they which are written in the Lambs Book of life. Isay. 35. 8. Zach 14.
^1. (...), 21. 27.


But without this CHVRCH shall be dogs and En^haunters, Romans ^. 9.
and Whoremongers, Revel. 22. 19.
and Murderers, and Idolatours and who so ever loves and makes lies.
