Unto the devout reders / Rychard whytford priest and professed brother of Syon
/ in our lord god and most sweet savior Jesus Salutacyon.
MAny devout persons / specially religyous / when they done send forth
works of their own making / their own gaderynge / or translacyon / done use
customably to reteyne (of mekenes) their names: which thing I do not
disco^mende / but rather do I praise them therein: notwithstanding I beseech
you good devout reders / take none occasyon in me / though I do contrary / that
is to say / though I (knowing that my poor labor and doing in such things
/ is no thing worthy praise: and also that mine own conscience does not
require any manner thank praise / or other te^porall or worldly reward but
only does desire the spirytuall profit of the reders or herers) though I say
/ do set forth my name unto every thing that I send forth / not (as I said
for ambicyon / our lord unto wytnes) but rather to expowne and offer my self
unto just correcyon: where unto I do in most humble manner submyt my self. And
also an other cause why I do so set forth my name / is that I have herd of
diverse works that be^ found in prynt as faderles childer without auctours /
that be^ not only ye less regarded because they ben with out auctours / but
also ben suspected / as not holdyng and keeping ye right path of christianite. I
would therefore none other person should be reproved ne blamed for my deed / but
rather that I should my self (as the common proverb says) drink such as I
brue. Trusting therefore in your charity / that ye will ascrybe apply / and
take all thing unto ye best / we have sent forth this martiloge / which we
did translate out of latin in to english / for the edificacyon of certain
religyous persons unlearned / that daily did read the same martiloge in latin /
not understanding what they read. And the addicyons for their more
edificacyon / we gadered out of the sanctiloge / legendaurea / catalogo
sa^ctorum / the chronicles of Antonine / and of saint Vince^t / and other diverse
auctours. I beseech you of your christyan favor and charitable prayer. I shall
humbly beseech our lord that all you / according unto the very purpose and
effect of our mind may profit in the redynge hereof. Valete. Our lord god
and most sweet savior Jesus send us all his mercy and grace. Amen.

The said wretch of Syon Rychard whytford.
