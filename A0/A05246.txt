To the right honorable his singular good Lord and Master Sir Edward
Seymoore. Knight, Baron Beacham, Earl of Hartfoord, and Lieftenant of his
Majesty's Counties of Somerset and Wiltes.
IT is a question hardly to be determined (my most honorable Lord) whether
Music may esteem her self more graced by the singularskil and exquisite
knowledge wherewith your Lordship is endued, both in the speculation and
practice thereof: or by the many benefits, and infinite favors your
Honorable bounty has conferred on the professors of that faculty: in both
are the muses greatly honored, and we (their servants) highly blessed; whose
virtuous endeavors and studious labors, not in this only, but in many other
kinds of Learning, have received their life; growth, and perfection, chereshed
and enabled by the warmth your beams have cast upon them. Amongst many, that
on the Muses behalf do owe your Lordshippe the tribute of their pens, I
must profes my self to stand deepliest engaged in the debt of duty, in that
the poornes of my merit holds least proportion with the largenes of your grace,
and that my utmost desert can reach no further, then humbly to acknowledge,
that what delight or sweetenes soever these my simple travels may bring to such
generous and well composed spiritsas bear affection to this quality, was
inspired meby no other power then the influence of your favor. And though the
error of conceit cannot make me so far ouervalew them, as to esteem them
worthy your Lordships judicious hearing, yet I will confess their want of
worth (wherewith my self as an impartial censurer, have already justly taxte
them) could not divert my purpose from publishing to the world the zeal I
bear to thankfulness: wherein I am ambitious of nothing but your Lordshippes
favorable acceptance and protection, which if it may please you to vouchsafe
to this first birth of my Muse. I shall then be as far from fearing
detraction and censure, as I am free from affecting glory and praise.

Your Lordships most humble devoted servant, John Bartlet

Love is a deadly thing to deal withal.
Yet where the wretch does take a happy vain,
It is the kindest worm that ever was,
But let him catch a coy conceit again,
In frantike fits, he does a fury pass,
So that in sum who hopes of happy joy,
Take heed of love, it is a perlous boy.
