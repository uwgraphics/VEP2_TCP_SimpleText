THE Portracture of Sir THOMAS OVERBVRY Knight. AETAT. 32.
Overbury blazon or coat of arms His Epitaph written by himself
The Span of my days meassur'd, here I rest
That is, my body: but my soul, his ^est,
Is hence ascended where neither Time,
Nor Faith: nor Hope, but only love can clime,
Where being more enlightened, She does know
The truth of all, men argue of below:
Only this dust does here in (...) remain,
That when the world dissolues she come again.
Tho: Ouerburie

Compton Holland excudit



Those Swan-like notes, sung so inspiredly
to thy untimely fall, prove most exact
Line's drawn from Life: and thy swift Tragedy
shows but thine own Souls Prophecy in Act.
Thy Name, and Virtues five: To kill thy Mould
was all Imprisonment, and Poison could.
But thy more-heauenly- Self, from double chains
set free (at once) Thy Body, and the Tower,
In that Supreme impartial Court remains,
where nor Ambition, Envy Lust have power:
Redeemed from poisonous plotts, from Witches charms,
from Weston's and the Apothecaries harms.
W. P.
