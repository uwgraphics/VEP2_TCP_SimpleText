Here ends the Table / here after follows the Prologe. Laus Deo
O Thoughtfull heart / plonged in distress
With slo^bre of sloth / this long wynters night
Out of ye sleep of mortal heaviness
Awake anoue / and look upon the light
Of thylke sterre / that with her bemys bright
And with the shynynge / of his stremes merye
Is wont to glade / all our emisperye.
And to oppress the derknes / and the doole
Of heavy hertes / that sorowen and sighen often
I mean the sterre / of the bright poole
That with her bemys / when she is alofte
May all the trouble assuage / and assofte
Of worldly wawes / which in this mortal see
Has us bysette with great aduersite.
The rage of which / is so tempestyous
That when the calm / is most blandisshynge
Then is the storm / of death most perilous
If that he want / the light of her shynynge
And but the sight: alas of her lokynge
From dethes brynke / us to escape
The haven of life / of us may not betake.
This streme in beauty / passith Plyades
Both of shynynge / and of stremes clear
Boetes and Artur / and also Iades
And Esperus / when it does appear
For this is Spice / with her bright spear
That toward even / at midnyght and at morrow
Down from heuyn adawith all out sorrow.
Whose bright beams shynyng fro so far
That clouds blake may the light not steyne
For this of Jacob / is the fair sterre
That under wawes / never does declyne
Whose course: is not under the ecliplyke line
But every lyche of beauty may be seen
Amyd the arc / of our meridyne.
And dries up the bitter terys wete
Of Aurora after the morrow graye
That she in weeping both on flowers flete
In lusty Apryll / and in fresshe May:
And causes Phoebus the bright summers day
With his way^^ gold borned bright and (...)
To enchase the mys^^^ of our cloudy air.
For this is the sterre / that bare y^ bright son
Which holds the spear / of Judah in his hand
Whole stremes ben / out of Iesse co^^e
To (...) light both in see and land
Whose glade bemys / without eclipsynge stand
Estwarde to us in the Oryent full shene
With light of grace to void all our tene.
Now fair sterre / o sterre of stetrys all
Whose light to se / Angels delight
So let the gold dew of thy grace fall
In to my breast / like scalys fair and white
Me to enspyre / of that I will endyte
With thylke bawme sent down by miracle
When the holy ghost / the made his tabernacle.
And the lycoure / of thy grace shede
In to my pen / to enlumyne this dyte
Through thy supporte / that I may proceed
Somewhat to say in laud and praysynge of the
And first I think / of the natiuyte
So that thine help / fro me not twynne
Benygne lady / anon to begin.
Here ends the prologe.
Here begins the birth of our most blessed lady maid / wife / and mother
of our lord Jesus christ / compyled up dan John Lydgate / monk of saint
Edmondes: Burye At the excitation and sterynge of the noble victoryous prince /
King Henry ye fyfthe.
A flour of virtue / full long kept in ^^^os
Full ma^e was / wholesome leuys foot
Only by grace / upon the stalk a^oos^
Out of ^else / spryngynge from the ro^s
Of god ordained / to be re^uyte and bot^
Unto mankind our trouble to determyne
Full long beforne / by pres^^^ns deuyne.
The which ^^ou^e preserves man fro death
Unto the virtue / who so ^yst take heed
That in a gardyne / amyd of Nazareth
(...) fair sometime began to spring a sprede
That through the world both in length and bread
The flesh odoure / and ^^^o the swetnesse
H^^^^s comfort of all he^ h^^upnesse.
O Nazareth / with bethlem the beside
This ^loure the makes / of name more ^yall
Than other Rome: ^late and full of pride
O mighty Troy / with the s^ou^dy wall
Who^e renown holds to be peregall
In honor / price ^ame / or reverence
Unto your passing worthy excellence.
If for the fruit co^mendyd be the tree
Thou have more laud and commendacion
For thy ^ke flower / spring out of the
Than has Aus^^ike or worthy Scipyon:
Of Rome Caesar / or of Fabyon
Though her names / were sotyme grave in gold
Her ydel fame / to thine may not be cold
Therefore rejoice / and be right glad and light
O Nazareth / of name most flourynge:
For out of the flower / most fair of sight
Most full of grace / sometime did spring
Of the which / fully remembrynge
So long agone spoke holy ysaie
When that he said / in his prophecy.
That on this flower / plainly should rest
The holy ghost / for his chosen place
As for the fairest / and also for the best
That ever was / and most full of grace
Whose passing beauty / no storms may defface
But ever a like / contynueth fresshe of hew
Withouten fading / the color is so true.
For this is y^ flower / that god himself beheld
The white Lelye / of the chosyn vale
The sweet Rose / of the fair field
Which of color / waxith never pale
The vyolet / our langour to auale
Purpyll he wyd / through mercy and pity
To socoure all that in mischyefe be.
And from the stock / of Ioachym and Anne
This holy flower / had her origynall
To him before by sign / y showed when
The angel told him plainly / that there shall
Of him be borne / a maid inspeciall
Chosen of god / most chief of her alye
And for her meekness / hight shall Marye.
And when the Angel / at the yate of gold
Had of this maid the birth prophected
And all the manner / of hem both told
In books old / as it is specifyed
Home to her house anon / they have them byed
and she conceyueth this faithful treue wife
^y Ioachym / the holy truyte of life.
Out of the which / began grow all our grace
(...) sorrows fully for to ^y^e
(...) plainly to ^^^^ace
Of ^he ^^^yme / called Serpentyne
For that when* (...) / had months nine
(...) this ^r^y^e ^o holy and ^^^^^re
Through the gra^^ of god anon it did appear.
(...) the Oryent to glade al mankind
(...) dedely error oppressyd of the night
With ^lowdes blocks / and with skies blind
Till they were ^leryd / with fayrenesse of y^ ^yght
Of the which the angel sometime had a sight
With (...) wrastlynge / from him as he ^rayed
So long a^^orne / to him when he said.
Let me depart / withouten more affraye
Against me / and make no resystence
The night is passed to the morrow graye
The fresshe Aurora so sayre in appearance
Her light dawith / to void all offense
Of winter nyghtes full long and tedyous
With n^we apperynge so glad and gracyous.
This is to say / the holy dawning
Of th^^ maid / of her natiuyte
The night began void / of our old morning
Is the Angel / in figure dydse
With such a touch / made Jacob be
Sore: in his senewes / like as it is found
In thy^ke member / where lust does most hab^^de.
In figure only / that there should spring
Down by dyssent / out of his kynrede
A ^^ene maid in will / and in worchynge
Pure of intent / both in thought and deds
With Aurora / with his beams read
The night avoided / with his copes done
^fore the vp^yst / of the bright son.
Right so this maid / at her natiuyte
The night of death / avoided has away
(...) bright Calendys / most lusty for to se
Of Phe^^s vpryst / withouten more delays
For ^he is Aurora / sobrely this is to say
Out o^ which / as Prophets began deuyse
The son of lyte / to us began first deuyse.
Of whose birth / full many a day beforne
A^o^m^zat wrote in special
And said a maid sothely shall be borne
Under the sign / above celestyall
That called is / the sign virgynall
The which maid / as he ^ke tell can.
Shall ^ere a child / without spotte of man*
And as Mynerue mother of prudence
Ie hold a maid / right so is this heavenly q^^^e
B^re in her womb / the fade^^ sapience
And mother was and may den clean
Of god provided / plainly for to been
So coure to man and help in all our need
When she was borne this flower of wom^^hede.
How our lady was o^^^yd in to the temple Capi..iii.
ANd alter three year a^ was the usage
^er moders ^appi^ she left as in sowk^^
(...) than ^none / in her under age
Unto the temple / o^uou^ly they (...) bring
(...) unto god they made osterynge
(...) this maid for to abide there
With other maidens* that in the temple were.
And not withstandyng / her passing tenderness
(...) ^re^^ youth but of y^^^s three
^horowe gods help this branch of holiness
Withouten help / went up gree by gr^s
^y^^en^ alo^^^ that all myghten se
^ofore that altar o^ ^o great an hight
And when her mother thereof had asight.
For very joy / anon she ^ylle a down
And said thus / that all my g^^en here
God from above hand herd myn^ ory^on
Of his goodness / and granted my prayer
And comforted (...) (...) (...)
In syg^^ of hem that (...) at my pain
And of malyc^ / g^n at me di^da^ne.
Now has he ben my synguler refute
To my trystesse consol^cion
For he has made / the dareyn^ to bear frut^
Through his mighty v^^itacion
And made clear / my confusyon
And all me woo / for to ouergone
Only by grace / amyd all my fone.
And through his might / y^ hertes has bowyd
Of him that began to chase / at my pride
Wherefore she has / unto god auowyd
That her doghter / shall in the temple abide
The holy ghost for to be her guide
For ever more / by gods purueyaunce
Through her meekness / him to do plesaunce.
Forth all her life / there to sleep and wake
Him for to serve / with humble par^ytenes
That all maidens / might ensample take
Of her alone / to live in clennes
And specially / of her me^enes
Be^yg^e port / t^^^^naunce and chere
If that him lest / of herthey might lere.
Full of virtue / de^oyde of all outrage
Her heart was / that god to dwell in there
And day (...) day / ^yght as she we^e in age
Right so in virtue / began she to encreace
And night ne day / would she never ceace
To exclude slouthe / and vices to werraye
With hand to worche / or with mouth to pray.
For but in god / her heart naught delyteth
So upon him entierly was her thought
And from above by grace he her vysiteth
That every thing / but him she set at naught
Of worldly lust / she has so little thought
That out of mind she let it ever slide
That naught but god / may in her abide.
And when that she xv. year did attain
She was as sad in conversation
And also demure / sothely for to said
From all chyldehede and dissolution
In governance and discresion
And in talking / as wise and sage
As any maid / of thyrty year of age.
Of the conversation of our Lady in the Temple. Ca..iiii.
ANd of her rule / this was her usage
From day to day / this holy maid entyere
From pryme at morn / by contynuaunce
Till three of the bell / to be in her prayere
And till the son / was at mydday spear
On gold and silver / and on wulles so^^e
With her hands / she would wyrche often.
And (...)
From god (...)
Which that (...)
Thanking (...)
And after (...) / anon this may de is went
Again to (...) / till (...) went to (...)
And at (...) with him she took her rest.
This life she (...) / and this course ^he go^th
In whom was (...) / yet found offense
And never man saw / this maid wr^th
But eu^^ meke / and (...) of pa^^enc^
Of heart clean / and pu^^ of concience
This life she led / and as b^kes teache
Of words ^ewe / and wondersoft^ of speech.
The meat also / that was to her brought
Out of the templ^ / for h^^ (...)
With heart glad^ / and with a (...) thought
To poor and ^^^y / that ly^^d in p^nau^c^
To ye^e it ^r^ly / was all he plesaunce
And who that ^uer / of her has a sight
Of all disease / was made gl^^^ and light.
And every wight / greuyd with sekenes
A touch of her / ^ade hem hole anon
And they ^^at were / in thought and in des^res
When they her s^ / he^ malice was agone
And thus she was to every ch^ue
Of all (...) / r^^^yte and remedy
With a beholdyng^ / of her godely eye.
And of this (...) as it is told
Her godely face / was so full of light
That no man might sustain to ^eh^lde
For it was clerer / than the son bright
That the crown / in the wynters night
Of Adryanne / ne of the sterres seven
To her fayrnes / ne be not for to neuen.
Yet never man tempted was to sin
While he beheld on her goodely face
The holy ghost / so hoole was her within
That all enuyrone spredde began his grace
Where that she was present in the place
For always god gave her to her presence
So fulsome light / of heavenly influence.
Ne none so fair / was never found in ryme
As was that maid of Judah and Syon
The daughter chosen of Iherusalem
Of Dauidis sede / to besette alone
Of all maidens / to reken^hem euerychon^
She bare the pryse as well in fayrnes
As she excelled / in virtue and goodness.
Let be thou greece / and speak not of Eleyne
Ne thou Troy / of young Pollycene
Ne Rome of Lucresse / with her eyes tweyne
Ne thou Cartage / of the fresshe queen
Dido that was sometime so fair to seen
Let be your boost / and take of hem no head
Whose beauce fails / as flower in frosty mede.
(...)
And Judith (...)
And Ber^abe / of (...)
And Rachell fair / Jacob can you tell
But she alone of womanhede the well
Of bounte / beauty / that never fade may
Naught like a flower th^^ storysshed but in may.
Passes echone both nyghe and far
Both in fayrnes / and in perfeccion
Right as the son / does a little sterre
And as the Rubye has the renown
Of stones all and domynacion
Right so this maid / to speak of holiness
Of women all / is lady and maystres.
Of whom spoke sometime wise Salamon
In sapience / woso list to seek
That she was chosen / for herself alone
This white down / with her ^yen meke
Whose chekes weren he beauty for to eke
with lylyes meynte and fresshe roses reed
This is to say / who so can take heed.
First with the Rose: of womanly sufferaunce
And with the fair lylye next of chastyte
She was ennewed to give her suffysaunce
As well in goodness as in beauty
And as he says she fayrer was ^ose
Than ou^her Pheus / platly or Lucyne
With horns full of heaven / when they shine.
And of this maid / as saint (...) says
In his writtynge / her beauty to (...)
Of face fair / but fayrer yet of faith
He says: she was this holy pure virgyne
Whose chaste heart / to nothing did enclyne
For all her beauty: but to holiness
Of whom also / this auctour says expres.
That she was daughter / of David by diss^nt
Sterre of the sea / and gods own ancille
Even in this world / alwey of one ^nten^
And gods spouse / his hestys to fulfill
And ever ready / for to do his will
Christ's temple / and also receptacle
Of the holy ghost / and chosen tabernacle.
The yare of bruen* and also the fayrnes
Of women all / whosoever looks a right
Of may denhede / lady and princes
One of the five / that ^are her lamps light
Ready to mete / with her spouse at night
Full prudently / away ^ynge at the yare
That for no stouthe / she came not to late.
In figure the* the chaundelabre of gold
That sometime / her seven lamps shene
This is to say / the recey^^ of the hold
Of god preserved / for she was so clean
Through her merit / endewed for to been
By grace of him / that is of power most
With the seven yestes of the holy ghost*
How one lady receynge the seven yestes of the holy ghost. Ca. v.
THe first yeste* was the yeste of dread
To ^fthe (...) ^he thing th^^ shall god disples^
The next pity of very women head
To rewe on all* that she saw in disease
The third conuynge / god and man to please
The fourth str^ng the / th^r^ we her steadfastness
Only by virtue / al vices to oppress.
Of counceyll the / she had excellence
To keep her pure in virgynyte
For ay with counceyll / ^^yed is prudence
Of understanding / eke the yeste had she
For god him self / chose with her to be
And of wisdom / so god list her ^uaunce
To know erhe thyuge / that was to his plesau^ce.
She was also / the Trone void of sin
That stands so royal / in gods own sight
To fore which seven lamps brenne
With heavenly fire / so spyrytuall of light
That never wast / but ever alyche bright
Continued in one / here above in heaven
By the which Trone: and the lampesseuen.
Is understand / this maid most entere
With seven virtues / that in her were ^ounde
That sometime were^ / with ghostely light so clear
Through light of virtue / in w^rd^ly ^^co^nde.
Only through ^ence / that did in her (...)
And all they / were grounded in me^enes
Her light to god: more pleasauntly to distres.
For faith in her / had a ground so stable
That it was void / of all doublenes
Her hope of trust / was also mayntynable
Ro^yd in god / by parfy^e sykernes
Whose charity / so large began him dres
That up to god / hasted ran the fire
With heart of clennes / to all by desire.
Str^nge in virtue / prubent in governance
She has also conveyed with clennes
And ^oueraynly / she had attempetaunce
In all her works / with great aduysione^
And ever annexyd / unto righwysnes
within her heart / of womanly bounte
She had of custom mercy and pity.
Sothfaste ensample also of chastyre
As says Ambrose / she was in thought and ded^
And treue myrrour of virginite
Of poorte benygne / full of lowlyhede
As humble of chere / and feminine of dread
Prudent of speech / of what she list to show
Large of sentence / and but of words ^ewe.
To pray and read / that was ever her life
Of heart w^^er: by devotion
To god alwey with thought contemplatyfe
Full ^eruent (...)
And ydel never from (...)
And specially / to (...)
Her hands was (...) ^edy at the ^ede.
And full she was of compassyon
To rewe in all that ^alt woo or smerte
Well wylled ever / with hole affeccion
To every wight / so long was her heart
Sad with all this / that her never asterde
A look a ^^s / of her eyes fair
So close of sight was this debonayre.
And in Psalm of holy prophecye
To look and read / she found most desyte
And ^dan she saw / and found in Isaye
Of Cristys hyrthe / how he did write
To god she ly^^e / her tender hands white
Besechyng him / she might abide and se^
The blesfull day of his na^yuy^e.
And in the book of Elyzabeth
That ^yrulyd is of her auysions
I synde how this maid of Nazareth
Said every day / seven orisons
That called ben her peticions
With humble heart / this blesfull young maid
Full lowly knelyng even thus she said.
How our lady prayed to god for seven peticions. Ca. v.
O Blisfull lord / that know the entente
Of every heart / in thine eternal sight

Upon my fete / in all my best wise
Go unto her / for to do service.
And to that flower of vyrgynyte
Grant also lord / that I may have space
Mekely to bow and knele upon me knee
Under supporte / only of her grace
And to honor the goodly young face
Other sone / as she does him wrappe
In clothes soft lyggyng in her lap.
And love him best plainly to my last
With all mine heart / and mine hole service
Withouten change / while my life may last
Right as thy self lord caust best deuyse
So that I may in faithful humble wise
In all this world / no more grace attain

And to thy grace also lord I pray
To grant me to fulfill in deed
Holy the statutes / and mekely to obey
Within the temple / as I here hem read
For but thou help / I may no thing speed

Therefore to serve / with heart and hoole courage
And where they err / lord on any side
Or thou do right / let mercy be her guide.
And thus this maid / always day by day
In the temple makith her prayers
To please god / what she can or may
The chyef resort / of all her desires
Till she attain / to fourtene years
With heart auowyd / both in thought and deed
For to continue in her maydenhede.
Of whose intent god / wot full unware
Wherein su^me of them / that in the temple abide
Of which a bisshope / called Abyathar
Cast him fully / for to set a side
Her purpose plainly / an so for to provide
That her auowe made of chastyte
Should not hold / but utterly that she.
Should be wedded sothely if he might
Unto his sone / of high affection
For that she / in every wyghtes sight
So passing good of condition
And to fulfill / his entencion
Abyathar byhoteth gold and rent
To the bisshoppes / to make her to assente.
To this purpose / and to her they gone
And what they may / they began her excite
And to afferme / to her euerichone
With sugared tongues / of many words white
That god above / does him more delight
In birthe of children / than in virgynite
Or any such / auowyd chastity.
And more in children / is honored in certain
And more in hem / has he his pleasaunce
Than in such / as ben not but barayn
Without fruit / through mysgouernau^ce
And holy writ / makith remembrance
That no man was sothely for to tell
Without seed / blessed in Israel.
To whom anon / with look down cast and chere
Benygnely / and in full humble wise
This holy maid / said as ye shull here
Certes quod she / yfye will you auyse
Which in your self / so prudent ben and wise
And well aduerte / in your discressioune
That Abell sometime had a dowble croune.
One for his faithful true sacrifise
Offryng to god / of humble heart and free
And another / as I shall deuyse
For he his body / kept in chastity
And Ely eke / as ye may read and see
For he in heart / was a maiden clean
He was rauysshed / above the sterres seuene.
Body and all / in a chare of fire
For he him kept / from all corrupcion
Therefore in vain / is plainly your desire
To speak with me / of this opynion
For god well knows / mine entencyon
How I have vowyd / as it to him is couthe
To be a maid / fro my tender y outhe.
And all my life / so forth to persevere
For life or death / only for his sake
From which purpose / shall I not disseuere
Through his grace / whether I sleep or wake
To keep and hold / I have undertake
My maydenhede / si^hen go full yore
Against which ne spekith to me no more.
And when they saw / her heart not mutable
But ever steadfast / of one affeccion
And ever eli^he / as one center stable
They have made / a conuocacion
Of all the kynredes / in conclusion
The eight day / for to come in fere
By one assent / to ^r^^e of this matere.
This is to say / that of old usage
O^ custom keep / for a memorial
That every maid / of fourtene year of age
Rich and poor / of the stock ryall
In the temple / no longer dwell shall
But be statute / shall be take and married
By the law / and no longer tarried*
And when they were assembled al in one
Isacar in opyn audyence
Began to pronounce / before hem euerichone
Full prudently / the su^me of his sentence
And said si^es / with your patience
So yt your eres offend not ne grieve
Declare I shall / my meynyng with your leave.
If ye remember sithen Salamon the king
Of Israel ceptre bare and crown
In this temple / so ryal in byldyng
Have young maidens by deuysion
Of custom had / her conversation
Both kings daughters and prophytes ache
As ye may find / if ye list to seek.
But to the age of fourtene year
Abyden here and no longer of spoke
As ye well know / withouten any were
And than be remeuyd from her place
And in her stead other did pace
As custom was / and each in her lynage
Delyuerd was unto marriage
And as a law it has be kept full true
Unto this time / in high and low estate
But now Marie / has fond an order new
To keep her clean and inuyolate
Against which / there help^th no debate
For of fre chose / and hertely volunte
She has to god / auowed chastyte.
Wherefore me seems / it were well sittyng
To her purpose / by good discressyon
First that we might fully have knowing
Of gods will / in this opynion
For thant were a more perfeccion
Her clean entente / as semyth unto me
And eke the stronger of auctorite.
First / that we might know verily
To whose keeping / she shall committed be
And they assenten / herto veraly
Withouten more / of high or low degree
And of accord / and of one unity
The prestes all begonnen to proceed
To cast lotte down by each kynrede.
The which lotte / on Judah fill anon
As I suppos / ethrogh goods purueaunce
And Isacar among hem euerichone
Purposed has a new ordinance
That every wight / of that allyaunce
That wyfles were / withouten more delay
Should bring a yerde / against the next day.
And to the bishop / highest of echone
Eueryche of hem did his yerde bring
Among which / Joseph had brought one
Though he were old / and passed his likynge
And he alone / made his offering
To god above / and a sacrifyse
In the old law / such as was the guyse.
And god to him / than did appear
And with the ye^des / bad that he should gone
And put them euerichone in fere
Insancta sanctorum / liggyng one by one
And in the morrow / to come again echone
Eueriche his yerde / to receive again
And upon which yerde / only were seyne.
A down appear / and up to heaven flee
He shall have / without more obstacle
Marie in keeping / so fair upon to see
As it is right / for the high miracle
And when they come / to the tabernacle
As ye have herd / the besshop deuoutely
Eueriche his yerde delyuerd by and by.
But utterly upon none them of all
At thylke time / was their nothing said
For gods heste / was naught ye ytall^
Other desire / to put hem in certain
Wherefore the bishop / with new fire again
Entered is in to the senturye
And while that he a while there gantarye.
Gods angel appeared to him new
Down fro heaven / by miracle lent
And told plainly / the heste of god was true
But how himself / was somewhat necligent
For to deliver by commandment
Every man his yerde / as he ought
And when the bishop aright him bethoughte.
He began remember / plainly in his mind
That of disdain / and wylfull necligence
The yerde of Joseph was left behind
Whereby he knew / that he had done offense
And began alone / to bring hit in presence
And took h^^ Joseph deuoutely in his hand
Among hem all there they did stand.
All behind disseueryd / from the pres
With humble chere / in the lowest place
And of this yerde / in manner recheles
Full stylle of port / with a dreedfull face
And when he did with his hand enbrace
His yerde again full debonayre of lok^
For Innocence of humble dread he quoke.
And suddenly through grace / about deuyne
All openly in every wyghtes sight
Upon the yerde of Joseph full benygne
Was seen a dow^e / of fetheris lyly whight
That toward heaven took the flight
And with one voice the people tho abrayde
And unto Joseph / all attones said.
Blessed art hou / and blessed is thy chance
Thy face blessed / and thine adventure
And blessed is thine humble attendaunce
And thou are blessed so long tendure
For to possede / so fear a creature
So good / so holy / now in thy passing age
So clean a maid / to have in marriage.
And she alone / by priests of the law
A^signed was / unto his governance
But sely Joseph / began him to withdraw
With humble chere / and shamefast countenance
And said certes / there is none accordaunce
Between her yougth / flor^sshyng in fayrnesse
And me / whom age with vnluste does oppress.
For she is fair and fresshe / as rose in may
And well I wot / also a maiden clean
And I am old / with white lock^s graye
Passed full fore / my tender years grene
Wherefore I pray you / to condsydre and seen
To accord discordaunt / says to me no more
Bitwene her beauty / and my lock^s hoar.
And when the bishop saw the humble intent
Of this Joseph / and the Innocence
And how that he to take her nolde assent
To him he said / in opyn audience
Joseph he said / take heed to my sentence
And be well ware / that thou the not excuse
Against the will of god / for to refuse.
This holy maid / assigned unto the
By open sign / which all the people say
Thorugh gods grace / and mighty volunte
Against which beware to dyssobeye
And think how he sometime made to deye
Ab^^on and Dathan / only for the offense
Done to him / of inobedyence.
Quod Joseph / that will I not in nothing
To gods will ne biddyng contrayre
But her accept / in to my keeping
For whom god has showed signs fair
Which is so good benygne / and debonayre
That I to her / will servant be and guide
Till for her / god list bet to provide.
And as the custom of the law hem bond
So made was the confirmacion
Be heste of wedloke / between hem hand in hand
And he her took / to his possession
With heart clean / and meke affeccion
But while he went to Bethelem the cite
Marie abide stylle in Galilee.
How Joseph vsyd the craft of a carpenter. Ca. ix.
AT Nazareth in her fathers house
Like her auowe of heart always in one
And five maidens the most virtuous
Of the temple where cosen out alone
Of the bishop with her for to gone
To wait on her / by humble attendaunce
In what they can / to serve and do pleasaunce.
Of which the first / called was Reyca
And Scepha the second / as I find
Susanna zabell and Abiega
The other three / as books maken mind
Which would never through sloth be behind
But ay in one / as it is specefyed
In work and prayer were occupied.
And unto him / as made is mention
That of living / so faithful weren and true
And diligent in occupacion
Delivered was sylke of sundry hew
For to make diverse werkis new
In the temple of intencion
Only to be in mynyst^acion.
And as it is put in remembrance
Eueriche her silk took by adventure
Like as her hand ^yll thereon by chance
But Mary as god tho shope her eure
The purpyll s^^ke took in to her cure
Of gracious hap / of sort without sight
The which color of custom and of right.
To none estate / is kyndely sytting
Of doubt to speak in special
But to the state only of a king
So that no wight / but of the stock ryall
By statuts old this color use shall
For by old time / ye should no man seen
In purpyll cladde / but other king or qu^ne,
Wherefore the sort full rightfully is fall
^^^^ly by dew disposicion
Upon Marye / that before hem all
By ligne right / is discendyd down
Of blood ryall / and by eleccioun
Of god above / was chosen for to been
For her merit of heaven and earth queen.
And mother eke / as ye shall after here
Of thylke king / that was clad in reed
Of purpyll hew / both face and chere
Down to the fete / from his blessed heed
When he of purpyll did his baner sprede
On Caluarye abroad / upon the rode
To save mankind / when he shed his blood.
And of this purpyll that I spoke of toforne
I find plainly how that Marye wroughte
Thylke veil / that was on tweyne torn
The same hour / when he so dear us boughte
Lo how^ that god in his eternal thought
Provided has by just purueaunce
The purpyll sp^ke / to his mothers chance.
How our lady is sete for an ensaumple of virgynyte. Ca. x.
BUt now / I leave this blessed maid there
In Nazareth / among her f^^des to dwell
Ledyng a life more par^yte and entere
Than any tongue / suffyse may to tell
For even like / as a fulsum well
Shedyth his stremys / in to the ryuere
Rtght so Marie / an ensaumpeler clear.
Gave to all by plenteuous largenes
Only virtue / upon every side
O well were they / to whom thou were maistres
And blessed eke / that might on the abide
To have by ensaumple / so virtuous a guide
And blessed was that holy company
That day by day / the seen with eye.
And blessid was the paleys and the house
In which thou had thy holy ma^cion
Fortuneth well / and wonder gracious
So humble was thy conversation
And blessed was also all the town
T^^^ce thou abode / and blessed the vyllage
O holy maid / where thou had hostage.
And blessed was the worthy table rich
Where day by day / thou wentest unto board
For in sothnes / the joy was not lyche
Of Cresus king / for all his rich horde
And blessed be they / that herden word by word
Of thy speech / and blessed the hour and time
Of all thy life / from even till the pryme.
O weelfull eke and gracious the sight
Of hem that myghten upon the behold
For well they ought / to be glad and light
That weren with the always when they would
And blessed weren young and old
That were reioysed with thy excellence
When that hem list of thy high presence.
O the joy / who could tell a right
Of thine heavenly meditacions
Assendyng up above the sterres bright
In thine inwardecon templacions
Or the blessed and holy vysitacions
Who can reherce / bright as son or leven
So oftesent down / to the fro heaven.
Or who can tell / thine holy slepes soft
With god always / full in thy memory
For love of whom / thou sighedest full often
When thou where sole in thine oratorye
Or who can tell / the melodye or glory
That angelys has made in the place
For the joy they had to look in thy face.
I am rude / to rehersen all
For uncunning / and for lack of space
The matter is / so mly spiritual
That I dare not so high a style pace
But lady mine / I put me all in thy grace
This iyrst book / compyled for thy sake
Of my symplenesse / and thus an end I make
Besechynge all to have pity and routh
That thereof shall have any inspeccion
If ought be left of necligence and slouthe
Or said to much of presumpsion
I put it mekely to her correccion
And ash mercy / of my trespace
There as I err / and put me in her grace.
And through her benygne supportacion
So as I can forth I will proceed
With all mine heart / and hole entencion
Prayeng that maid ofso goodlyhede
Croppe and rote / to help in this need
Whom I now leave / in Nazareth soiourne
And to my matter / I will again return.
How mercy and peace / rightwysnes and truth dysputed for the redemption of
mankind. Ca. xi.
W No that is bound and fettered in prison
Thinks long after delyuerauuce
And he that feieth pain and passion
Desires sore after allegeaunce
And who that is in sorrow and penance.
Little wondre of hertely heaviness
Though he coueyte / relees of his distress.
And who that lives in langour and in woe
Fear in exyle and prescripcion
And is with set / with many a cruel fo
And can no gain to his salvation
To escape death / without great raunson
Full long he thinks / of full litell space
While he in bonds abides after grace.
And yet to record of old felicite
In sothfastnes / encreseth more his pain
Than all the constraynte of his aduersite
And causes him more / to sygh and plain
For joy passed / can herten more constrayne
Her welthe before / to be weep and wayle
Than all the torment / that hem does assail.
O who could euersith the world began
Of more joy or of gladness tell
Than sometime could the worthy kind of man
That shapen was in paradyse to dwell
Till he alas / was banysshed in to hell
Fear in exyle / from his possession
And there to abide / stocked in prison.
And he that lost his riches and honor
His myrthe / his joy / and his old welfare
His force / his might / and holy his socoure
And was of virtue / nakyd made and bare
And lay full secke languyssenge in care
So fear proscripte out of his contre
That by the law / there may no recouerbe.
Whose neck oppressed / with so strong a ch^^^
Lay plunged down / without remedy
That when mercy would have been a^ane
Right wysnes began hit anon deny
And when that peace for recover began to cry.
Came troth forth with a stern face
And said plainly / that he get no grace.
For peace and mercy to gyder assembled ware
Full long agone to trete of this matere
And rightwysnes / with hem was eke there
And troth also / with a deynous chere
And when they were all four in fere
As ye have herd / and began to entrete
Than first of all cruelly to threte.
Truth began almost in a rage
Of cruel ire / and of melancolye
And said shortly / that man for his outrage
Of very Right must needs dye
And thus began the contrauersye
Between the susteren and truth always in one
Said plainly that recover was there none.
For I quod Troth / at his creacion
Told him the parell before his offense
But he me put out of his bandon
And gave to me no manner audyence
And ^ quod Right all my dyligence
Would him have rewlyd / but he took none head
Wherefore of me / he get none help at need.
And when he gave credence to the snake
He made his quarrel even against Right
And again Troth / he fallely began to take
When he her clean put out of his sight
And again peace / began a quarrel to fight
When he from him mercy set aferre
And so he set him self / all out of herre.
Therefore quod Right / pleteth for him no more
But let him have / as he has deserved
ye do great wrong / if ye will him restore
That has his heste / to you not conserved
Ayes quod mercy / nature has reserved
To peace my suster plainly and to me
On wretches ever / for to have pity.
And offends has of ignorance
More than of malice: y wys quod mercy to
yet for all that he must have his penance
Quod Right / anon like as he has do
And think quod peace / that toward Ierico
He was disposed among his cruel fone
For lack of help / when he left him alone.
That was quod Troth / for he was recheles
To go the way / I taught him of reason
Quod mercy than the mortal fo of peace
The old Serpent rote of all treason
Of false envy and indygnacion
Lay a wait / to bring him in a train
When he to him falsely did feign.
That if he ete / of the forboden tree
The fair fruit in paradyse present:
He should like unto God be.
Of good and evil / to have entendement
And for my sister / troth was absent
And ye your self / also rightwysnes
He was betrayed / sleyghtly by falsenes.
Wherefore quod mercy / I purpose utterly
Him to releue / if I can or may
And I quod peace / will help faythfullye
The great ire and rancour to allaye
Of judgment to put it in delay
And here upon to find full refuge
I will proceed / before the hye Judge.
How mercy and peace brought in this plee before the high judge Ca. xii.
ANd right forth with / before the king of glory
Mercy and peace the cause brought alone
And in the high heavenly consistorye
Peace said thus / among hem euerichone
O blessed lord / that art both three and one
So please it the benygnely to here
What I will say / and my suster dear.
Remember lord / among thy works all
How thou made mercy sovereign
That when that ever unto the she call
Thou maiste not of right her prayer disdain
And specially / when that we both twain
To thine hyghnes / for any thing require
Thou must of grace / fulfill our prayere.
Is not thy mercy great above the heaven
Thine own daughter chief of thine alye
And has her place above the sterres seven
With the ordres of every Ierarchye
Whom day by day / thou can so magnefye
Among thy works / to make her empress
To help wretches / when they ben in distress.
Thy mercy eke abides ever with the
Like thy gretnes and thy magnyficence
And who that does mercy and pity
Does sacrefice / high in thy presence
And is not mercy / of more excellence
(Like as the sauter well reherce can)
Upon the earth / than the life of man.
Thy self / also as it is plainly couthe
Auysedly who so takes head thereto
Say openly with thine own mouth
That a thousand / thou can thy mercy do
And holy David / records eke also
With his Harp / above all thing
That he thy mercyes eternally shall sing.
And how might eke any creature
Upon earth / in any manner kind
Without mercy / any while endure
For all were gone / if mercy were behind
Wherefore lord on mercy have thy mind
The woeful captyfe / to take unto thy grace
That has so long / be severed fro thy face.
And though that I be humble meke and fre
Forsothe lord of ouete and of right
yet ever in own / my dwelling is with the.
For selde or never / I part out of thy sight
Peace is my name / that power has and might
Through my connyng / they that be mortal fone
By the help of the / to accord in to one.
And also lord as holy writ can tell
That of thy peace / there may none end be
And eke thy peace / does every wight excel
And art thy self / of very duere
Called the prince of peace and unity
And yet by hotest wretches to releue
That is mankind / and shall never fro him meue.
And Job records the holsomest fruit
Of all this world / spryngeth out of peace
Now lord sithen / I am made to be refuyte
And to the woeful comfort / and encreace
Grant of thy grace / now a full releace
That I and mercy / may the sone confound
Of thy^ke caytyse / that lies in prison bound.
So that he may have lyberte
To go at large / and have rempssion
Of this thraldom and captyuyte
And be delivered out of this prison
So that there may be made redempsyon
For his seruage and fynall pay
Lord of thy mercy / without more delay.
And when they had / her matter full purposyd
Mercy and peace / with full high sentence
Touching man with sin so enclosed
The judge gave benign audyence
And when he had kept long scilence
For all the skilles / to him that they laid
Yet at the laste*to hem thus hesayde.
How god the father of heaven / answered to mercy and peace. Ca. xiii.
^Ine own daughter / next to mine alye
Though your request / come of tender heart
ye most consydere / with a prudent eye
Of ryghtwysnes / it may not me asterte
Like your askyng / by tauour to aduerte
Unto the cause / that ye represent
But right and troth / fully would assent.
Withouten whom / I may not proceed
To execute any manner judgment
Wherefore let call her in this great need
For I mo^e worche by her auysement
And when they waren come and present
Than troth alone / touching this matere
Said openly / that all myghten here.
If hit so be / this man that trespaced
Ne be not deed / for his iniquyte
Though utterly the franchesse is defaced
Both of my suster / ryghtwysnes and me
And finally / our both lyberte.
Goes unto naught / of our iurisdiccion
But he be punysshed for his trausgression.
The word of God / that plainly may not err
Told him before / withouten any dread
The great parelle / of this mortal war
Etynge the appell / that he must be deed
But he o^ slouthe / took thereto none head
Wherefore he must / as right list provide
Without mercy / the dome of death abide.
And though that peace / be of pity meued
Man to delyuere / with zele of routhe
Righwisnes would than be agreued
With me to consent / that am called truth
And as me seems / it were to great aslouthe
Dome or cause plee or any suit
Without us tweyne to be execute.
Me semyth eke / my sister peace does wrong
To foster a man / and hold against us twain
That has been conuersaunt so long
Among us discord to restrain
Therefore quod peace / now will I not feign
To do mine office / right to modefye
That she of rigor / cause him not to dye.
Than quod right of necessyte
Hit must follow / though he were my brother
That he must dye / by dome of equity
Or in his name / mo^e be deed su^me other
So of my ship guyded is the rather
That ne may erre^tor wawe nor for wind
More than the anchor of troth will me bind.
Certes quod mercy / so it not dysplease
Unto your noble and wise providence
His death to you may be little ease
For holy writ / reherceth in sentence
If you consyderd / in your aduertence
That death of sinners / the high god to queme
Is werst of de^hes / yfye of right list deem.
For sinful blood / is no sacrefyse
To god above / that every thing mayes^n^
Than must ye death / of one deuyse
That is of sin / innocent and clean
And is I ^rowe / under the son shene
Through the world / to reherce mankind
It were full hard / such one for to find.
For rust with rust / may not scoured be
Ne ^oule with fylth / may be purefyed
But who is soyled / with dishoneste
To wasshe another / it is not aplyed
Black unto white / may not be dyed
Ne blood enfecte with corrupcion
To god for sin / is none oblacion.
Figure hereof / ye may not be dyed
As the bible makes mention
How that a lamb of spotte and fylthe free
Sometime was take by eleccion
And offered up in satisfaccion
To god for sin / for to signefye
Who should for man's ransom dye.
Must be clean / pure and innocent
Right as a lamb / from every spotte and blame
And trewly under the firmamente
There was nonesuche / sithen Adam did atame
The fruit to ete / for either halte or lame
In sovereign virtue / is all the kind of man
Wherefore quod mercy / the best read that I can.
That peace my sister / cesse this discord
And all the stryte / that is us between
And that we pray / our judge and mighty lord
To this matter benygnely to seen
And of his grace / to shape such a mean
For troth and right / so prudently ordeyne
That peace ne I / have no cause to pleyne.
And this request is naught against right
Ne unto troth plainly none oftence
If that our judge of his great might
Ordeyne so in his prouydence
To escape away / through his sapyence
That troth and right be not displeased
Through peace and me though man be help and eased.
How the father of heaven accorded the fouresystren Ca. xiiii.
ANd when that she by reason had fined
That grounded was / plainly upon skyll
The high judge by mercy is enclyned
To condescende of grace to her will
And in such wise her asking to fulfill
That right be served / and truth not dysmayed
That peace / and she should eke be well apayed.
And by sentence alone diffynytyfe
The judge said for conclusion
An innocent pure and clean of life
Shall mekely dye / to pay the raunson
For man's gylt and trasgression
And he so freely / shall the death abaye
In all his pain / that he ^o word shall say.
And thus shall right in all manner thing
Have her desire / and troth shall not fail
But agreably in their worchynge
To execute fully / to stynte this battle
And for that peace in much may anayle
And mercy eke / shall not be agreued
Her brother asking also shall be achyeued.
To find a man that shall undertake
This mighty quarrel / of mercy and pity
To suffer death lonely for man's sake
Uncompellyd freely and of volunte
That is a lamb withouten spotte shall be
And with his blood / shall wasshe vndefouled
The gylt of man / with rust of sin y mouled.
How his son should take mankind. Capittulo. xv.
BUt for to wete / of what stock he shall spring
Ot what kynrede / and of what estate
My sothfast word eternally living
Mine own son / with me encreate
Shall down be sent to be incarnate
And wrappe him self in the mortal kind
Of man (for love) so that he may find.
A clean ground / his palayce unto bylde
In all the earth neither of lyme ne stone
But in a maid / debonayre and mylde
The humble daughter of Judah and Syon
And unto her / shall truth and mercy gone
By one accord / sent before my face
Like my deuyse / to chese me a place.
And say to her in all manner thing
Her tabernacle / that she make fair
Against the coming of her mighty king
Which is my son and mine own heir
That in her breast / shall have his repeyre
Where troth and mercy shall to gyde^ met^
By one assent / and her rancour let.
And there shall peace kiss rightwysnes
And all the susters accord in that place
And right shall leave all her stourdines
And trewthes sword / shall no more manace
And finally / mercy shall purchase
A chartour of pardon / like this maiden cle^^
And which for man is so good a mean.
That he shall mow escape dangers
A myd the forest / free from every trappe
While the maid / that causes all this peace
Has the unicorn slepyng in her lap
That through mekenes / shall his horn so wrappe
There it was wont to slay by vyolence
Through death / it shall again death be defense.
Against venym / more wholesome than treacl^
Every poison asofte and aswage
When the lion makes his habitacle
Within a maid / but of tender age
And Gabriell shall gone on message
To her alone / mine own secretary
With new tydinges / and no longer tarry.

But held his way from the sea of glory
Unto this maid clean / in will and thought
Where as she sat in her oratorye
With heart ente^tyfe / and with hole memory
Great to god / and all her full mind
To whom the angel / when he did her find.
Benignely with all humylite
Said unto her alone as ye shallen here
Hayle full of grace / our lord is with the
Ne dread the not / but be right glad of chere
That art to god / so acceptable and dear
That holy his grace / is upon the fall
To be most blessed / among women all.
And with that word / through gods might
All hole the sum of the deyte
That from heaven his blisfull bemys bright
Shadde on therthe of our humanyte
When in the breast of a maiden fre
The holy ghost / by fre eleccion
For his mekenes has made his mancion.
For wha^ that Bernarde / sometime began behold
With thought up lift / by contemplacion
The bright son / in heart he began to cold
July astoned / in his aspeccion
And full devoutly / in a meditacion
Thereof remembrynge / as he began take heed
Said even thus / quakyng in a dread.
A lamentacion of saint Bernarde. Capittulo. xvii.
A Lord quod he / so I am agrysed
And sore a drade / to look on this clerenesse
And yet well more / with fear I am supprised
For to behold for mine unworthiness
Any word to write or to express
Of this mystery / and great pryuyte
Benign lord lest thou say to me.
What art thou bold or dare in any wise
My rightwisnes to tell or to write
Or to presume so hardely to deuyse
My testament with thy mouth endyte
That certes lord / but if thou respyte
My wretchidnes by supporte of thy grace
I greatly dread of death for my trespace.
But would god through his great might
And his goodness like to my desire
That from thaulter that brenneth in his sight
No little sparcle / but a flame of fire
Would down discende / mine heart to enspyre
For to consume with his fervent hete
The rusty filthe that in my mouth does flete.
And all uncleanness / cankered there of old
To make clean / and to scour away
That through his grace / I durst be so bold
Other to write / or some word to say
That was rehercid upon the blisfull day
When Gabriell and Marie met
In Nazareth and humbly her grette.
But sithen this man / so parfyte of living
This holy Bernarde / so good and gracious
So dreadful was this matter in writtinge
That was of life so inly virtuous
How dare I than be presumptuous
I woeful wretch in any manner wy^e
To take on me this parfyte high emprise.
My lips pollute / my mouth with sin ysoyled
Mine heart unclean / and full of cursidnesse
My thought also / with all vices foiled
My breast receyte and cheste of wretchidnesse
That me to write of any parfitnesse
Not only dread of presumpsion
But for to esche we the indignacion.
Of god above / for my great offense
That I am bold or hardy in his sight
To dare presume / the great excellence
For to descryue of her / that was so bright
But under hope / that mercy passes right
And that disdain / my style not veraye
With humble heart / thus to him I pray.
A recapitulacio^ of the words of Gabriell to our Lady / how holy men by
divine liknesses wrote of our Lady / in co^me^ dacion of her. Capitulo. xviii
O Lord whose mercy goth not declyne
But ever ^liche / stondith hole in one
That sometime sendest down from Seraphyne
To I say an Angel with a stone
Wherewith he began to touch his mouth alone
To purge his lips from all pollucion
So let thy grace to me descend down.
My rude tongue / to explite and speed
Somewhat to say / in commendacion
Ofher that is well of womanhede
And through her help and meditacion
Be to my style full direccion
And let thy grace / always be present
This book to forther after mine intent.
For of my life for to undertake
To speak or write / in so devout matere
Little wonder though I tremble or quake
And change both countenance and chere
Sithen this maydeu of virtue tresorere
Perturbed was in look and in vysage
Of Gabriell to here the message.
And full demurely / stylle began abide
And in her heart castinge up and down
Full prudently upon every side
The manner of this salutacion
And how hit might in conclusion
In any wise fully performed be
She stondynge hole in her vyrginite.
And when the Angel saw her lowly head
Her humble countenance / changed in her face
He said Marye for nothing that you dread
For to fore god / thou haste found grace
And shall conceive / within a litell space
And in thy womb a^one of all virtue
And shall him call (when he is borne) Jesus.
That shall be great / and named sothfastlye
Sone of the highest / that ever was of might
And god to him / shall leave give full iustlye
The sea of David / his own fathers right
And he shall reygne in every wyghtes sight
In the house of Jacob / eternally by ligne
Whose kingdom ever shall last and never fine.
And though his heste where passing of ^^now^^
Surmountynge / eke as in excellence
That vtwardly / gave so meruaylous a^ow^^
And wonderful to her audience
Than she full mekely of great reverence
And look down cast other eyes clear
Benignely the Angel began enquere.
In what manner shall this thing betyde
Sithen I no man know in no degree
Quod Gabriell / within thy blessed side
The holy ghost / shally shrouded be
And all the virtue of the Trynite
Enclose shall in thy breast so clean
The son of life / with all his bemes shene.
Wherefore this child / that shall of the be borne
Shall called be gods sone eterne
Behold and see a little here tof^r^^
Elyzabeth thy^^ own co^yn de^^
Conceived has sithen gone half year
Though she forage went to have been barayne
And is with child / to put all in certain.
That to god is nothing impossyble
But as him list / may every thing fulfill
Unto whose word / be fully now credible
Byholde quod she / of god the meke ancille
With all mine heart / obeyeng to his will
In every thing / right as him list it be
And like thy word / fall it unto me.
Lo she that was chosyn for to been
Of all this world / lady and empres
Of heaven and earth / alone to be queen
And gods mother / for her holiness
Lo for all this / how lowly with mekenes
She all commits unto gods will
As he ordeyneth / ready to fulfill.
And would not call her self none other name
But gods handmayde in full low manner
O where is all the transitorye fame
Where is your boste / or daren you apere
Of pomp or pride / or surquedrye in fere
With your forblowe / blowyng vanyte
Sithen that a maid through her humylite.
Of pride has now won the victory
And openly has given him a fall
Through whose lowlynes / y^ high king of glory
Within her womb / has made in special
His dwelling place / and his hospital
And with one word / of the maid I spoke
The holy ghost / is in her breast yloke.
A commendacion of our Lady. Capitulo. xix.
ANd wha^ y^ Angel from her departed was
And she alone in her tabernacle
Right as the son perissheth through the glass
Through the cristall / berall or spectacle
Without harm / right so by miracle
In to her closer the fathers sapyence
Entered is / withouten vyolence.
Or any wemme / unto her maydenhede
On any side in party or in all
For gods s^ne / taking our manhede
In her has bylde his paleyce pryncipall
And under pyght / this mancion ^yall
With seven pylers / as made is memory
And therein set his reclynatorie.
Which is performed / all of pure gold
Only to us for to signefye
That he all holy made has his hold
Within this maid / that called is Marye
And seven pylers that sholden this maid gye
Ben seven spirits / so as I can disserne
Of god above / this maid to govern.
For all the tresoure of his sapience
And all the wisdom of heaven / and earth thereto
And all the richesse of spiritual science
In her were shette / and closed eke also
For she is toure / without words m^
And house of puore / in which Salamon
Shette all his tresour / in his possession.
She was the castle / of the cristall wall
That never man might yet unclose
In which the king / that made and causes all
His dwelling chief / by grace began dispose
And like as dew / discendeth on the rose
With silver dropes / and of the leaves fair
The fresshe beaulte / ne might not pair.
Ne as the rain / in Aprille or in May
Causes the virtue / to run out of the rote
The great fayrnes / naught appeyre may
On vyolettes / and on herbs sote
Right so this grace / of all our greues bote
The grace of god / amyde the belly white
The beauty causes / to be of more delight.
And as the cokyle / with heavenly dew so clean
Of kind engenders / white perles round
And has no cherisshyng / but the son shene
To his fosterynge / as it is plainly found
Right so this maid of grace most habounde
A peerle has closed / within her breasts white
That from the death might all our rau^soune quyte.
She was eke the gate / of the locks bright
Set in the north of high devotion
Of which sometime the Prophet had a sight
Ezechyell as is written in his auysion
Which stood ever close in conclusion
That never man enter / shall (...) pace
But god him self / to make his dwelling place.
And yet in sothe / as I reherce can
So as the fl^ce of Gedyon was wette
Before he taught / with hem of Madyan
With heavenly dew enuyron all be set
In sign only / he speed shall the bette
Right so has god on her his grace showed
With the holy ghost / when she was bydewed*
In token plainly / she should socoure be
Unto mankind / manly for to fight
Against the devil / that has in his pouste
All madyan with his fell might
And through the help / of this maiden bright
And through the dew / of her heavenly grace
We shall this serpent from our bonds chase.
She was also of gold the rich vrne
Keeping the man of our salvation
That all our woe / may to joy turn
With wholesome fode / and full perfection
She was also / as scripture makes mention
The yerde of Aaron / with fruit and leaves ^ade
Of virtue most to comfort us and glade.
She was the aultre / Cedre / gold / and stone
Steadfast and true in perfeccion
And as the Cedre conseruynge all in one
His body clean / from all corrupcion
And for to make a full oblacion
Of every virtue to / god in chastyte
She shone as gold / by parfyte charity.
And on this altar she made her sacrefyce
With fire of love / brennyng as bright
To god and man / in every manner wise
As down the sterres on the frosty night
Her frankensence gave so clear a light
Through good ensaumple / that the parfyte leven
Of her lyuinge / raught in to heaven.
She was the trone where that Salamon
For worthynes set his ryall set
With gold and yuore / that so bright shone
That all about the beauty men might see
The gold was love / the yuore chastity
And twelve Lions / so great huge and large
That of this work / bare up the charge.
Of the old law weren Prophets twelve
That long before began behold and see
That Salamon gods sone him self
Should in this maid / behold his ryall see
So that in soth / her clean virginite
To be a mother / should nothing let
Amyd her breast / that he his trone set.
She was the woman that saint Johan
Saw in heaven / so richely appear
Cladde in a son / which brighter shone
Than Phoebus does in his long spear
And twelve sterres / that passyngly were clear
So as to him plainly did seem
Weren set above in her dyademe.
And as him thought / at her feet there stood
A large moan / bright and nothing pale
In figure only / that she that is so good
To swage the bitter of our old bale
The son of life / made to auale
Down to the earth / to govern us and guye
And eke the moon / to us does signefye.
All holy church / large to behold
Within this maid / had his original
When finally / with his rightes old
The synagoge of Iewys had a fall
For in this maid / the first faithful wall
Of holy church / God began first to bylde
When with his son / he made her go with child
And to reform / the rudenes utterly
Of blind folks / that could not parceyue
How that Marie might kyndly
A maid be / and a child conceive
That if him list / reason to conceive
They may examples / right ynowe find
Of this matter according unto kind.
Autentyke conclusions against vnbeleufull men that sayde^ that Christ might
not be borne of a maid Capitulo. xx.
O Blind man / through thine iniquyte
Why have thou lost / thy reason and thy sight
That thou of malice / list not for to see
How Christ Jesus / through his great might
To his disciples / held the way right
Through the yates / yshette by great deffence
Without brekyng / or any vyolence.
Why might he not of his magnificence
Within a maid / make his mancion
And she yet stood / in high excellence
Of maydenhede / from all corrupcion
ye ben to blind / in your discression
That list not to see / also how he rose
From death to life / in his sepulture close.
And here withal / thou may also aduerte
How he full graciously / of his mighty grace
Made Peter out of prison to sterte
And where him list freely for to pace
And yet the doors were shut of the place
What wonder than though god by miracle
Within a maid / made his habitacle.
And being close / and parfytly shette
With all the bonds / of clean vyrginite
For sothfastly / her clennesse was not let
Upon no side / ue yet her chastity
But encreasyd / and favor for to se
That gods son / list to light adowne
Within this maid / to make his mancion.
Eke Heldefons / tells of a tree
Instead of fruit / hereth birds small
From year to year / by kind as men may se
Without medlyng of female or of male
This verily is soth plainly and no tale
Tha^ wondre not though / Crist were borne bitwene.
The chaste sides / of a maiden clean.
Eke certain birds / called bultures
Without medlyng conceyuyng by nature
As books said / withouten any lees
And of her life / an hundred year endure
Than the lord of every creature
That causes all / no wonder though I say
Though that he were conceyuyd of a may.
And Plunius / in books natural
Writ of a roche / great and large also
That will remeue / with a finger small
But if a man do all his might thereto
It will not stere / neither to ^e fro
Right so this maid / that is of virtue most
With a finger of the holy ghost
And with a touch of his mighty grace
Conserved has steadfast / god and man
That never might remeue from her face
Of thylke auowe / that she first began
To be a maid / as fertorth as she can
In heart and will / as any roche stable
That from his ground / is not remeuable.
This clerk also this wise Plunius
Says in Tauriche there is an earth found
That of nature isso virtuous
That will cure every manner wound
Right so Marie was the earth found
That god out chose by eleccion
To bear the fruit of our redemption
That should be health and also medecin
To all our wounds / when they ache or smerte
And our greues and our hurtes fine
From death to make us to asterte
With wholesome bawme / percinge to the heart
Our festerid soris / that they shull ache no more
Ne that she ne were / we were all forlore.
And ferthermore this auctour can eke tell
Within his book / who so looks a right
To Jupiter sacred is a well
That when it has queynte his brondes bright
That efte again hit gives them a new light
Who list assaye / soth as he shall find
What wonder than though the god of kind.
Amyd this well / from fylthe of sin cold
Full of virtue / with fair stremes clear
His lodging took and his mighty hold
And through his grace / set hit new afyre
With the holy ghost / that that withouten were
Though she were cold / from all flesshlyhede
She brent in love / hotter than the glede.
And in Falisco / as him list to write
Is a well that causes eke of new
When the oxen drink to be white
And suddenly to change her hew
What marvel than though / the well true
The well of health / and of life eterne
The lord of all / so as I can disserne.
These stremes / shed in to this maid fre
To make her whightest / as in holiness
That both should / maid and mother be
And ever in one / keep her clennesse
Withouten change / so that her witness
Ne fades never in beauty ne in color
Of maiden head to bear / both lefe and flower.
And who that would / dispute in this matere
I hold him mad / or else out of mind
For if he have his eyes hole and clear
He shall now se prefe enough by kind
For he that made / both lefe and rynde
And with a word / these waste words wild
Might make a maid / for to go with child.
And he that made the high cristall heaven
The firmament / and also every spear
The golden axtre / and the sterres seven
Cithera: so lusty for to appear
And read marce / with his stern hcere
Might he not eke only for our sake
Within a maid / of man the kind take.
And he that causes / fowls in the air
In her kind to w^xe and multeplye
And fysshe eke with fynnes sleid fair
In deep ^aves to govern hem and gye
And does one live / and another dye
And gives beasts her fode upon the ground
And in his kind does hem to abound.
Sithen he is lord / and causes all thing
To have being / if I shall not feign
And is the prince and the worthy King
That all enbraceth in his mighty chain
Why might he not by power sovereign
At his fre choice / that all may save and lose
To his mother / a clean maid these.
Who causes the fruit / out of the hard tree
By virtue only / that spryngeth from the rote
To grow and wexe like as men may se
With leaves grene / and new blosmes sote
Is it not that lord / that for all our bote
Would of a maid / as I reherce can
Mekely be borne / without touch of man.
For he that does the tender branches spring
And fresshe flowers / in the great mede
That weren in winter / deed and eke droppinge
Of bawme void / and of lust^hede
Might he not make / his grain to grow and sede
Within her breast / that was both maid and wife
Whereof is made / the sothfast bread of life.
And he that grauyd of his great ^ight
Without poyntell / in the hard stone
And the tables / with letters clear and bright
His ten precepts / and buyldynges euericho^e
The same lord / of his power alone
Has made this maid / here in earth low
A child conceive / and no man to know.
And he that made the busshe to appear
All on flame with ferly sparcles shene
And when Moses began to approach nere
And yet no harm / came to the bows grene
The same lord has conserved clean
His habytacle / and his herber sweet
In this may de / from all flesshely hete.
And he that made the ye^de of Moses
Of a serpent / to take the liknesse
In the hall among all the prees
Where Pharao / the people did oppress
And in deserte / the Bible bears witness
The River made to run / of the stone
The thriste to staunche / of the people alone.
And over this / for to verefye
His great might: Sampson the strong man
As Iudicum / does plainly specefye
Drank the water / that from the channel ran
And he that made the flodes of Iurdan
To torn again / for love of Iosue
That all his people clearly might se
And how wawes began asondre break
And like and hylle / to stand high on lofte
And he that made the Ass to speak
To Balaam? for he rode so soft
Why might he not / by power preued often
Sithen he the yren made in the water houe
Be of a maid borne / for man's love.
And he that made / a angel for to take
Abacuk the prophet / by a litell hear
And suddenly bring him to the lake
In Babylon / which was so fear
And to visit ligginge in his fear
Danyell among the beasts rage
Till he to him brought the potage.
The doors shut / of the strong prison
For to aswage of hunger all his payue
And in a moment / to his mancion
Full suddenly restored him again
Why might he not as well in certain
The same lord / of a may de than
Take flesh and blood / and bycome man.
And he that made the son at Gabaon
To stand and shine / upon the bright shield
Of Iosue and toward Achalon
The moon also as all the hooste beheld
The long day / they faught in the field
Against the Kings of mighty of Amorre
That his people clearly might se.
And he that made the shade we to return
In the orlage of King Ezechye
By ten degrees only to parfourme
By heste I made to him of I say
Why might he not / that all this world shall gye
Of a may de / by the same skyll
Freely be borne at his own will.
And he that fed / with five loves small
Five thousand / in solytarie place
Far in deserte / sittinge in a ^ale
Through the foyson / and plente of his grace
The same lord / why might he not purchase
Within a may de / duringe her maydenhede
When that him list to take his manhede.
For as the Be / both wax and honey shede
At the hyue / who takes head thereto
Right so Marie flouring in maydenhede
Bare in her womb / god and man also
And yet in sothe / she was both two
I dare afferme / one person in fere
A maid clean / and Christ's mother dear.
And as the beam shynyng from so far
Shedith his light / as men may well espy
Withouten harm / of hynderyng of the sterre
And so as Manna / fyl down fro the sky
Right so this flower / that called is Maria
With womb hallowed into chastyte
Conceived has in her virgynite.
And as the Barnacle in the hard tree
Of kind bredeth / and the vine flower
Causes the wine / florre for to be
Through Bachus might / and grapes gouernoure
Right so in soth mankyndes sauyoure
As the barnacle and flower out of the vine
Spronge of Marie she being virgin.
And as a worm under a stone
Of therthe comes without engendure
And as the Feuyr / of which there is but one
To ashes brent / rene with by nature
Right so this lord / that all has in his cure
Our kind again for sin to renew
Took flesh and blood / in this maid true.
And as the Snow / fro Jupiter does f^ll
Through the force of Sagittarius (...)
And zepherus does the flowers fall
On white blosmes / when she does blow
Right so in sothe / the grace alight alow^
Of the holy ghost / like a wind cherisshyng
Amydde the maid / to make his dwelling.
And to the flower / did no duresse
But parfytly / conserved her beauty
From every storm / and flesshely lustiness^
An like fresshe of fayrnes for to se
As by examples / more than two or three
As ye to forne / have herd deuyse
Which as me seems / ought enough suffy^e.
To all that be grounded in the faith
Against falshede / to stand at defense
And yet in such / so as saint Gregore says
Faith has no merit / where as euydence
Or man's reason: gives experience
But he that leueth / and fyndeth no reason
Ne kind according / is worthy more guerdon.
But if that any be / now in this place
That has doubt or ambyguyte
Through false error / that does his heart enbrace
Either of malice / or of iniquyte
For to accuse the blessed virginite
Of Marie plainly / this is my bon^
But if so be that he amend son.
And are mercy / for his great ^ff^nc^
Of her that is / of mercy ground and well
That he of vengeance / have experience
With Ixyon / down deep in hell
And that the clapper / of his destuned bell
May cankre sone / I mean his false tongue
Be doumbe for ever / and never efte to be ronge.
With him / I am no better in charity
Then ye have herd / at even and at morow^
For here my truth / he get no more of me
Save Cerberus / I take him to borowe
What ever he be / and leave him with sorrow
To Tantalus his hunger to appease
At jew words pass / over is an ease.
How our Lady went to saint Ioha^ Baptist mother. Capitulo. xxi.
FOr what in sothe / upon any side
Is Phoebus chare appeyred of his light
Though eyes raw / may not abide
For to behold / against his bemes bright
Right so plainly / though the goundy sight
Of here tyke^ may not sustene
For to behold the clerenes of this queen.
May in no wise sothely disencreace
Her clear light / ne her p^rfyte brightness
Whose fair stremes / shullen never seace
Withouten Eclipse to shine in clennesse
For of this maid / as books done express
When Gabriell to heaven drowe the cooste
She replenisshed was / of the holy ghost.
Rose up alone / and out of Nazareth
Toward the mounteyns fast began her hye
And there she sale with mekely Elizabeth
Within the house of treue Zachary
And right forth with / when she did espy
Of Marie the meke salutacion
And through her eres / when passed was the soun
Within her womb / plainly thus to tale
For very Joy / and spirituell gladness
The young infane / with his lymes small
Reioysed him the Gospel says express
And she fulfilled in very sothfastnesse
With the holy ghost / loud began to cry
And even thus said unto Marie.
Blessed art thou among woman all
And of thy womb / blessed the fruit also
And how to me of hap / is new befall
My lords mother / for to come me to
For very joy / I note what I may do
For sothfastly thy greatyng as I here
Within my womb / my litell child now here?
Rioyseth him / for gladness as he can
That of all woe / mine heart it does releue
And blessed are thou / that first this joy began
The word of god / so faithfully to believe
Now be right glad / and thine heart meue
For all thing / shall performed be
That been of god / byhested unto the.
Marie than with a devout entente
With look benignely / and full humble ^here
The same hour being ay present
Elizabeth her own cosyndere
With a full meke / and humble chere
And all the accord / and hole melody
Of the holy ghost said in her armonye.
How our Lady made Magnificat. Capitulo. xxii.
WIth laud and prise / my soul magnefieth
Eternal lord / both one two and three
That all has made / and every thing now gyeth
Which of his might / and bounteous pity
Of his goodness and high benignite
Only of mercy / list to have plesaunce
For to consider and graciously to se
To my mekenes and humble attendaunce.
My spryte also with heart and thought in fere
Reioysed has / with fulsome habundaunce
In god that is mine heart sovereign entere
And all my joy / and all my suffisaunce
My hole desire / and all my sustenaunce
Within my thought / so deep he is grave
That but in him / without variaunce
In all this world / I can no gladness have.
For he from heaven / goodly has behold
Of his handmay de / the humilite
Wherefore in soth / all only for he would
All kynredes shall be blessed (call me)
Of the which the thank / o lord be unto the
With price and honor / of every voice and tongue
Through armony / of sothfast unity
For this alone / be to thy name song.
For he to me has / do things great
Of high renown / and passinge excellence
His grace made / fully me to flete
For he is mighty of his magnifycence
His name holy / and most of reuer^nce
That will I love / hit shall me never sterte
With all my true faithful diligence
To thank him / of all my hole heart.
And he his mercy / most passyngly famous
For kyn to kyn / and so down to kynrede
Shall through his grace / be so plenteous
Perpetually that it shall proceed
And specially to them / that louen and dread
Mine own lord / with heart will and mind
To such his pity / shall ever spring and sprede
Of due right / and never be behind.
He has his arm enforced / and made strong
His dredefull might / that men may se and know
And proud men they reyne not full long
He served h^th / and made hem full low
With all his heart down of the whele hem throw
For to a^^^^e her surquedrie and pride
Or they were ware / her pomp was over throw
Full suddenly / and leyde her boste a side.
And mighty tyrauntes / from her ryall so
He has avayled / and I put a down
And humble and meke / ^or her humilit^
He has enhaunced to full high renown
For he can make atransmutacion
From low to high / as it is seen full often
And when him li^^ the dominacion
Of wordly pomp / to tall full vnsofte.
He has fulfilled / and fostered in her need
With the goods of plentuous largenes
Hem that were hongry / and indygent in dread
And hem rel^^ed / of all her wretchedness
And he the rich / has raught from his richesse
Full wild and waste / to make upon the plain
And suddenly plungyde in distress
All solytary / and left him ligge in vain.
For he his child / chosen of Israel
Benignely has taken to his grace
And of his mercy / is remembered well
To void only / vengeance from his face
And humble peace / shall occupye his place
And pity shall besesed in his stall
And truth shall his right / so enbrace
To set mercy / above his Works all.
As he has spoken / and faithfully behight
To our fathers / that has been here tofore
To Abraham / and to his sede of right
That his mercy shall last evermore
For nere his mercy / all the world were lore
Unto the which to make man attain
He has made mercy / our kind to restore
And of all his works / to be sovereign.
How our Lady after the birth of saint Johan Baptiste turned to Nazareth.
Capitulo. xxiii.
ANd when this blessed gracious dyte
Was said to god / devoutly of Marie
I find after plainly / how that she
Still in the house / bode of Zachary
Three months / the Gospel may notlye
And after that / I read in certain
To Nazareth / that she went again.
And there above / in contemplacio^
In her prayers / always day by day
With many an holy meditacion
To queme her lord / in what she can or may
From whom her thought / went never away
Her full mnyde / ne her remenbraunce
For but in him / she has no plesaunce.
In all this world / of no manner thing
For all her joy / was on him to think
What ever she did / prayeng or worchynge
Nothing / but he might in her heart synke
For finally / whether she wake or wynke
Amyd her heart / he was always present
So fix on him was set her hole intent.
And day by day / this holy life she lad
This party emayde through high devotion
So seruent love / unto god she had
There may be made no division
For she sequestered her opynion
From all the world / and let it plainly gone
So hole to god / she gave her heart alone.
For ever in love / she brent more and more
Toward god / in his high service?
Was all her lust / with heart set so sore
All erthely thing / she fully does despise
And day by day / her womb began to rise
Through the fulfilling of the holy ghost
Therein by look / whom she loved most.
This mean while Joseph ay soiourned
In Galilee / god wot full innocent
Of all this thing / and why he not returned
Was for that he was so diligent
In Carpentry^ / with all his full intent
Sundry works of meruaylous empryse
By carpentrye / to forge and devise.
For in this craft inpassyng excellence
He had in soth / and high discression
And was had / most in reverence
Of all the werkmen / of that regyon
And for he had in connyng / such renown
Like a master / there is no more to say
The werkmen all his bidding did obaye.
And when he had all work acheued
He is repaired to Nazareth again
But lord how he was in his heart ameued
When that Marie / he has with child yseyne
That sore astoned / he not what he may said
So at his heart / it sat so inwardly
Till at the last / he abrayed suddenly.
And said alas / how it is fall of new
In mine absence / or what thing may this be
Sithen this maid / so faithful and so true
Is with child / and god wot not with me
That sometime had auowed chastity
And to my keeping / eke delivered was
What shall I say / of this sodeyne cas.
What shall I answer / my self to excuse
Unto the bishop / if he me appose
For either must I plainly her accuse
Or my gylte / with this gylte enuose
This thing is opene / I may it not enclose
O blessed god / so do me now this grace
Out of my breast / this woeful ghost to trace.
For certes lord / and it were thy will
I had lever utterly to dye
Than through my word / this maid for to spyll
As I more need / if I her bewraye
And on my self / if I the charge lay
For to afferme she has conceyuyd by me
I more accuse her vow of chastyte.
And so my self / appeche of vntreuth
Sithen I in soth did / her never know
O blessed lord / have on this matter reuth^
For utterly / my wit is brought so low
To see corn grow / where no sede is sow
And reason also platly can I none
How a maid with child should gone.
And flower forth / in her virginite
I never saw / ne never yet did read
And this I doubt / my reason can not se
How that Marie / has kept her maydenhed^
In mine absence / and this I double dread
My wit is brought / and wot not where to turn
For double cause / that I have now to mourn.
That one is this^that my fantasye
May never accord / that she did offense
And reason plainly / again ward does deny^
And upon kind / grounded his sentence
To preue sothely / without resistance
That never woman / in natures sight
Without a man / a child conceive might.
And with that word / he breast out for to weep
Like as he would / all in teres brown
And for the constreynt / of his syghes deep
Stood on the point / for to have fallen down
His sudden woe / made him almost sown
So for distress this Joseph / far in age
Of inward thought / cought was in a rage.
How the Maidens that weren atte^dau^t to our Lady comforted Iosephe Capitulo.
xxiiii.
ANd when the Mayde^s weren ^y present^
And ever in one abiding on Marie
And understood / what that Joseph mente
All atones / they began to cry
And said Joseph / leave thy fantasye
And thine error / for it is folly
Withouten auyse / to de^e sodaynlye.
And certainly / with all our heart entere
Of knowlegynge / in very sykernesse
We will record / euerichone in fere
All openly touching her clennesse
And here upon bear openly witness
Li^^ as we know / unto this same day
Though all this world / at ones will say nay.
For we in soth / through busy diligence
Have been with her / both day and night
And never departed / out of her presence
But ever in one / had of her a sight
And late and erly / with all our might
On her awayted / without words mo
And from our sight / she did never go.
And every hour / both tide and time
Of us / there was no deuysion
And all the morrow tide / till high prym^
She never stynte / of her devotion
To be in prayer / and in oryson
And each day by continuance
A certain hour / she had a dalyaunce.
With holy angels / that with her knelid or stood
And on a time / through gods puru^aunce
Of his hand / she took her holy fode
As needful was to her sustenaunce
And this in soth / has been her governance
And as we echone / of her can record
Wherefore Joseph / this life does not accord.
In sothfastnes / of thine opynion
That so misdemeth / of this maiden fre
Of fantasye / or of false suspeccion
For to accuse her vyrginite
Of which thing / we dare ensure the
That no wight / made sothely to deuyse
But the holy ghost / her womb for to rise.
And here / upon we record can
Of all the time / thou were in Galilee
She never aloue / with was no man
And what she spoke / we might here and se
Wherefore Joseph / let thy tales be
And deem not amys / in word nor in thought
For all this thing / by gods hand is wrought.
And by his angels / coming on message
Is this thing fully brought about
Therefore Joseph / let thine ire assuage
And of Marie / be nothing in doubt?
Certes quod he / I may not void out
My fantasye to assent in any wise:
It should be like / as ye now deuyse.
For by an agell / it were impossible
Her to conceive / like as ye witness
But if it so were / that it be credyble
Some wight by sleyght / taking the liknes
Of an angel / through fraudelent falsenes
Through innocence / shortly to conclude
By engyne of fraud / her thought to delude.
And efte again / for his inward pain
He began to change / both face and hew
And from his eyes / the salt teres rain
Like as he would drown him self of new
So sore he began / in heart for to rewe
For this matter / that for his mortal woe
He can no read / ne wot what he may do.
And in his heart / he cast many away
To have found refute / with all his full mind
And thought always / he would her not betraye
For he was rightful / plainly as I find
And thus he began in sundry / thoughts wind
As in Balaunce / for possed up and down
Till at the last in conclusion.
He purposes fully and casts him utterly
To go his way sothely / if he might
And thought / he would forsake her pryuely
And never more to come in her sight
Till an Angel on the same night
Sent down from god / to Joseph did appear
While that he slepte / and said as ye shall here.
How the Angel warned Joseph to abide with our Lady. Capitulo. xxvi.
O Thou Joseph / ne dread thou not blyue
Thou the sone of David / of line by dissent
For to take Marie to thy wyue
Which is a maid / with all her full intent
With whom is ay the holy ghost present
Of whom god / as I the tell beforne
In very soth / that shall of her be borne.
And like in soth* as writes (...)
Of this matter* that for c^us^s three
Unto Joseph as he tells us
The Angel came / and first he said that (...)
Sithen he was rightful / that (...) no degree
Of purpose rightful / he should unrightfully
This holy maid / forsake pryuely.
Another cause / he writes the express
That his forsakinge / might to her name
Be dishonor and cause in sothfastnesse
Of vntreue tongues / for to speak her shame
And though in her / there were no spotte of blame
Suspeccion to void / on ever either side
The Angel bad / that Joseph should abide*
The third cause / and also most true
Was that he with more diligence
Should her keep / when he the s^th knews
That she was clean / without all offense
And wiste plainly / that by magnificence
Of the holy ghost / his erreur to enchace
Conceived has this maid full of grace.
And when Joseph abrayed / out of his sleep
And in his heart / by reuolucion
^an to cast / and to take keep
Against the morrow / of his auysion
He caught comfort / and consolacion
Of all that ever he was before dispayred
And to Marie again / he repaired.
And (...) hole heart
That he to him / has so (...)
In recomforte of his in (...) (...)
His (...) (...) ^ight ^^clared openly
And of (...)
He asks mercy of humble affeccion
That ever to her / he had suspeccion*
And of his error / and of his trespace
This hoar graye / with all humilite
With weeping ^y^^ / began to are grace
And she alone / of womanly pity
His heuines / when she did se
Comforted him / in all that ever she might
And he alone / in all their sight.
And all her maidens / standinge enuyron
Began even thus / for to cry^^owde
Certes quod he / my derke suspeccion
Came of blyndenes / for I none other could
But now in soth / the mysty black cloud
Of ignorance / is so clarefyed
That all the troth / to me is verefyed.
Through grace of god / that mine old rud^ness^
Is now from (...) chaced clean away
Have me excused / of my derke dullness
With all mine heart / benignely I pray
My night of (...) / is tour^ed in to day
That I may now / with mine eyes old
The bright bemes of Tytan well behold*
That for derknes / I ^yste what to done
Only for lack / of his bemes bright
Weren me berafte / through the clowdy moan
And has within / me no clear insighte
That this Eclips / was caused all to sone
By hersodeyn interpocession
That was chief / ground of my suspeccion.
This is to sayn / that mine erthely thought
So was oppressod / derked and borne down
That woldely skies / that I might naught
Ne was nor worthy / to have inspeccion
Of this derke knowelege / by relacion
Till the son / of his grace did shine
My wit Eclipsed / fully to enlumyne.
For he to me / has his Angel sent
Mine ignorance / fully for to clear
Wherefore of you / in all my best entent^
O ye maidens / that be present here
I axe mercy / with all mine heart entere
Of all that ever / that has be spoken and said
And lowly I pray you / be not evil a paid.
And they echone / thanked god of all
With heart and will / both in word and deed
That he on Joseph / has inspeciall
His grace of new / made for to sprede
To void away / all his hole dread
Of every conceyt / and imageninge
To make him know / the truth of this thing.
There through in soth / the joy began renew
Among hem all echone / of one accord
The armonye entuned / was so true
Between hem that / there was none discord
Not so much as a litell word
And thus in joy / a while I let hem dwell
And of the Bishops / forth I will tell.
How the Bishop did do sompmon Joseph for our Lady was with child Capitulo.
xxvii.
Touching this thing / plainly if I conne
How word by word / sothely in sentence
Of this thing / the rumor is yronne
And reported / that through necligence
Of this Joseph: or by vyolence
How that Marie / goth with child great
Wherefore they have / in a sodeyn heat.
Cyted him before him to apere
And he came forth / with sober countenance
Of whom anon / the Bishop began enquere
Abyathar of his governance
From point to point / with every circumstaunce
Touching this thing / what it might amounte
Or how that Joseph would give a count.
That Marie debonayre and so mylde
That sometime was / of such opinion
In the temple / is great now with child
(...) Of tongues large / and every fantasye
As is sometime showed by the hew
Of them that drank the drink of Ielosye
As Numeri does clearly specefye
Wherefore anon / there is no more to seye
Make you ready / for ye both tweye.
Shulle^ make a taste / whether it be sour or sote
There is none / agaynsay ne excusacion
Till the truth / be ryped in the rote
Ne shullen proceed / to this conclusion
That god list make / a declaracion
Of all this thing / for favor or for routhe
There is no mean / but the plain truth.
For if god list / that your innocence
Like your deserte / by openly excused
Than is your merit / of your excellence
That ye toforne / falsely were accused
And sithen this prefe / may not be refused
But that ye must / obey to the law
Come of anon / and you not withdraw.
Do set her forth / and bring her to presence
That has in virtue / so excellent a name
In whom was never yet found offense
But unto this time / ever floureth in her fame
And stands at large / from every manner blame
Now let her come / and like as god your ewre
For you disposes / takes your adventure.
And she ano^e / was of her friends brought
Knowinge not / what all this might mean
Deuoyde of dread / both in heart and thought
For dread in soth: may not do no tene
To conscience / that is of sin clean
Ne vengeance / there no place ocupyeth
Where innocence / a soul unguilty gyeth.
For the fire may no while brenne
After the brondes be taken away
Ne the river hold his course and run
The head spring dry / sothely this is no nay
Ne vengeance plainly / make may none assaye
To execute against innocence
Ne void of sin his mighty vyolence.
For nothing but sin / may engender shame
For selde or not / ben the chekes read
Of him in soth / that is deuoyde of blame
For who so is clean / takes litell head
To wynke or blenke / for any manner dread
And for the assaute / of any misty cloud
Light of virtue / may no while shroude.
It may a while / be derked with a sky
As is among the fair bright son
And with the wyndes / of malice and envy
The clear sterres / often wexen done
But when troth / set abroche his tonne
To make the soth / openly be know
The wind of falsenes / may no longer blow.
How our Ladies friends wayled and morned when the Bysshoppes made so strong
a prefe of her virginyte. Capitulo. xxxi.
THan sythen truth / may no while dare
Horns shrynke / ne hyde him in his neste
But like a son / his light abroad declare
When she that was the very chosen cheste
Of all clennesse / and there with all the best
Of all good / how might it betyde
Her light of virtue / to be set a side.
That it nyll shine / maugre who says nay
When her beams ben openly discured
As gold in fire / fined by assaye
And as the tried / silver is depured
And she that was in virtue most assured
Where the holy ghost / his dwellinge did set
How might than / any mystes let.
The clear light / of her parfytnesse
Or any manner prefe or probacion
In any part / for to make it less
For light will out / it may not be borne down
And so will truth have dominacion
For any falsenes / that men can conspyre
Than she that was so fully set a fire.
Of the holy ghost / ne dare but little dread
To drink water / whether it be thyke or clear
To take a pre^e / of her may denhede
For her harm / it shall have no power
For to deface her color or her there
But rather amend more / and clarefye
The derke dymmynge / of every cloud sky
And so Marie standing in the place
And all her friends about enuyron
Where men may se / upon many a face
Of frendely routhe / and compassion
The salt teeres / fall and run down
For dread and love / they had for to seen
So hard assaye / made on her age grene.
But she always / constant as a wall
In thought in chere / abashed never a dele
Ne in her heart / dredeth not at all
But upon god / tristeth always well
That he of troth / shall try out the stele
And by that she spoke / but words few
Withouten speech / he shall the deed show.
And when the water fully was confecte
Like the statute / and the rytes old
T^ Bisshoppe has the cup first direct
Unto Joseph and him / the parell told
And manly / he began it hold
And drank her up / and changed not his chere
And seven times about the Aultere.
He went than by custom as he ought.
Of face and color / always like new
And to Marie / also the Bisshope brought
A cup of water / and she of heart true
Accepts eke this godely fresshe of hew
And or she drank / this holy parfyte maid
All openly thus to god she said.
How our Lady prayed to god to show her virginite. Capitulo. xxxii.
OSothfast lord / that have the knowlechynge
Of every thing / through thy might
And art so truwe / and so just a king
To high and low / thou will do right
And nothing may be shrouded fro thy sight
Through none engyne / ne thy face asterte
But sothtastly know every heart.
So that no wight / fade may ne feign
Tofore the eye / of thy sapience
Now let thy grace / down fro heaven train
Clearly in deed / and not by appearance
To show in me / if there be offense
Of any gylte / mine auowe to appeche
To the I pray / so thy light to reche.
That it be couthe / here all openly
To wete in soth / whether I in chastity
Have led my life as faithfully
Like as thou know / for the love of the
And if I have my virginite
Concerned hole / this is mine oryson
Make openly a demonstracian.
And with that word / the drink she did ataste
And went her course / about the Aultre
And all the people began to gasen fast
If any sign / did in her appear
Other in color / countenance or chere
But all for naught / plainly as I told
The more on her / they loken and behold.
The more she was in her sight fair
And like as Phoebus / in Ioly grene may
When she has chased / the derke misty air
Shines more clear / the bright Summers day
When thylke vapors / ben driven clear away
Right so Joseph / and also Marie
So fresshe were / in every wightes eye.
That to behold / they thought it did he^ good
The long day in her opynion
For in her face / always was the blood
Without poling / or any drawing down
And always more fair of inspeccion
Of which thing / the people began marvel
And for astoned / thoughten her wits fail.
How the Bysshope and the people dread hem of the assaye that was made to our
Lady Capitulo. xxxiii.
ANd in pa^^ye greatly / weren dis^^^^^
Lest that god on he^ / would take veng^^^c^
For they so far / gods might have assayed
Of error blind and ve^ay ignorance
And right forthwith / of hertely repentance
They bonchen her breasts / with fystes wonder sore
And all attones / fellen down before.
This holy maid / with humble reverence
And wolden her fete have / kyssed there a none
Asking mercy / of her great offense
And she forgave it hem every chone
And all the Bisshoppes / and the people gone
Benignely / to bring her away
And to her paleyse / fully her conueye.
Of whom the noise / to the heaven ronge
With heart and speech / as they magnefye
The lord above / in every wightes tongue
For joy and myrthe / began him glorefye
And all the day / thus in melodye
They ladde forth / till it drowe to eve
And godely than / of her they took her leave.
And forth they went every man his way
In the storye as made is memory
But Marie in all the haste she may
Entered is in to her oratorie
As she that has won the victory
Of all tho that aforne began muse
Her maiden head / of malice to accuse.
And through her merit / has ye mouths shette
And lips closed of hem / that weren in were
And day by day / kepinge her closette
Continuelly lay in her prayere
Expectaunt ever like / as ye shall here
With humble heart / and devout obeysaunce
Upon the time / of her delyueraunce.
The holy ghost / being ay her guide
Her chaumbre she kept / her day awaytinge
As ye shall here / if ye list to abide
And god toforne / yet or the birds singe
And or that Flora / does the floris spring
Tofore the calendes of Apryll or of May
My purpose is plainly / if that I may.
For to proceed / forth in his dyte
So as I can / or make mention
Of the feste and solempnite
That called is / the Incarnacion
Only through help / and supportacion
Of her that is so plenteous benign
Or that Phoebus enter in the sign.
With this carecte / of the Ariete
Of this feste / somewhat shall I write
But o alas / the Rethorikes sweet
Of Petrake fraunces / that could so endyte
And Eullius / with all his words white
Full long agone / and full old of date
Is deed alas / and passed into fate.
A comendacion of Chaucers. Capitulo. xxxiiii.

The gold dew dropes / of speech and eloquence
In to our tongue / through his excellence.
And fond the flowers / first of rethorike
Our rude speech / only to enlumine
That in our tongue / was never none him like
For as the son / does in heaven shine
In mydday spear / down to us by line
In whose presence / no sterre may appear
Right so his dyttes / withouten any pere?
Every making / with his light distayne
In sothfastnes / who so takes head
Wherefore no wonder / though mine heart plain
Upon his death / and for sorrow blede
For want of him / now in my great need
That should alas / conueye and direct
And with his supporte / amend and correct.
The wrong traces / of my rude pen
There as I err / and go not line right
But that for he / ne may me na^ k^nne
I can no more / but with all my might
With all mine heart / and mine inward sight
Prays for him / that now lies in cheste
To god above / to give his soul good rest.
And as I can / forth I will proceed
Sithen of his help / there may no socour be
And though my pen / be quakinge ay for dread
Nether to Clyo / ne to Calyope
Me list not call for to help me
Ne to no muse / my poyncell for to gye
But leave all this / and say unto Marie.
O clear Castle / and the chaste Toure
Of the holy ghost / mother and virgin
Be thou my help / conceyle and socoure
And let the stremes / of thy mercy shine
In to my breast / this third book to fine
That through thy supporte / and benign grace
It to parforme / I may have life and space.

With heart and will / and with humble chere
For gods word / that no man may withsaye
Has hasted it / gone full many a year
To Abraham / and also Isaac in fear
And to Jacob / that in her holy sede
Full hastily / who so will take heed.
Shall all the peoples blessed be
Through out the world / in every land and reme
And with that word / that Joseph might se
The Angel stye above the Son beme
And he goth forth / toward Bethleme
With Marie / till that they both twain
In full litell space / began to attain.
To the bonds of Bethleem the cite
Weary and mate / somdele of her vyage
Where they founden / of people such plente
In the cite / of every manner age
That they might have / no manner herbegage
In all the Town / neither boure ne hall
Save a stable / and a litell stall.
That was sequestered / and I set a side
Out of all prees / the story says express
Made for bestes / therein to abide
Full streyte and narowe / shadoweth with derknesse
In to the which / Joseph began him dress
With Marie / to rest there all night
And as she entered / a new sodeyn light*
All the place / enlumined enuyron
That shoue as bright / as any summers day
So that this litell humble mancion
Was fresshe and light / as Phoebus is in May
Which began to wexe / and encreace ay
While she was there / all be that it was night
And right anon / the sothfast Son of light.
Of all our joy / cast him to arise
And shed his light / to glade all mankind
For toward midnight / shortly to deuyse
When all was hushte / holy writ makes mind
As sothely as he did him wind
In the sides of this holy maid
So esely this new son abrayde.
When he was borne / in to this mortal life
Upon the earth / to shede his brightness
Withouten help / of any mid wife
Or of his mother / travail or sickness
For she that first conceived in clennesse
It sat right well / that she should also
Withouten travail / or any manner woe
For to go quyte / at her deliverance
And specially / have a prerogatyfe
In her chyldinge / to feel no penance
Sithen she was maid / mother and wife
Chosen of god / for to stynte our strife
Of all women by her self alone
Wherefore it sat not her to cry and groan.
Like to other women / that be inly syke
In the time of their trauaylinge
Wherefore sithen / she was to none other like
No pain felt she / the hour of her childinge
And as I find / at her deliueringe
There was no wight / but her self alone
For thylke time / Joseph was out gone.

And in this while / with her eyes meke

And to the place / the midwyues brought
Even at the door / abashed in her thought.
Stoden still / a stoned of that light
And the brightness / that shone in the place
Again kind / that time of the night
That they ne might / sustain in her face
And no wonder / for the Son of grace
Within which cast his light so far
Of whom the Moon / and each other Sterre.
Receyuen her light / eueriche in her spear
All by that he lay / here in earth low
In a stable / with his sacred chere
Sole with his mother / that no man did know
Of whom her look / she mekely began to throw
Godely beholdynge / his fair young face
And knelynge down / began to enbrace.
His tender lymmes / in her arms twain
And wrapped him in clothes tenderlye
And took him up / and sothely began him leyne
In her lap / and full humbly
She beheld his features by an by
So fair shapen / in party and in all
And with her milk / very celestial.
And heavenly lycour / of her pappes small
His tender lymmes / she spredde in every cost
The white bawme / to make it auale
Fet from the conduyte / of the holy ghost
Upon the thing / that she loved most
And gave him so wke / of the pyment sot^
That spronge and grew out of the holy rote.
Of maydenhede / and from the chaste vine
Of all clennes / was I tried out
Wherewith she made her young child to dyn^
Whom heaven and earth / must obey and lowt^
All be that he / with beasts him about
Lay humbly / as y^ have herd deuyse
And after this / his mother did arise.
And lift him up / sothely in to the stall
Where the Ass and the Ox stood
And on her knees / she began anon to fall
And worshipped him / this best of all good
That gives to Angels / and to man food
And than this maid / with debon^yr chere
With face erecte / and hands eke in fere.

This high feste / for a memorial
The lauds song / in the heaven quere
Like as David had in the Saultere.
Prayseth the lord of the high empire
And with one wise / his birth gloresyeth
That has with love brent and set attire
Seraphyne / wherefore him magnefyeth
Between two beasts / though he in earth lies
Full humbly / through his humilit^
And now this feste of the Natiuite.
The high Angels / and virtues all
Praysen him as they be wont to done
And let the swetens / of their notes all

This day has chose / with us for to wone
And lies now wrapped in his mothers barm^
Whom well softely with her holy arm.
And with the fayrnes of his fyngers white
Full softely she does him enbrace
And in so much / in heart does delight
His tenderlymmes / to welde and compace
And to behold / the goodliste face
That ever was forgede by nature
For it was he / I dare well assure.
Whom she beheld / with her eyes meke
That from eterne / was in his fathers thought
And one with him / who can take keep
His own word / that all made of naught
Whom a may de has to mankind brought
Through her mekenes of heaven / and earth queen
The lynyall stock of Judah to sustene.
Whom that Jacob on his fatal day
When Antropos should his threde untwine
Which Cloto had put in delay
And Lachesis / or they would it five
Began to bless / and thus to hem divine
When all his brethren stood enuyron
This old graye / with a full soft sown.
O Judah Judah / thy brethren euerichone
Shall praise and worship the great renoun^
Of thine estate / which shall of all thy fone
The pride oppress / and make hem lowte down
That shall be cleped / the whelpe of the Lion
The ryall beast / which Maugri who says nay
Shall mighty be to catch / and take his pray.
And prowdly bear it home / unto his cave
My sone Judah / in thy dredefull ten^
For through thy might / thou shall victory have
Maugre echone / that the reuers mean
For who shall move / withstand or sustene
Thy kyngly power / to make resistance
Again thy manhood / and thy magnificence.
That shall in the / so clerey show and shine
Without ^lipsinge / of any manner cloud
The sep^e^ of whom / in soth shall never fine
To be famous / by report of law loud
He never cese / ne in covert shrowde
Till a Duke arise of the kynrede
Whom all the world / shall obey and dread.
The which in soth / is for to be sent
Out of the sede by succession
Like a King / to hold his parliament
With his lieges and his region
And he shall be to every nation
Sothfast abidynge / and socour in her need
And he shall bind his mighty stern stead.
Of very force / at the wholesome vine
And ^ye his Ass / under the grapes read
And he his stole / that like to god does shine
And his palle / by might of his manhede
Shall wesshe in Grapes / that shall blede
The reed blood / deper than scarlet hew
And thus arrayed / in his vesture new.
Ofloke he shall be sterner to behold
Than the stremes of the light sterre
And of eyes fair many fold
Than wine fined shyninge through a verr^
And like Iuore / that comes fro so terre
His tethe shall be even / smothe and white
And like in soth as Joseph list endyte.
The son of Jacob / in his testament
Whereto his children / he makes mention
To fore his death / with full entente
His presence as they knelin down
To hem rehercinge / the great ^uision
Which he had in Egipte goone full yore
In the Foreste / among the holtes hoar.
How that he saw twelve hertes white
Full lustely go in her pasture
And after that Lyncolne list to write
He saw of Judah borne a creature
Of thought and deed / a very maid pure
And in his dreme / he thought he did seen
Of her brought forth / without spotte all clean.
A lamb most fair to his inspeccion
That ever he same / unto his plesaunce
On whose lift hand stood a fierce Lion
And beasts all by one alyaunce
That were in earth / through cruel resemblaunce
Aforcinge hem by sheltron in battle
By fell malice / this fair lamb to assail.
But or they a^ ^yle might in fight
The lambs power / made hem for the deye
And hem vanisshed through his humble might
That man and Angel / when they this conquest say^
They fyllen down / and the lamb did obey
Sent of god this meke werriour
Which was borne to be our savior.
Unto mankind and proteccion
To slay the Lion / that he may not endure
And according with his auysion
This lamb of god / clade in our armure
This day was borne of a maid pure
And lord of all here / in a litell cage
By kyn descended out of lignage.
Of the worthy and mighty brethren two
And as burion out of a stock growing
Right so this child from Leuy / and also
Fro mighty Judah / grew out succedinge
Borne of the blood / to be priest and King
So entremed lyde by succession
Of both these two was the generation.
Till the branches be run / and so far gone
By ly^^all course / de^^endinge as a steyre
Till the kynredes were both grown in to one
In to a branch / to have repeyre
That was preued plainly to ben air
The right of Leui / in preesthode to succeed
And by Just title / who so list to head.
For to be king / and bear the Diadem
After his father / and by successoure
To worthy Judah / of Israhel to queme
To be her prince / and mighty gouernoure
And fro Jacob / this burion and this flower
First began spring / to Iesse till it raught
And so forth down / till the buddes caught.
How nature obeys to virginite. Capi. xlix.
THe holy sides in a pure virgin
To bear fruit / that shall mankind save
And now this day / the prophecye to fine
In Bethleem / within a litell cave
Kind and maid / such werre have
For this matter / how no creature
To man's might / justly by nature.
That been contrary / have her restinge place
For maid and mother / shortly for to seye
In one person to gyder may not trace
For by kind / that one must void aweye
But in this cas / nature did obey
To a maid and gave up hole her right
Wisely aduertinge / she was to feeble of might.
In this matter to hold chaumpartye
With her / that was of face most benign
Wherefore she voydeth / all rancour and enupe
And humbly her quarrel does resign
For it were vain / for nature to malign
Though she of kind / be the emperesse
Again her lord / that made her so maystresse.
That she most need of necessite
In every thing / to his will obey
And be minister unto his volunte
Sith of her might / he bears him self the keye
For in to her / by no manner weye
It is no wrong / ne no prejudice
Though of a maid / without sin or vice.
That was so holy / and parfyte found at all
He would grace descend down so low
To take the clothinge / freel and mortal
Of our kind / to make a burion grow
That never was of man set ne sow
But with a word / and the consentinge
Of a maid / a graffe burgeninge.
Of Judas stock / this day began appear
When Christ was borne af a maid fre
And the father sent his sone dear
Down to the earth / to make an unite
By parfyte love / and fervent charity
Eternally be bound / that may not fail
Fully assured / by weddinge and spousayle.
Between his sone / his chosen air
And holy church / perpetually to last
And in a chaumbre / by excellence fair
Of maydenhede that him self cast
The holy knotte / and the bond so fast

And of that array for to termine.
Where the feste and the weddinge was
In all the earth / I hallowed and I hold
In all closette / more clerer than verre or glass
Or any berelle / brighter to behold
For by record of Patriarchs old
The chaste chaumbre / was within adorned
With gold of faith fair bright I borned.
With charity / that gives so clare a light
To reconforte / all that been in presence
And with silver / depured out so bright
Thorugh high wisdom of ghostly sapience
And all the gemmes / chat have excellence
In mortal virtue / for to show and shine
The closette chosen / so clearly enlumine.
That of uncleanness / there may no Clipsing be
So fulsum light is there of parfytnesse
For there the Uiolettes men may behold and se
Of clean intent and of holiness
With Roses strewed in god to have swetenes
And with Lylies of chastity I meynte
And thereof color / that never will be feynte.
These Uiolettes betoken maydenhede

And in this chamber / full of honest dread

All that was wrong / or in our kind amys
Wherefore this feste for to glorefye
Full long agone / to singe his psalmodye

This day of days / most worthy and famous
And all the prophets / in her sawes preyse
This noble feste / this feste gracious
And fro heaven with voice melodious
Angels full low / send down alight
For to honor this holy night.

In Bethleem / how of a maid pure
A child was borne / most sovereign of degree
And first of all in Rome the cite
His birth was showed / hyghly by miracle
For wall and rofe / Toures and pynacle.
Of the Temple / most famous in the town
To god of peace / that was consecrate
The same night / the ground fill down
Plain with the earth / waste and dissolate
In which Temple / most ryall of estate
The statue stood of mighty Romulus
And at the byldynge / the story tells thus.
Of this Temple / they of Rome went
To Appollo / with humble sacrefice
To have answer in her best intent

And he gave answer unto one and all
How this Temple / with his walls wide
With his crestes / and batalinge ryall
Shall ever stand sure withouten fall
Unto the time / that a maid child
And they anon / that first made it bylde.
Of this answer glad / and full credible
That this Temple ever should stand
For hem thought it was inpossible
A maid ever either on see or land
To have a child / and so they understand
And they anon / gave to the Temple a name
By one assent / for the great fame.
And called it / as I can discern
The Temple of peace / with his walls white
And therewith named is eterne
And at the enter / so they did write
But on the night / the truth to endyte
When Christ was borne of a maid clean
This Temple fill down / enlonge the grene.
To fulfille the true prophecye
Of Apollo / that told hem all this thing
And in that place / in worship of Marie
And of her sone of heaven / and earth king
Stands a church full ryall of byldynge
And even like the self / the same time

Of Romulus / that was edefyed
Fell to the earth / and braste on pieces small
And though Romans made him stellefyed
His great heed / for all tht did auale
Of whom all the werkmen made a tale
That forged it many a day before
And in so^h / till a child were bore.
Of a maid / it should stand up right
This great image / and never his heed incline
But he alowted upon the same night
When Christ was borne of a pure virgin
Like as the werkmen did aforne divine
Again the conceyte / and the entencion
Of that he mente in his opinion.
I find also that the skies done
Which of custom / curteyne so the night
The same time / with a sudden son
Enchaced were / that it wexed all light
As at mydday / when Phoebus is most bright
To show sothely / that the sone of life
Was borne that night / to stynte all our strife.

In to Oil / and so a day endure
When of this world was borne the savior
In Bethleem of a maiden pure
And as I find also in scripture
The same day / high in the firmamente
Toward the party of the Orient.
Were seen three Sons lustely appear
Eueriche of hem / large round and bright
That cast abroad his fair beams clear
Thorugh all the world / in every man's sight
The which Sons drew line right
Her course holding in haste / and that anon
Till they three were joined in to one.

That he was borne / in whom were founden three
To encreace our joy and welfare
Flesh and soul / and eke the deite
Knytte all in one / by sothfast unite
Which as a Son voydynge shoure and shade
Was borne this day / all the world to glade.

Wolden echone / him have deyfyed
And called him / by name immortal
The which thing / when he had espied
As he that was full prudent found at all
To his presence / made anon to call
Sibille: that was myrrour of sapience
Here upon: to here her sentence.
And there withal / that she must deffyne
Without doubt or ambiguite
As far in soth / as Phoebus does now shine
If there were any of power more than he
Or peregall unto his degree
From este to weste / here in earth low
In all this world / that she could of know.
And this was down upon the self day
When Christ was borne / in Bethlee^ by miracle
And she full wisely / Nolde put him in delay
To give answer mankind a small obstacle
Till at the last / the fine of her oracle
Amyd the chamber of the Emperor
Standing enuyron / many a Senator
Was plainly thus / with chere and face bold^
O Emperor / lift up anon thine eye
And look up gynder / and se the stercle of gold
About the Son / which each is to espy
And there behold / thou may it not deny
A maid sit of beaulte / most souereyne
Holding a child in her arms tweyne.
And yet anon as Octauian
Saw the child / by clear inspeccion
Without abode / a voice he herd than
From alofte / unto the chamber down
Behold and se / with humble affeccion
This is the Altar of the high heaven

Of all folks / whose empire shall be one
And no senger divided into twain
Which in Idols / made of stock and ston^
Ne shall no more be pollute to ordeyne
False offerynges / to god that they seyne
And the prophecy / that called is Adge
Full openly / who so list to se.
Writes of his birth / in a litell stounde
Even like as he was enspired
That he shall meue / heaven / see / and ground
And he that is of all most desired
Shall come in haste / like a king a tired
For joy / of the which holy Zachary
To Christ's spouse / this does specefye.
Be glad and light / thou daughter of Syon
And singe / thou daughter of Iherusalem
Behold thy king shall come right anon
That shall be borne / sothely in Bethleem
And his power / shall fro royalme to royalme
The bonds stratche / of his royalte
As far in south / as any flode or any see.
Holden her course / as they with waves wind
Out of her mother / the great Occian
Of whose coming / Malachie makes mind
Within his book / the Bible tell can
How the name of him / both god and man
Shall strotche his streams / withouten wene
Fro thylke place / where the Son shen^.
Reyseth his light / when it begins dawe
At the vpriste in the morning
Unto the weste / where he goes under wawe
Till efte again / his chariete he bring
In to the east / that does the lark sing
For joy only / that his beams rise
And of his coming / does eke Amos deuyse.
And says: he shall newely by miracle
Restore again / and eke reedefye
Upon that day / the mighty tabernacle
Of king David / with all the regallye
And of this child / writes also I say
When he is borne / that in his presence
Kings for dread / shullen keep scilence.
A question assoyled / which is worthy est of king / Wine / or woman.
Capitulo. lvii.
ANd as in earth / is made a question
Of things three / which was worthiest
King / wine / or woman / in comparison
Each I praised / and holden as for best
And all this strife / and as Darius began lest
Zorobabell: withouten any slouthe
Above echone / had preferred truth.
And while they were / atrauerse of these three
Eueriche holding his opinion
Zorobabell of right and equity
To woman gave his commendacion
Making forthwith / of truth mention
Only in sign / as he can deuyse
Fro woman first / truth must arise.
Which is the band / and knotte pryncipall
Of all virtue / it may not be denied
And therwithall / so excellent royal
With god himself / that is next alyed
And for it is / so much magnefyed
Through the world / of price and worthy fame
God chese himself / of that to bear the name.
And with his mouth / himself so list him call
As the Gospel makes mention
And by record of prophets all
God descendynge / to one conclusion
This day in earth / for our salvation
Of a woman in maydenhede flourynge
To mankind / truth did spring.
And fro heaven / rightwisnes beheld
How truth and mercy / in a maid met
And thus is truth / spronge out of a field
Where the holy ghost / the rain of grace sett^
To make the graffe / that he fro Judah set
To fructefie / and a pure virgin
That shall be title of the same line.
The crown of Judah / to accept anon
And vnderfonge it as a champyon
Which was byrafte / so many a day a gone
From Sedechie away in Babylon
When that was made / a transmigracion
By the tyrant: Nabugodonosor

In Bethleem / within a small dongeon
He and his mother / as who says but all on^
To wait on him / other few or none.
A lady mine / how god has made the rich
Thy self alone / all richesse to possede
For in this world / none is the lyche
Of plente royal / fro the land of mede
Where the hills of gold / ben as I read
May no treasoure / in his menes reyse

For certes lady / thou alone haste all
That within heaven / Angels desire
The Jewel eyche / the treasoure celestial

And as Augustine the holy doctor writes
In a sermon of the natiuite
We may to the say / right as he bids
With devout her^e / knelynge on our kne

Ever among thy holy mouth to kiss.
And suddenly / with childely chere Iocounde

With his soft tender arms round
And than atones / fall on thy face
And of his eyes / fulfilled of all grace
A goodly look / to the ward enclyne
And so forth / his chekes leye to thine.
And with his fyngres / mouth / and eyes touch

His young face / between thy pappes couche
And hold him stille / with all his besy pain
And grype hem fast / with his hand tweyne
For therein was his heavenly repaste
Thy young sone / when he list to break his taste.
There was his fode / and his norisshynge pure
Soth fast seleer / of his sustenaunce
The tonne of life / that ever did endure
Ay like fresshe / unto his plesaunce
With sacred lycour / of holy habundaunce

For it for him / was only set abroche.

Falsely with god / to make him at debate.
But now the milk / of thy pappes twain

Within thy breast / spryngeth from a vain

O how it is a passing high miracle
Through gods might / and by naught else

Of a maid spryngynge as a ryuere

O goodely lady / o heavenly botelere

How Christ was circumcised. Capitulo. lx.
When Ianus bifrons / in cold January
With frosty berde / entered in the year
And Phoebus chare / neyeth to Aquarie
His watery beams tofore Feuerere
When that his light / was pale and nothing clear
And from him late / was passed Lucine
The same night / as I saw her shine.
A ourned new / with beams glad and merye
On the heaven / and cast his streams down
I began remember / of the high ferye
That called is the circumcision
How it befell / than by reuolucion
By just acountynge in the Calenders
The first day of the new year.
And though I would in my book proceed
Of this feast / somewhat for to write
And to the gospel / first I began take heed
Of this day how Luke list to endyte
Though he thereof / speak but a lyte
And was full brief and compendious
yet of this day / high and glorious.
He writes plainly / and says how that anon
After the day of the natiuite
When eight days passed were and gone
The child was brought / with all humilite
To the Temple / lowly for to be
As the law of the Jews has devised
The eight day to be circumcised.
And he thereto / mekely did obey
And with a knyfe / made full sharp of stone
His mother lokynge / with a pyteous eye
The child was corue / therwithall anon
That all about / the reed blood began gone
Without abode / as says Bonauenture
And for the pain / he did endure.
And for sharpenes of the sudden smerte
The child began weep / that pity was to here
Wherefore his mother / of very tender heart
Out braste on teres / and might her self not stere
That all bydew^d / where her eyes clear
When she saw him / that she loved so
So young / so fair / to weep for woe.
But he anon / in all his passion
For all that he was so young of age
In manner / he had a compassion
To se his mother / to weep in her rage
And put his hand unto her vysage
On mouth and eyes / passyngly benign
And as he could / goodely made a sign.
Withouten speech / to stynte her weeping
That came to her / of motherly pity
And she full well / conceyueth his menynge
From point to point / and than anon began she
To look on him / that was so fair to se
And his fetures / considered by and by
And in her arms / wonder womanly.
She took him up / and prayed him be still
As of motheres / is plainly the manner
And he in all obeys to her will
Though he were yo^ge / and began to change his chere
And with her kerchyef / she made his eyes clear
On his chekes / in all that ever she may
Full motherly / the teres w^pte away.
How in four manner of wyses Christ was circumcised Capitulo. lxi.
ANd like of Asquyne / as it is devised
That Christ Jesus / who so list to se
In four manners / was truly circumcised
First of his father / at his natiuite
With the knyfe of wilful pouerte
And now this day / which is not feyned
Eke with a knyfe / by the law ordained.
The third manner / ye may eke consider
How with the knyfe of great aduersite
That he was kyte / first when he came hyder
Taking for us / our humanite
And alther last / with full cruelte
For us he suffered circumcision
Upon the cross / during his passion.
How Christ suffered circumcision in his chosen people Cap^. lii.
^Ke in four manner / who so can take heed
Christ in it is chosen / by good inspeccion
Here in this world / withouten any dread
Of new / he suffered circumcision
The first is made / by false detraccion
That ky^teth away / both friend and fame
And the shynynge of her good name.
The second is / by false tyranny
Of such that have no conscience at all
But takes away / by cursed robbery^
Unrightfully / her goods temporal
And the third / sothely is most mortal
Of heretykes / that falsely disobeye
To holy church / and to out faith vareye.
The fourth / is made by effusion of blood
Of tyraunte / that the body sleeth
When they of malice / again the faith stood
To execute her venym up by death
To make mar^ers / to yield up the breath
Whom Christ Jesus eternally in glory
Ordained has / ^ palm of victory.
Eke five times / Christ in his manhede
Shed his blood by effusion
And alther first when he did blede
Upon the day of circumcision
And in soth / tofore his passion
Upon the hill / for auguysshe when heswete
The read blood / which all his body wette.
The third time / his blood most virtuous
Began ren^e out by many a cruel wound
When that he was this king most gracious
Of the Jews to a pyler bound
The fourth time / eke as it is found
He spent his blood / for our alther good
When he was nailed / high upon the rood.
And alther last / when Longeus a fere
Through his heart / plainly as I find
On Caluere him perced with a spear
That blood and water / as books make mind
Began streme down / to his eyes blind
By whose virtue / anon this paynym knight
Only of grace / recovered has his sight.
And in his books / eke as it is told
How the pyece of his Incision
Was by an Angel / in an vrne of gold

And he anon of great affeccion
Of this miracle / for the excellence
Made it be kept for great reverence.

Full many a yete by reuolucion

But clerks have an opinion
That the day of Resurrexion
When Christ Jesus rose from death to live.
The same pyece returned as blyue.
To the place / where that it cain fro
Sithen that it was sothely as I find
Of his manhede / parteynynge thereto
And a patty / longing to his kind
Though (...) be so / that books make mind
That in Rome it is yet preserved
And year by year / when this test is served.
In a church / which men of custom call
Sancta Sanctorum / of old foundation
The same day / there the prestes all
Solempnely make a stacion
When all the people gone on procession
Fully in hope / better for to speed
From year to year / there they singe and read.
And ferthermore / the story does devise
The same day / righ fortwith anon
In the Temple / as they him circumcise
He named was Jesus of echone
The which name long or that agone
Was of the Angel told and said before
To his mother / or that he were bore.

From east to weste / it gave so clear a light
That of the streams / every manner wight
Astoned was / they were so bright and sheue
And to the eye / full persant for to seen.
The which Sterre / drove his course of right
Toward the hill / like as books tell
Where the kings / the long wynters night
It to a wait / solitary dwell
And there anon / upon her knees fell
And thanked god with all her hertes lust
Which has not hem defeauded of her lust.
How the three Kings perceived the sterre Capitulo. lxix.
ANd all that night to gyder as they woke
Upon this sterre / that shone so fair and clear
And suddenly up ward / as they began look
They saw a child / above the sterre appear
So young / so fair / in a golden spear
Full roially stand / and about his head
A large cross / that was of blood full read.
The which child spoke to hem anon
Above the hill / with voice and chere benign
And bad hem fast / that they should gone
In to Judah / right as any line
And follow always the sterre for a sign
That shall him bring to that region
Where the king most worthy of renoun.
Was borne that time / to have the regallye
Of Jews land / of very dew right
To whom the sterre did specefye
When he was borne / with his clear light
And they anon / when passed was the night
The next morrow / no longer list abide
But to ward him / cast him for to ride.
With great array / and royal aparayle
As was sittynge / to their worthynes
They shope hem forth / and for they would not fail
To do honor to his noblenes
(...) To give him clearly informacion
Other exploire / and of the child also
Surely affermynge / by false collucion
That he himself would sone after go
Unto the child / and his deuoyrdo
To worship him / and all under colors
As the Worm / or Serpent under flowers.
Darith full often / and keeps him covertly
Of kind malice / till they a time se
To shede her venym / and than suddenly
All atones / when they vnwarest be
They styngen and she wyn her cruelte
And her venym / under flowers fair
Full often is hyd / till they may appayre.
Right so thou Serpent full iniquite
False tygre / full of doublenes
Under fair color of humilite
Thy venym dares / and also thy falsenes
O thou tyrant / o rote of cursidnes
Thou Herod of malice / most mortal
What wenest thou / him that knows all.
To discepue with thy slyly wyle
What can sugar under gall feign
What wenyste thou / the kings to begyle
And of malice / bring hem in a train
Of whose coming / though that thou disdain
It may not help / plainly ne veil
For of thy purpose / plainly thou shalt fail.
For by grace / they shullen in quyete
Maugre thy might all the danger pas
For though that thou / with words honey sweet
Maliciously / upon her death compass
They shullen escape / despyte of thy face
For all the coniecte / of thy princes wise
As the story shall anon deuyse.
And so with venym / in his heart yloke
He gave hem leave / pass through his reme
In her repair / him casting to be wroke
If they return again by Iherusalem
And so the sterre / hem brought to Bethleem
And line tight / the chyldes head above
Where as he lay still / began to houe.
Of the joy that the Kings had when they found Christ. Capi. lxxii.
BUt who the joy could tell or endyte
Or with his mouth / the myrthe expres
Or who can plainly with his penue write
The great bliss or the gladness
Which they made in sothfastnes
After her journey / and her long w^y^
Above the house / when they the sterre seye.
That began to hem clearly certefye
Without more / the chyldes dwelly age place
And they anon / fast began hem hye
With lusty heart / and glad of there and face
To alight down in (...) space
They made he^^ ready / and with reverence
They entryd in / and came in ^o (...).
Where as the child most worthy of d^g^^
Was with Marie in a Oxes stall
And humbly the kings all three
Forth they went toward the stall
And brought her tresoure / and her g^^^es all
As reverently as they could devise
And him presented in all her best wy^e.
Like as her estate / eueriche after other
Making their present / with all humilite
Like her age / as brother after other
Gold / Frank / and Myr^he / they gave him all thr^
After custom of Perce and Caldee
For of th^^ land / when kings present make
The custom is such gifts for to take.
And this was done with foyson and plente
In very soth / and great habundaunce
For in ^er present was no scarsete
For of richesse / they had all suffisaunce
Wherefore they ^^ste with devout obeysaunce
Of due ^ight / with the child to part
Of her tresoure / or that they depart.
And (...) (...) is pa^ed for tribute
As it is found of ^^tiquite
Therefore the kings / for a manner suit
That they him (...)
They brought him gold ou^ of her co^tr^
And gave (...)
Holy of heart / for a recog^isaunce.
And Frank also / as clerks can devise
Ordained is in conclusion
To god only / to make sacre^ise
With contrite heart and devotion
Therefore to him for oblacion
They brought Frank to signefye than
That he was both sothfaste god and man.
And for they would in all thing obey
To his hyghnes / with all ^er besy cure
In token he should for mankind dye
They brought myrre to his sepulture
For like a man / death he must endure
And with his blood / ^hed in his passion
For our trespace / for to make redempciom.
In Frank also / who that can discern
Is understand the high mageste
Of his power / which that is eterne
And eke also / his high dey^e
The gold betokens his high dignite
And myr^he declares / unto us at all
Of his manhood / that he was mortal.
And gold betokens of love the feruence
That he to man had of affeccion
And Frank betokens the sovereign excellence
In holiness his conuersa^ion
And myrre betokens the tribulacion
That he suffered / and all the great penance
For us in earth by continuance.
In gold he was know as a king
In Frank a preeste / who so can take hed^
Of myrre also this day the offering
Was longing only to his manhede
And thus he was withouten any dread
Both king and preeste / as I discriue can
And for our sake in earth a mortal man.
In gold also / most glorious metal
Figured was his high deyte
In Frank also / that is so cordial
The soul also / of Christ most parfyte of degree
And myrre betokens through his dignite
His flesh / the which by disposicion
May never suffer no corrupcion.
And of these gifts passing reverence
Full of mystery / and heavenly priuite
And when they had made their present
Unto the child ay sittynge on her knee
And with great auyse / they began behold and see
Tofore that they remeue from that place
His godely chere / and his fair face.
Considering his fetures by and by
With great insight / and humble enten^ion
And ay the more they look besely
The more they think in her inspeccion
And thoughten always / as in her reason
Though kind and god / has set in one figure
The beauty holy of every creature.
It might not in sothenes / heaven ben liche
To his fayrnes / neither peregall
For he that is above nature rich
Has made this child / ^ayreste in special
For in his face / they beholden all
The hole beauty / and fayrnes eke also
Of heaven and e^the / to gyder both two.
Wherefore no wonder / though they hem dely^^
Most passingly upon him to se
For they in heart reioysen hem not alyte
On him to look / that they have liberte
For ay the more plainly that they be
In his presence / the parfyte hot fyr^
Of hertely ^oye / hem burnt in desire.
And of one thing good head they took
How that the child / demurely cast his sight
Toward hem / and godely began to look
On her faces / with his eyes bright
And how that he put his arms right
Goodely to hem making a manner sign
To them of thanking / with chere full benign.
And of his mother / they much thing enquere
Touching his birth / with humble affeccion
And she answers most femynyne of chere
Full prudently to every question
With chere demure / and look ycaste adowne
With all the port of womenly clennes
Her self demenynge / chefely with mekenes.
Of virtuous pouerte and mekenes of our Lady Capitulo. lxxiii.
O She that was of heaven and earth queen
And of hell lady and princes
O what was she / alas that might fustene
To be proud considered her mekenes
O pride alas / o rote of our distres
Though thy booste above the sky blow
Thy byloynge / high shallbe brought full low.
O Surquedrie / alas why n^^te thou se
How that she had heaven in her demeyne
And lady is both of land and see
And of the axtre / between the poles tweyne
And of the enbracynge / of the golden cheyne
yet unto her / I say in sothfastnes
Above all this / agryed her mekenes.
O pomp elate / with thy cheres bold
Remember and se / and look how that she
Of whom kings have joy to behold
In her presence to knele on her kne
Though she of women / be highest in degree
Take heed and se how louly in a stable
How that she sat this lady honorable.
Were there of gold any clothes found
Of Sylke Damask / or rich Tartaryne
Or whas there Aras about her head bound
Or was there any Uelwet Crymsyne
Or was there any Samyte or Satyne
Or were there any Tapytes / large or wide
The naked ground / to cover or to hyde.
Or was her paleys bylte of lyme and stone
Or the pylers set on marbell graye
Or the ground pauyd on to gone
Or fresshe parlours / glased bright as day
Or were therein chambres of array
Or for estates / was there any hall
Save a Dongeon / and an Oxes stall.
Or of her bed was the appareyle
Of Gold and Sylke / corteyned large about
Or were the shetes of long or wide entayle
Kytte out of raynes / nay without doubt
Or were there any ladies for to loute
To her hyghnes / with besy obseruaunce
Or of maidens any attendaunce.
O as me seems of very dew right
ye women all sholden take heed
With your Perles / and your stones bright
How that our queen / flower of womanhede
Of no devise embrouded has her wede
Ne furred with Ermyn / ne with Christi graye
Ne Martyr^e / ne Sabil^ I trow in good faye.
Was none founden in her garmente
And yet she was the fairest for to se
That ever was under the firmamente
That me seems / ye sholden have pity
To se a lady of so high degree
So semely atyred / o ye women all
So narowe closed in an Oxes stall.
Let be your pride / and your affeccion
Of rich array / and nothing you delight
In wordly pomp / and such abusion
Of sou^dry clothes / read / black / and white
And be well ware / or the spear byte
Of cruel death / and the fell smerte
My council is to lift up your heart.
To that lady / and to that worthy queen
That you may best help in your need
And you releue / in every woe and tene
And deliver from all mischyef and dread
And think plainly / and take right good head
That all shall pass array / and eke riches
When ye lest wene / and all your semelines.
Let hem before be to a Kalendere
I sowde Eleyne / and eke Policene
Hester also / and Dido with her chere
And rich (...) / of Ethiope queen
Lygge they not grave / under colors grene
And yet all this / may not your pride atame
Natwithstandynge / that ye shall do the same.
And after death abides no memory
For ay with death / comes foriet fulness
And fare well than array / and all vayneglorie
Save only virtue / that stands in sikernes
I take record of the high mekenes
Of her that is of holiness well
Of whom I think / sothely for to tell.
How that she satte / for all her worthynes
Holding her child / lowly on the ground
And kings knelynge / as ye have herd expres
Beholdynge her in virtue most habounde
Till at the last / they have a leyser found
To take her leave / and the same night
They began to ride homwarde all her might.
How the Angel warned the three kings to pass not by Herodes / but by
another way. Capi. lxxiiii.
ANd suynge after on the next night
While they slepte at her lodging place
Came an Angel apperynge with great light
And warned hem / that they nouht ne trace
By Herodes / but that they should pace
Withouten taryenge / in all the haste they may
To her kingdom by another way.
And in short time to their region
They ben repaired / the Gospel tells thus
And of her names to make mention;
The first in Hebreu was called Appolleus
The next Amerus / the third Damarus
And in Greek / the first Galgatha
And Sarachim / the third Malgalatha.
And in Latin / as books make mind
The first of hem named was Jasper
And the second / plainly as I find
Like mine auctour reherce as I dar
Called was / and named Balthazar
And the third / ye get of me no more
As I read / was called Melchior.
Of whose repair / as some books seyne
That first of all / they wenten to the sea
And retornynge to her kingdom again
They shipped hem at Tharse the cite
For which Herod / of cursed cruelte
In Tharse made all the ships brenne
Whereof write David the Saulter if ye kenne.
And unto you clearly to specefie
Touching this ^este / and this solemnite
Whereof is said this word Epiphanie
Which is a word of great auctorite
And said / and compouned / who so can se
Of Epi first / and Phanos soth to said
And one word compouned of these tweyne.
Comes this word of Epiphanie
And this word Epi by discripsion
Is said of heyght / as I can signefye
And of a showing / by demonstracion
As Phanos said / and so by good reason
Epi and Phanos / both knytte in fere
Is a showing / that does a lofte appear.
And for this day / alofte was the sterre
Which Christ's birth / and incarnacion
With his streams began shede from so far
From east to weste / in many a region
Whereof this feste in conclusion
As ye toforne have herd me specefie
This feste is called of Epiphanie.
The which feste has a prerogatyfe
Of miracles notable in special
For things four / wrought in Christ's life
Weren on this day by his power royal
The first of all / for a memorial
Is of the kings / as ye have herd me said
Which were in ydell / to reherce again.
The second is / it is sothely told
That Christ Jesus this day of saint Johan
The year when he was thyrty winter old
Baptized he was in the flow Iordayne
At which time / three kings under one
Appeared this day / worthy of memory
The first was that from the high glory.
The fathers voice / as clerks list endyte
Came down to earth / that men might here
An like a down / with fair federes white
The holy ghost also did appear
And Christ Jesus the fathers sone entere
This day apperynge in our mortal kind
Was of saint Johan Baptiste as I find.
And for as much / as they all three
This day were seen / by sothfaste appearance
They being one / in partyte vn^^^
Therefore this day of most reverence
Named is truly in this sentence
Theophanos for god in treble wise
Therein appeared as ye have herd deuyse.
For The^s is as much for to mean
As god in englisshe / if ye list to se
And Phanos / as showing withouten wene
As ye have herd before reherced of me
For in earth / ^ god in trinite
This day appeared withouten any lie
ye truly may it call Theophanie.
Eke when Christ was old thyrty year
This day he turned water in to wine.
That passyngly was to the eye clear
And of tarrage / inly good and fine
The which he sent to Archedeclyne
And for this miracle / july virtuous
In Galilee was showed in an house.
This same day / which man did espy
As holy church makes mention
Therefore it is named Bethphanie
For^eth in englisshe by discripsion
Is called a house or a mancion
Of which miracle renomed of fame
Bethphanie this day has the name.
Eke in the year of his passion
Fer in deserte / this day also I read
With loves five / through his great foyson
Five thousand I find / that he did feed
Of which miracle / if ye taken head
This day is last named Phagiphanie
Like as first was cleped Epiphanie.
For this word Phagi in to our entente
Is said of fedynge / of re^eccion
For which miracle passing excellence
That is so famous / and so high of renoun
Like as the Gospel makes mention
Therefore this day among the other all
ye lustely may it Phagiphanie call.
A declaracion of the three Kings of their three gifts. Capitulo. lxxv.
Now Christ Jesus this day this high feste
We the beseech / with heart / will / and thought
Only of mercy / to here our request
For the miracles / that thou therein haste wrought
For love of hem / that the so far have sought
The worthy kings / that came out of Caldee
The ^o honor / in Bethleem the cite.
And through the prayers of these kings three
That for thy love / token her vyage
Jesus defend us from all aduersite
And make us strong / and sure in our passage
In this exyle / and parlous pylgrimage
With our fo men of malice / and of pride
Which have us bysette an every side.
The which our gold / of parfyte charity
Wolden us byreue by persecusion
That we should offer of feruente unto the
O^ hertely love / and high devotion
And eke our Frank of contemplacion
Wherewith he should make our sacrifise
O^ high disdain and malice they despise.
For Gold of truth / is falsely now alayed
By feigned love / and simulacion
And faith with fraud / is corrupt and frayed
With double tongues and detraccion
Our Frank also / of high perfeccion
That should brenne clear above the sky
Is with the code medlide of envy.
That it alas / give may no light
In the center of true affeccion
For day of truth / is turned in to night
Through false report / and false suspeccion
And thus good ^ayth / is ro^^ed up s^ dow^e
And true menynge / derked with a sky
That we in Englisshe calle^ flaterye.
And thus our offrynge / goes almost wrong
Of Gold / of Frank / for ought I can espy
And our Myrre has behind full long
Us to preserve / from all such trecherye
For now is turned / into Ipocresye
Our holiness / and that is great ruthe
And cause why / for fraud has banysshed truth.
But Chrike Jesus / that all this may amend
And that is amiss / in each state redres
This high feste / such grace to us send
That we the Gold of stablenes
And eke the Frank of parfyte holiness
May on this day present unto the
With all true heart / as did these kings three.
And grant also / both to high and low
To have such Myrre in her a vertence
That every wight / his own fautes know
And that no man be hasty of sentence
To deem lightly before / or in absence
For sodeyne dome / meynte with ygnoraunce
Has a long tail / showing of repentance.
For in sothnes / if that every man
Would make a myrrour of his own mind
To deem himself / of thing that he well can
And open his eyes / that has be long blind
To se his fautes / that he could find
I trow in soth / for any hasty rape
Harmeles fro dome his fellow should ascape.
How we should do this offering ghostely. Capitulo. lxxvi.
Now Christ Jesus y^ know every heart
And nothing may be hyde fro thy p^sence
Ne from thine eye declyne ne asterte
Grant us this day of thy magnificence
The Gold of love / the Frank of innocence
And the chaste Myrre of clean entencion
So to present in our oblacion.
To thine hyghnes / that it be acceptable
While that we live ever from year to year
As was the offrynge in Bethleem in a stable
Made unto the / and to thy mother dear
Of the kings / that with the streams clear
Of a Sterre conveyed were by grace
Where thou lay / to come to the place.
And unto the this day / we clepe and call
Thou blessed queen of kings emperesse
That gave thy sone souke in a stall
That chaste milk of virginal clennes
That thou this feste / o Sterre of holiness
Conueye our offrynge / to that Sterre se
Where next thy sone / thou haste the souer aynte.
And good lady in this sorrowful vale
Of trouble and woe / and of heuines
Sithen thou of Jacob art the right scale
The way of life / the Ladder of holiness
Toward that contre / the even way dress
And make thy men thither to assende
Where ever bless / and joy has no end.
For cer^es lady / in this life we lack
Of sothfaste joy / all the suffisaunce
Save among we knele before the rack
Wherewith thy sone was sometime thy plesaunce
And us reioysynge / as by remembrance
Only by likeness to look on thine image
And on thy sone / with his fair vysage.
But o alas there is but a likeness
Of portrature / that does great offense
For we may not have / full the blessidnes
Of thy vysage neither of thy presence
And so to us great harm does appearance
When that we se / of our desire we fail
We may plain / but it may not avail.
yet day by day / of true affeccion
We gone of new / thy likeness for to s^
Where of one thing / we have compassion
To se the bestes that so humble be
To stand so nere between thy sone and the
The rude Ass / and the Ox also
And than we say complaining in our woe.
With all our heart / o what thing may this be
To se that lord in a rack lie
That has the heaven in his postye
And all this world / power has to gye
O how it is that the regallie
Of heaven and earth is brought down so low
That no man list uneath his power know.
And suddenly our hertes gynneth cold
For astonynge / and is for wonygh mate
So great a queen / when that we behold
Alone sittynge all disconsolate
So fair / so good / and so high estate
Most womanly / and so benign of chere
Thy sone / and the together sutynge in fere.
In the bands of so narowe a dongeon
Whereof all earth tremble shall and quake
And every wight by lamentacion
Weep and plain / syghe and sorrow make
O blissed queen / only for thy sake
To se on the / none other waiting
But bestes with hey him self fedynge.
But in one thing / comfort yet we feel
O good lady / sothely if we se
Three worthy kings / before thy face knele
Bryngen her gifts with all humilite
And hem govern / like to thy degree
With meke attendaunce / and full besy cure
But all this thing / we se but in picture.
Alas the while / and yet it does us ease
And in party as wageth our greuaunce
For nothing may our sorrow so appease
As ever of the / to have a remembrance
For in the lady / is hoole our sustenaunce
Though we live in langour for thine absence
yet good lady for thy magnificeuce.
To thy servants of thy grace se
And to thy sone / be for us a mean
This high feste / which longs unto the
In which thou were honored like a queen
With Myrre / and Fra^ke / and Gold / that shone so clean
Now for the honor / this day was to the
And for the love of the kings three.
When we shall part out of this woeful life
And make an end of this captivity
Or Herodes through his mortal strife
The fend by trappe us through his cruelte
Now that time lady of thy benignite
Against the snares / of this dreadful werre
To life eterne / be thou our loode Sterre.
How our Lady was purified. Capitulo. lxxvii.
Glory / and price / laud / and high honor
O blessed queen / be given unto the
That were of gold / the close chaste toure
Surely founded upon humilite
Shette with the keye / of (...) (...) (...)
From all sin / fully to be assured
And of the holy ghost / round about enuired.
That never no brennynge of flesshely hete
Assail might thine holy tabernacle
With dew of grace / thy closette was so sweet
Fulfilled with virtue / only by miracle
God chase thy womb for his tabernacle
And hallowed it so clean in every cooste
To make it sacrarie / for his own ghooste.
Natwithstandynge / that thou were so clean
Above all other by eleccion
Of mekenes only / o thou heavenly queen
Thou list to have none indignacion
The day to pass of thy purificacion
But to fulfille the precepte of the law
In every thing / and not a point withdraw.
But even like as it is specified
Leuitici who so can understand
To the Temple / to be purified
Thou mekely come thine offrynge in hand
All be the law set / on the no band
For it is there made mention
Touching the law of purificacion.
If a women conceive by a man
And have a child / by medlynge hem between
That it be a male / the law teaches than
Forty days that she should be unclean
And keep her close / ^that no man should her seen
And after that she should her offrynge
In law expressed / to the Temple bring.
But takes thede in conclusion
How this law like as ye shall find
Ne was not put / but by condition
Only to them that corupt weren by kind
Through touch of man / of such is made mind
The days nombred of her purgacion
To come and make her oblacion.
And bring a lamb / the which in sacrefise
Should all be brought in the holy place
And a pygeon / as law does devise
She should eke offer / as for her trespace
And than all fylthe from her to enchace
She of the priest hallowed and sacrefied
Retorneth home / and fully purifyed.
And if she had in her possession
Redely no lamb / only for pouerte
Than should she take for her oblacion
Two turtell Doves / and therwithall go fre
Or two pygeons / like as ye may se
Leuitici / where as by distinction
Of this offering is made description.
But this may de / who so can take heed
Excluded ^as fro this condition
That bare a child / without man's sed^
Bring ever cle^e from all corruption
Where through / she was from such oblacion
By law except / and was under no charge
For her clennes / standing at her large.
For of her womb / the cloister virginal
Was ever eliche / both first and last
Closed and shytte / as Castle pryncipall
For the holy ghost / devised ^t and cast
And at both times shytte as like fast
In her chyldynge no more through grace ybroke
Than at her conceyuynge / than it was vnloke.
For nature withouten any strife
Repugnaunce / or any resistance
Gave this maybe prerogatyfe
As mother to have experience
Only of chyldynge / and feel none offense
Nether of sekenes / ne of such manner woe
In trauelynge as other women do.
She was except from all such passion
For her clennes / and so was none but she
And yet her time of purification
She did abide of her humilite
And like as law ordeyneth by decrete
After all this of custom as she ought
To the Temple she her offering brought.
To give example only of mekenes
To the law she mekely would obey
Fro point to point the Gospel says expres
And on no side would it ^at withsaye
And though that she ^are of gold no keye
To bye a lamb / for pouerte constreynynge
yet she full mekely to make her offering.
Brought two Turtels / as it is said aforne
That was the offrynge of pore folk echone
Which to the Temple / when she has borne
As custom was / she offered hem anon
And after that old Simeon
With humble heart and a full pain
The child embracing in his arms twain.

And such a joy of him began to make
Within him self / of high affeccion
That heue could another by word ne soun
Outward declare / neither with chere ne face
The passing joy that began his heart enbrace.
And he was rightful / holy and virtuous
This old man / this blessed Simeon
Dredefull also / and passing famous
Among the prestes / to reken hem euerichone
That was expectant / and full long agone
Of the comfort and consolacion
Of Israel in his entencion.
For he had answer of the holy ghost
In his prayere that he should se
The birth of Christ / that is of power most
And eke fro death / that he shall go fre
To the time of his natiuite
And to the day / that with his eyes old
The birth of him / that he may behold.
The which day / that with his eyes old
And for that he by reuelacion
The time know / he has the way hold^
To the Temple / with high devotion
To se of Christ the presentacion
How that Marie and Joseph eke also
The child presented / and her offering do.
And for that Christ was the first borne
After the law / in his tender age
Not of Leu^ / as ye have herd toforne
But of Judah / comen by lignage
Therefore his mother / most holy of vysage
Her offrynge made / list not for to strive
For him again / to pay shyllynges five.
Like as the custom of the law was
She mekely made his redemption
And Simeon beholdynge all this cas
Full st^lly in his inspeccion
For love brennynge by affeccion
Of very heart / suddenly abrayed
Holding the child / even thus he seyed.

And suffer me to dye in quyete
For now to me death is wonder sweet
Now have I seen thy health and thy socoure
And of mankind lord and sauyoure.
Which thou haste dyght before the faces all
Of each people to make hem glad and light
To let thy grace / so to earth fall
Through all y^ world / to show his bemes bright
That may be called for comfort of his light
Unto all the gentyles the reuelacion
The glory also / and the salvation.
Of Israel the people in special
To void hem out of all derkenes
And Marie full mekely listeneth all
And began merueyle with great aduisednes
Of the words that he began expres
And Joseph / eke began to wonder also
And Simeon hem blessing both two*
Spoke to Maxie / and said in audience
Behold and se in thine inspeccion
How he is put in ruin and offense
Of many one here in his region
And to so me in resurrexion
That shall releue through his mighty grace
And through thy soul / shall a sharp sword pace.
Of hertely woe / to se his passion
That passyngly shall be bitter and fell
To opene hertes by confession
Her soroufull thoughts / openly to tell
And Anna than daughter of Phanuell
Borne of the Trybe of the kynrede
Called Asser / sothely as I read.
Of the joy that Anna the daughter of Phanes had / when Christ was offered in
to the Temple Capitulo. lxxx.
THat was that day run f^r in age
Within the Temple by contynuaunce
Sole by her self out of marriage
Lay night and day / in fasting and penance
In Wydowe abyte / sade of countenance
And in prayer was her busy cur^
Which in that hour of grace or adventure.
Wha^ Christ's was there / with his mother dear
In the time of his oblacion
This Anna came / demure and sade of chere
And unto him / with great devotion
When she him saw / fill on knees down
Recomforted of all her old smerte
Him honourynge with all her hoole heart.
Said openly that all might here
Bethe merry and light / in your entencion
And every man be glad / and of good chere
For now is borne for our salvation
He that shall make our redemption
This young child / blessed must he be
That me has granted his face for to se.
And than in soth / wha^ every thing was done
After the law withouten excepcion
And than Anna and holy Simeon
Had of this child made declaracion
As ye have herd in conclusion
This child and Joseph / and this maid ^^e
Returned home again in to Galile.
A profitable declaracion of the prop^rtes of the Turtell / and the Dove
Capitulo. lxxxi.
Now as me seems in this hye fer^e
That named is the Purification
Every man ought to be glad and merry
And with good hert^ / and hol^ (...)
Deuoutely bring his oblacion
And offer first the turtell of innocence
Of very mekenes / and hertely patience.
And who y^ would this offrynge make a right
He may not fail / none of both two
First shine in clennes / with his chaste light
As the Turtell / and therewith also
Lyche the Dove / both in we^e and woe
His heart daunte so by temporaunce
To void rancour / and plant in sufferaunce.
And as the Turtell by contemplacion
For sin soroweth with great waymentynge
Only for love / of thylke eternal dileccion
That lasts ay / and has none ending
And as the birth shows the coming
Of grene wherewith fresshe birds new
Right so of virtue / with flowers fair of hew.
He must exampell of the Turtell take
And be well ware / that he not ne varye
But live sole when he has lost his make
And in prayer be also solitary
And look always that he not ne tarry
On no careyne of no flesshely head
And with all this to take also head.
That he his life led not in vain
But like a Dove busely aspye
Where he (...) may the grain
And that he (...) not out of company
Waiting also the galle of envy
And that he have ^y indignacion
Of sinful lust out of corrupcion.
Of any careyne to foster him and feed
And evermore with all his dusy pain
Eschewynge sin / love god and dread
And with the Dove syghe and complain
For his offense / and with wings twain
Take his flight as ferforth as he can
Through parfyte love / both to god and man.
And as the Dove touchet eke her make
Only with kissynge / when they to gyder gone
So most he* whether he sleep or wake
Through chastity / set his heart in one
And like a Dove makes his neste of stone
This is to seye among all his pleasaunce
He must his ^lesshe daunte with penance.
And as the Dove with her eyes meke
Of kind aspyeth amyd the Riuere
The Hawks shadow / when he does her seek
Sechynge his repaste / both far and nere
Right so must he with parfyte eyes clear
Amyd the watres full of woe and strife
In the wawes of his mortal life.
The dedely shadow of the fend esche w^
That wayteth him with snares large and huge
And to the death / ay does him pursewe
To trappe him here in his deluge
And like a Dove f^e to his refuge
By grace only if he may escape
Or death bytraye him with his sodeyne trape.
And who so by clennes / with the Turtell (...)
As I tofore have made mention
And like a Dove before his peril flees
Of death to esche we the persecution
And can be meke in tribulation
I dare record it / write it for soth
Truly to god / he his offering does.
And who that ever lives in chastity
And has envy enclosed in his heart
He may well offer / what so that he be
To god a Turtell / but the Dove naught
Wherefore they must be to gyther brought
That clennes by sothfaste unite
Without partynge / be knytte with charity.
And sothely than there is no more to said
When his offering and oblation
Is justly made to god of both twain
It is accepted of more devotion
And for to make a short description
Of the Turtell / and the Doves kind
Redeth these verses / and ye shull it find.

This feste also / both of more and less
Through out the world / in every region
Called is the feste of ^andelmesse
For sundry skylles / in conclusion
As old books make mention
And how this feste first took his name
So as I can / to you I will atame.
How Candelmasse took first the name. Capitulo. lxxxii.
Sometime when Rome / through his hye renou^
Was most flourige i power and i might
Every fyfthe year by reuolucion
In February upon the first night
Each man and child / with a taper light
Went in the cite / two and two a pas
Unto a Temple / which sacred was.
To Febru^ of old fundacion
That mother was to Mars omnipotente
In whose honor this procession
Ordained was by great auysemente
At each luster wenynge in her entente
That her power and great worthynes
Preserved was through help of this gods.
From all assaute of every aduersayre
Supposing fully in her oppinion
That she fortune made debonayre
For to sustain the honor of her town
And through her help and meditacion
That mighty Mars / to increase her glory
In all conqueste gave to him glory.
For which cause / through out the cite
As ye have herd / of high and low estate
Was first ordained this solempnite
In the Temple that was consecrate
To Februa the gods fortunate
Through help of whom they were victorious
And so this custom supersticious.
In Rome town / as mine auctor seyth
Observed was / long and many a day
yet after that / they turned to the feyth
But ever in one / this ryte they kept always
For old customme is hard to put away
And also usage greueth folk full sore
To do away that they have kept yore.
But at the last Pope Se^gius
Of the people seeing this error
And that the customme was full ^eryllo^s
Did his deuoyre / and also his labor
That ryte to change in to the honor
Of our Lady / so that this hye feste
From the highest down to the loweste.
Every man and woman in her hand
To the Temple should a taper bring
Through out the world / in every manner land
And there withal make her offrynge
After the Gospel / the prestes hand kissynge
With light solemn / that all might it seen
In honor only of the heaven queen.
That best may be our mediatrice
To her sone / that is without fail
Both lord and king / and she imperatric^
Of land and see / of peace and of battle
Withouten whom / no conquest may avail
For she has power more in sothfastnes
Than Februa of Rome the gods.
And thus this ryte was utterly refused
By Sergius as ye have herd devise
That was aforne of hem of Rome used
Full many a day in her paynym wise
Whom to she we all Christen must despise
And of Candels / when this rite began pass
Came the name first of Candelmasse.
This feste also / of full long agone
The name took of the procession
Made of Anna and holy Simeon
When they him mete with great devotion
Brought to the Temple to this oblacion
As was the law custom and vsaunce
Of holy church for a remembrance.
Observed for the / fro year to year
Of February on the first day
With sacred light / upon taperis clear
Shynynge as bright / as Phoebus in May
When the people / in what they can or may
Full ready ben of one entencion
To make in figure a presentacion.
Of Christ Jesus with all her full might
Signefied / who so can take heed
By the tapre / that we offer light
For tyrste the wax betokens his manhede
The weke his soul / the fire his godhede
For as the wax is made of new
Through small bees of flowers fresshe of hew.
Through clennes / only and diligent labors
On blossoms gadred / and to hyue brought
So Christ's manhood / grow out of a flower
Whose fresshe beauty of color fades naught
For a maid clean / in will and thought
Lyche as wax of flower sote and glade
Is tried out / and does hem not to fade.
So Christ Jesus conseruynge her clennes
His manhood took of a maid fre
She standing hole flourynge in fayrenes
With all the fresshenes of virginite
And as a tapre is one to gether on three
So thylke lord / that is both three and one
Took flesh and blood / to save us euerychone.
Of a maid / which this day fro Bethleem
Mekely went to be purified
To the Temple of Jerusalem
As her toforne / it is specified
In whose honor / this feste is magnefied
Of all Christen men / with fresshe tapres shene
To signefye / who so that will be clean.
Must offer a taper to gether made of three
Of feythe and work / and true entencion
For sothfastly / but they conjoined be
Without partynge or division
Another his offrynge ne oblacion
How fair outward / plainly that it seem
To god above / it may never queme.
And though his taper brenne bright all day
And enuiron make his light to shede
If work of fay the / prolonged be away
And true intent / follow not the deed
Fare well his guerdon / his merit and his mede
For when these three be not knytte in one*
He is not able to offrynge for to gone.
For if these three to gyder be not meynte
Feyth / work / and hoole entencion
His offrynge fares but as a taper queynte
That gives no light / but brightness enuiron
For derke of deed from all devotion
His offrynge is / but if this three
Be knette in one / through perfyte unite.
Now Christ / that art the sothfaste holy ligh^
The heart of man for to enlumyne
Upon us wretches / for thy see so bright
Let the Son of thy mercy shine
For love of her / that is a pure virgyne
Which on this day to the Temple went
Of mekenes only the for to present.
Through whose prayer / lord of thy might
Grant us grace / when we be old
And shall dye to hold our tapers light
Tofore thy see / where that it is told
Seven Chaundelars / all of pure gold
Fresshely with light standeafore thy face
Theder to come of mercy / grant us grace.
And in this exyle / where as we soiourne
Grant us lord while that we ben here
In February / as Phoebus does return
The circuit of his golden spear
Upon this day / ay fro year to year
With tapers fresshe / and bright torches shene
To keep and halowe / in honor of that queen /
To whom this feste is in special
Dedicat both of more and less
Which bare her child in a litell stall
Between an Ox / and a sely Ass
And blessed queen / this feste of Candelmasse
To thy servants / shield and socour be
To keep and save from all aduersite.
