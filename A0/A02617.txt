Confutation of a late Pamphlet secretly imprinted and entitled: A Brief
Censure upon two books written in answer to M. Campions offer of
disputation. etc. Compiled by Meredith Hanmer M. of Art, and Student in
Divinity.

To the Right honorable Sir Thomas Bromley knight, Lord Chanceller of
England: William, Lord Burleigh and Lord Treasorer: Robert, Earl of
Leicester: Edward, Earl of Lyncolne: with the rest of her Majesty's most
Honorable counsel, continuance of health, increase of honor, and all heavenly
wisdom.
IT is not long sithence (Right honorable) there was a great brag or challenge
directed to your Lordships from M. Campion a Jesuit, lately arrived here in
England, with other his accomplices and confederates of the Romish religion:
where he declaring his estate and condition craved with show of great
humility such things as were not to be granted: the which petitions falling
into my hands, were scanned, perused, and answered in so modest a sort as I
might, submitting my self, and the whole to your Honorable Censure and
favorable interpretation. Since which time there has been a Pamphlet secretly
imprinted, (no doubt in England) though without name, yet having this Title: A
Brief Censure upon two books made in answer to M. Campions offer of
disputation, containing very dangerous doctrine, vnreuere^t speeches against
particular persons, tending thereby as much as in the Author lay, to discredit
the Gospel and the professors thereof. As hereto fore in mine answer to the
challenge so now also with all humility I thought good to direct unto your
honors a further view of this Jesuitical sect and wandering Romanistes,
displaying in their Banner (as the Title prefixed to the Book gives to
understand) their original and success, their vow and oath, their hypocrisy
and superstition, with their doctrines and positions, being the rather moved
thereunto, by this late Pamphlet, here inserted (as occasion has been given)
and also largely confuted. And seeing it falls out that with singleness of
heart, they seek not after peace, with humbleness of submission, they yield
not unto her Majesty's proceedinges, neither with penitent minds they embrace
the Gospel and the truth of Gods word: let there continue (as Augustine
faith) between us and them, the rather a conflict for the defense of the
truth, then with them in falsehood a concord. But it is greatly to be wished,
and my self with the rest of my fellow laborers, we I say, are most
instantly, again and again to desire your Lordships, to be a mean unto the
Queens most excellent Majesty, that at this present summons, and noble
assembly, in the most honorable and high court of parliament, there be a view
had of this dangerous sort of people, that their rouing be restrained, that
their religion be reformed, if the word cannot take place, in some other sort
as shall seem best to her most Royal mind, and the holy Ghost the guide and
leader of you all. Although Eusebi^s in the life of Constantine the Emperor,
reports that the great clemency of that most noble Prince was misliked, and
that the liberty and favor then showed, grew to looseness: Yet am not I so
straight laced, but that I could wish all kind of fair means, clemency,
courtesy, liberty, conference and long suffering, to be used and showed to
such as are to be won, and especially, in matters of religion. The Prophet
David speaking of the Lord, says: that he is merciful, long suffering,
pacient, yet if the sinner will not turn, he will bend his bow, he will gird
himself, he will whet his sword, and shave the hearie scalpe of the enemy. I
am not to procure this Jesuitical sect displeasure, neither work the^
discredit in respect of their persons, whom in tender love I do heartely
embrace: but it is their religion that I desire reformed, and their Romish
practices detefted and abhorred. How they prevail in other Countries with the
children of unbelief we hear daily: What trasshes they bring in their
Fardels from Rome, we see they be not worth the taking up: how slily they
inueigle the simple, and snare the^ in error, experience do^th. daily teach us:
and what treachery they work in corners against the state of the Realm, the
Crown and dignity, we are vehemently to suspect. They lay fables, visions, and
fond miracles before the people, and keep the word of GOD vnpreached from
them: they swear obedience unto the Pope, and bar Princes of the loyalty
and subjection due unto them: and they prostrate themselves before Idols and
images and rob God of his honor. In tender consideration whereof, may it
please your good Lordships being of her Majesty's most honorable counsel
endued with the spirit of wisdom and counsel; from above: that by your
favorable countenance* religion, and the preaching of the Gospel may be
furthered in this flourishing: common weal, and most Christian Realm of
England: that sects, schisms and heresies may be rooted out: that as there is
one God, one faith, one baptism, one hope of our calling, so we may vn^ai^^dly
honor the same God, embrace the same faith, perform the vow made in the same
baptism, and rest in the same hope, loving one another, praising God, and
obeying our Prince, whom the Lord bless, and preserve long to raygne over us.
AndIo I cease presently, further to trouble your Lordships, but with
remembrance of my humble duty, I desire the Lord long to bless and
preserve your Honors.

From London, the 3. of March. 1580. Your Lordships most humble at
commandment. Meredith Hanmer.

The original of the Jesuits.
Cap. 1.
WHereas heretofore in mine answer to Master Campions challendge I have in
few words displayed the lesuites hammer, to with, the antiquity of their
order, the original of their line, and progress of their society, with other
circumstaunces there unto appertayning and as yet vnaunswered, and that lately
there has been a Pamphlet in hucker mucker imprinted and spread abroad,
entitled: A brief Censure upon two Aunsweres made to Master Campions offer
of disputation, containing very dangerous doctrine, vnreuerent spieches, and
malicious staunders: not only against mine own person by name, but sundry
others, both wise, g^^dly, and learned: I thought good (notwithstanding I
looked for a more modest and more substantial reply) in the mean time to
stay the indifferent Reader, to discharge my self of the several untruths
laid to my charge, and to justify my God whose word I do profess. Sicing
also that the brethren of this new found order, can give us neither truth in
doctrine* neither modesty in words, neither accept of our doings unless
our doctrine he proved, and our allegations culled out of their own Authors: I
will therefore return the d^truthes unto them as their own, and yield them the
measure they gave unto me, yet all in love and Christian modesty. You
contemptuously reie^te the learned ^^riters of our age, nanily John Bale,
Martinus Che^n^zius and Sleidan, yet cannot digest the pedigrew of Ignatius
Layola your progenitor, yet take scorn that I term him a cripled soldiour,

Ichan^e^ Coduri* Alfonsus Salmeronius, Simon Rodericus, Nicholaus Bouadilla and
others, he went to Rome, and craved the Popes bull and facaltie to go a

Afterward this Pope Paulus the third being given to understand how auailable
this order was for the upholding of his pontifical authority, and repairing
of the ruinous walls of his decayed Church* decreed in the year 1543. that
the order called* the society of Jesus should not be tied to any one place of
abode, neither limited with any certain number of brethren. Andradius
concludes: Hac societ atis Jesus initia, hac illins prima origo. These are the

sometime a Jesuit writes thus: Nam tam a quotid^^^a^^^ de rebus diuinis

Iniesuared (or become Iesuses) none otherwise than Christ was incarnate by the
holy Ghost. The whole nature almost of a man being as it were deyfied (in
this society) does testify the same. And here this society shakes hands
with the Family of Love: who say that God i^ (...) in them, and they de^^^ed in

(...)ing of the law, so (I think) they would have us believe, that perfect
holiness consists in their society. Secondly, as Christ commended love by the
name of a new commandment: so would they persuade us, that they practice y^
same by a new order. Thirdly, as Paul allureth all me^ to the executing of the
duties and (...) of love and charity: so they, as Apostles of these latter

Now I return unto you, (the Jesuits) your own speeches and phrases full of
sp^ght, malice, rancour, and venom, wherewith ye inti^le the professors of

And in the mean while until I hear further from you* I will gave you (...)
bo^^^ to pick.

1 First, ((...)er with your self) they offend not a little, who in matters
of religion dos assume or take unto themselves names unfit for them, as you
call your selves Jesuits.

2 Secondly, the name Jesus, and title Christ, by the commandment of the
Father was given as proper and peculiar unto the some of (...) into the world
and therefore no name foryou.

3 Thirdly, the faithful in Christ by direction of the holy Ghost, from the
beginning of the preaching of the Gospel were called Christians, Therefore now
not to be otherwise termed.

4 Fourthly, they seem not to know Christ, or they seem as it were to fall
from him, who in religion those unto themselves any other Title then Christian,
as you do.

5 Fifthly, in your new order calling your selves of Jesus, Jesuits, ye are to
be taken as Authors of novelties, schism, and sacrilege.

6 Sixthly, the Charecters of love, and print of the Cross of Jesus cannot be
seen in your society, therefore are you to be taken for Counterfeites.

7 Seventhly, your society has great affinity or likeness with the
Nazaraean Heretics, enemies unto the Cross of Christ, therefore to be
rejected. I doubt not when yet have picked these bones but that either in
finding no marrowe in them you will throw them to the dogs to snarle at, or
reserving them for some good use, you will gilt them with some glorious
floorishe or gay reply.

Lastly, where I find in your works that you glory in the success of your
society, saying: There is no nation Andrad* lib. 1. Orthod* explic. page 25.
so rude or barbarous to whom the name of the society of Jesus is not well
known, ye might as well have said (all honor and reverence be given to the
name of Jesus) There is no nation under heaven but have heard of the Devil and
beheald his practices. We understand of your schools, Colleges, and
Conuenticles at Colonia, Moguntia, Treueris, Ingolstadium, Oenipontum, Augusta,
Monachium, Tirnauia, Dilinga, Vienna, Praga, Portingallia, Neapolis, and Rome.
Your whispering in Corners, your creeping into companies, your perverting of

often as new things begin to be had in admiration* But as there is nothing

see many orders of Monks, to lay aside their state and doctrines.

The vow and Oath of the Jesuits.

it seemed best unto them selves (yet al ways a moderation and decency
retained) the age following brought in arestraint: first in apparel, then in
meats, afterward in special points as it appears in the substance of
their orders set forth with sundry superstitious ceremonies. First of all (good
christian reader) I will display what I find written in late writers of this
new found order and vpstarting Jesuits. Afterward, what there of is to be
considered. Before this order was confirmed by Paulus y^ third, when as Ignatius
Layola, and his companions wents on pilgrimage to Jerusalem, there were seven
of them shorn Priests at Venice, by Verallus Archiepiscopus Rosanensis, and
there, as Andradius writes: Perpetuam spent ^(...) Deo a^te eius pedes

consider with himself that he is a portion of a society chi^^lie for this

in life and christian doctrine, the spreading of the faith by public Sermons
and ministry of the word of God* by spiritual exercises and works of
charity, and namely, by instructing of children and the ruder sort in
Christianity, and by hearing of confession, and giving Ghostly comfort unto
the faithful. Also let him first have a care of GOD. next of his order, which
is a kind of way unto him, always laying before his eyes this end ordained of
God for him, and with all might of him to be attained unto. Yet let every one
behave himself according unto the grace ministered him of the spirit and the
proper degree of his calling, least that some show a zeal, and not according
unto knowledge. Let the judgment or sentence touching every proper degree, the
bestowing and the distributing of Offices, lie in the hand of the Provost or
Prelate, whom we have too choose, that decency and order may be kept in

of any sending forth, but cast all their care upon GOD, next the Bishop as
his Vicar, Thirdly, the Provost of the society. The which Provost as well as
the re^t, must promise that he also confer not with the said Bishop
touching his own sending forth, without he make the society privy
thereunto.

Furthermore, as the flattering Can^ni^ts have said of the Pope, so does these
Jesuits (...) their Provost, as Franken writes: What things soever the

men is called a promise in respect of God is called a vow. And whereas there
are promises in general y^ which we vow in Baptisime, having the ground and
warrant thereof in holy Scripture, you have tied your selves to specials, and
such a kind of vow as Ricardus defines: Est Ricard. 4. se^^ did. 38. Ar^. ^

your vow has not any ground in the law, it is not of faith, it is beside the

commands have respect to the measure of grace, given unto hun, that he
tempt not the Lord his God. Thirdly let him weigh with what mind he voweth,
if he will have it allowed of God: for in that the Lord regards the heart,
and not the outward show, the heart must be clean before him, al hypocrisy,
vain glory, and opinion of holiness reposed in outward things must be
abandoned. Here your orders of Monks and Friars, your weed and vestments,
your refraining from wine, your abstinence from certain meats, your fasting
on certain days, your observation of times, your barefooted, naked, or half
naked iourneis, your pilgrimage to saints, your lousy scripte poverty, your
girdle of continence, your counterfeite obedience, with all the rash vows of
romish professors must be laid aside. Old father Gerson John Gers^^.
complained of such things in his time. I confess, (says he) we may not
deny, but that there are many things brought in among the simple christians,
under color of religion, the laying aside whereof, were more holy. As your
vows are found diverse, so your law in that behalf is very confuse. Foolish
vows are sometimes extremely urged and recounted for matters of great
importance: the breach of a vow is in some cases venial, in some other
mortal: one while the inferior priest, an other time the Bishop may dispense,
at other Deregu^a. (...). ^^cet. de (...) perue^^^.
times it is a case reserved for the Pope: and again it falls out, that
neither the Pope no nor God himself (as you say) can dispense. Your law
says, that the vow of a mad man does not bind: if the chaung be for better
the vow is not broken: if it be made in anger or heat of choler it deeth not
hold: if the bow dee filthy Glos. in cap. dudum, de conuer. coniuga. 22. q. 4.

or shameful, it must not be performed: if a man vow to visit the holy land,
he may be excused, so that he send thither the twentieth part of the fruits
of his benefice: if a man vow, and die before the fulfilling thereof, the living
may perform it for him: lastly, if one vow to gos on pylgrimage, an other may
do it for him* I would wish M. Campion, that you, with the rest of my
countimen of your society renounced your Popish pylgrimages, and wearisome
iournies by sea and by land, and sufred the roging Jesuits beyond the seas, to
perform your vows. You are an Englishman borne, God has endued you with
sundry good gifts, let not your nature be estraunged, neither go ye about to
thrust into this land for reine power, and such people as curse not only y^
ground we tread upon, but also our bodies and souls, and are ready to cut all
English throats, if they might have access unto us. Ye say ye have vowed,
yet hear what your law says: In malis promissis rescinde fidem: in turpivoto
Causa. 22. quest. 4. in malis.
muta decretum: quod incuate vouisti, ne facias: impia est promissio que
scelere adimpletur. In evil promises break thy faith, in a shameful vow
alter thy mind, which thou have unadvisedly vowed, do not, that vow is
wicked, which is performed with mischief.

The rules of your order are not as yet come to my hands, but the oath which all
you take, that profess the Romish religion, I may not conceal from the
reader, and reading it, I cannot choose but lament, to see your flauerie and
bondage, and the lively caracter of Antichrist thereby imprinted, not only in
the hand of the laborers, Apocalips. 13
but in the forehead of professors and consciences of all those y^ buy and
sell and traffike in his countries and dominions. In english thus I. N. do
firmly admit and embrace the Apostolic and Ecclesiastical traditions, and the
rest of the observations and constitutions of the same church. Also I do admit
the holy scripture according unto that (...) super or (...) and (...) and (...)
artis and (...) culta^^^ (...).
sense, which the holy mother the Church has and does hold it, to whom it
appertains to judge of the true sense, and interpretation of the holy
scriptures, neither will I ever receive or interpret it, but according unto the
uniform consent of the fathers. I do also profess, that there are truly and
properly seven sacraments of the new law, ordained by Jesus Christ our Lord,
and for the salvation of mankind, though not all to every one, necessary. To
wit, baptism, confirmation, the Lords supper, penance, extreme unction, order
and matrimony, and that they confer grace, and of them, baptism,
confirmation and order without sacrilege may not be reiterated. I do also
receive and admit the received and allowed rites of the catholic church in the
solemn administration of all the aforesaid sacraments. I do embrace and
receive al and every the things, which of original sin and justification have
been defined and decreed in the holy synod of Trent. I profess in like
sort, that in the mass there is offered unto god, the true proper, propicia
tory sacrifice for quick and dead. And that in the most holy sacrament of the
Eucharist there is truly really and substantially, the body and blood together
with the soul and divinity of our Lord Jesus christ, and that there is a
conversion of the whole substance of bread into the body, and the whole
substance of wine into blood, the which conversion, the catholic church
calls transubstantiation. I confess with all, that under one only kind
whole and perfect Christ, and the true sacrament is received. I do constantly
hold purgatory, and that the souls there detayned, are relieved by the prayers
of the faithful, and in like sort, that the Saints reigning totogether with
christ, are to be honored and callled upon, and that they pray unto God for
us, and that their relyques are to be worshipped. I do firmly auouche, that
the Images of Christ, and the mother of God always a virgin, and also of other
Saints are to be had and retained, and that we are to give them due honor
and worship. I do affirm, that the faculty of pardons has been left by
Christ in the church, and that the use of them is very wholesome to christian
people. I do acknowledge the holy catholic and Apostolic church of Rome, for
the mother and mistress of all churches. I do promise and swear true
obedience to the Bishop of Rome, successor of blessed Peter, prince of the
Apostles, and Vicar of Jesus Christ. I do also undoubtedly receive and pro^esse
all that have been delivered, defined, and declared by the holy cannons and
general councelles, and specially by the holy Synod of Trent, and withal al
things contrary and haeresies whatsoever have by the church been condemned,
rejected and accursed, I also do condemn, reject and accurse. This true
catholic faith, without the which none can be saved, the which I do presently
willingly profess and truly hold, the same wholly and imaculate unto the last
gasp most constantly to retain, teach and preach as much as in me shall lie,
I the same N. do promise vow and swear, so God me help, and the holy Gospels
of God. New comes Pope Impius 4. with his farewell. Let it not be lawful
therefore for any man at all to infringe this page or leaf of our ordinance,
inbibition, derogation, will, statute decree, and commandment, or with rash
enterprise to contrary the same, if any therefore presume to attempt the same,
let him know that he incurreth the indignation of almighty GOD and of blessed
Peter and Paul the Apostles. Dat. Romans apud 5. Petrum. Anno 1569. Id. No^em.
Pontific* nostri ann^ 5 Good God, what perjury, Idolatry, heresy, and
blasphemy there is contained in the aforesaid oath? And the spirit of
Antichrist is plainly revealed in the cursed conclusion following after.

In truth such traditions as are contrary, and besides the word of God, though
they be called Apostolic, are not to be received: that sense and exposition of
the scriptures, which the Church of Rome delivers, is not the right and
perfect understanding: the Church (and especially as you deliver it) the Church
of Rome is not judge of the scriptures: there are but two Sacraments, Baptism,
and the Lords supper, the rest by you added art of an other kind and nature,
in which sense we may say, as Jerome said of the Revelation: Look how many
words we find there, so many Sacraments there are. The Sacraments confer not
grace, as you imagine. Ex opere operato: the rites in the administration of the
Sacraments retained in the Church of Rome, are childish, superstitious, and
impious: that doctrine of original sin and justification, lately decreed in
the council of Trent, is plasphemous and abominable. The Mass is an Idol,
and the sacrifice there pretended for quick and dead is a deceiving of the
people: the Eucharist is not real, substantial with the soul and divinity
of Jesus Christ neither transubstantiated: the Sacrament is not perfect, when
it is delivered under one kind: Purgatory is a fable, neither are the souls
of the departed, relieved by the prayers of the living: the Saints are not to
be inuocated, their relics are not to be worshipped, neither Images to be
adored: Popes pardons are to no purpose, but a deluding of Gods people, and the
filling of the poke: Rome is neither catholic, apostolic, nor the Lady and
mistress of al other Churches: the Pope is not the true successor of Peter,
neither the Uicar of Jesus Christ: to receive what Rome receives, and condemn
what she condemns, is ^o deliuere Barrabas, and crucify Christ: to embrace
the before said doctrine is dangerous, maliciously to impugn the truth of
the contrary, and with Pharao therein to harden the heart against the Lord, and
lastly to deny the truth, and blaspheme the majesty of Jesus, is unpardonable
for ever. It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

lawful to be observed.

Peradventure ye may be sound in the number of the two hundred, which went with
Absalon from Jerusalem to H^bron (as he made them believe) to perform his vow.
They were (as the story says) of simple hearts and minds, and altogether
ignorant of the cause, which in very deed was to rebel against David, their
sovereign and the anointed of God. Of whom it is thought, when they
understood the pretense, y^ they repented: but if by the way they had been
taken, they had been to be charged with rebellion Examine, I beseech you the
nature of your vows and oaths, it happily may fall out, that ye shall find
your self deceived and abused by others, if in time ye conform your self,
there is hope of grace. The question is not whether vows are to be kept, but
what vows they be that are made, and stand with the word of God, and are true
vows. To vow and swear with the Pharisees, Acts. 23.
neither to eat bread neither to drink wine before they had killed Paul, is
very impious and contrary to the commandment, therefore no godly promise,
neither to be performed.

I would wish you used means by calling your self home, and to avoid the
heavy hand of the Lord, withstand al errors that impugn the manifest truth
in the word of God, and fly from them. Peter answered the high priest we ought
to obey God, rather then men* Augustine teaches Acts. 5.

things, which christ has not taught: for Christ is the way unto the
faithful. If therefore Christ has not taught that which we teach, yea we our
selves will account it detestable. I will not stand presently to confute the
several points of the aforesaid permtious oath, but refer them to the last
tract of this book, where I purpose to examine your doctrine. In the mean
while take the Censure of Cardinal Vergerius, Pope Paulus 3. legate, that
confirmed your order. Popterea repudianda tanquam falsa, quia a Verger. resp^
ad lib. Antichrist. Romans
Romana credu^tur ecclesia, quae ^^mirum solet credere diuersa and contraria

false, because they are believed of the church of Rome, which truly is wont to
believe, repugnant and contrary things to these, which the son of God has
taught.

The hypocrisy and superstition of the Jesuits.
Cap. 3.
IT would require a long time and great leisure sufficiently to dilate of
this Jesuiticall sect, the hypocrisy and superstition of Monks and Friars,
with all other irreligious orders. But that I may orderly proceed herein, by
way of preamble, I will consider of the present occasion, which moved me so
speedily to take pen in hand. The Author of the Pamphlet, entitled A brief
Censure, printed, as he says at Doway, by John Lion, and that Cum
priuilegio, plays his part egregiously.

Their dealing in saying they come from far, and that their book was printed
beyond the seas, together with that which they report of the antiquity of
their doctrine we may behold in the crafty Gabaonits, who being neighbors
of Joshua, and adjoining upon Israel, came to I^s^. 9.
entreat of peace, taking old sackes upon their Asses, old bottels for wine,
old clouted shoes, old raiment, saying unto Joshua, we are come from a very
far country, all was old, so would they make us believe. For they load
Romish Asses with old sackes full of traditions, their old bottelles are broken
cesterns, their wine is egre, their Mass is an old clouted sh^^e, their old
raiment i^ an ^^^ite full of counterseite holiness, al is so old, that it st^^^s
for stains. And now forsooth they come from far, I sear me it is from the
devil, and that is very sarre from God. Paulus Florenus says of the Jesuits:
This our Jesuitical C^^^^q (...)* ^^^ page (...).
religion is altogether made of superstition, hypocrisy, and a certain
feigned and painted holiness. Again: there is no man at all fit for this
religion, but he that has a natural inclination to hypocrisy and
superstition, gotten Page 1^.
either by seru^le education, or taken by some b^ockishnes of mind. This we
may see in Ignatius Layola the Spaniard, which of all other nations is most
superstitious, and tyr^annous in urging the dregs of Rome, and the drunken
cup of the strumpet of Babylon. For a true christian and a professor of the
Gospel (be he an Englishman, or what other nation soever) shall find more
favor among the Papists in France, with the Pope at Rome, and the Turk in
his dominions, then among the inquisitors in Spain. And whom has Satan
thought fittest to sow his tares of hypocrisy and suspicion, now in the end of
the world, then Layola the spaniard, and father of Jesuits. They make an Idol
of the Pope, so that Christian Franken being a Jesuit* and Page 40*
seeing the worship that was done unto him, says: I verily took him for
christ, or rather some greater thing. I will pass over their Idolatry and
superstition, in worshipping La Madonna di Loreto, our Lady of Larctum in
Grego* de valent* de idola^ cont. sect* d^s*
Italy* Gregorius de Valentia, the Jesuit is, not ashamed to defend in three
several tractes, that the adoration of the sacrament, the honoring of
Saints, and the worshipping of Images and relics is no Idolatry: concluding
most blasphemously in on respect: praise be unto God, and to the most blessed
virgin Mary, joining the cre^^t^re, as partaker of praise with the creator. I
will Christ. Fran. de bestial. idol page 57.
not speak of the two brazen pyllers at Rome, fall (as they say) of holy
earth, died with the blood of Christ, so that they have two Christ's, the one
dead and dissolved to earth, the other aliu^, and sitting at the right hand of
the father. Franciscus Xauir, the Iesnite, having nuztled the heathenish
Indians in Idolatry, was recounted Jacob Payua. Andrad. Orthodox ex^^ plic.

among them (says Payua) as an other Frauncis, the Father of Minorites, so
that they honor and worship most religiously his corpse, which as yet not
without a miracle is kept whole. Believe if who will. The Jesuiticall miracles
of Goncallus de Silueria the Portingale, are very ridiculous, where it is
reported, that he tied his holy vestments (be like the Cope and surplesse)
about his head, and s^^^mme over a great water in the Indies: again, thathee
went into a pottage pot, gave himself to the riuen, and that the swift stream
carried him to the land. But lastly he used such iugling feats and apish toies
at his service in y^ kingdom of Manamotapia, yt they took him for a coniurer,
and cast him into the water, where neither pot nor portnise, nor cope nor
surplesse could save his life. This is that order, which now adays is counted
only holy. This M. Stapleten in the fourth book of the counterblast.
is y^ order which M. Stapleton with dasled ties, or rather as it were a man
frighted out of a sullen dumpe, wondreth at, where he writes: Surely if a man
would deeply and thoroughly weigh and consider the greatness of this benefit, he
might well doubt, whether after the creation of the world and he redemption of
mankind, by the passion of Christ, there be any one benefit or work of God
more wonderful then this: or whether there be any one state or vocation in
Christ's church, after the Apostles more worthy laud and praise then these
Jesuits. Yet Colloq. Jesus. itic* epist. dedis.
Christian Franken protests before God, that this order is nothing else, but
an hid or cloked poison under the divine name of Jesus that it is: a
pharisaicall sect, full of guyle and fashood. Again, says he: None of all the
Jesuits, truth and conscience being against them, dares or shall be able
truly and sincerely to answer it. I may not here forget Theatinus the
hypocrite: and now to you M. Censurer. You charge me very deeply, that in
mine answer to M. Campion, I should call I heatinusa Jesuit: In the book
^^tuled The Briese Cen* sur^. etc.
your words are these. He blusheth not to put in print so notorious an
untruth in the sight of all the world, and to repeat, urge and amplify the
same so often in his book saying: that one Theatinus a Jesuit hypocritically
got to be cardinal and Pope meaning thereby, Paulus quartus, called before
Johannes Petrus Caraffa, of the order of I heatines, and not of Jesuits, which
all the world knows to be two several and distinct orders of religion, and
therefore M. Hanmer with friar Bale, whom he cites in the margent may be
ashamed of so false a sla^der, both toward the man, and also the religion. In
this your grane censure and great wisdom, you seem not to deenie but that he
was an hypocrite, you will in no wise grant that he was a Jesuit. You term
my allegation an untruth, you reject mine Author John Bale, quoted in the
marge^t, and insteede thereof you placed Payua, a Jesuit, and a pertiall writer,
whom you will needs have credited. Che^nizius, Mar. Chem. John Sleid. Cel.
secund. Cur. P. Paul. verg. Jacob. Herebr. Ioh, Bale.
Sleidan, Caelius, Vergerius, Herebra^dus, Bale, with others, do call him a
Jesuit: yet are you so wedded to your will, that one Payua with you shall have
the prise, and weigh al these learned writers. It appears in truth, that
first he was a Jesuit, afterward, as the manner is of vain and unstable
heads, having no sure ground nor stay of Gods word, he fell to devising a purer
trade of life, which after him were called Theatines. Yet again, that ye may
more plainly conceive the truth, he fell first from the common trade of
Christian life, to play the Jesuit: secondly, from the Jesuiticall sect, to be
a Theatine ^ thirdly from an hypocritical Theatine to be Pope. These
circumstances in sum shall appear in the works of Andradius the Jesuit,
where he writes: There were Jacob. Payua Andrad. lib. 1. Orthod. explic.
certain men, who being inflamed with kindled desire of holiness, were wont
oftentimes to meet together in some secreete place, severed from the common
sort of people, to the end they might earnestly occupy themselves in prayers,
ministration of the sacraments, and other works of charity. The which company
was therefore called: Diuini amorts sodalitas, the society of divine love: by
whose example, Paulus the 4. who the^ was called Johannes Petruscar^ffa, being
stirred up, joined himself to their number or company. When he had, for a
certain space exercised himself in those noble works, four of those holy
and religious men, to wit, this Paulus the 4. who then was bishop Theatinus,
Caietanus, Bonifacius, and Paulus Romanus, being stirred up. I wot not by what
particular kind of instigation of the holy spirit, being inflamed with a
singular desire of heavenly love, being moved with a great and a just kind of
sorrow or grief* that this our sacred order of clergy had so filthely
degenerated from the first sincerity and purity of old and decayed, to the
great ht^i^ of the church, began a notable kind of order, whereby they might
in some part conserve and call again the ancient integrity. Again, when
they had given all their substance in common to be distributed, as every ones
necessity required, and laid aside all cares counting human affairs, they
gave themselves w^^ly to sound divine praises and heavenly meditations, and
took in hand in all respect that trade of life, which they judged to be most
like unto the purity of old. Where ^^^^ they were called Regular priests. Yet
because P^ulus the squeth* bishop of Rome having the^ forsaken his ^^^^oprike
of Theatum, took himself to this order, with great wonder of all men, they
were all called Theatines.

so far he, Here Andradius justifies that which has been already said of
Theatinus the Hypocrite. First, that the brotherhood whereto he linked
himself, was called: Diuini amoris sodalitas, The society of holy love,
(...) 5. (...)
Osorius, Christian Franken, and Payua do call your society, Sodalitatem,
your selves consesse that because of the great love and charity among you,
your socictie is honored with the name of Jesus Secondly, under pretense of
holiness, he forsook his Bishopric. it cannot be denied. Thirdly, he fell to
a purer order, so Payua confesses, which he thought to be most like, or
nee^est the purity of old. Lastly, he was weerie of this purity and became
Pope, so that men woondred not so much at his holiness before, as they did
now at his pride. And in Italy unto this day there arose of him a Proverb,
that if any mention be made of any famous hypocrite they christian him:
Theatino. Yet one thing more of him I may not conceal from the Reader. He
being at Venice, his sacrificing Priests hearing confession, were woonte to
reveal unto him, all that in secretie was delivered unto them, and he at
certain times would very solemnly with color of great holiness, give the
parties to understand thereof, so that they took him for a Prophet. And among
many others there was one (says the story) who prostrated himself before him:
Eumque adorat, clamans oportere Call. Secund. Cur(...). Pasquil (...).
eum esse alterum Christum. And worshippest him, crying out, that he ought to
be an other Christ Morcouer the hypocrisy of this order appears in their
voluntarye whipping and scurging called among them discipline and penance, the
which as Christian Franken testifies, cost many youths their lives in their
years of probation. And he also himself had hardly escaped death had he not
through friendship been removed from the College in Rome to a place in
Campana. I have oftentimes trembled (says he) Recordans nostrorum flagellorum

do write of certain hypocrites called Sarabaitae, who at certain solemn
feasts were wont to repair to Jerusalem their prostrating themselves,
wringing their hands, yielding scritches and deep sighs, pulling y^ hear of
their heads and of their beards, and renting with their nails the skin and
flesh of their faces, and after y^ by this guileful me^^ they had stirred men's
minds to de^otio^* liberality and good opinion of the^, they would depart. Here
not only y^ law of God which co^de^neth al such counterfeite affliction, but
also y^ law of nature is broken which forbids man to offer in^ury or
violence to himself. This penance or affliction bewrays it self and is
proved pharisaicall in that it is openly done in the sight of the world, that
man may conceive thereof an holy opinion. For the Pharisees M^^^h. 6. Mark. 12.
giving alms, had the trumpet of vain glory sound in their cares: when they
prayed they stood in the corners of the streets, that passengers might
behold them: when they would be honored with glorious titles, they walked
abroad to be saluted of men in the market place. Furthermore these Jesuits in
habit and order, join with the Pharisees, as they were known by their
Philacteries and order after the Etymology of their name (divided from the
common sort of people) much like unto munkes as Theophilactus writes: so this
Iesuitical sect is descired by their long ^ackets, their course stockinges,

sorbonical tippet, their coptanked quoyfe their broad brimde hat, which
oftentimes (as it is thought) for humilities sake they bear in their hands
through the streets full of (hypocrisy) I would say courtesy, when there is
none to be saluted. To every man they say: God and our Lady bless ye. Their
habit and their order is no less holy then y^ of the pharisees. As I have
said heretofore to M. Campion y^ opinion thereof, I mean of irreligious orders,
has bewitched not only mean persons, but also great personages, and princes.
For Franciscus Marquis of Mantua, Albertus Pius John Sleid. lib. 12.
Prince of the Carpies, and the great Clarke, Chrisiophorus Longolius charged
their executors to burye the^ in Saint Francis weed, they hoped (says the
story) to obtain remission of sin, if they were buried in a gray friars
cote. Here M. Censurer takes eccasion to lay down his unadvised judgment.
Whereas to this purpose I alleged Aquinas without quoting the place, he
bewraieth his ignorance in denying the allegation, the which as it appears he
never read: his words are these, where he speaks of the answer to M.
Campions challenge. He is not ashamed to auouche without In the book
entitled: A brief ce^sure. etc.
citing the place that S. Thomas of Aquine holds, the wearing of Frauncis or
Dominikes cowle to have power to remove sin as well as the sacrament of
Baptism, I return the shame to the Church of Rome, and Aquine, the Friar who
mainteineth this superstitious opinion. And as for you M. Censurer you were
best plead ignorance and say: Non putaram. Aquinas has hereof a large
discourse where first he shows the degrees to attain 2^ 2^. de ingress.
relig. quast. 189.
unto the perfection of holiness, by comparing this professed vow or order of
Munkerie and Fratrie with the Sacrament of Baptism. Secondly, he entreats
of the necessity of fulfilling this vow, saying: Implere id quod vouetur
necessitatis est. The professed is of necessity to perform that which is
vowed. again: Post votum nonpotest aliquis finem salutis consequi, nisi
impleat votum. After the vow be made, a man cannot attain the end of
salvation or soul health, unless he fulfill the vow. And to salve the
breach thereof he says: Hoc non derogat bonitati vot^, sicut nec derogat
bonitati Baptismi quod aliqui post Baptismum grauius peccant. This does not
prejudice the goodness of the vow, no more then it derogateth the goodness
of Baptism, that some after Baptism do more grievously offend. Thirdly, he
declares the power and virtue of this vow or order: Rationabiliter autem dici
potest quod etiam per ingressum religionis aliquis consequatur remissionem
omnium peccat^rum. It may reasonably be said that by entering into Ibidem.
vow or order of Religion, a man may obtain remission of all his sins. He
yields a reason of the same: Even as with certain alms deeds a man may
forthwith make satisfaction for his sins, according unto that in the fourth
of Daniell: redeem thine offenses with alms deeds: much the rather in making
satisfaction for all sins, it is sufficient that a man bequeath himself wholly
to divine service, by entering into holy order, which passes all manner of
satisfaction. ^astly he concludes that, which I have heretofore alleged, as
his opinion. Legitur ^^ vi^^^ patrum quod ^^ndem gra^^am consequuntur
rellgionem ^^trantes quam consequuntur baptizati. It is read in the lives of
fathers, that such as enter into holy order, do obtain the same grace, the
which such as are baptized do attain unto. It should appear M. Censurer,
that ye are but a nouice: you were best confer with the old singeantors, and
learn further of their order. This was the received opinion of that age, as we
may gather by that, which the Monks demanded of Barnard: you will hear this
of me (says he) Whereupon Barnard. ^^ praecep^ ^. despens.
among other the ordinances of penance it comes to pas, that monastical
discipline deserved this prerogative, that it should be called second baptism.
As I suppose, because of the perfect renouncing of the world, and the passing
excellency of the spiritual life, wherewith this conversation excelling all
other kinds of humane trade of life, makes the professors and embracers
thereof like unto Angels, unlike unto men: yea, it reformeth the Image of God
in man, conformans nos Christo instar baptismi, co^forming us unto christ like
baptism. And we are as it were the second time baptized, whilst by
mortifying our earthly members, which are upon earth: we again put on christ,
being set a new after the similitud of his death. And withal, as in baptism
we are pulled out from the power of darkness, and translated into the kingdom
of eternal light: so by a certain new birth of this holy vow or order, we
pass in like sort out of the darkness not of one orginall, but of many
actual sins into the light of virtues. When the professed solemnlie doweth,
the Bishop answers: And I promise thee the Confirmat. Ord.
kingdom of heaven and life everlasting, if thou observe these things.
Again: in the monastical absolution it is said: The rygor of the vow, the
merit of the order be unto thee for remission of sin, and reward of
everlasting life. Bernardinus de Busto is of this opinion. The irreligious man
always when he remebreth that he has vowed, Bernard. de Bust. in Rosar.
and is therewith quiet, and would do it afresh, if he had not done it before,
for every such turn he obtains full remission of all his sins. Albertus
Pighius has thought no less, and of late Petrus a Soto, who left both Albert.

life and lewd opinion at the council of Trent, has written the like in his
catholic confession: We may justly with Alfonsus de Castro call this dealing
blasphemy: for if S. Paul pronounced, as concerning the works of the law,
which were commanded from above: If righteousness come by the law, then
Christ died in vain: How much y^ more with grief we may not only complain,
but cry out: if vows and religious orders have no warrant from above, but y^
devises of man's brain be a full satisfaction for all sin, and deserving a
plenarie remission (for so they write) of original and actual misdeedes, then
Christ dyed unto them in vain. Again of the vows and orders of Monks and
Friars be equivalent or of like force with baptism for the purchasing of
remission, a pana and culpa (as they would make us believe) then faith is to no
purpose, the preaching of the word is in vain, and the use of the Sacraments
is done away. I cannot, but Alphons. de Castr. aduer. haeres. lib. 1. cap. 9.
stomach them (says Alfonsus de Castro) who to set forth their order, are
not ashamed to brag in open audience, and to avouch, that he which once
takes upon him the weed of that order, cannot err in faith, neither fall
from the truth. Is not this open blasphemy, when as hereby he seems to
attribute more unto the weed wherewith he is clad, then to the faith, or grace
of God! Is that cloth or garment of more virtue then the grace of God, or
faith? the devil go with so great a madness. Yet neither faith, neither grace
received in baptism does so preserve man, but that he may fall into heresy.
How comes it to pass then, that the habit preserves? if any will refer
this to the profession, and not to the weed that he affirm the profession,
which in that order he vowed, has power and effycacie, who is it but sees
that we all vowed christianity in baptism, yet does not that vow keep us so
secure, neither make us so free, but that we may fall into heresy? neither
will there be any man so impudent, that he can deny, but that the vow in
baptism is more glorious, and of greater force, then any that is made after.
Let such then go with a vengeance, and leave those toys for Poets to prate
of and let them preach better stuff unto the people. I call God to witness, I
lie not, a certain friar, in my hearing in open audience, upon the Saints
day that founded that order, preached, that who so would put upon him the
habit of that order, could in no wise be an heretic: I hearing it, abhorred
the boldness and impudency of the man. So far Alfonsus. It lyketh you not,
that your Romish orders and irreligious sects of Monkerie and fratrie should
be so contemned, and disgraced among the godly through out the militant Church
here on earth, and therefore, to uphold their credit, and to cloak their late
hypocrisy and superstition, you allege the fathers of old, Augustine,
Athanasius, Basil, Nazianzen, Chrysostom, Cassianns, Seuerus Sulpitius, who
(as you think) may stand you in some steed, as a bare shifte to s^^e out so
had a matter, and with theit here (...) to bleare the eye of the simple ^. ^^

u^ the time of the Appostles: all your Romish orders, if they be brought to
the* touthstone of Gods word, they are no gold, but copper and counterfeit
metal: if they be brought to the balance of purity in profession, though
laden with traditions and Jewishe ceremonies, yet light in truth and ancient
integrity: and if with the young Egles, for certeintie of issue and o^^prnig
they be brought to behold the golden beams of the bright sun, they will close
up their eye liddes, they will be found bastardes, and such as have degenerated
from God their father, and fallen from the word, which his son Christ and our
Jesus has delivered unto us. Many of your own authors, of no small credit
amongst you, will auowch the same. I report me to the visions showed to your
holy people, so termed among you: to wit, Briget, Elizabeth, Hildegar,

how much do we nowadayes differ from the Monks that lived in the days of

like as chalk is to cheese, or as an apple to an oyster, or as it were an Apes

drinks, vows, habites, ceremonies, altars, shrines, relics and Romish

The doctrine and positions of the Jesuits.
Cap. 4.
IAm now entering into a labarynth of romish errors, when as I take pen in
hand, to painte forth unto the posterity this Iesuitical sect, and to display
their erroneous doctrine and heretical positions. The impudency of some is
such, that there is no doctrine so wicked, but they will face it out: no
positions so impions, but they have wherewith to b^ulster them: no superstition
or idolatry so abominable, but that they can cloak with a mantell of fig
leaves, marching forth like ^oly champions to encounter with the Saints of
God, bearing upon their shoulders like Atlases, the pynacles of the Romish
Babylon. And that I may orderly proceed, I will begin with the brief
Censure, being as it were an Interim from M. Campion, where in this respect,
and upon the like occasion, an odious comparison is laid down between Luther
(as it pleased him to write, progenitor of the Protestants) and Layola the
cripple, Father of the Jesuits, and founder of their lame and ha^ting
religion. To the end they might discredit the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and the
professors thereof, this Censurer has culled out of Luthers works certain
notes and imperfect conclusions, which in his foolish opinion, seem not to
contain the soundest kind of doctrine. And as we defend not ^en neither (...)
of men, but justify our God ^ vow the truth in his word, as we call not our
selves Lutherans, Cal^inistes, Zwinglians, they being nor masters unto us, nor
we Disciples to them, for Christ it is whom we serve, and his Gospel we
embrace: yet insomuche Luther with others of like profession being faithful
members and paynefull laborers in the Uineyarde of his Church, have deserved
well of the posterity, we are to prayss God for them, and in brotherly and
Christian love to purge and clear them of the untruths, slanders, and crimes
laid to their charge, by the malicious and spiteful enemy. So it is M.
Censuer, yt first ye allege out of him for erroneous doctrine, where he
writes: There is no sin but incredulity, Luther* tom. 2. lib. de Captiuit.
Babyl. cap. de Bapti.
neither can a man damn himself, do what mischief he^an, except he will
refuse to believe, Although ye have r^^ked his words upon the tentors of
prejudice and partial translation, yet the truth appears notwithstanding,
and the doctrine in that sense which he delivered it, is Christian and
comfortable. Luther discourses there very renerently of Baptism, of the
promise of God thereunto annexed, of faith to apprehend the same, and
repentance. Where he lays faith as the root, yielding moisture to al other
virtues, and of the other side, infidelity, as the fountain of all mischief,
issuing to damnation: so that though a man be baptized, though he hear the
promises, though he repent with Judas, if he beleene not Gods word to be true,
and his promises sure and certain, apprehending the same by faith,
incredulity as the fountain is the cause of his damnation. If a man dishonor
God, if he fall to idolatry, if he profane the Sabbath, if he kill, if he
steal, if he covet, and so forth, and afterward repent from the bottom of
his heart, God is willing, ready and able to forgive: but if he that so
repents, will not (...) the (...) ^^ by ^^^^ ^^^ ^^^ta^^^ faith apply it to
his comfort incredulity ^^ it* that co^dem^eth him. This is the doctrine of
Luther, this is it, which all the Jesuits in the world shall not be able to
overthrow. The like he has delivered in sundry other places, the ground
thereof is in holy scripture, and the Luther, (...). 5. ^^ 1. Cor. ^. Tit. 1.
rocks is Christ. Unto the deane* all things are clean: but unto the defiled
and faithless, there is nothing clean* yea their mind and conscience is
polluted. There is no damnation unto them that are in Romans 8.
Christ Jesus. Unto them that love God, all things turn to the best.
Whatsoever is not of faith, is sin. So that Romans 11.
all sins and iniquities lie here soaking in the root of incredulity. GOD
(says Saint Paul) has ^^ut up all Marc. 1^
in unbelief or incredulity, that he may have mercy upon all. He that
belieueth, and is baptized, shall be saved: John. 3.
but he that believes not, shall be condemned. He that believes in him, shall
not be condemned: but he that believes not, is already condemned. Secondly, as
ye peeped in at the kay hole to view the commandments, and Luthers
commentaries therevppon, you Luther. ^om. 3. lib. quo m^do and quo. fiuctu,
^^bri Mosis* Christ^anis legensunt. ^ust^^. Martyr in Colloq* cum. T^^phou.
found in a glymse, written by Luther: The ten commandments appertain
nothing unto us, where ye think that ye have gotten great vauntage. Luther
deals plainly, if malice had not blinded your eyes, ye might have perceived,
that he meant nothing less. He neither added too, neither took froe. They
were your pregenitors of the Romish synagogue, that learned of their for
fathers, the Jews, as Justinius Martyr writes, to raze y^ scriptures. For you
have taken out, as it appears unto y^ world, the second commandment, which
is against your carved Images, and divided the tenth, to supply the want
thereof. But returning to Luther (having said thus much by the way) I will not
give you the lie: but I ^ ^ Luth. tom. 3. lib. quomodo etc. vt supra.
^ question, then he (...) (...) (...) (...) ab omnibus s^ruanda; and ad omnes
perti^e^^, sed ^^^ quia a Mose pracep^^^sed quid (...) (...) he l^ges decalogi
inscript^ s^^t. The precepts of the d^^^loge o^ ten commandementes are of all
men to be kept, and they appertain unto all, but not because they were
enjoined by Moses: but because these laws of the ten commandments are
imprinted or written in the nature of men. Thereby giving us to understand,
that the law of nature, is indeed the law of God. Not only says h^^ this,
which is contrary to your slander ^^^ allegation, but also indu^eth the
faithful in Christ by three reasons, to the reading and embracing of Moses, and
his works, the which I need not presently to repeat. Thirdly, ye come
^^^ping among the Gospelles, and take hold of a preface, where (you not
understanding y^ same) Luther (as ye say) wrote: It is a false opinion and to
be abolished, that there are four Gospelles: forth Gospel of John is the
only fair, true, and principal Gospel. I cannot but marvel, at your
childish dealing, and wilful ignorance. The last word principal has relation
unto that, which you will not reneale. Are there four Gospels, or has Christ
delivered unto v^ four will of the Father? Do ye find the Gospel of Matthew,
the Gospel of Mark, the Gospel of Luke, y^ Gospel of John? or rather y^
gospel after Matthew, Mark, Luke, John? There is but one Gospel, though there
are four Evangelists, and they entreating one thing, their harmony is called
the Gospel, whereof John is counted the principal, mounti^^^loft, as the Egle

of Christ, it is one Gospel* though we one way deliver the same: and an other
handle it with other words. And again, one word thereis, one Gospel, even
as there is one only faith, and one baptism throughout the whole church of
Christ.

^ Fourthly not being content with the forme^ vn^^ne the, ^^^staunder Luther*
that he should write: If any woman cannot, or will not prove by order of law,
the insufficiency of her husband, let her request at his hands a divorce, or
else by his consent let he^^ye ^^iuely with his brother, or withsome other man.

is the gift of God as well as continency. Man is more excellent then the
woman, yet she is the work of GOD as well as he. Before GOD all things
are equal, which otherwise differ among themselves. So wedlock and
virginity are one before him for they both are the gift and work of God,
although Luth. tom. ^. de vo^* mo^^s^^.
the one do excel the other, being compared among themselves. Seventhly you
report that Luther should say, Christ and Paul did not counsel, but
dissuade virginity unto christians. Here ye are not ashamed to falsify his
words and slander his doctrine. For as he wrote thus they lie: Virginity
and single life are counseled, Christ himself has not plainly counseled,
but rather dis^waded, he only showed and commended it, while he said unto the
Eunuchs: he that is able to receive Matthew. 19.
this, let him receive it: And again: All men cannot receive this thing. Are
not these the words of one that rather withdraws and disswadeth? For he
allureth and calls none* but only shows it. Yet Paul 1. Corinthians. 7
says: I give counsel, neither does he allure any, but rather dissuade and
withdraw, while he says: every man has a proper gift of GOD, neither does
he counsel, neither dissuade, but leaves it beetweene both. First I note
your malice in that you allege Christ and Paul as jointly alleged by
Luther, which he has not done. Secondly in that ye deliver not simplye his
meaning expressed in these fearmes: Plainly and Rather. Lastly, in that ye
conceal his conclusion, which resolves the whole and lays down the right
understanding of the holy Ghost according unto the exposttion (...) Luth. do
vot.
Luther writing: It is as necessary for every man (that cannot contain) to
have a wife as i^ i^^^ care, drink, or sleep. What fault find ye with this
doctrine? there is none that wro^te more reverently of blessed wedlock and
holy virginity then Luther has done. In that place by you alleged and in
sundry other his learned discourses Tom. 1. sermon. de matri^on, and tom. 5. in.
1. Cor. 7
he entreats of the soul and the faculties thereof, he displayeth the body
with the senses, passions, and affections of the mind, the disposition inward
and outward, not forgetting, diet, raiment, with other necessaries thereunto
appertaining: and amongst al with great modesty he lays down the necessity
of matrimony, for those that cannot keep their vessels sta^^ch and (...).
Nienthly ye bring in Luther saying: All christians are as holy and as just as
the mother of GOD and as the Apostles were. You have practiced so long to
flaunder his person, and falsify his words that ye cannot leave it, he has
written not as you say, but as follows: Because we are borne again and in
this new birth become the Luth. tom. 5. in. 1. epist. Pet. cap. 1.
sons and heirs of GOD, we are equal in dignity and honor with Saint
Paul, Saint Peter, and the blessed virgin, and all the Saints. We have the
same treasure of GOD, and all good things as largely as they. For it behooved
that they should be borne again, as well as we, wherefore they have no more
than any of the other Christians. These words do not establish your
imagination, neither can ye ground here that comparison. Jacob. 1. Romans 8.
Matthew. 25. Apocalip. 19. Matthew. 20.
For (without derrogation to any of the Saints be it spoken) all y^ believe
rightly in Christ Jesu, are borne again, are become the sons and heirs of
God, are the blessed of the father, they shall follow the Lamb whither soever
he goes, and shall receive their penny in the life to come, as well as y^
blessed Uirgin, the holy Apostles, or any of ye saints of God already departed
to rest. But as for their special graces, namely, y^ Mary should bear Christ,
Matthew. 1. Act. 9. Act. 2. Jacob, 4. Romans 12. 1. Corinthians. ^^ Matthew. 2^.
that Paul should be a chose^ vessel, and so extraordinarily be called by a
voice from heaven, y^ Peter with the rest of y^ Apostles should have the holy
Ghost in the form of slrrie tongues rest upon them, with other rare gifts: we
learn to humble our selves, not to stand too high in our own conceits, to
embrace y^ measure of faith which y^ Lord has given unto us. For every one
has a proper gift, one thus, and another thus. One has five talents, an other
two, another one. The sum is this: Mary, the Apostles, all the Saints and
faithful people of God either already praising God in the triumphant church,
or presently in the flesh and congregation militant, waiting for the bridegroom
to enter into the celestial Jerusalem, are partakers of that one only sacrifice
offered upon the crossr for the salvation of mankind, and have no righteousness
neither merits of their own, but are al equally saved by the righteousness,
merits, and passion of Christ Iefus. This is the doctrine of y^ catholic
church, this has Luther taught, this teach we and none other. This is
christian humility without comparing of graces. But to let pass your slanders,
seeking to discredit al, by the doctrine of one, if ye could have found him to
have erred: I will not speak of that erroneous doctrine where some of your
side hold simple fornication to be no mortal sin: some maynteine the the
stews and curtezans of Rome: some have dispensed with incest, and murder:
some hold of Thomas, some of Scotus, some of Occam, some of Lombard, and other
some, with the saying, Hic non tenetur Magister: your reco^ciling of writers,
your patching of canons, your iumbling of decrees, your iarring of glosses,
with infinite enormities concerning private persons and sole opinions. We need
not over busy our selves to work your discredit by disgracing some particular
writer of your side, seeing y^ there is no lewd opinion among you, but has
infinite favorers: nay we may truly say of you with the Prophet: From Esaias 1.
Prancis. Petrarch.
the sole of the foot to the crow^^ of the head, there is no health. Your
profession is but a (...) or l^^pe of all abomination. Or we may say with
Petrarcha Rome is a temple of error and a school of heresy. One thing here
I may not let pass, which you lastly, and in the tenth place have annexed unto
your collections out of Luther, I mean your story of the Devil. You dealt
favorably with him, you made up the devils mess with the company of Lindan,
Godens, and Claudius, de Sanctes, you bring in Hosius, with salt and spoones,
and bearing the candls, when Luther (as yet say) went drunk to bed. The sum
is this, all you together with Satan have conspired against Luther dis^r^diting
his life, his doctrine, his death. As for his life, ^nce he sincerely embraced
the Gospel, none of you* no not one, shall be able in truth to stain him: his
doctrine is known unto the world, his great tomes, and godly labor is to be
seen, as for his end, he died in his bed, being threescore and three year
old or there about, in the year. Philip. Melancthon. ora. funeb. John. Sleid.

1546. the. 18. of February. His sickness whereof he chiefly complained was
the oppression of humors in the Orifice or opening of the stomach, which of a
long time had troubled him. There were then present in the chamber at his
departure, his three sons: John, Martin, Paul, with Ambrose their
schoolemaister. There was Doctor Jonas, there was also Albert earl of
Mansfield with his wife and diverse others that loved him well. These as they
have done heretofore, so will they be witnesses unto the posterity, and give
evidence also at the day of judgment against all those that discredit his
person and deface his doctrine. After sundry godly meditations he gave up the
Ghost with this prayer: My heavenly father, eternal and merciful God, thou
have made manifest unto me thy dear son, cut Lord Jesus Christ. I have
taught him, I have known him, I love him as my life, my health, and my
redemption* whom the wicked have persecuted, maligned, and with iniutie
afflicted. Draw my soul to thee. I commend my spirit into thy hands, thou
have redeemed me, O GOD of truth. God so loved the world, that he gave his
only son, that all those that believe in him, should have life everlasting.
Such was the godly death of Luther.

As for Ignatius Layola, the founder of your sect, I find that he was given
to novelties and unstableness in religion, carried away (as ^^ Paul says)
with every puff or blast of vain doctrine: I find that he ^^bra^td
superstition and Idolatry, being marked with the Character of the beast in the
Revelation, and licenced to buy and sell traditions, and to traffic in the
kingdom of Antichrist. Touching any good y^ he did, or any souls y^ he
geined, or any sound doctrine that he delivered unto the people of God, I
find no mention. And now unto that, which I have especially determined with my
self, I am to display for the furnishing of your Banner, the doctrine which
your society generally establishes, the which you (as ye say) under the
Banner of obedience do so we abroad. The points being many, the labor great,
and my leisure small, I will not wear^e the Reader with tedions discourses and
autorities of men, but wade in the holy scriptures, so far as mention is made
of the matters called in question, and where the word of God is silent and of
the other side, doctrine is urged: there to give the Reader to understand, that
it is the devise and invention of man, and therefore as easily consuted as
confirmed. I find in your works, as follows.

1. The Jesuits doctrine.
HOly scripture is a lame, maimed, and imperfect doctrine* Again* holy

imb^ace and belee^e nothing, which is no^ written in holy scripture For all that
the christian says belee^eth, and religion honors, is not contained in holy
scripture. Page 126.

1. The Catholics doctrine.
HOly scripture is a perfect, sound, sufficient, and absolute doctrine. The
doctrines and precepts therein cotai^ed, are sure and certain. It contains al
things necessarily to be believed to salvation. The Patriarchs, Priests and
Prophets delivered nothing to the people, but that they were commanded by the
holy Ghost: the Prophets begi^ne with: The word of the Lord, the vision which
God showed, etc. Christ the son of GOD affirmed that he spoke nothing of
himself: Paul glories, that he was (...) Galas. ^.
called to be an apostle: not of men, neither by man* but by Jesus Christ, and
y^ he preched not himself: but christ cruci^ied, and no new doctrine, but y^
which god had promised by the Prophets. Peter says: Prophecy came not in
old time 2. Pet. ^.
by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the holy
Ghost. We followed not deceivable fables, when we opened unto you the power
and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. For all doctrine to be edified, for all
doubts to be resolved, and abuses to be reformed, God would have us to have
recourse to his word. Unto the Pharisees it is said: you err not knowing Matthew.
2^. Esaias. 8.
the scriptures. Will not my people (says the Lord) enquire at their God?
will they not have recourse: to the law and testimony? Abraham would have
the Luke.
rich man's brethren, receive Moses and the Prophets, and hear them. Christ
convinced the devil with scripture, Matthew. 4. (...) 15. Luke. 24.
he defended his Disciples against the Pharisees by scripture. After his
resurrection, he rebuked his incredulous Disciples, opening unto them
throughout the scriptures all that concerned him: In the law, prophets and
psalms. the sufficiency and perfection thereof appears in y^ it is called the
fountain of wisdom, the word of truth, the words E^^le. 1. John. 3. John. 6.
Prou^^^. ^.
of everlasting life, y^ lead into al truth. Solomon says in the person of
God: all the words of my mouth are righteous, there is nothing lewd or froward in
the^, they are al plain to him that will understand and straight to the^ that
would find knowledge.

Again, All the words of God are pure, and he is a shield to those that trust
in him. Saint Paul says: The word Proverb. 30. Hebr. 4.
of GOD is lively and mighty in operation, and sharper then any two edged
sword, and enters through, eue^ unto the dividing a finder of the soul and
the spirit, and of the ioyn^es and the (...), and is ^ dis^^rner of the
thought^ and the inte^tes of the (...). The Author of the (...) of Wisdom,
writes: Thy word, O Lord, heals all things. Now are ye clean (says
Christ) Sapient. 16. John. 15. Psalm. 18. 19.
through the word, which I have spoken unto you. The Prophet David is full of
testimonies, tending to the confutation of the Jesuitical sect. The way of GOD
is vncorrupt* the word of the Lord is tried. The law of the Lord (as the
Septuagintes tran^^ate it) is (...) unblameable, or perfect converting the
^oule: The Testimony of the Lord is sure, and gives wisdom unto the simple.
The statutes of the Lord are right, and rejoice the heart, the commandment of
the Lord is pure, and gives light unto the e^es, by them is thy servant made
circumspect. In Syrach we read, A man of understanding walks faithfully in
the law, and the law is faithful Eccle. 33. Baruch. 4. John. 8.
unto him, O Israel, we are blessed (says Baruch) for the things that are
acceptable unto GOD, are manifest unto us, Jesus said unto the ^ewes, which
believed in him: if ye continue in my word, ye are verily my Disciples, and
shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. S. Paul exhorts
Tymothy to continue in the doctrine delivered him. For in doing this (says
he) 1. Timoth. 4. 2. Tim. 3.
thou shall both ^aue thy self, and them that hear. Again: Thou have known
the holy scriptures of a child, which are able to make thee wise unto
salvation, through the faith, which is in Christ Jesus. For the whole scripture
is given by the inspiration of God, and is profitable to teach, to improve, to
correct, and to instruct in righteousness, that the man of God may be
absolute, being made perfect unto all good works: Search the scriptures
(says Christ) for in them ye think to have eternal life. What John. 5. Romans
^5.
soever things are written before time, are written for our learning, that we
through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. John the
Evangelist closes up y^ whole* where he seaseth to write, saying* Many other
John. 2^.
signs also did Jesus, in the presence of his disciples, which are not writ^e^
in this book: but these things are written, that ye might believe that Jesus
is the Christ, the son of God, and that in believing ye might have life
through his name. As much to say, though other miracles were wrought by Christ,
and not here laid down, yet as much as is thought necessary for ye to
believe, is here written. Whereby we gather the sufficiency of holy scripture
to salvation. And whereas the woman of Samaria confessed the opinion then
generally received, saying: John. 4.
I know well that Messiah shall come, which is called Christ, when he is come,
he will tell us all things* Jesus said unto her: I am he that speak unto
thee. In an other place, to his Disciples, he said: All things that I John.
^5.
have heard of my Father, have I made known unto you.

Again, where he promises his Disciples to send them an other comforter,
which should teach them all things, and should bring all things to their
remembrance, that he had told them, the same (after the Act.
the ascension of Christ) rested upon the Apostles in the form of fire
tongues, and was plentifully shed in the hearts of the faithful, and
continues unto the end, assuring the children of God, that they are his, and
daily opening and lighting unto them y^ la^tern and ca^del of his word. Lastly,
least any should surmisse any fradulent dealing, or imperfection to rest after
the departure of the Apostles. that they speed not their commission in so ample
a manner, as they were enjoined by our Savior, saying: Go, teach all nations.
etc. Teach them to keep all things, that I have commanded you. Their own
protestations shall stand for sufficient evidences. Paul for himself and his
fellow laborers, says: The things which eye 1. Corinthians. 2.
has not seen, neither ear has heard, neither came into man's heart, etc.
GOD has revealed them unto us by his spirit. Again: we have the mind of
Christ. In an other place, taking his leave of the Elders of Ephesus, he
says. Ye know from the first day that I came into Asia* after what manner I
have been Act. 20.
with you at all seasons, and how I kept back nothing that was proffitable: but
have showed you and taught you openly and throughout every house. In a while
after he says: Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am clear
from the blood of all men. For I have kept nothing back, but have showed you all the counsel of GOD. The conclusion is this. Seeing that the holy scriptures of
the old and new testament, which we embrace, are undoubtedly the word of GOD:
seeing the holy men of old have delivered none other to the posterity: seeing
that the sufficiency thereof, and every parcel therein contained* is such, as
the premises declare, to make the man of GOD perfect: seeing that the Messiah
is come, and revealed all things: seeing that the promised comforter is become
our guide, and assures the faithful consciences: seeing the Apostles and
Disciples of Christ have received the sense and meaning of Christ, and
delivered the same simply and fully, as their Euangelies and Epistles do
testify: we are to reject the Jesuitical opinion, received at Rome, and to
confess in the truth of Gods spirit, that the holy scripture is no nose of
ware* no leaden rule, no lame* maimed, neither imperfect doctrine: but a
perfect, sound, sufficient, absolute, and containing all things necessary to
salvation. I need not stand confirming the same with testimonies of fathers,
the scriptures themselves are copious enough in this behalf.

*2 The Jesuits doctrine.
THe want, that is in holy scripture must be supplied by peecing thereunto
traditions. Censur. Colon. This does Andradius the Jesuit defend, allowing of
the former sentence, where he writes: The brethren of the Society of Jesus
(meaning the Censurers of Colen) have defined both godly and wisely, that the
traditions of the church are necessarily to be annexed unto the holy
scripture. O^hod. explic. lib. 2. page 101.

The late council of Trent has most blasphemously made traditions of equal
authority with the scriptures. Their words are these: All the books of the
old and new testament, yea and also the traditions, appertayning as well unto
faith, as manners, as if they had been uttered by Christ, and endited by the
holy Ghost, conserved by continual succession in the catholic Church, this
Synod does receive and honor with like affection of piety and equal
reverence. Sub. Paul. 3. sess. 4. cap. 1. The same also is found in the Censure
of Colen, and in the Catechism of Canisius, allowed in the council of Trent.

2. The Catholics doctrine.
THe holy scriptures are perfect and sufficient of themselves and need not, to
^e p^^ced with traditions. This depends upon that which goes before:
therefore it requires not so large a discourse. There are too ways, to
attain unto the knowledge of GODS word, the one inward by inspiration of the
holy spirit: the other outward, by reading and hearing of the scriptures, the
thir^ place I find not for traditions to^^^d, neither may they be joined as
(...), to draw in the vi^^eyarde Deuteronomy.
of the Church. Israel was charged not ^^ pl^we with an Ox, and an Ass, not
to make their garments of linsie wolsie: the Passo^er was to be eaten with
sweet bread, the leven of the phari^aicall traditions being said Exodus
a^^^^: The Prophet complayneth, that the fountain of the water of life was
le^t, and that the people had d^gged them broken cester^^s: Jeremy would have
the chafe Jeremy. 23. 2. Corinthians. 6.
of men's dreams severed from the wheat of Gods word: S. Paul would not have
the faithful joined with the infidel, righteousness and unrighteousness,
light and darkness, Christ and Belial, the temple of God, and the grove of
Idolles, as much to say in the whole, the word of God may not be linked with
the traditions of man. To this effect are the injunctions of the holy Ghost so
often repeated in holy scripture: Beware of false Prophets, beware Matthew. 7
Matthew. 16. 1. Cor. 7. 1. Timoth. 6.
of the leven (as the Disciples understand it) the doctrine of the Pharisees and
Saduces. Become not the slaves of men. O Tymothy, keep that which is committed
unto thee, and avoid profane and vain bablings, Persistin those things which
thou have learned. For other foundation can no man lay, then that which is
laid, 1. C^r. 3.
which is Jesus Christ. Every plant (says Christ) which my heavenly Father
has not planted shall be rooted up. Mat. 15.
He turns him unto the forfathers of these Jesuits, saying: Why doeye
transgress* the commandment of God by your tradition? H^e applies unto
them the complaint of old, made by the Propet Esaias: In vain they worship
me, teaching for doctrines, men's precepts. John. 10.
The sheep of Christ will follow him, A stranger they will not follow: for
they are commanded the contrary. Ye shall put nothing unto the word* which I
Deuteronomy. 4. and ^* Deuteronomy. 5. Deuteronomy. 12.
command you, neither shall ye take ought there from. Again: Take heed, that
ye do, as the Lord your God has commanded you, turn not aside to the right
hand, nor to the left. Again: ye shall not do after all the things that ye do
here this day (that is) every man what seems him good in his own eyes. Put
nothing (says Prou. 30.
Solomon) unto his words, least he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar. A
man's will or covenant (says Galat. 3.
S. Paul) when it is confirmed, no man does abrogate it or add any thing
thereto. Much less may the will of God be abrogated, or add any thing
thereto. The co^^^ation is terrible in the end of the Revelation, where John
says: I proteste unto every man, that hears the Apoc. 22.
words of the prophecy of this book: if any man shall add unto these
things, GOD shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:
and if any man shall diminish of the words of the book of this prophecy, God
shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city,
and from those things which are written in this book. Who then dares offer
Leuit. 10.
strange fire before the Lord, with Nadab and Abihu, which the Lord has not
commanded? I dare not (says S. Paul) speak of any thing, which Christ has
not commanded? I dare not (says Saint Paul) speak Romans 15. Galat. 1.
of any thing, which Christ has not wrought by me. Ha protests unto the
Galathians, that he preached not the doctrine of man, neither the Gospel of
Jesus Christ, after the manner of man, that is, as it may be gathered by
mingling the same with traditions. To be short, the holy Ghost has commanded
us to lay aside traditions, with the leaven of the Pharisees, God has threatened
plagues to light upon them, that add or diminish his word, the Apostles and
Saints of God durst not presume to do it, the word of God is perfect, and
needs no peeceing, the Author is omnipotent, and his word mighty in
operation, then is the Romish opinion to be rejected, and the truth, as it
appears in the premises in humility of spirit to be embraced.

3. The Jesuits doctrine.
ALl and every the things contained in holy scripture, are so wrapped in
obscurities, that the best learned, can gather thence no certain knowledge:
wherefore, for the preservation of religion, they must altogether, and that in
the whole forbid the laity the reading of Gods word. Censur Colon. That this
is the general opinion of that society, I report me to Andradius the
Jesuit, who says: The Jesuits of Colen does show, that the holy scripture
contains so many and so great difficulties, that it may evidently appear not
to be the wisest way to admit al sorts to the reading thereof. Orthod, expli^.
Lib. 2. page 12. His own judgment is this: Many places of the holy scripture,
written in the vulgar tongue, are no less obscure unto us, then the Hebrew
unto the ignorant, in the same. Page 128. Again: Many having tired themselves
through continual labors in the study of holy scripture, could never
attain unto certain mysteries of the holy Ghost, the which are lively seen
to be painted out in the life of holy men. page 58. His discourse tends to
persuade men, that by the working of miracles, visions, and revelations there
is more good done, then by the reading of the word: where, in mine opinion,
he shakes hands with the Anabaptists: who will be fed from above, by the
spirit (as they say) and not by direction of the written word. Again: least
any do deny the latter part of the former opinion to be Jesuiticall, he
says: The Jesuits of Colen do forbid the unlearned laity, the reading of
holy scripture. I do confess it. page 125. They nouzell up in ignorance this
sort of people, and defend with Cardinal Caietan, that if an ignorant man
be an Heretic, and have learned that opinion of such as he thought to be
catholic, he is not to be charged with heresy: for the faith of the church
does save him. page 149. Caietan. 2a. 2a. quast. 2. artic. 3.

3. The Catholics doctrine.
ALl and every the things contained in holy scripture are so unfolded and
opened by the coming of Jesus christ, that the simplest christian may find
there sure and certain knowledge for the edifying of his soul: and therefore
for the preservation of religion, and enlarging of Gods kingdom, the laity
must not be barred from reading the same if our Gospel be hid (says S.
Paul) 2. Corinthians. 4.
it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the GOD of this world has blinded
the eyes of the infidelles, that the light of the glorious gospel of Christ,
which is the image of GOD, should not shine unto them.

Again, It is the power of God to salvation, to every one Romans 1. 1. Corinthians.
1. 2. Corinthians. 3.
that believes. To them that perish it is foolishnes, but unto us that are
saved it is the power of God. In another place: Seeing then that we have such
trust we use great boldness of speech. And not as Moses which put a veil upon
his face that the children of Israel should not look unto the end of that
which should be abolished. Therefore their minds are hardened, for until this
day remains the same covering untaken away in the reading of the old
Testament, which veil in Christ is put away. But now in Christ Jesus, ye
which once were far off, are Ephe. 2.
made near by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, which has made of
both one, and has broken the stop of the partition wall. S. Danle had to deal
with wauerer^ and scrupulous people and such as depended upon treditions and
the works of the law, and were loath to admit the light burden and cast yoke
of Christ where he* writes. The righteousness which comes by faith Romans 10.
speaks on this wise: say not in thine heart, who shall ascend into heaven
(that is to bring Christ from above) or who shall descend into the deep? (that
is to bring Christ again from the dead) but what says it? the word is near
thee even in thy mouth and in thine heart, this is the word of faith which we
preach. We have (says S. Peter) 2. Pet. 1.
a most sure word of the Prophets, to the which ye do well, that ye take
heed as unto a light that shines in a dark place, Wisdom stands in the
streeses to receive Proverb. Matthew. Psalm. 1. Corinthians. 3. Luke. 11.
all those that will embrace her. Christ would have all them that are laden to

Whosoever commits sin, transgresses also the law, for sin is the

Moses, saying: speak unto the children of Israel, when a man or woman shall
commit any sin, that men commit, and transgress against the Lord, etc. Then
they shall confess their sin. God is wroth with such dealing, Ier^^^^. 6.

Sin took an occasion by the commandment, and wrought in me all manner of
concupiscence. Again: I allow not that which I do, for what I would, that do
I not, but what I hate, that do I. If I do then that which I would not, I

foreskinne of the flesh, but also the filth of sin, and the superfluity
thereof, ouergrowing the heart: the believing in the time of grace, has not
only his body outwardly washed with water, but also his soul inwardly
cleansed, by the power of the holy spirit: Yet the state and condition of the
regenerate after circumcision under the Law, and after Baptism under the
Gospel, is indifferently laid down by the Apostle, where he says: David
declares the blessedness of Psalm. 32. Rom 4.
the man unto whom GOD imputes righteousness without works, saying: blessed
are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered, Blessed is
the man to whom the Lord imputes not sin, If there were no more too be

God alone. What is man, that he should be clean? And he that is borne of a

abominable and filthy, which drinks iniquity, I. John. 1.

THE regenerate in this life cannot by their works attain unto the perfection
of the Law, but are found 1. Cor. 1. Romans 3.

is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.
We know that whatsoever the Law says, it says unto them, Galat. 2. Galat. 3.
that are under the Law, that every mouth be stopped, and all the world be
culpable before God. Therefore by the works of the Law shall no flesh be
justified in his sight. As many as are of the works of the Law, are under
the curse. For it is written: cursed is every one that continues not in all
things, which are written in the book of the Law to do them, and that no man
is justified by the works of the Law before God, It is evident, for the just
shall live by faith. Whosoever ye be that are justified by the Law, ye are
fallen from grace For if Abraham were justified by works, he Abac^k ^.

has wherein to rejoice but not with God. For what says the scripture:
Abraham believed GOD, and it was counted to him for righteousness. Now is it
not written for him only that it was imputed to him for righteousness, but also
for us. The Israelites being ignorant of the righteousness of Romans 10.
GOD, and going about to establishe their own, submitted not them selves to
the righteousness of GOD, for Christ is the end of the Law, for

own, that all we have received. He is the fulfilling of the Law for

9. The Jesuits doctrine.
NOT only in moral affairs, and civil actions, has the will of man much
sorce, but also in matters appertayning unto salvation, so that man can do
nothing unless his will be yelding prompt, and ready to receive the grace of
God. Censur. Colon. Canisius. Catechis. Andrad* Orthodox. explic. lib. 4.

9. The Catholics doctrine.
NOT only in moral affairs, and civil actions tending to good, has the will
of man little force, but also much less in matters appertaining unto
salvation: so that man can do nothing that good is, unless his will be
tempered by the spirit of God, to yield and made prompt, and ready to receive
the grace of God. No man (says John. ^.
Christ) can come unto me, unless the Father which sent me do draw him.
Again, says he unto the Jews: Therefore said I unto you, that none can
come unto me unless it be given him of my Father, Saint Paul says: No
man, speaking by the spirit of GOD 1. Cor^^t. 12.
calls Jesus ex^^rable, Also no man can say, that Jesus is the Lord, but by
the holy Ghost. John the Baptist told the Pharisees that wee^dred at the
d^oinges of Christ: A man can receive nothing except it be given him from

fall stopped, his gifts corrupted and himself together with his posterity
became the slaves of Satan* being brideled with the ^ur^e of sin* So that now

which is within me, Again: Thus I live, yet not I, but Christ*liueth in me.
Not the good which I would, do I, but the evil which I hate, that do I. It is
not in him that wills, nor in him that runs, but in God that shows
mercy. Neither is he that* plant^th anything, neither he that waters, but
God that gives the increase. O generation of Vipers, (says Christ unto Ierem.

Lord, and I shall be whole, save me, and I shall be saved. Turn us again O God

upon comes it to pass also, that the comfortable answer is made: I will

they shall be my people. Again: I will put my law in their Jeremy. 2^. Jeremy.

meet to be pertakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light. Then have
we not free will to that which is good, being by nature the children of wrath,
clogged with the corruption of original sin, and concupiscence: so that we
cannot do (as saint Galat. 5.
Paul says) whatsoever we would.

10. The Jesuits doctrine.
10. The Jesuits hold, that the first motions of concupiscence are without
the gilte of sin. Censur. Colon. When as in very deed the motions of the
said lust, in that we are by nature the children of wrath, do condemn us,
if Gods mercy, and the merits of Christ's passion stood us not in steed.

11. The Jesuits hold, that there are many other more grievous offenses, and
more damnable, then those that repugne the law of GOD, and yet the law
condemns them not, namely traditions, man's laws* and the precepts of the
Church, the which Canisius reckones to be five in number. 1. See thou celebrate
the set feast days of the church. 2. See thou hear reverently upon the holy
days* Mass and Ma^^^ns. 3. See thou observe the fastinges appointed upon
certain days and times. 4. See that thou once a year confess thy sins to
thy ghostly Father. 5. See ^hou receive the sacrament once a year, at the
least, and that about Easter. Censur* Colon. Canis. s^^^^^ ^^^ doctrine. de

reproved by the law, neither be there any so grievous, as those which repugne
the law. For the Church is not to bind the consciences with her laws, but to
preserve and proclaim the precepts and laws of God.

12. The Jesuits say, that faith is a most firm ass^t, or believing not only
of the things opened in holy scripture, but also of those things which without
scripture are delivered by tradition. Censur. Colon. Canisi^de fide and ^imbol.
Cap. 22. And^^d* Orthodox. ^xplic* (...)* Trident. Faith (says the Catholics)
is not only a knowledge, by the which the Christian firmly holds all that
is made manyfeste in Gods word, but also a sure confidence kindled by the
holy Ghost through the Gospel in the heart, by mean whereof he rests in
GOD, persuading himself for certain, that remission of sin, everlasting
righteousness, and eternal life is given not only to others, but also to
himself, and that freely of the great mercy of God, by the merits of Jesus
Christ.

13. The Iesui^es say, The just in that he lives by faith, has not that in
Christ, but of his works. Again, That faith justifies, she has not that
^o^me or efficacy of Christ, whom she apprehends and possesses, but of
our love. Again, Faith does not therefore justice, because she apprehends
Christ, who is our righteousness, but works are so necessary, and stand in
so great a stead, that they give unto faith her life. Cens. Colon. Canisi.
Andradius. The Catholics hold, that they must live by faith, as the holy
Ghost has delivered in writing. And now he lives no more (as Paul writes)
but Christ lives in him, and the life that the just now lives in the flesh,
he lives through the faith of the son of God, who loved him, and gave
himself for him. So that faith has no more her being or life of our love or
works, then the root has moisture ministered unto ^^ by fruit growing upon
the tree.

14. The Jesuits write the proper salvation of some certain private man, is
not to be referred unto faith. For the private justification of men is
uncertain, and much more the eternal salvation of them. How then in these
being uncertain, shall faith assure her self. Faith in particulars is
uncertain, and hope oftentimes is frustrate. Censur. Colon. Canis. Andrad.
Orthodox. explic lib. The counsel of Trent will also have no particular man to
assure himself of his salvation, and holds them accursed, that do so. Sess.
6. cap. 12. and canon* 13* 14, 15. But the Catholics hold that most
comfortable doctrine which Abraham, Moses, Job, David, Paul, and all the elect
people of God, the spirit testifying unto them whose children they are, which
assured themselves of their salvation not hanging with the c^llier^ faith upon
the ^leenelesse c^^te of the Romish Church, neither only generally believing
that some shall be saved, but perticulerly also knowing that the election,
v^cation, justification, and salvation of every particular of the elect of God,
is sure and certain.

15. The Jesuits say, that Justification is none other, then the seeking or
searching of righteousness, and to speak philosophically, a motion unto
righteousness. Censur. Colon* Canis. Andradius. The Catholics hold justification
of a man before God, or christian righteousness to be a remission of sin, and
an imputation of the righteousness of Christ, and a free donation of life
everlasting, not for any worthiness or works of ours, but only for Christ's
sake, and the same apprehended by faith.

16. The Jesuits do hold, that the reconciliation which is called
justification comes to pass by mean of love, which is the gift of the holy
Ghost, shed in the hearts of the faithful. And truly, say they, great is the
force of love, yea, and of such a force, that it makes us the sons of God.
Censur. Colon. Canisius Catechist. The Catholics say, that the elect are not
reconciled unto God, but by the ^^rite^ of Christ's passion. And that love
goes not before reconciliation as the cause: but follows after, as the
effect, ^^^^^fying our justification.

17. The Jesuits affirm, that the justice of God, revealed in the Gospel, is
a power in God, which renders unto every one, according unto their worthiness.
Censur. Colon. Canis. Andrad. The Catholics hold, that the justice of God
showed in the Gospel, is an acceptance of the satisfaction and obedience of
christ, for the sins of al them that believe.

18. The Jesuits teach, that the mercy of GOD in Christ, in the which
consists our salvation, is this: that God promised unto them that do good
works, to wit: such as fulfill the law, life everlasting. Censur. Colon.
Canis. Andrad. Council. Trident: But the Catholics say: that the mercy of God,
wherein consists the salvation of all the elect people, is this: that the
heavenly father promised freely to all them that believe in Christ, and also
gives freely remission of sins, righteousness, and life everlasting, not
because of their obedience toward the law, but only for Christ's sake our
Lord, our Savior and Mediator.

19. The Jesuits hold, that there is a twofolde justification, a first, and a
second. The first justification (say they) is, in that Christ deserved by his
death, that such as believed in him, should be endued and adorned with love and
other virtues. The second (say they) is, in that they, by the merits of
Christ, having received these new ornaments and virtues, man (I say) deserves
a greater, fuller, and more ample righteousness, reconciliation, adoption, and
in the end, everlasting life. Censur. Colon. Andrad. The Catholics hold, that
there is but one way, or manner of obtaining everlasting salvation, to wit:
the fr^e remission of sin, and the imputation of the righteousness of
Christ, apprehended by faith, given us, not because of our works, but for the
merits of Christ.

20. The Jesuits hold, that our works are necessarily required for the first
justification, and merit the amplification of the second. Censur. Colon. Canis.
Andrad. Ortho. explic. The council of Trent lays down, that they are causes
of justification and also do merit, etc And accurseth them that hold the
contrary. Se^s, 6. Canon. 24. 32. The Catholik^ believe that life everlasting
is the gift of God, freely given and promised to them that believe in Christ
our savior. The works of the regenerate are not causes of our salvation, but
witnesses of the grace received by Christ, neither do they merit ought, for
when we have done all that lies in us, we are commanded to confess our
selves to be unprofitable servants.

21. The Jesuits hold, that the works which are before justification are
meritorious and accepted of God. Censur. Colon. Canis. Andrad. Orthodox.
explic. lib. 3. Council. Trident. ^ess. 6. canon. 7. The Catholics affirm,
that the works which are done before regeneration and justification are
sinful: For whatsoever (says S. Paul) is not of faith, is sin. And they
are no more acceptable unto God, then the works of Philosophers, Heathens,
Turks and Infidels, who denying God, are in the state of damnation.

22. The Jesuits hold, that no man is justified by faith only without works.
Censur. Colon. Canis. Andrad. And the counsel of Trent accurseth them, that
hold the contrary. Sess. 6. Can. 9 and Sess. 13. Canon. 11. The Catholics
hold with the words of our Savior in the Gospel, where it is said: Only
believe* and with the opinion of Paul, saying: We suppose that a man is
justified by faith Romans 3. Mark. 5.
without the works of the law, and other places of holy scripture, tending to
the confirmation thereof, that man is justified by faith alone, without works.

23. The Jesuits hold, that there are seven sacraments, to wit: the Lords
supper, baptism, confirmation, penance, extreme ^^^tion, order and
matrimony. All that hold the contrary are often accursed by the counsel of
Trent. Sess. 7. Can. 1. Sess. 7. can. 1. Sess. 14. The catholics do hold,
that there are but only two sacraments, so properly to be called, that is,
baptism and the Lords supper* sufficiently established by Gods word, and that
all the rest do differ far from the proper nature of Sacraments.

34. The Jesuits do hold real presence in the sacrament, they maintain
transubstantiation, they minister the sacrament under one kind, barring the
laity of the cup, they will have the sacrament adored, and the remains laid
up, and reserved, all contrary unto the catholic faith and warrant of Gods
word.

25. The Jesuits do hold, that man can make satisfaction unto God for his
sins, although the offense be infinite, and the satisfaction finite, or
terminable. Censur. Colon. Canis. council. Trident. The catholics do affirm,
that a man although he be regenerate, can make no acceptable satisfaction unto
God, neither present ought before him, to appease the wrath of the father, but
only his son Christ and his merits.

26. The Jesuits hold, that the Saints are to be inuocated, to the end they
may make intercession for us. Again, they think that the Lords prayer may
be said unto them. Again, they confess, although that the holy scripture
teach no where the invocation of Saints, yet say they, notwithstanding it is to
be bel^ued, received, and retained. Censur. Colon. Canis. Andrad. Orthod.
explic.* Council Trident. Sess. 25. The Catholics assirme that there is none to
be called upon in prayer, but God alone, and that it is blasphemy to say: Our
Father which art in heaven, etc. Unto the Saints, and that there is no doctrine
to be received, but that which is contained in the old and new testament.

27. The Jesuits teach that the Saints are so be honored, and served, that
their relics and images are to be woorshipped, as they write, Cultu Latr^ae,
with the honor and woorship due unto God him self, and that the image of
Christ is as much to be honored as the books of the Gospel of Jesus Christ,
they that hold not she sa^^ with them are by the Pop^ accursed. Censur. Colon.
Canisius. Gregor. de Valenti^. de Ido. Andrad. Orthodox. explic* lib. 9. page
705. Council Trident. Sess. 25.

The Catholics teach that God alone is to be honored and served, with (...)
^^^^^ and service, that the woorshipping of relics and images, is idelatrie,
and contrary to the express word of God, for he will not have his people
taught by his wing of pictures, but by the lately pre^ching of the word of
God.
