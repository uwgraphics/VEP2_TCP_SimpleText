An exposicyon of the.xv. psalm made by master Erasmus of Rotherdame in
which is full purely declared the pure and clean behauoure that ought to be in
the pure church of Christ which is the multitude of all true christen people.

you be the light of the world. Let therefore your light so shine before men
that they may see your good works and so glorifye your father which is in
heaven. Mattheu. v. To the christen reader.
IF my gross endeuer could so purely have set forth in Englys^he the
exposicion of this most godly and pure psalm as it is purely written in pure
latyne by master Erasmus / than truly durst I promise the that to read it o
most pure and gentylle reader should be to the a passing pure and profitable
pastyme. It is intytled by the said master Erasmus. De puritate ecclesie /
that is to wit it does declare the pureness which ought to be in all
christen or pure people called the church or congregacyon of god. And I doubt
not (my gross translacy^on natwithstandynge) but who s^ ever shall please to
read it purely the same shall find godlynes in it so purely showed that it
shall synke pleasauntly and purely in to their breasts / and consequently arise
out of the same again in pure and godly behauoure to the honor of god and to
the wealth both of them selves and of other their neighbors abiding about
them. And moreover the pure and pleasant style or form of eloquente speech
which this writer master Erasmus passing all other does generally use in
writing / shall delight the passing any other mynstrelsye. For no harmonye is
so pleasant as eloquence being an undoubted and singular good gift of the
holy ghost / and likewise a gift more vtyle than any other mynstrelsye or
harmonye mundayne. And moreover no mynstrel or musicyan I dare say and can well
prove was ever better expert in any kind of musyke / tha^ was Erasmus in
eloquence. Which as it is declared in all other his noble works / so does it
in this most souerayntly appear joined with most pure prophesye and
declaracyon of scripture that is musyke and harmony celestial. So that if this
our author did ever utter these his passing sweet and melodyous gifts of
eloquence and pure prophesye in any other his works (as undoubtedly he has
done) yet did he never more frelye declare him self and his said virtues or
gifts tha^ in this treatise / and as I wene never so freely. Which work
ought and shall delight the so much the more / that he does show this his
musyke to accord with the most pure expositers of scripture / whom god has
gra^cyouslye now in our time rayse^ up to the expulsyon of filthy an^ gross
errors / that otherwise b^ called of vnpure preachers vn^wrytten verytes / and
to the redu^synge or restorynge of the pure veryte contained in scripture holy
/ which god grant shortly to be known and followed of us all to his pure
honor. Amen.

The text of the psalm.


He which speaks the truth from

In whose sight the ungodly is

He which swears to his neighbor

Who so does these things shall

A Paraprhase of the psalm.
Lord who shall be received in to thy tabernacle? Who shall abide with the in
heaven being as a mountain in which thy holy majesty does appear?

A man walking syncerely without craft or dissimulacion doing th^^ is right
and which speaks th^^ he says faithfully with heart a^^ mind.

Which loves to hurt no man with tongue / which does none euy^ to his
neighbor nor sclau^deret^ him or rayseth no rebuke or ign^^mynye upon him.

Which set naught by the wicke^ or ungodly / but estemeth hyely the which do
love god / which will na^ go from that thing which he hat^ sworn or earnestly
promised.

Which has not with his mone^ occupied vsurye / nouther doth^ take brybe or
mede to the domag^ of an innoce^te / he that loves to do these things shall
never perysshe.

Finis.
Lord who shall dwell in thy tabernacle?
FOr so much as there is one only way unto salvation, and life eternal /
which is to know god, and to obey his comau^deme^tes. The prophet in the
psalm going next before, did bewail and lamente more, than blind madness of
men / among whom were found so few / which joyfully and gladly would
receive or embrace the gentle, and redely offered mercy of our creator and
redemer. But contrary wise, all they for ye more part being corrupt with
their own lusts and concupiscences, were so brought into a perverse mind,
that in their heart they would say: there is no god. And out of this fountain
of wicked persuasyon which they had of god / did spryng all manner of myscheuous
dedes^ done toward our neighbor. Another can any man love his neygh^bour with
heart and mind, which does not love god. Unb^l^f^ is the ro^^ o^ al
^^sche^ou^ ded^s l^ke as ^aithe is the ro^^ o^ cha^^^^.
And no man does love his neighbor verily / except he does love him for
gods sake. From faith, as from the rote do spring the works of charity. Who
soever therefore speaking or talking with him self / does say in heart that
there is no god (for asmoch as he has an heart, full wyc^kedly and noughtely
corrupt / from whe^s does proceed his speech wit^ all other his fautes or
doings)^ the same does breathe nothing upon his neighbor but moos^ Psalm.
xiii
foul stynche / such as does issue out of sepulchers or graves / nothing but
fraud and disceyte, and the venyme of adders / which an other psalm does
call incurable^ Deutero xxxii.
From this corrupt heart does proceed all lewdness of myscheuous words /
all bytternes of detractyon or backebytynge / from which princyples and
begynnynges do men go forth, until they come unto the lust or desire of blood
shedynge / which is the vttermoste point, or buttell of rancoure and hatered /
according to that saying of Iohu^: i. Io. iii.
He that hates his brother, is a murderer or manqueller. For all though he
does not always actual murder / which does hate or bear rancoure / yet
natwithsta^dynge in that, To hate our neighbor is murth^r.
he following his ire or wrath does study to harm his neighbor / he does
in that approach to murder / and in that so farforthe as in him is, he is an
homicyde or murderer. For like as according to the testymony of John^ John^.
iii.
/ no greater joy is unto godly people / than when they do se many men come to
y^ knowledge of the ^^uthe / and to walk in the way of ^he veryte
euangelycall: Even so is no dolor or grefe to the^ more bitter and payneful,
The mos^ bytte^ d^lour of a ^rue christen / is to se his neighbor ^a^ke in
ig^orau^ce.
than when they do consider in the great multitude of me^ so gross ignorance
/ so great contempt of god most benygne and g^acyous / so great lack of
charity to our neighbors / and contrarywyse to se in so few men, any sign or
semblaunce to appear of very faith and true charity. Another do the Epicures
only say in their heart there is no god / but that I can not speak without
grievous syghes and doloure / we may find men innumerable among the
christyane, which in their heart do say, there is no god. And would god there
were no ^hrysten people, which would vomyte or thruste forth such deuelysshe
and wicked sayenges among the christyanes. But for because we should let
pass such monstrous and wonderful wicked words / we will touch things
more usual, and common, or familyare. They which have no love or regard of
spiritual things / but do all coueyte and gape after riches / worldly
honors, excess, or lechery, and such like volu^tes / in seeking to get
these things / outher by right or wrong / by periurye, brybery, and theft /
or such other like feats or crafts: which when they have obtained such
things, do think them selves blessed or happy / and when they do lose them,
be ready to blaspheme both god and his saints. Do not such also show them
selves to say in their heart: Titus. i.
there is no god? In mouth they do profess god / but in deades they do renye
him. Of such is so great a multitude and plentye / and contrary wise of those
which should truly dread god, is so great Psalm. xiii.
scarcyte yt the prophet does bring forth god lokynge out of heaven whether any
creature at all should be in the earth having understanding and requirynge or
seeking after god / and in beholdynge with his eyes from above all mankind /
he found none, except one which is Christ Jesus / with whom be they,
natwithstandynge all jointly recounted and nombred / who soever ^y faith and
charity be made one with him. Ergo they which ^o tru^t in (...) good work^s as
they call th^^ do not plea^se god.
For no creature sith the world was first made, did ever please god / except
the same has put his confydence in the free and mere mercy of god offered
unto all men through Christ. For although diverse have be saved under the law
of nature / and many under the law of Moses / and yet more under the law of
the gospel / yet salvation or sauetie, is not properly due, ne to be ascrybed
unto any law / but al only unto the mercy of god through Christ. the
church of Chr^^^^ was ^u^r s^the the b^gyn^^nge of the world.
From the very beginning of ye world was the church or congregation of
rightwyse men, which is the body of Christ / and even from that time, was
the euangely or gospel / that is to say remissyon of sins reveled of god
from heaven through ye mere and free mercy of god for Christ's sake / and even
from ye time also was grace, which through faith did purefye the hearts of
men / although by Christ incarnate, Acts. xv
and by the prechynge of the apostelles / it was than the more largely spredde
abroad / and did also shine ye more clearly. So that than it appeared full true,
that the apostell Paul does so often inculcate or repete: very ryghtwysenes
does come unto no man by ye law, Rom^. iii.
or by works of the law / but by faith and confydence in Christ But all men
had not faith, by wh^^che they should beclyppe and em^brase the grace offered.
Like as also now a days all though ther^ be f^l many which do profess faith
with their mouth / yet be there rygh^ few which do bear true faith in heart /
the^ be I say right few, if so they be compared with those, which outher be
alyantes from the gospel / or else with a pharisa^call mind do the gospel
admytte and receive. This paucyte and small nombre of true faithful people,
did Esaias see and bewail, Esaias. lii.
Paul alledgynge the place of his said prophecye, which is thus: Roma. x.
O lord who have believed our words? And that which Christ yet abiding in
the earth, did say to his discyples in this wise. Luke. xii.
Fear you not o little flock, for the kingdom of god is your or does
pertayne to you / the same may even now be said of those which have verily
fastened all their confydence in Christ. yet natwithstandynge in the same full
few right christyanes / all things be weak, inchoate or begone and
vnperfytte (I might also say) vnpure. After that, therefore this our prophet
David had bewailed so great a paucyte and small nombre of innocente people /
and that contrarywyse, there is so great a turbe or multitude of vnryghtwyse
and wicked people / And where as he also did se, yt there is no hope of sauetie
but in the tabernacle of god, and in the holy mountain, which is the church
or co^gregacyon / In which no man is granted to abide or rest, except he be
through faith implanted in ye body of Christ / which same, Christ does cry
unto us in the gospel saying: Mat. xi.
Come unto me all ye which do labor and be gre^ued or burdened / and I shall
eas^ and refresshe you. He consyderyng^ the impuryte and fylthynes of men where
as is required synguler and perfyte puryte, if we should be made one with
Christ, and so abide with him in the house of god / the said prophet I tell
you with full great fear and care, does thus cry to the father: O lord who
shall abyd^ in thy tabernacle, or who shall rest^ in thy holy mountain?
Therefore after the plain and most vulgar sense / the tabernacle which
Moy^ses by the commandment of god had made, Erodi. xl
was at Jerusalem in (...) mount Syon / until Solomon by the word of god
did build a iii. of kings. vi.
new in the same place / the passing rich noble and famous temple that was had
in a reverence even of the hethen people and panymes. There also was the regal
palace of David. And as ye jews did boste the^ selves to be the chyldre or
posteryte of Abraham and of David / even so had they a peculyer rejoice and
glory for the city of Jerusalem / by which as by an holy thing they did
swear as we may perceive by the gospel. Matthew. v.
They were proud and holy minded for the temple and the altar which were in
the city / whereof did come that check given to the^ by ye prophet Ieremye:
The temple of the lord / the temple of ye lord / ye temple of the lord. etc.
Jeremy. vii.
There did they believe god to dwell there did they reckon he should be
worshypped and odoured / that there he would be prayed unto / that there he
would be offered unto, and pacefyed with sacrifyces / that there the law ought
to be inquyred and the questyons of the law / there was the propicyatorye,
Erody. xxvi.
H^brues ix.
out of which god did give and show forth dyuyne oracles or answers / ther^
were the tables written upon wit^ the finger of god. There was Aa^rons rod,
and the arc of the testament / the holy table / the pot o^ Manna / the
cherubym There was sanctum sanctorum / that is to say, the holiest of all holy
/ in to which no man might enter, except the hye priest only / and yet
might he not that do, but ones in ye year. Of these things before showed, did
arise pride and presumpcyon in the people of the jews / whereby they also
contempned and dispysed all other nacyons. Finally they had the temple in such
great reverence / that they did obiecte it against Christ, for a crime most
horrible and outragyous that he said: John^. ii.
undo or distroy you this temple / and I in.iii. days shall raise it up again
/ whereby he did covertly signyfye, that he should be s^ayne of the jews / and
within.iii. ^a^^^, he s^ulde reuyue or live again. Therefore after my mind
this psalm after ye lytterall sense / does pe^ulyerly belong to the leuytes
and priests / Whose duetye was to abide and reaste in the temple, to which
they were deputed minys^ers. Of these was required hye and perfyte puryte and
synguler sanctemonye or holiness / but which the common sort of ye jews did
yet think to consyste in exteryor ceremonies. Theiues do reckon holiness to
co^siste i^ ceremonies.
Concerning which holiness, they had holy consecracyon, and often locyons or
wasshynges of the heed / of the handes^ and also of their garments. It was was
not lefull for the priests to be present at a buryall / nor to touch a deed
caryone / nor to eat profane or unhallowed breed / nor to vysyte Mat. xii.
their wives and children / nor to move their foot out of the temple, in
especyall upon those days in which they did minyster in the temple / lest
they should get o^ take some impurite or vnclennes^ But all these things
were nothing else / but shadows and fygures of things far more excellent
and precious. For our true David) to whom promise was made, that his kingdom
should be enlarged even unto ye uttermost costs and marches of the world /
which kingdom should co^tynewe so long as the son or moan / and to whom is
given al power, Psalm. lxxi.
both in heaven and in earth), Matthe. xxviii.
is Christ anointed not with the oil of prestes / but with grace celestyall,
Psalm. ^liiii.
over and above all the children of men. His regal palace is the church or
congregacyon, which the lord him self does otherwhyles call the kingdom of
heaven. His imperye or dominyon, is the lyberte of the spirit. The tabernacles
is the congregacyon of all true beleuynge people in all or every nacyon.
Jerusalem is yt mystycall city, which saint John^ did se in the
reuelacyon.xxi. being build of lively stones / Christ being the heed corner
stone. ii. Peter^ ii.
The holy mountain is ye sublymyte or hyghnes of ye doctrine euangelycall /
and the inviolable veryte, upon which the building of the temple does lean
and is grounded upon. Of which is also thus mencyoned in an other psalm:
Psalm C.xxiiii
he that trusts in the lord / shall as the mount Syon, never be moved /
which abides in Jerusalem. The prophet therefore co^templatynge with
spiritual eyes / the wonderful majesty and sanctymonye or holiness of the
church / which holiness the fygures of the old law before showed with other
like did signefye / by the glory of which church also those thynge^ which
did appear very gloryou^ to the jews, were obscured and dar^kened / and after
the interpretacyo^ of Paul, ii. Corin. iii.
were made without glo^rye. The same prophet also, seyn^ yt there is no
mortal man which ca^ abide pure in the house of god, and offer to god
lacrefyce acceptable ^ he tournynge to the father or heaven does cry thus: O
lord who shall abide in thy tabernacle, or rest in thy holy mountain? The
true knowledge of god is drawn and coarted in to a very strayte or narowe angle
of the world. The other nacyons do worship for god, stocks and stones /
they do sacrefyce unto deuelles / after whose lust and pleasure, they be
drawn as oxen by the nose unto all kind of myschefe. And among the self
same nacyons or people, whom thou haste chosen aparte to the / whom thou
haste excited or called by so many wonders and miracles to the knowelege of thy
majesty / whom thou haste by so mauy benefits provoked to love the / whom
thou haste fensyd with so many precepts and commandments / whom thou haste
instruct by so many prophets / among ye same people is none that
accordynglye does worship the. They have one god in their mouth / but in
their heart have they many gods. Whiles one does serve ire, envy, and
desire of vengeance / another serves auaryce / and some ambicyon and pride.
And they which do appear to the^ selves excellently just or ryghtwyse for
observing the law / do not yet observe that which is the heed of the law.
For who does love ye with all his heart, with all his mind, and with all his
power / and his neighbor as him self? Thus thy law (where as of it self,
it is good) does come evil to pass with them, turnynge them to evil / another
does it pacefye the, but provoke the to anger / another does it see quyte, or
dismysse them found gyltye or fautye / but it does accuse and condemn them.
A great sort of men does worship the after the commandments of men / and
with ceremonies, they do walk in thy temple, they do kylle sacrefyces / they
do offer oblacions. worshyppynge of god after ^n^s commandments and
^^remon^es is near reb^ked and in the gospel such is called ^als worship.
Acts. vii and.xvii. God ^^th not abide in temples or churches made with h^^de
another requires he to be there worshypped more tha^ in other places.
But thou whom all the whole world does not comprehend art not enclosed in
temples, or edifyces made with man's hand / another doste thou regard such
worshyppers, which do worship the with in walls builded by the science of
work men. But for so much as thou art the hye and full parfyte truth or
veryte / thou doste require true worshyppers, which should adoure or worship
the in spirit and veryte. Thy soul or mind does abhor our sabbote days
and holy days of the new moan / and thou doste require no sacrefyce for
John^. iiii
Isaye. i.
sin / another haste thou any need of our good deeds / we do sacrefyce to ye
of thine own. Psalm. xxxix.
But thou doste deteste and defye the sacrefyce of them whose hands be full of
blood. Psalm. xv.
The blood of gotes or of calves, Isay^. i.
can purge no man from sins. Thou art parfyte and doste require things
parfyte. H^brues x.
But the law does bring no man to perfectyon. All the whole nature of man is
utterly infecte and poisoned, even from the very rote through the vice or
sin of our first parents. ii. Corin. v.
I perceive that thou doste loathe and disda^yne Apocal. xxi.
old things / thou doste require all new things / thou doste renew the
temple / thou doste renew the law / thou doste renew the rytes and the
preesthode. But what priest is he so clean and immaculate / so in thy favor
or acceptable, that he can reconsyle the to all men being angrye or
displeased? Who shall abide in this tabernacle, which does come from heaven?
Who shall dwell in thy holy mountain, unto which no man coin^uynate or defiled
may approach? Who shall offer a sacrefyce so effectual, that it can verily
purefye the hearts of men? To this fear and sollicytude of the prophet, does
the lord make this answer: I do renye none of these things which thou haste
told / thou sayste truth, I in very deed do ordain a new temple / I do
require a new sacrefyce / for I was full a good while before of the old. I
will make a new priest not that is of ye earth earthly / but yt shall be from
heaven heavenly / which shall make new every creature / not doing sacrefyce by
course or often times / Hebrews vii.
but which after one sacrefyce made shall remain a priest for ever, Psalm.
C.x.
after ye order of Melchisedech / whom I will descrybe unto the: Christ
described shortly according to scripture.
he shall walk in the earth among men / but he alone shall be without all
spotte. He shall be conversant with sinners / but that he may iustefye them. He
shall work ryghtwysenes, and do justice full parfytely / In such wise, that
he only may say: who among you can accuse or rebuke me for sin? Ioh. viii.
The devil which is an evil speaker, and the prince of this world shall come
unto him / but he shall find no defaute in him. Io. ^iiii.
He shall speak truth in his heart / for he shall be the very truth it self.
Another shall he commytte or do any gyle with his tongue / for he shall speak
nothing, but yt he shall be commanded of me to speak. Another shall he
flatter the wicked / nor yet fode or feed ye godly with veins promyses: but he
shall promise remyssyon of sins by faith given unto him / and he shall truly
give it: he shall promise resurreccyon and life eternal / and he shall
perform it. And so much shall he eschew to do evil unto his neighbor /
that he will bestow his own life even for his enemies / and for them shall he
make intercessyon to me / of whom he shall be slain. John^. iii.
For he shall come not to destroy or cause any to perysshe / but to preserve
and save: He shall come not to judge or condemn / but to reco^cyle and to
make peace betwyxte god and man. Another will he begin to rebuke or sclaunder
his neighbors / which dyenge will cry for his most cruel torm^ntours or
murderers: Luk^. xxiii.
Father forgive them for they wot not what they do / which also shall cast
to the ground the devil that is the accuser of mankind in making him domme
and spechelesse / the obligacyon being anulled and made of none effect / by
which he intended accyon and accusacyon against all men. Coloss. i.
And all though he according to his malice by reason whereof he does envy the
sauetye and salvation of men / in so much that he will fence and set forth
in arms or harnes all his power or armies against my priest / and will so
declare all his gyles and treachery in bendyng his artyllarye against me: yet
shall he no whytte profit or avail / but he shall be broken to peaces and be
brought to naught: Another shall the rage or crueltye of the wicked work any
other thing than that the victory and glory of him shall be y^ more clearly
known and honored / whom they did coueyte with great force but in all vain
to be extinte and utterly abolysshed out of the mind of men. Ieremye xi.
And they by ye same shall purchase none other thing to them selves than
confusyon or shame everlasting and most grievous death or destruccyon. For this
my priest whom I will ordain Hebrews ii.
chief ruler in my new temple and in my kingdom shall by death overcome the
author of death / and by shameful death of the cross he shall have most
honorable tryumphe of the spirytes or deuylles his adversaries. And partakers
of this glory shall he make all the^ which fearing to offend the father
will hear and obey my well-beloved son. Matthew. xvii.
In whom only I shall have so great pleasure and liking that nothing at all
can offend or displease me. He moreover shall be in so great both favor and
auctoryte with me yt I will deny him nothing. In the mean while it is right
and true glory to overcome the world to overcome the flesh and to overcome
the devil. But like as the glory of my son shall in manner be hid or
unknown among men / when he shall be in the shappe or semblau^ce of a poor
and humble or vile servant / yea and of a sinner / when he shall be rebuked
and reuyled accused condemned and put upon a cross: Even so shall the glory
also of the^ which do dread god be hid and utterly unknown among men by
reason of infirmyte of the flesh / or at the least it shall be obscured and
darkened. But when he being now condemned and crucified betwyxte two thieves
shall come again in his majesty with thousands of aungelles innumerable / all
godly people also rysyng together with him unto life / and they which were
partakers with him of tribulacyons shall be also partakers with him of glory:
Tha^ shall ye wicked se whom they have smytten and wounded: They shall than se
them (whom before they have co^culcate and trodden down) with their excellent
bryghtnes to obscure or darken the clerenes of y^ son / where as they them
felues shall lamente and bewail their ow^e madness. These things have I
thought good to touch / for because I do se that of ye old doctors some have
applied all this whole psalm unto the person of Christ / to whom do full
parfytly quadre and agree these words hitherto spoken. But the words
following do not seem to accord so well to his person: Which swears to his
neighbor and does not disceyue him / which has not given forth his money to
vsurye / and has not taken brybes or rewards upon innocents. Another is it
any great praise not to have done those things / which without a great crime
ca^ not be committed or done / Such as these be: to work falsehede by
periurye / to increase worldly substance by vsuryes / to be corrupt with
brybes / to condem^ne or to bear false wytnes against an innocente body. They
which used to do such things were recou^ted evil doers even among the
hethen and myscreantes / and they were punysshed by the laws: ii. questyons
moved.
Agaynew^rde they which did no such things did not receive any public
reward used to be given to such men as had done for the common weal. But
nothing does appertain to Christ but that is of hye perfeccyon / and that
surmounteth all the pr^ceptes of the law. Here aryseth up also an other
qu^^^tyon: wherefore in the discrybyng (...) Christ does he recyte these forsay^
vices more than other which al^ the law does condemn as (...) ensample:
which does not steal E^odi. xix.
which does not kylle or slay / whi^^ does no aduoutrye or fornicacyo^^ But
these doubts do prycke a^^ somewhat trouble us though (...) should apply this
present place (...) unto the person of Christ / but o^ther unto ye minysters
of ye church or else unto every membre of t^^ church. The explicacyon of the
diffyculties does parhappes r^^quyre an hye or excellent wit / that is well
exercysed in holy scrip^tures / I natwithstandynge accor^dynge to my feebleness
will show forth my mind or thought in suc^ wise that no man shall be stoppe^
from saying his deuyse / if he hat^ any better matter to bring forth^
scripture does in diverse fassions ^^structe us to learn virtue and god^ynesse.
Other while it does keep ye ^rdre of nature i^ calling us back ^yrste from
vices / and there after ex^ortyng us to virtues. what order or fassio^s
scripture does use i^ teachinge or exhorti^g.
For to for^ette evil and vices is naturally ^he first and former thing. And
^he second or next to that is to go unto goodness and virtues / like as
naturally first is the thing which is vnparfyte and (as the Apostle does
call it) natural / and there after that is parfyte and spi^ytuall. i. Corin.
xv.
This order does here the ^piryte of god keep when he says: Psalm. xxxiiii.
Avoid or declyne from evil and ^o good / seek peace and pursue thereafter. In
a like wise does Esaye saying: Take ye away the evil of your cogitacyons or
thoughts from my eyes / least you do peruersly / and learn you to do well.
Esaye. i.
Forthwith does he join thereunder the precepts of charity saye^^ socour the
nedy / do judgment (...) the fatherless child / defend t^^ wydowe. etc. In
likewise also i^^parable of the gospel: Matthe. xii.
The hou^^ is first made clean and afterwar^^ commanded to be anourned.
Cle^^n^s that is to say innocencye does come by faith and baptysme / the
orname^tes be good works. Such a like thing is that also spoken by Paul:
Romans ^iii.
let us cast away ye works of darkness / and let us put on the armoure of
light. Also Colossians iii: Now put you of all things wrath. etc. This order
is sometime also turned / that is to wit where as those things be first
commanded which be parfyte / and those things after be forbydde that be
contrary. Of which sort is this saying of Paul: Romans ^iii.
So that we may walk honestly as in the day not in fraunchynge or surfettynges
and in dronkenes / not in chambryng and uncleanness / not in contencyon and
enuyenge. And these fassyons be often times myxte or myngled together as in the
word^s of Christ saying: Bless them which do persecute you / bless and
curse not. Romans xii.
Other whiles good things only be commanded as for ^xample: Thou shalt love
thy lord god with all thine heart. etc. Matth^^ xxii.
And thy ^^yghbour as thy self. The prohibytynge of evil things does rather
agree to hard and obstynate people: the co^maundynge of good things is
agreeable to such as be ob^dyent / and of their own accord inflamed to virtue
and godlynes. How scripture does tempre d^ct^yne according to the (...)
posicyo^s of all me^
In such fassyons does the scripture procure the health of all persons / so
that the parfyte may therein find how they should proceed and go forward:
And the weak or forgetful may there also have how they should be refrayned
and also admonysshed^ The rudenes or dulnes of our nature in receuyng godly
doctry^e
The rudenes and slouthe or dulne^ of man's mind is meruaylous^ And therefore
the law of the.x. commandments which were given unto the gross and
rebellyous o^ obstynate people does contain three only precepts which do
command things honest and virtuous / the other do prohibyte sins and
enormyties: Thou shalt not stele / thou shall not slay or kill / thou shalt
do no fornicacyon. etc. But so often as both these fassyo^s be myngled to
gether it moughte appear a thing superfluous / except that our nature did
require such inculcacyons or repeticyons. For else when the lord had said:
bless you them which do persecute you / what need he to add bless ye, but
curse not / except that he would the more deapely fasten the said lessone in
the minds of his dysciples? Therefore both these fassyo^s of speech be each
one understand in other. In christ's precepts is an affirmatyue always
contained in a negatyue and a negatyue in an af^irmatyue.
As when ye scripture does bydde god to be loved above all things and our
neighbor as our selves / ye same does undoubtedly forbid al things which do
discord with y^ love of god and of our neighbor / and those be things
innumerable. Again when the law does faye: Thou shalt not kylle / it has
well and justly commanded all ye deeds of charity by which we ca^ help our
neighbor. Also wha^ it says: thou shalt not do fornicacyon / it does bydde
all things which do preserve clennes / sobernes / labors / fasting /
prayeng. etc. But things which be hid and unknown does not ye rude or
unlearned people understand. And therefore have the prophets Christ and the
Apostles opened bnto us those things which have be spoken co^pendiously and
covertly. Therefore i^ this psalm is propowned and set forth in a preposterous
order / first ye content and sum of perfyte religyon and godlynes / and tha^
for ye ruder sort be the things expressed by name which be contrary to ye
said description and image. For wha^ he says: he which does entr^ without spotte
and does work ryght^ wysenes / he has in ye same compr^^he^ded al
ryghtfulnes. For he which does enter without spot does committee no vice or sin
/ and agaynewarde he does omytte no virtue a^cordyng to right and his duetye.
According to this intellyge^ce or vn^dersta^dynge it is no faynte or febl^
praise wha^ christ is denied to hau^ done any gyle with his tongue. For s^ do we
know him alone to be suc^ one in whose words yt is to wit Against veretyes
unwritten.
all ye whole canonical scripture / eternal and undoubted truth does
valyau^tly remain without any spo^ or blemysshe of error. Wha^ he is denied to
have done evil unto his neighbor / we do understand that all his life and his
death was ordained and ordered to the health of all men. When he is denied to
have bego^ne any rebuke or ygnomynye against his neighbors / we perceive that
he did make intercessyon unto his father even for ye wicked and open evil
doers. When he is denied to have deceived his neighbor by periurye / we be
admonysshed that what soever thing Christ did ever promise by his prophets
(for by the^ did he speak) the same has he right faithfully performed.
Hebrews i.
He has promised great things / and that be uneaths ^redyble to any man's
capacyte / that is how god should come in ^^esshe / that he by his death
should ^edeme mankind / that he should within three days reuy^e again from
death / that he should ascend in to heaven / that he should come again in
glory to judge ye quyck^ and the deed / and to receive his people raysyd unto
life to blessed im^mortalyte. All these things for the most part has he all
ready acco^^plysshed / and that is remaynyng^ will he perform in like
fidelyte^ When he is reported that he dy^ not lend or give forth his mone^
unto vsurye / we understand tha^ he was full pure from all earthl^
concupiscences / which was frel^ beneficyall to all men sekyng non^ outher
profit imperye or glory^ for so doing: He did freely given he did heal freely
the sick / he dy^ freely redeem us / and he be stowe^ freely him self all whole
/ and all tha^ he had for our sakes: Matthe viii.
he had not (...) this world whereupon to rest h^^ Johan. xviii.
heed / he did profess him and h^^ kingdom not to be of this world / he sought
not his own glory / but the glory of his father. Johan. viii.
So far wide was he from taking rewards against innocents yt he gave him
self to be a ransom to redeem innocents sufferynge death for them that he
should bring them being reconsyled unto life everlasting. These things as
they be surmountynge and passing great / even so did he only perform and
accomplysshe them / and therefore shall he never be moved. H^brues xiii.
For Jesus Christ as says the Apostle yesterday and to day he is all one for
ever. And thus farforth have I said concerning the first questyon which might
bring ye reader in doubt / as if these co^mendacyons or praises were semynge
unmeet and unworthy for Christ. The so^lucyon of the s^conde questyon.
Now is the other questyon to be soluted which is why the prophet does free
and ^elyuer Christ from these only vices / seeing that he was all to^gether
free and quyte from all manner crimes or vices? The prophet appears by these
foresaid points to have properly divided ye person of Christ from all other.
But in the only person of christ were many personages / as the personage of a
king / of a priest / of a prophet / o^ a judge / and of a doctor. In the
only personage of Christ be many pe^sonages co^prehe^ded.

Luke. xi. Christ is a p^rfyte k^ng^.


In a kyn^ which could bind the strong^ one mencyoned of in the gospel ^
entering in to his house violentl^ take away his goods was requy^red a power
more than humayne ^ angelical. And therefore it is sayd^ The malygner in his
presence i^ brought to naught. Christ is ^ passing hy^ priest
In a pree^^ which only should purge and clen^^ the spots of all men was
requy^red a wonderful clennes / which I can not se found in any man. ^^h^s. ii
Psalm. l.
For we be all borne the children of ire and wrath / and according to the
testymonye of David we be conceived in sins. The only son of god did come
without carnal copulacyon in to the womb of a virgyne / and did not by his
entrance in to her defyle but consecrate her pureness or clennes. And such as
was his concepcyon and natiuyte / such was also all his living. And this
notes the prophet say^nge: And he works ryghtewysenes." But there was never
any priest whose concepcyon and natiuyte has be with out all spotte / or whose
life has be by all manner wise incontaminate. Aaron the hye and the first
priest of all did so proceed from his mother / yt he neaded circumsicyon /
E^odi ^xxii. 1. of ^ynges. ii.
another did he a little offe^de god following the furye of the people in making
a goldynge calfe. H^ly did sin by ouermoche cockerynge or tenderynge his
sons. Incredulyte was imputed and laid against zachary ye father of John^
Luke. i.
Baptyste / for which he was punisshed / the usage of his tongue for a while
taken away. But why do I recyte these? The very law does declare no man to be
without sin / Hebrews v.
which therefore does prescrybe a sacrefyce that ye priest ought to offer for his
own sin. I will here let pass to mencyon of the false prophets / For
among the holy and commendable prophets was never any pure from all spotte
or blemysshe. Isay. vi.
For Isaye did need of a quycke cole / which should purefy ^ his lyppes. There
was none of the but that was ignoraunte in som^ethynge / another was the spirit
of prophecye always present with them / and though he were present, yet did he
not put them in remembrance of all things. For a certain prophet does
complain saying: iiii. of kings. iiii.
God has hid from me this word or thing. To all was given the gift of
prophecye according to the proporcyon or measure of their faith: Coloss. ^^
but in only Christ did inhabyte the fulness of the godhede corpo^ally /
another was he admonysshed or taught in a dream or visyon / but he brought with
him from the father the full parfyte knowledge of all things that be paste
present and ^o come. To this pertayneth that is here said: He spoke the truth
in his heart / and wrought no gyle in his tongue. In a judge is required parfyte
knowledge of causes / integryte or parfyte ryghtfulnes / and a mind incorrupt.
Christ is a synguler true justice or judge. John^. v.
The lord does report of him self in ye euangely saying: The father does
judge no man / but has given all judgment to the son / and in ye Creed is
testefyed that he shall come to judge the quycke and the deed. He only does
judge truly and verily Luke. xvi
which does not judge after the ou^^warde show or appare^ce but does innerly se
and behold the hearts / and regards not ye estates of any me^ / knowing no
parcyalyte / but renders unto every man accordyng^ to ye works done in his
body. Romans ii.
ii. Corin. v.
And accordyn to the saying of the gospel they which in ye last iudgemen^
shall go about to win the fauou^ of the judge by allegacyon of old^
familyaryte or acquoyntaunce o^ of works exteryor / to such shall be said:
Luke. xiii
I say unto you truly I know you not. The same thynge^ all be welnye
required i^ a doctou^ or teacher / which be requisyte in a prophet. A
prophet is a doctoure or teacher.

Christ is an ^xcellent doctor.


For a prophet is also a doctor or teacher / like as he which is a king is
also a judge. In a doctor which is a teacher be requisyte wisdom fidelyte
authoryte / and living according to his doctrine or learning. Coloss. ii
In only Christ was all fulness of dyuyne sapyence or wisdom / he was both a
faithful and right prudent distrybuter of mysteryes celestyall / which did
bring forth of his treasurye things both new and old. And as touching
authorite it was never said absolutely of any other than of Christ / whose
words all were spryte and life: The authorite of christ.
hear you him. Therefore ye prophet does recyte those John^. vi.
crimes or defautes chefely / which all ye personages before showed and
contained Matthe^ xvii.
in christ are wont to be subget unto and fautye of. So that all ye whole
world should understand that in conclusyon one man should come which should
parfitly declare him self to be an innocent king / a priest thoroughly and in
all points pure / a prophet in all things just and true / a doctor or
teacher teaching other men nothing / which he hy^ self did not in deeds
perform a iudg^ incorrupt. ^gay^ste vnwryt^en ve^y^ies and tradicyons of men.
So that there is no^thynge yt we ought to seek in thi^ life without or
besides christ. I^ is no need to tell that to all men is known / yt is to
wit how great harm diverse kings do unto me^ by reason of their power and
cruelte / When they polle the people wit^ unrightful exaccyons / when the^ do
break good laws and mak^ evil / wha^ they move unjust war^res / when they
harken to tale bea^rers and promoters or false accu^sers / wha^ they rage and
show rygoure to innocente and harmeless^ people / wha^ for money they do
committee or give offices to men unmeet and unworthy. But let us leave to
speak of discommendable princes and priests of which is a passing great
nombre. With how great and noble testimonies of scripture was Moses anourned
/ against whom natwithstandyng was obiecte the crime of impiete and wyckednes
/ for because N^^^^^. xx.
when the people did thirst after waters he did not glorifye god / and
therefore it was not granted him to enter in to the land of promise / how
soever he be excused for killing the Egypcyan. Exodi. ii.
Another was it any small blotte in Aaron that he followed the mind of the
people requyryng ydolles or false gods to be made them. Exodi. xxxii.
Did not David of whom remains this noble testimonye of gods word (I ii.
of ^ynges. ^iii.
have found a man occordynge to mine own appetite and heart) join a
detestable crime with his cruelnes that is to say, adulterye with murder? i.
of Pa^^lippo. xxvii.
He was called a man of blood or blody man / and recounted unworthy to build a
temple to the lord. iii. of kings. ii^^.
Solomon received an excellent testimonye of scripture / but with how many
crimes and outragyous deeds did he ob^uscate and dymine that glory. Two right
famous and sovereign men have I noted and showed unto you / the other do I not
mencyon of less I should be over prolixe and tedyous. But he which is our
David and very right king of Syon where as he had a kingdom sempiternall and
incorruptible / yet natwithsta^ding according to the prophecye of zacharye
zacharye ix.
he came not against us but for us / not with violence and tyranny but with
ryghtwysenes / another being an oppressor of ye people but a savior / another
came he dredefully by reason of fearcenes or statelynes / but myldely and
quietly sitting upon an ass. Now all though other should be brought forth
being never so much laudable and commendable / and anourned with the testymonyes
of ryghtwysnes / yet they all being compared to Christ be sinners. Psalm. l.
Every man is conceived in iniquyte (of ye virgyn Mary do I give no sentence)
every yet was she saved by christ and his death Luke. ^.
one is borne the child of ire and wrath / every one does bear about
concupiscence being fast roted in y^ nature of man / all though none other
spotte should co^tamynate our life. But of these will I make no long rehersall
/ seeing it sufficyent yt I have now showed you ye vices before named / unto ye
which many of those personages among y^ jews were subget and fautye of /
which personages al we do find in christ hyly reverent and worshipful. This is
here to be noted yt the argument of this psalm does not differ from y^
argument or matter of y^ psalm going before. For wha^ he there had recyted how
mankind was on every Romans iii.
side corrupt / and how that god Gala. iii.
had concluded and compassed all things under sin to then^tent that he
should take mercy vp^on all: He there also consyderyng^ that another the law
was sufficye^^ to pacefye so great wrath of go^^ conceived against us (which
law^ did rather provoke the wrath o^ Romans iii. and.iiii.
god against us than pacefye o^ aswage it) nor that any sacrefyce^ prescrybed
of Moses were to thi^ sufficyent: But that we had nead^ of a new king godly
myghtye^ strong which should do away the tyranny of Satan / and that w^^ had
neade of a new priest which should be void of all spots tha^ so he should
offer a sacrefyce farr^ more effectual than was the blod^ of beasts / and yet
he could fynd^ no such priest among all man^kynde / he being converted to
go^ does thus make exclamacyon: wh^ shall give salvation or health to Is^rael of
or from Syon? And he hea^reth answer again: when ye lord shall turn away
the captiuyte of ^is people / Jacob shall rejoice and ^sraell shall be glad. In
ye mount of Syon as we have showed before was both the tabernacle and the
^ynges palace. In which both is signyfyed the church which is also called the
kingdom of heaven / and in to which who so^uer be admyt^ed or chosen they be
called by the i. Peter. ii.
^estymonye of saint Peter an holy ^acyon and a royal prees^hode. But what a
captiuyte was that which did not suffer the Israelytes to be ^lad and rejoice?
For at that time ^he people of Israel which were Hebrews were captyue or i^
seruitu^^ to no manner of men. Gala. iii. and.iiii.
But it was a sore captiuyte to be under ye ma^ediccyon of the law which was
^n hard scole master to the people wantyng the spryte. ii. Corin. iii.
For where ^oeuer the spryte is not / there also is no liberty or franchyse.
And where as the terrore of the law^ does manace vengeance ther^ is no pure
gladness of heart. For because therefore there was no hope of salvation in men
the father did send his only begotten sonn^ being more mighty than the
de^uyll being a tyrante / which shuld^ auerte and put away the captiuyt^ of
his people delyuerynge or making us fre by grace from ye malediccyon of the
law. He sent hy^ being a priest full of efficacy^^ H^brues v.
which making intercessyon for his elect should be graciously her^ for love of
his reverence and godlynes. And thus in conclusyon dy^ Jacob rejoice and
Israel wa^ glad and joyful. Jacob and Israe^^ be the names of one man / all
be (...) that here according to the custom^ of scripture they be used for ye
pe^^ple of Israel. Furthermore bot^e the words do signyfye a wrestler / for
Jacob to the Hebrews is a supplanter / and Israel a strong man toward god.
Jacob truly (as is contained in the holy historye) did wrestle with Esau in
his mothers belly. Genes. xxv.
The same did also wrestle with the angel / for the which wrastlynge he
obtained the name Genes. xxxii.
of Israel. For I says he will not let the depart except thou shalt bless
me. His brother being supplanted / he did obtain his fathers blessing: He
inforsynge the angel did purchase the blessing of god. Another ought it to be
thought any inconuenyence if a man be said to wrestle with god / seeing we do
hear our sauyoure him self saying in ye gospel that Matthe. xi.
the kingdom of heaven does suffer violence / and that men violently coming
to it do pulle it to them. The Samaritans and gentles or infydeles did russhe
in to it before their time / and as a man would say^ the dor^s broken up.
Matthew. x.
For first was the lord sent unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. But
wha^ vyolence is that by which ye kingdom of heaven is with violence overcome?
The ki^gdome of god how it is got^n with violence.
It is fayth^ a thing mighty and importune / which in a manner does wreste
out from god that no merytes do purchase or obtain. ^atthe. xv.
Does not the woman of Cananye i^ a manner appear to wrestle with the lord Jesus
/ provoking him with importune cry to hear to hear her / when he pretended
that he would not. Of the ^oma^ of Canante wras^eling with christ.
Again when she was driven from him being called by the rebukefull name of a
dog / yet did she stylle crave for cromes naming her self a whelpe. Does not
she than appear to say with Jacob: I will not let ye deperte except thou shall
bless me? Forthwith there after wha^ ye lord says: O woman great is thy
faith be it unto ye as thou will have it / both it not appear to be the word
or voice of a man overcome in wrastlyng? Will ye tha^ hear how puyssant
pugnant and victoryous a thing faith is? The puy^sance and virtue of faith.
Only says he believe for all things are possible to him yt believes. Mark.
ix.
But for to return from this digressyon to a short conclusion. Like as in ye
psalm before ye prophet does demand after the salvation of mankind saying
who shall arise to help and remedy ye world being so desperate: In like fassyon
does he hear cry saying: O lord who shall abide i^ thy tabernacle / or who
shall reaste in thy holy mountain? In yt he names a tabernacle he requires an
hye priest / and when he names a holy mountain he desires a king of more
puissau^ce tha^ is ye puissau^ce of Satan / and he hears answer made to him
of the sprite: he which enters without spotte and does work ryghtwysenes.
By the which testimonye or praise is signyfyed the person of Christ which
only with out all excepcyon was pure and clean from all blemys^he or spotte.
Whose doctrine does sauer of no vylenes or baseness / but as it did come from
heaven even so does it utter and speak heavenly things. Mount Syon whereof it is
so denominate.
Mount Syon has his denominacyon or name of speculacyon or beholdynge / In
which who souer does reaste he being hyer than all things terrestryall or
earthly does behold and desire no things but celestyall. And he did not only
work ryghtwysenes which in all points did accomplisshe the works of his
father / but he also wrought ryghtwysenes for us and to us. For unto i. Corin. i
us says ye Apostle was he made ryghtwysenes which another had any of our own
/ another could have any / in likewise as we can now also have none of our
own or propre. Thus hitherto have I applied this psalm unto the person of
Christ. Another do they amysse which do interpret this psalm of the life
heavenly. For in heaven also is both a temple and a tabernacle / in which
without inintercessyon or cessynge is offered the sacrefyce of praise and of
thanks gyuyng / like as is said in an other psalm: Blessed be they which do
dwell in thy house O lord / Psalm. lxxxiii.
in world without end shall they praise the. The gospel also does make
mencyon of tabernacles aduertysyng us that we should hear purchase us fryndes
with ye Ma^mon Luke. xvi
of iniquyte which should receive us being destytute and succourles in to
everlasting tabernacles. There therefore is ye templ^ of god thoroughly pure and
wholly / there is y^ mount Syon in which the veyle taken away we shall se the
glory of god presently / there is the holy city of Jerusalem for there is
finally parfyte and true reaste. But in to this temple and in to this palace is
none entrance or ingate by ceremonies or the Po^pes Against ceremonies and the
popes bulls.

Matthe. xxv.


bulls / but by a mind purefyed by faith / having no evil conscience / and
by the deeds of charity which done unto our neighbor / Christ wylleth them to
be imputed done to him. Natwithsta^dyng we at this time had leauer to entreat
upon and to declare the moralle The moral sense.
sense / which all though it does appear ye more base or low / yet in my
judgment is it for us most profitable. And thus the prophet considering the
great majesty of the house of god / and the great purite of his church or
co^gregacyo^ / which ye lord him self did wasshe with his blood to exhibyte and
make it to him self a spouse having another spotte ne wryncle: Ephesians. v.
And again ward he considering how great the impuryte of man is / does say:
O lord who shall abide in thy tabernacle / or who shall reaste in thy holy
mountain? All though this place does peculyerly and properly belong unto
them which be prelates in the church of god which be appointed to minystre
the word of god to the people / and to shine or show light unto them in
puryte of living / all they natwithstandynge which by faith and baptism be
admytted i^to ye mistical body of christ do dwell in this tabernacle / and do
in a manner offer up the^ selfs a sacrefyce living acceptable and pleasynge god
/ and they reygnyng with Christ do Romans xii.
ouerc^me ye devil / as by co^tempte of things vile and corruptyble they
find reaste in hope of things heavenly and celestyall. This thing in the
mean way is to b^ observed and noted (all though i^ does appear of small
importance^ that this word Enter in / i^ not hear used as the contrary t^
going out. Which word hau^ yet deceived some interpretyng that we be made
immaculate by (...) very entering / and that by bap^tysme we do enter into the
church Another is it written Eselthei bu^ Porefetai which is to say going
passing or walki^g like as it is d^^clared i^ an other passage: Psalm. C.xviii.
Blessy^ are they which be immaculate i^ the way / which do walk in the
law of the lord. Erodi. xiiii.
For after that w^ did forsake Egypt / and did leau^ or put of all our spots
in ye redd^ see / this is remaynyng that we d^ from henseforth walk pure and
immaculate until we do come unto that blessed land / which god has promised
to men persevering in the love of him. To stand in the way of the lord is
to go backewarde. To stand in the way of the lord is to go backewarde / and
yet is there aco^me^dable sta^dyng.

Philip. ii


Paul did walk whi^he forgetting those things yt were left behind him did
stretche him self to those things which were before him. Natwithstandynge
some standing is yet commendable. For so writes Paul saying: Stand ye in
the faith in which ye be called that is persevere you / not so that you should
not go forward to things more parfyte / but that ye do not fall backewarde to
worse things. There is also a ronnynge in the way of virtue and godlynes as
is showed in ye psalms: Psalm. C.xviii.
I have run the way of thy commandments when thou dyddest dilate or
comfort mine heart. And in the cantycles or balades o^ Solomon: canticles first.
we shall ro^ne in ye odr^ or sweet sauoure of thy oyntemen^tes. And you Apostle
says: i. Corintheos. i^.
So ro^n^ that ye may obtain. He walks ^ goes forward. He stands which
perseuereth in goodness being i^ readynes against the assautes o^ sculkewatch
of the devil. He dot^ run which with great lust and cou^rage / and with
strong feruentness^ of the spryte is rauisshed to do the works of faith and
godlynes. An^ like degrees be in the way of the wicked. He is judged blessed
whi^che does not walk in the way o^ the wicked and ungodly. Psalm. i.
This i^ the first degree to wyckednes an^ impiete: And does not stand or
co^^syste in the way of sinners / this i^ the second degree of men
perseue^ryng in evil: Another does sytte i^ in the chair or seat of
pestylence^ And this is ye third degree of men which do glory in all evil
things and vngracyousnes. The way of the wicked has also a propre ronnynge:
Isay. lix.
The feate says he of them does run unto myschefe. Now is there a certain
vain and turnesycke walkyng / of which the scripture does mencyon saying:
Psalm. xi.
The wicked do walk in a circuyte or ambage. For when they be carried about
with desires and concupiscence of vain and transitory things / so that the
more they get or purchase ye more they desire and lust for / and wha^ they
be carried from one lust or desire to an other / as from the y^ love of riches
to ambicyon and to ye desire of honors / or to worldly pleasures never
fyndyng y^ can satisfye or content their my^de / do they not seem or appear to
be rolled or turned up set down in a circuyte or cyrcle? Therefore who soever
will walk pure and immaculate he must walk within the tabernacle. For
without the church b^ even those things maculate and foul which do appear
bryght^ and clear. Both Heretykes and Scysmatykes do fast / say psalms /
give alms / live chaste / preach the word of god / and exerc^^se such other
deeds which hau^ the show or semblaunce of ver^tue and godlynes. But all
these things for so much as they b^ done without the tabernacle / the^ be
nothing else than spots an^ blottes. And they which do sek^ very true reaste
ought not to de^parte from the holy mountain o^ god in which is builded the
chur^che. The prophet has in this on^ lyttelll verse as is said before
co^^prehe^ded universally all vertues^ He which enters without spott^ and
does work ryghtwysenes. The first point is to want al crimes ^ and the
second to anourne thy life with good works. The first is wrought by faith in
ye lord Iesn / the other is caused by charity which is the co^panyon of pure
faith. Matthew. xii.
Another is it surely according to the parable of the gospel to leave the
house swepte and made clean / void or emptye / but it must be anourned and
garnysshed with diverse stuff and apparayle of good works / least ye end be
worse tha^ the beginning. There be some which have meruaylously extolled the
virtue of faith / another be they i^ this deceived / they do judge faith to be
of full hye value and power / but holy scripture do not without a cause
commend unto us full greatly in diverse and many places good works. Scripture
does call all sin spots. Now do all spottyng remain in ye heart / and out
of such spottynge in the heart as out of the rote do works spring and arise:
There is the fountain of al our works and deeds / the vein whereof if it be
sincere / i^ spryngeth forth first in to ye tongue ^ and so thereafter in to
works. Such^ a vein had he which said: Psalm. xliiii.
My tongue has bolked out a good work. But if this vein be i^fect^ it
bubbleth or boyleth out first i^ to speech and words / and so fort^ in to
works pestiferous. And the murren or spots of the heart d^ russhe out in
none other wise / tha^^ the very pockes do flower and bu^^gene out in to the
skin of them ^ which have the inner parts o^ their body infecte with evil
and noisome humors. As for example heresye is a foul spotte / and s^ is
diffidencye a foul blotte / to hat^ our neighbor is a foul thynge^ and the
love of money or of volup^e^ is fylthy. Such spots whyle^ they lay hid in
the heart they do defyle him only which has them without infectynge of other
/ but they can not abide long hid. For when the preuye evil shall be fast
roted it will breath out pestylente speech / and break forth in to
abhomynable deeds. There is also a spotte which we all have taken of y^
poysone of old Adam. Finally concupiscence which we feale innerly fastened
and impla^ted in our flesh may ryght^ully be called a spotte. Euyden^ signs
of co^cupyscence showed even i^ infantes.
Of which concupiscence we do se even in some babes and infantes an euydent
prynte or simylytude as the prynte of Envy / of Wrath / and of vengeablenes.
Which affeccyons when they can not express in words yet do they show them
in whynynge / weapynge / and channyyng / or chatterynge / and in their froward
cou^tynau^ce. So that saint Augustyne was not without a caus^ brought i^ to
doubtfulnes whethe^ that age of infancye was coinquynate not only with y^
sin called oryginall / but also with the synn^ which is called personal or
actuall^ Seeing than it is thus some may thus make obieccyon how may it "agree
to us, To enter without spot^ seeing that John^ the Euangelys^ speaking of
such as be regenerat^ in Christ does plainly testefye: How christen men be
^potted and also with out spots.

1 John^. i.


I^ we shall say that we have no synn^ we do deceive our selves and the truth
of god is not in us. Saynt^ Paul also does cry out sayenge^ Romans vii.
O wretched man that I am wh^^ shall deliver me from this body o^ death? If
sin be in us how sha^^ we be called immaculate or with out spotte? Even
they which (...) ryghtewyse have spots / for e^^ should they not cry unto
the f^^ther: Matthe. vi.
Forgive us our trespasse^ like as we forgive them which have trespassyd
against us. Who is he which does not often times and commonly offend god?
Or who is he which at some time does not vex and grieve his neighbor? But
such spots which be in such men does the flesh that is so white as
snow of the immaculate lamb Jesus Christ cover. Romans viii.
For there is no dampnacyon to those persons which be in Jesus Christ. Romans
xiii.
Not in chamberynges (says the Aoostle) and in Lecherye or uncleanness / not in
surfettynges and dronkenes / And thus do you hear of spots / but put ye on
the lord Jesus Chryste^ in which you may parceyue a coue^ for the spots of
mankind. O^ our selves we be all spottye / but in Christ we be immaculate and
without spotte / if so we abide in him.

And the psalmyst does report the^ Psalm. xxxi.
to be blessed whose sins be covered / and to whom the lord has not imputed
or laid syn^e to their charge. And now do I speak of ye sins which by the
infyrmyte of men can not be avoided. For Lecherye or uncleanness dronkenes and
surfettynge or glotony with such like crimynal sins or outrages be ones
covered in Baptysme / bu^ thereafter do not they agree with y^ flesh of the
lamb immaculate. Who soever has committed a deed^ly sin / he has cast
away the white garment or crysome which he did take in Baptysme / and has put
on the black vesture or garment of the devil / Natwithstandynge yt they in
which does dwel^ the virtue and power of faith d^ lightly return to their
old in^nocencye not by Baptysme but b^ repentance. And except they d^ repent
all though they do appear to abide in the tabernacle by professyng of the
catholyke faith and co^munyon of the sacraments / yet in very deed they do not
abide or dwell in ye tabernacle of the lord. The ryghtewyse man therefore
which does abide or dwell in the tabernacle of god and does reaste in his holy
mountain / after that he has forsaken Egypt he does not cease / but the
fire or light of god shynynge before him he does always walk being immaculate
unto perfeccyon until yt he shall attain and come unto that stable and
immovable bliss and felicyte / which is signyfyed by the figure of the land
of beheste. It partayneth to innoce^cye to hurt no man. And charity will be
ready to profit or help all men. And therefore it follows: And does work
ryghtwysenes." what ryghtwysenes does signefye in scripture.
Ryghtwysenes in the scripture is comenly thus used and taken / not yt it
should be one part of the moral or cardynall virtues distyncte from prudence
fortytude and temperance / but that it should be taken for all manner of good
doing: Ezechiel. xviii.
I shall says he not remember al his ryghtwysenes. And in Esaias: Isay. lviii.
And ryghtwysenes shall go before thy face / where as a little before he had
reckened up the deeds of charity toward our neighbor sayynge: Break unto
the hongry thy bredde. etc. All the life of Christ what other thing was it
than bountefulnes and good doing always open and ready to help all men. So
that it becomes him which has put on Christ to follow so farforth as he
may so well the parfyte bountefulnes or good doing of Christ as his perfyte
innocencye / like as teaches saint John^ saying: i. John^. ii
he which says that he abides in Christ ought to walk / like as Christ
walked. Thus has the prophet in one verse comprehended the sum of all
godlynes and virtue / now does he dyscende unto the kinds of virtues and to
the special names of vices saying: which does speak truth in his heart /
which has wroughte no gyle or deceyte with his tongue. The most part both
of good and also of evil works is wroughte with the tongue. In the very mind
is also a tongue with which the mind does speak to it self and to god. From
the heart does proceed life and death. It skylleth therefore very much what
things every man does speak with him self in his heart. Nouther can he
speak true things to his neighbor / which does lie or speak falsely unto
him self in his own heart / True things I say not only which be contrary
to falseheed / but which be spoken symplye / sincerely / and with heart and
mind. The Pharisees wha^ they said unto Christ: Matthe. x^.i.
M^yster we wot that thou teache^t y^ w^ye of god truly and thou regardest no
man's estate. In this they said no false things yet did they not speak true
things / for somoche as they spoke with a gyleful and disceytefull mind. And
Dauus in a profane or secular comedye doth^ work disceyte in speaking true
things / which is a kind of lyynge most ungracious or myscheuous. Truth
disceytefullye or untruly spoken is a kind of lyynge most pernicyous. How man
begyleth him self with lies which he speaks to him self.
In this wise do many speak unto them selves in their heart law ghynge or
smiling at their own vices / their conscience yet repynynge. But death
approchyng does vrter and bewray their falsehede or lyenge. For than are they
vexed and tormented and be feign to confess that they before have not spoken
truly in their heart / but yt they have with flatery or fair words disceyued
them selves. Thus does it usually come to pass to such as by pardones have
purchasyd Against pardons
remyssyon of all their sins / or to such as by defraudynge o^ good men by
theft and by brybery will seek y^ iustefyenge as they call it of things
gotten. But he which without fraud or dissymulacyon does speak the truth in
his heart / such one even when y^ parell of death does pynche him obtayneth
still his former and old hope or confydence. The folysshe man which has used
to say in his heart there is no god has pernicyously spoken lies unto him
self. Psalm xiii.
Also heretykes which do persuade unto them selves false doctrynes / and upon
the same do promise to them selves tra^quillyte of mind / such do speak to
them selves falseheed and lies. To be short all they which do beheste to them
selves any felycyte in this life / the same do not speak the truth in their
heart. The rich man mencyoned of in the gospel did deceive and lie to him
self saying: Luke. xii.
Soul thou haste much goods enjoy thou them many years long / where as
yet he was inforsyd in the same night to give up the ghost and to depart or
dye: Who soever does think or rightfully judge of ye artycles of ye faith does
speak the truth in his heart: Against ^re will.
Who soever does knowledge that by his own power he can do nothing / but that
all his help and supportacyon is of the free mercy of god: Who soever does
confess or acknowledge his sin and with a sincere mind does desire the
mer^y^ of the lord / the some does speak the truth^ in his heart: Who soever
does speak false things in his heart does deceive him self / but who
so^uer does bear or work disceyte or gyle in his tongue / he does dysceyue
his neighbor. Agaynewarde he which speaks the truth in his heart does
profit him self: And he which has his tongue void of all gyle does ede^ye
his neighbor / So that the one follows upon the other. For how shall he
which lies to him self in his heart speak true things to his neighbor?
And like as by this half verse: He which does speak the truth in his heart
is excluded all errore all perverse oppynyons / all evil yea and also idle
thoughts or cogitacyons All ydlenes is falsehede and vanyte.
(for all thyng^ is false and vain what soever is idle) and agaynewarde as by
the same half^ verse be understand all godly opinyons / all affeccyo^s pure
and incorrupt / Even so by ye other half verse, Which has not wrought^ gyle
or deceyte in his tongue, is excluded every word which hurts our neighbor.
All thing is disceyte or gyle which does hurt the soul. By the same particle
is also excluded as I have showed every vain or idle word. For every thing
which profyteth not does hurt. Matth^. v.
The lord commands that our co^munycacyon should be yea yea and nay nay /
that is to say we should afferme nothing but that is true / nor deny any
thing but that is false. ^olo. iiii
And Paul does bydde that our speech should always be well favored and
poudred ^ith salt. ^ol^. iii.
The same also byddeth that we should deceive no man with lyenge / but that we
should speak y^ ^ruthe among our selves and to all men. If it pertayneth to
Christen pureness not to disceyue y^ infydels or myscreantes with disceytefull
words / Is it not than a shame to us Christen people to se so few among us
which with heart do speak truly to our neighbor? Is not all the occupyenge
of the people abroad commonly full of fraud / disceyte / and lyenge? How many
be there which for love of a little lucre will not blind and begyle his
neighbor? Another has done evil to his neighbor. Passing much myschefe is
wrought with the tongue / and from the speech of the tongue we do come to evil
deeds / of which the tongue is the entyser and procurer. Natwithstandyng it is
somewhat to abide with in d^ceyuablenes w^ought by t^^ tongue and not to pass
it. Thou has^ sclaundered thy neighbor an^ wounded him with thy tongue / add
thou not there unto evil doing which is wrought with thy hand (...) or with
other thy members. It shul^ seem but a werisshe or f^ynte praise / yt he has
not done evil vnt^ his neighbor / but as I hau^ showed tofore one contrary
is t^ be understand by an other. One contrary understand by an other.
So ^ the ryghtwyse man which is repo^^ted to have done evil to his neighbor
is understand he which has helped his neighbor with all manner of gentylues
and honest deeds. In omyttynge to help our neighbor we do hurt him.
For he has hurt his neigh^bour and done to him euyll^ / who so ever has
not helped him and done him good when need was / and that he so might. Like as
gyle or disceyte is also wrought with the tongue / so often as charity does
require good doing / and the same does not her office in well doing. As for
example thou hear thy neighbor to be sclaundered and thou ^oste hold thy
peace or doste not speak / thou have in yt committed gyle with thy tongue. By
silence keeping we do often speak deceyte against our neyghbo^^.
Thou see thy frynde in errore and doste not warn him thereof / disceyte is
so committed with thy tongue / and by silence or not speaking thou speak
fraud and disceyte. In like wise thou doste se thy neighbor to be hurt and
injured / and thou (where as thou may) doste not help him / thou so doste
to thy neighbor wrong and iniurye. Also thou doste se thy neighbor to be
payned with need and penurye / and thou doste not socour him wha^ you haste
wherewith to do it / in so leauyng hy^ vnsocoured you have spoiled and robbed
him. It is theft and robbery yt thou doste in leaving thy duty undone. Behold
now whether y^ parcel following does agree to this sense or no?

And he has not enterprised an^ sclau^der against his neyghbours^ Thon doste
appear to thy self in^nocente and harmless in that (wha^ other do bring up
a rebuke o^ sclaunder upon your neighbor thou art still and doste keep
sy^lence. In how many ways a man does sclaunder his neighbor.
But a ryghtwyse man is na^ only ware least he should sclaun^der or rebuke an
other man / but h^ also will not suffer or wynke at it^ if an other man shall
sclaunder a^ innocente. He that holding hi^ peace will wynke to se or hear
hi^ brother infamed / the same doth^ cause and work the infamye. H^ is not
only infamed or sclaundre^ which is reuyled and ignomyny^ouslye spoken upon /
but also wh^^soeuer is moved or provoked to d^ sin. They sclaunder men which
do en^^se them to sin.
They which do move a man to dronkennes / do go about to d^ great reproach and
villanye to their frynde / and he which does not mysproue or blame the
entyser or mouer (when it is oportunyte) in reuokynge or withdrawynge the man
entysed or moved has enterprysed to sclau^der his neighbor. He which does
tempte a maid to Lechery or uncleanness / does cause great ignomynye and
sclaunder. And he which in such a case does not tell the man temptynge of his
defaute / and does not help y^ maid being in parell or ready to fall with good
counsel / the same does begin to sclaunder his neighbor making him self
pertaker of an other man's crime or trespass. Some man will yet peradventure
think that forsomoche as ye world is full of men temptynge and provoking to
vices / if a ryghtwyse or just man should assaye to reprehende or admonysshe
them all / he else could do nothing / and yet should he get to him self
mortal hate and displeasure. But I answer that the qualyte of some person
does excuse our silence. when we shall be excused though we do not repr^he^de
sin in wordes^
The son of a man being young does not sin if he does not rebuke his
father or mother / or if a child should keep him sylente before his elder / or
if a subgette and man of low degree does not mysproue or reprehende a prince.
The place also does other while excuse our silence. As no man does reprehende
the preacher in churches: and to reprehende one before many should rather chafe
the mysdoer than correct or amend him / In especyall if in the same nombre be
such persons present / before whom it is not expedyente that the authoryte
of the man trespassynge be hyndered or dimynysshed / as if the children of an
householder or the subgettes of a prince should be present. The doctrine of the
gospel does also teach this moderacyon of reformynge or admonicyon gyuyng /
so that the first admonicyon should want testes / the second should
admytte.ii. or.iii. Matthe^ xviii.
and the third should be presented before the church or congregation.
Generally where as appears no hope of amendment it is lef^ll to keep
syle^ce. Intercessyon or prayer does often times work the same thing that a
rebuke should do or chiding. Now is this kind of reprehensyon or rebukynge
granted Reprehe^sion of sin by showing of do^o^^ in cou^tynaunce.
to al men / to signyfye by heaviness of countenance that he does not commend
those things which be done or said. Contrary wise do they which with a merry
cheer do hear a backebyter or sclau^derous body / which do rejoice in foul
or rybaldy ^ales / which do smyle upon seruyle flatterers / or ^estynge byters.
From such manners does the ryghtwyse man full greatly abhor.
Ecclesiasticus. xxviii.
He does close his ears with thorns yt he should not hear the words of men
sclaunderynge or backebytyng their neighbor. Many have delight in obtrectacyon
or to hear backebyters countynge the vitupery or blame of other to be their
laud and praise. With such be tale bearers set by whom the just and
ryghtwyse man does abhor and defye. For in the presence of him (as hear
says y^ prophet) is the malygner brought to naught. It is extreme contempt
to count one for naught or nothing. what a maligner is.
He is a malygner and enuyous person which does not suffer the honest fame
or name of his neighbor / but in what soever wise he can does spotte or blotte
it. A malygner is in diverse ways brought to naught.
Such one is diverse ways brought to naught / as when he outher is openly
contemned / or when he is chastysed for evil speaking / or else when he is with
holden from that vice by wholesome admonicyon. when a mal^gner is blessydly
and for his wealth brought^ to naught.
He is blessydly brought to naught which of an evil speaker is made a good
speaker / of a reprehender or rebuker a prayser or co^mender / of an enuyous or
malicyous man gentle and innocent. A backebyter or evil speker is a great
pestylence.
But the just man for because he does know how great a pestylence a
backebyter or evil speaker is in this life will whytesaue to give to such one
none honor / but he does fly from him abhorrynge him. The venyme (says he)
of adders Psalm. xiii.
is in their lyppes / their tethe be weapons and arowes / and their Psalm. lvi.
tongue is a sharp swearde / their mouth is full of cursyd speech and
bytternes / their wine is the galle of dragons. De^ter. x^^^i.
What thing can be more horrible than such a beast? If at any time he looks
or speaks fair / he reaches forth the gall of dragons for wine. A malygner
is a beast most horrible.
If he only does breathe upon the / he breaths poison or venyme. If he
byteth / his tethe be arowes dypped in venyme. If he smyteth with his tongue /
he sleeth with a swearde. If he opens his lyppes / he powers out ye venyme
of aspes / or rather a poison that is worse or more hurtefull than ye venyme of
aspes. The venym of a maligner is many ways (...) more hurtefull than the
venym of add^rs.

Psalm. C.x.x.


The styngynge of an aspe or adde^ does slay the body only / but this venyme
does kylle the soul / wherefore the prophet being a frayde thereof does cry:
Deliver O lord my soul from ungracious lyppes and from a gylefull tongue. He
is a ferde of his soul and not of his body. An aspe or adder all though he
does slay with styngynge / yet does he cause an easy death and nothing
paynefull. For he that is ^tynged is brought thereby in to a ^leape / and that
so without all manner of pain / that he does dye with some fealynge of
pleasure. But it is a death most cruel that a sclaunderer does cause. Whose
venyme is tha^ the more sore and venymous / when it is cloked with the color
or appearance of amyte and benevolence. The venym of a maligner is than most
venymous when it is cloked with appare^ce of amyte.
There be some which before one be louesome and flatteryng / but they power
out privily being with other men deedly poysone. There will they make
couenante for silence to be kept / which silence The malygner does require
silence perverse.
they do unwisely require of other / seeing they them selves can not keep it.
They tell to one / and after to an other / and so often to one and to other
that every man does know it / and there secret huszynge and buszynge does
break out in to a common rumoure of the people. This vice did scarcely never
so sore rage as in this our ag^ or time. All the world is full o^ obloquye /
nouther be any books more desyrouslye read than those which be full of
raylynge or malycyous words. And now do they ^eare away the praise of
eloquence / which be not afraid to shote forth all manner rebukes or opprobrye
against every man. But the just man does recounte all such for most refuse
parsones and abiectes supposing them only precious which do fear the lord.
A ryghtwyse man will not sclaunder his neighbor but excuse his.
For who soever does fear and dread ye lord he will not sclaunder or distayne
his neighbor for whom ye lord did dye / but such things as be doubtful
does he interpret to the best wise / those things which be well does he
gently praise / and those things which be more manyfestly evil than that they
can be excused does he yet dimynysshe if by none other color / yet at ye
least by the greatness of the te^ptacyon / saying thus if a like temptacyon had
happened to us we should have sinned more grievously. Now does follow Which
swears to his neighbor and does not disceyue him.

IT is a detestable crime to disceyue men by periurye / which vice to want is
no very great praise. Fidelyte of prom^ses na^ hold^n does dissolve all good
societe or ^elyshippe^
But by this foresaid saying of the psalm is commended fydelyte in all promyses
/ without which all socyete or company in this world is broken and dissolved.
And now a days be they taken for infamous persons which have be conuycte of
periurye. But if a man would narowly look upon the matter the veyle or cover of
custom being put away he shall find the life of christen people / on every
side ful^ of periuryes. The life of christian me^ is more full of periurye tha^
many do think it.
The abbotte doth^ swear to ye monks. The monks do swear to the abbote. The
bysshoppes do swear to ye other clergy. And the clergy is sworn agaynewarde
to the bishop. The prince does swear to his subjects / and the subjects
be agaynewarde sworn to ye prince. He does swear which does take an office
or is made a ruler. And before time who soever was made a consul or sheryffe
did add over and besides his oath an horrible execracyon or curse saying: I do
curse or give me and mine from god to the devil / if I shall wyttynglye
disceyue you / or work a^y falsehede. The judge does swear and so does the
testis coming before him. The deuyne does swear taking the authoryte of a
doctor / and so finally does a Notary / yea and the poor carpynter least I
should further proceed to make rehersall of all. Go thou now and consydre me
what every one does profess by his oath made / and also examyne whether they
do perform the things which they have professed or no / and I fear least
thou shalt find many multytudes of false oaths and periuryes. Evil c^stomes
do make me^ blind in judgment.
But usage and custom does cause that such things be not counted periuryes /
only is he noted fautye of periurye which does forswear a thing put to his
custodye or credyte as be pledges and such other / or which does forswear
money lent to him. Now all though there is made none oath betwyxte parties /
yet who so ever doth^ receive any charge or office / the same does secretly
swear to his neighbor / which charge except he shall faithfully perform he
is not all clear of periurye. As who soever shall tak^ upon him to be a legate
or embassatoure / or to defend and plead a matter in the law / or to
instruct youth in learning and good manners / y^ same does oblige him self by
a secret oath in the taking of any such charge that he will do (...)
faithfully. A carpenter that couenaunteth upon a price to build an house / all
though there be none oath expressyd / yet is he bound to perform it by the
secret law of his conscience. A tailor which takes in hand to make a
garment / or a goldesmyth which takes upon him to make a cup / A carye^ or
shypman which takes in ha^d^ to carry or convey marchandyse / i^ he does
committee fraud or disceyte / he does couple theft with periurye / all though
such manner or form of speech is not had betwyxte you: will thou swear to
keape fidelyte / and he answeareth ye will I swear. Another does it skyll
whether he does add this for more assurance: I do give me from god to the
devil if I be not faithful. For he has all ready given him self to the
devil which wyttingly has disceyued his neighbor. I do know ye pykynge or
pety theft of myllers / and of caryers drynkyng out the wynes of other men.
But in christen people ought to be so great synceryte or p^renes that a simple
or syngle promise should be so substanciall or weyghtye as a solemn oath.
Another ought we ^ccomplysshe to our neighbor only what soever thing we do
swear / but to our enemies also / and and to the myscreantes or infydeles / if
so it be not a thing mischeuous ^r malycyous that thou haste promised. Which
has not given out his money to vsurye. Deuter^ xxiii.
It was a detestable crime in ye old law ^ if one jew should lend a thing
t^ an other jew intending to receyu^ more than the sum lent out. For it was
granted them to occupy^ vsurye with strangers or alya^tes^ But among
christen people (which ought to be coupled one to an other with more strayte
bands of amyte than before time were the jews) the word or name of vsur^ is
verily odyous and spyteful / b^^ would god the thing self were so spytefull
detestable and abhorred^ The hethen Philosophers did al^so think vsurye to be
a thing de^testable / for so much as money t^ enge^dre or get money is a
things against nature. Usurye hated of the hethe^ Ph^losophers as a thing
contrary to nature
But besides tha^ kind of vsurye which is co^myt^ted in the open face or
sight of th^^ world. Much preuy usury that is not so counted of the doers
How many bargaynes ^ covetous crafts to get luker ^ subteltyes be there so
nigh appro^chynge and according to vsurye yt they be many times more wicked and
evil than it? These do we than most chefely use / when necessyte does pynche
or grieve our neighbor / and in such a case as he ought to be helped or
releaued freely and without any mede or money. Against i^grossers of corn.
The husband or ploughman is in need / than will the rich man or usurer for a
small sum of money bargayne with him / that he shall every year deliver to ye
rich usurer so much wheat as shall come of the husbands lands / or so
much money as the wheat is worth. When men do fear small increase or
renuynge to come of fruit and corn / or when neade of things necessary does
come upon / than they which have corn in store will auaunce and set up the
price. He which does lend out a thousand crowns in silver / that he by the
bargayne should receive s^ much in gold (which commonly is more in value)
does he not many^festly committee vsurye? Against auau^sers of the val^acyo^ in
coins for covetousness.
From the which vsurye they be not far wide which do procure the valuacyon
of money to be outher dyminysshed or else to be set up or auau^^syd to thentente
they may thero^ have profit and vauntage. Nouther be they which do enforce
they^ credytours to give them a quyt^tance testefyenge them fully payd^ and
contented (when they have re^ceyued but a p^ace of the whol^ sum) clear and
free from the crym^ of vsurye. But such false crafts of vsurye can I now not
recke^ up. For they be infynyte / from the which all natwithstandynge h^ ought
to be quyte and fre which will dwell in ye tabernacle of god^ Now if so it
like you we may interpret or declare further this place after the moral
sense. Every gift of god by which a man may help his neighbor is money. By
money may be understand al^ gifts given to us of god.
As in example to this man is given ye gift of eloquence or langages / to that
man is given learning and faculte to judge things ryghtefully / to some man
is given a feate or co^ueyance to govern / some can well give counsel / an
other is in authoryte with the people or lords. He that with his gift given of
god does freely and kyndely help his neighbor is to be praised by this
testymonye of scripture: Which has not given or lent out his money to vsurye.
Matthe. xxv.
But here ryseth a doubt saying that the servant in the gospel is condemned
/ which did not give the money lent him to the usurers / How does it agree
that he should hear be praised which has not given out his money to vsurye
and for vau^tage^ These things be no whytt^ r^^pugnante. Laudable usury
The lord does love vsurye which does bring to hy^ lucre or vau^tage / but
he does h^^e vsurye which the servant does get or claim to him self. He
which by the gift of eloquence or langages does gather glory and profit to
him self is ryghtwysely condemned / for the vauntage ^r lucre belongs to
him which dy^ give or lend out the first stock ^r lent money. But he which
does so distrybute ye word of god that many may be inflamed to the love ^f god
/ and that in them god may ^e glorified / the same man does exe^^cyse a
laudable vsurye. And so is (...) be said of other things. But the ^uste or
rightwyse man which does convert all y^ gifts of god unto (...) profit of his
neighbor / for so much as he does know and acknowledge ye very same po^er or
ha^^lyte by which he does profit other to come of gods bountefulnes and
lyberalyte and to be his gift / he thereupon does ^ndeuer himself to the best
of his power to bestow well the lords money / but in such wise that he yet
will seek therefore no praise or worldly profit to him self / but he will
get and bring all y^ lucre or vau^tage to god / which did lend unto him
the first stock or su^me. Thou than wylt obiecte if we must labor freely /
than is not ye workman worthy of his reward or hyre? yea rather shall no man
have a more plentuous reward than he which does freely bestow and deal
abroad the gifts of god. How this is to be understand.
He has a gracyous and bountefull detter who soever does give out or lend for
vauntage to god. The workma^ is worthi of his hyre.

1. Timo. v.


Furthermore this sentence of the Apostle the work man is worthy of his mede
and hyre is not spoken to those which do distrybute o^ deal abroad ye gifts
of god / bu^ Romans xv.
to them which through the distrybucyon or bestowyng of such gifts be helped.
^. Corint. ix.
Such ought to give their carnal goods to those of whom they do receive
spiritual goods. But a faithful steward^ and distrybuter shall take of the^^
whom he has profyted and done good to / and yet not all thynges^ nor every
where / or in all places ^ nor of all men. How a fayth^ull steward shall
receyue^ of whom worldly living / but with out requiryng the^ as duty. This
is against our beneficed men which will sue in the law for tithes when they
yet preach not.
He shall such things not require as duty / but he shall look to receive his
mede or ^^warde of god / whose work and bu^synes he does. In like wise as
(...) is to be supposed that saint Paul^ did receive or take at some tyme^ of
some men some things / which were wyllyngly offered and given i. Corintheos.
ix.
to him / but of ye Corinthyans dy^ he receive or take nothing / and i^ ii.
Corin. theos. xi
is not read yt he required of an^ man any thing at all. No man does less in
vain bestow good we do not read that Paul ever required any temporal living
for preachyng^
doing upon his neighbor / than he which is to them beneficyall freely
without respect of any mede or vauntage. Now do this thing which follows
appear to be a small praise: Which has taken no rewards or brybes against
innocents.He was abhomynable even among the infydels which being corrupt
with mede or with a brybe should condemn innocents / or which for money
received should oppress an innocente with false wytnes / or if an attorney in
the law for love of luker and vauntage should defend a mysdoer against one
whom he did know to be an innocente. Against false wytnes and attourneys i^
the law
The playntyue in a matter of law swears his forged cause or cautell to be
true / and his attorney swears to support or defend it faithfully. Which
thing would to god it shuld^ not so often (as it is) be perceived among
christen people. But this sentence of the text does proceed more largely.
Ta^yng of brybes against an i^noce^t has a large inte^dement or sense.
He does take a brybe against an innocent who soever for love of any co^modyte
or vauntag^ does not socour an innocent when ^ or where as he may. As for
ensample: If thou da^te se thy neighbor wronged / and thou for because of on^
man or other doste wynke at it / ^ will not co^sydre to ease or remedy it /
than doste thou take a brybe a^gaynste an innocente. He that thu^ thinks if I
do supporte or ayd^ ^his man / he which oppressed him where as before he has
be to me ^eneficyall) will withdraw his hand / and so will stop his
main^tenau^ce of the right / than the profit or vauntage which he was wont
to take / is a brybe taken against an innocente. He that ^oth these things
shall never be ^oued. It is said he that does / ^at he which speaks. ^atth.
^v.
God does ^bhorre them of whom he is ho^oured with lyppes. The Pharyse (...)
did well know and per^e^ue which was the hye and chief ^omaundement in the
law does hear of the lord: Luke. x.
Do this and thou shalt live. He therefore y^ does these things. Which
things? Enter with out ^pot / work that is right / speak the truth in his
heart and all the other things which he has before recyted. Iames^ ii
For they al do join together / so yt if any is faylyng / all be marred. But
what fruit or profit shall finally come to the worker or acco^plysshe^ of the?
He shall never be moved / of y^ which words may be double inte^deme^t or
meaning. That is he shall never be moved / or else if he be moved for a time he
shall not be moved etern^lly or for ever but he shall arise after falling and
shall come again in favor with god. Like as he which trusts in the lord
shall not be asshamed for ever / al though that for a while he be shamed or put
to shame before men: Even so he which abides honestly in the tabernacle of y^
lord and does rest in his holy mountain / the same shall not be removed for
ever. Like as is testefyed in an other Psalm: He which trusts in the lord
is as mount^ Syon / he shall not be removed which abides in Jerusalem.
Psalm. C.xxiiii.
The cite says Israel of our strength / the lord shall be set in it the
wall and the fortress. This is the only cite of which the lord spoke
sayynge? Matthe. xvi.
And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Things condemned by
this psalm.
In this psalm is condemned all exteryor worshyppyng of god which is not
coupled with very devotion of the mind / and al knowledge or learning which
is joined with corrupt manners. Ieremye does entreat this matter in the.vii.
chapter: Stand thou (says he) in the gate of the lords house and preach
thou there this word or message: Hear the word of the lord al^ ye of Judah /
which do enter by these gates to honor the lord / Thus says the lord of
hosts the god of Israel / take you good ways and follow good cou^sayles and
I shall dwell with you in this place / trust you not in false lyenge words
saying hear is the temple of the lord / the temple of ye lord / the temple
of the lord / but rather amend your ways and counsayles / if you will judge
right betwyxte man and his neighbor / if ye will not wrong the stranger the
fatherless and the wydowe / if ye will not shede innocente blood in this place
if ye will not go away after strange gods to your own distruccyon than
will. I dwell with you in this place and in the land that I gave before time to
your fathers for ever. And a little thereafter: what think ye y^ this house
which bears my name / is a denn^ of thieves? Thus se you as the lord in
these words like as in o^ther following does conceive in^dignacyo^ with great
stomach against those which did put co^fydence in y^^ temple and in ye
ceremonies of the temple having their my^de and life coin^^uynate with sinfulnes.
Agay^ste ceremonial persons
Such do na^ purefye y^ temple / but rather they d^ pollute the temple. More
plainly and sharply does Esaye handell this matter in the first chapyter.
There does god in this wise stomach the thing against those which worshypped
him with ceremonies of y^ temple / where as else they lived pollutely: why offer
you says he to me so many sacrefyces? I am over full and weary of them I would
not have the burnte offerynges of wethers / and the fatnes of fed beasts /
and the blood of calves / and of lambs / and of gotes. When ye should come
before me / who did require these things of your hands / to thenten^ you
should walk in my porches? Off^e ye no more oblacyons thus to me in vain /
Incense is abomynacyon to me / I may not away with your new mones / your
sabbotte days and such solemn feasts my soul does hate / your calendes
and solempnytes they are to me paynefull and grievous. etc. Moughte not the
gross people and rebellyous to god make answer again to this: What has
chaunsed the O lord? Doste thou now say: Who did are or require these
things of your hands? Where as the law which thou haste given us by Moses
does so dilygentlye prescrybe and appoynte to us all these things promising
great benefytes to the obseruers / and thretenynge death to the tra^sgressers.
Now doste tho^ say that incense is to the abomyn^cyon / which thou dyddest
before say was a sweet odoure. Now^ does thy soul hate the feastefu^^ days /
in which before thou dyddest rejoice to be present. From^ whense comes this
so great mutacyon and varyete in him / which only abides immutable? Wha^
answer shall god make to the mutterynge and rebellyous people? I am (shall he
say) immutable / but ye do not observe those things which I have commanded
/ nouther have I so prescrybed these ryghtes or ceremonies / that yo^ should
put parfyte trust and confydence of ryghtwysenes in them / but yt partly they
should be signs by which you should be admonysshed / and partly things
furtherynge or promotynge us to very virtue and holiness. Which if it be absent
all other things be vain / and to me be they so little pleasau^te / that they
do provoke me the more to wrath. Romans vli.
The law is spirytuall and does require the works of charity to be done with
puryte of my^de / which works except they be ioyntely added / let outward
worshyppynge and ceremonies be kept how much so ever you please / yet is the
law vyolate and broken and all your doing hypocrysye. What thing than is it
(will they say) that thou chefely doste require of us? Be you washed says he
and made clean. The sayynge of Isay accordyng^ to this psalm of David.
This verily is the ^hynge which the psalm does hear say: Which does e^ire
with out spotte^ Take away your evil thought as from my sight. Which thing
is thus spoken in ye psalm: Which does speak the truth in his heart. Seek to
do right judgment / deliver the oppressed / hel^e the orphlyne or fatherl^sse
to the^^ right / defend the ^ydowe. That (...) psalm does thus record:
Which works ryghtwysenes or does (...) is right. The same people in the
lviii. chapy. of ye same prophet dot^ mutter against god saying. Wh^^ fore
have we fasted and thou have na^ beholde^ it? Fasting dysco^me^ded.
Why have we chastise^ our souls and thou have not known or regarded it? But
what answear^ do they hear again of ye lord? Is the fasting says he which
I have chosen of such a sort yt a man for a day should chastyse him self? Or
to wrythe his heed about as a cy^^^^ or ring and to cast upon him (...)
^lothe and ashes? Or call you thi^ fasting / and an acceptable day unto ye
lord? What thing therefore in ex^^ryor matters or doings can b^ pleasant
unto god / if fasti^g sole^^ly done in sack clothe and ashes does displease
him? iii. of Kings. xxi.
Or did not ye Nyny^ites Achab and other full many turn the ire of god unto
mercy with such fasting? Fasting when and whereby it is ^^^mend^ble
Fasting therefore does not displease god / but tha^ finally does it please him
/ if puryte of my^de annexed with the deeds of charity be ad^^d thereto. And
therefore it follows: Dissolve thou ye bands of iniquyte / lowse ye burdens
which do oppress or press down / let the^ go ^re which are impotent and
broken with labors / and break all charges / deal thy breed unto ye hongry / ye
nedy and way farynge men bring into thy house / when thou shalt se a na^ed
man cover him / and dispyse ^hou not thine own flesh / tha^ shall thy light
break forth as the morning and thy health shall sone arise / and ryghtwysenes
shall go before thy face / and the glory of the lord shall cover the / than
shalt thou pray and the lord shall gracyously hear the / thou shalt cry
and he shall say / lo I am present / for I thy god am a mercyful lord. Of
this sentence does the prophet entreat largelye and with many words: The
lord is merciful / and therefore is he chefely delyted or pleased with the
sacrefy^e of merciful doing. To this does Christ exhort in the gospel
saying: Matt. v.
Be ye parfyte like as your father is pa^fyte. How or in what wise parfyte? How
we shall be per^yte as our heavenly father.
In doing good to all men with out excepcyon. And therefore is added: which
causes his son to ^^ryse upon the good and upon the evil / and does send
rain upon the just and unjust men. The sa^^ ryghtwysenes in things exteryor
and have sought to be recounted holy and virtuous before men rather than before
god. Whose supersticyon the lord does often and commonly reprehende in ye
^uangely. But we had need dilyge^tly to forsee and take heed whether such
things do pertayne unto us or no / which although we offer or sacrifyce no
beasts / yet have we ceremonies and rytes prete^dyng a wonderful show of
holiness / to which men perhaps do trust neglectyng and leaving a part
puryte of mind. Some do with great cost anourne churches or ^e^ples / found
aulters / edifye monasteryes or cloisters Church buylders and founders of
aulters and cloisters.
/ and yet do they not give to their nedy neighbor yt they owe to give /
another do they restore their evil gote^ goods / nor change their corrupt
living / and yet ^hey rejoice i^ the^ se^ues / as though god were greatly
beholden to the^ for their good doing / yea such will cause them selves to be
painted and their images to be graven in the temples ascribing thereto their
names and tytles. But I fear least god will also say unto them: Who did
require these things of your hands that you should wa^ke in my porches / I
Isay. i.
mean that ye s^u^de occupye the temple and mine aulters with your tytles nam^s
and images? Some do believe that he has gotten god by the foot / and that he is
full godly or holy if he do give money for masses to be song or celebrate for
him in certain places / and upon certain prescrybed day^s. An other does
believe in like wise that he is all so well sped if he do bestow money that the
morrow mass may be solemplye song in the honor of our Lady with the
quer^s^^^^ and the organs going / and that an antemne be song again at even
in the worship of her with most melodyous harmony of syng^n^e men / of the
organs and with ieolyiynglynge or chymynge of the belles. If these things be
done with minds vnpurefyed / or with out mercy associate / is it not to be
doubted least they shall hear said again to them: Isay. i.
And when you shall cry unto me I will not gracyouslye hear you? What than
shall we neglecte and despise exteryor^ worshyppynge or ceremomonyes? Of
e^t^r^or worsh^pp^ng god.
Nay verily but we shall bring it back from supersticyon to right holiness
and devotion / from unmeasurable excessyue and super^luous cost to a christen
measurablenes. Tha^ ought we pri^cypally and above all things / cause that
kind of sacrefyces to be occupied / which be to god princypally delycyous and
pleasant. And which be those? A mind through faith and innocencye immaculate
/ and through charity all ready to do good to all men. Matthe. ^xiii.
These things says the lord should y^ do / and the other ought not to have
be omytted. What things than be those which we ought to do according to
this saying of this psalm: He that does these things shall never be moved?
These things be they which of them selves do commend us to god / all though
the other without our blame be not with them ioyntely added. As for example.
The church has assygned or commanded fasting / and thou doste observe it.
But yet doste thou not refrain from voluptuousnes / from wrath / but thou
art more ready than thou war^e wont to take vengeance. Thus is thy fasting
displeasynge god which cries against the: Think ye this fasting pleases me?
or that this is the fasting which I have chosen? Thou haste left undone that
thou ought do / and thou haste done the thing which thou ought not
omytte. Thou doste celebrate mass but / thou art at discencyon with thy
neighbor / know thou tha^ that thy sacrifyce or mass is dyspleasaunt to
god. Thou cryeste to god mercy / mercy / mercy / but thou doste show no
mercy to thy brother. Thou prayest that god would deliver ye from peril /
when thou denyeste healpe unto thy brother being in peril. Therefore so many of
us as do profess the name of Christ and w^ll be recounted his members that we
may worthily abide in his tabernacle / and that we may find reast in his holy
mountain / Let us cast away all malice that we may walk in his syghte
without spotte being of one accord in the truth and of one mind. For there
wants no spotte where as is dyscorde / nouther is there veryte in the heart
where dyuersyte is of opynyons / nouther is in the tongue synceryte where as of
doctrine is dyuersyte. More over let us daily off^e sacrefyces p^easynge to him
/ which has offered him self for us / that we should verelye be a very
preesthode. And let us also fight strongely with the devil that we may
verily be a royal generation. Let us keape our selves pure from all
corrupcyon or pollucyons of the flesh that we may Be ye holy for I am holy
the lord your god. ^euitici. xi.
i. Peter. ^
Aaron him self was not all only consecrate but all his garments and al ye
instruments or vessels of the temple. Nouther was any so presumptuous to
apply any such things to any occupyenge in his house / How much more
religyously than and reverently ought we to be ware least we do violently or
irreverently take aw^ye any of those things (which be conse^rate unto the
service and worship o^ ^od) unto a profane / unholy and fylthy usage. The
vesse^s and garments of our temple.
The vessels or implementes of our temple be all our members / all the powers
of our mind. The garments be our deeds or works by which we be anourned to
ye glory of god. we be the precious temple of god.
Thou wondreste upon and doste esteem holy a temple edifyed with white marble /
glysterynge with gold and precious stones. But thou art a temple more
precious. Thou abydest religyously and devoutly in a temple which ye bishop
has consecrate or hallowed with vnccyon or oil. But y^ art more holy and more
consecrate. Thou art not anoy^ted with y^ preystes oil. But what than? Nouther
was christ ever anointed with Moses oil / where as yet he is king of kings /
and a priest for ever. The ointement with which we be hallowed
Thy crown and hands be not anointed with oil which is made of ye poticaries /
but thou art all whole and thoroughly anointed wit^ the blood of ^he immaculate
lamb Jesus Christ. He is gracyously and blessedly anointed which has his
heart anointed with the vnccyon of the holy ghost. And yet natwithstandynge
thou doste not lack exteryor vnccyon. Thou art anointed in baptism / thou
art anointed in co^firmacion. In the first thou art anointed to be a priest
and i^to preesthode. And in ye second thou art anointed to war and to be a
warryour. In old time men were baptized with only water. In old time me^ were
baptized with water only.

Psalm. C.iiii.


The authoryte of ye fathers did add thereto oil which they call chrisme. Our
lord does cry by ye prophet: Touch not ye my christ's yt is to say mine
anointed. And John^ does say: i. John^. ii
The vnccyon of hy^ shall teach you of al things / where he speaks not only
of priests / but of people which be ^^secrate to christ. Let therefore every
one of us se and take heed yt we being pure may off^e pure sacrefyces / and
being chaste may offer chaste sacrifices every man in his ow^e temple. What
facrifyces (will you say) doste you mean? Our sacrifyces (...) a^te^ sacrifys^d.
He y^ in hy^ self has quenched ye fervent heat or carnal lust of lechery
/ has both sacrifised to god a precious got / and also strystryken Satan our
enemy with a deedly wound. He that has driven out of his mind the mocyons
of envy has offered to god a pleasant oblacyon. He that has oppressed
fervent and boylyng ire or wrath has immolate a lion. He that has cast away
folly and ignorance has sacrifysed a sheep. He which in trouble and
adfliccyons does submytte him self all whole to the will of god has offered
a sacrefyce passing acceptable. He that does refrain petulancye or wantones
does offer a calfe. (...) rejects fraud or deceyte taky^g to him simplicyte
and playnes does sacrefyce a fox. He which does correct or reform excess
in meats or drink with sobernes and te^perance has offered up a swyne. He
that forgets fosysshe prattelynge or clatterynge has sacrifysed a pie. So
that in this manner of sacrifyces be all manner of beasts sacrifysed and offered
/ whether they have the figure or fassyon of any vice / or else do resemble or
represent any virtue. As he which does live chaste with his laufull wife does
offer up a couple of tyrtle doves to the lord. The married man is tha^^e which
occupyeth his only lau^ull wife.
He that does syghe for desire of life heavenly and does in all things love
simplicyte or playnes / ye same has of^er^d up a pair of pegyons. we ought to
offer up bo^he vices subdued and virtues obtained ^o god / and why.

mattheu. v.


For we ought to offer up both vices subdued and also ve^tues gotten to the
lord / ^^thout whose aid we can do no^^^^^ the one ne the other. He which so
does lead his life that men seeing his good works may gloryfye the father
which is in heaven / the same does offer up most sweet incense. According to
the word of Paul which is thus: ii. Cor. ii.
we be a good ^auer to god in all places. Pure prayers also and geuynge of
thanks do make to god a perfume more pleasante / than any incense myr^he and
galbanus. ^salme. ix.
There is a sacrifyce of praise geuynge with which god does love to be
honored. There is a sacrifyce of mercy by which we do provoke the mercy of
the lord. He that for christ's sake does socour^ (...) help the nedy / or
does forgive the trespasser has offered no vile but a pr^cyous oblacyon to
the lord. ^phe. ^.
^ol^os^. ^.
And if according to the admonicyon of the Apostle we do contynually sing with
hymns and songs spirytuall in our ha^^^es unto ye lord / this melody (...)
^xcelle all other instruments of musycke. Let us therefore co^tynually and
always sacrifice unto the ^orde with such sacrifyces / with ^uche perfumes /
with such obla^yons / with such songs / fyght^nge also by his aid and
suppor^yon against Satan / that we may ^e transposed and removed from this
tabernacle into the tabernacle
