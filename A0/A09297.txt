TO MY BELOVED WIFE HELENER PENRY, partaker with me in this life of the
sufferings of the Gospel in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ: And
resting with me in vndowbted hope of the glory that shall be revealed: all
strenght and comfort, with all other spiritual graces be multiplied through
Christ Jesus our Lord.
I see my blood laid for (my beloved) and so my days and testimonies drawing
to an end for ought I know: and therefore I think it my duty to leave behind
me this testimony of my love toward so dear a sister and so loving a wife in
the Lord as you have been unto me. First then I beseech you stand fast in that
truth which you and I profess at this present in much outward discomforte and
danger. Let nothing draw you to be subject to antichrist in any of his
ordinances. Let your soul and pour body be far from those assemblies which
yield either known or secret submission unto the ordinances of the beast.
that is to receave his marks either in the right hand or the forhead / as the
spirit of God says. Rev. 13.16. For this are you forbidden to do under the
pain of Gods eternal wrath. Rev. 14.9.10.11. 2 Cor. 6.14.15.16. and 1 Cor.
3.16.17. Rev. 22.18.19. Deu. 12.30.31.32. etc. Again (my beloved) / continewe
a member of that holy society whereof now you are / where the Lord in his
ordinances reigns: for here and in all such assemblies the Lord dwells by
the presence and power of his spirit Mat. 18.20. and 28.20. Exodus 29.45. Leui.
26.11.12. Here he is a mighty protection and defense ready at hand Isay.
26.1. and 4.6.. And his ordinances you know / has he greatly commanded to be
kept and observed. Psalm. 119.4. Oh our souls are to rejoice in these ways
more then in all substance and treasure Psalm. 119.14. And the loving kindness of
the eternal is for ever and ever toward them and their seed that remember his
ordinances to do them. Psalm. 103.17 18. Whereas all those are accursed that
err from his statutes and diminishe from the obedience they owe unto his
Majesty. Psalm. 119.21. Reu. 22:19. Psalm. 119.118. I pray you mark these places
with all such like in the word / against all those that makes a slayght matter
either not to walk in the ways of God or to be subject unto small corruptions
as they acco^pte them and be enarmed with the power of the word against all
such lying delusions. Lok. 2 Cor. 6.14.15.17. In conclusion my dear wife and
sister / look not at any earthly thingh / consecrate your self wholly / both
soul / body / husband / children / and whatsoever you have unto the Lord your
God / let them not be dearer unto you then his worship and service / know / it
know it to be an unspeakable preferment for you / that he voutchsafeth to take
either your self / or any of yours to suffer affictions with him and his
gospel here upon earth. Luke 18.30. Mat. 19.29. And I am persuaded that you
have undergone the profession of the truth upon the condition set down by our
savior Christ. Luke 14.26.27. that is to hate all in respect of his gospel.
Fear not the want of outward things / for the Lord cares for you and yours.
Remember what is set down. Heb. 13.5. Luke 12.31. The Lord is my God and yours
/ and the God of our seed. I know if you and our pore children continewe /
that they shall see a blessed reward eve^ in this life for these small and weak
sufferings of ours for the interest and right of Christ Jesus / for I am
assuered that the Lord will give a breathing time / a comfortable rest unto his
pore Church in this life. And my good wife / if you or any of mine live to see
those days: remember and let my pore children remember to declare in Syon the
vengeance of the Lord our God and the vengeance of his temple against babel:
and that the Lord God has brought forth our righteousness in rewarding that
wicked antichristian religion as it has done unto us. Ier. 50.28. and
51.10.35.36. and 50.15. Reu. 18.6. In the mean time wait pacientlie the Lords
leisure / he is not forgetful of you and yours especially of his pore Church /
he cannot deny himself and the truth of his promises you know 2 Timothy 6.5. Be
much and often in prayer day and night / much in reading and meditation of his
word / and you shall find that he will grant you yours hearts desiere /
according to his good pleasure and will. Pray with your pore family and
children morning and eavening as you do. Instruct them and your maid in the
good ways of God. See that no day pass over your head wherein you have not
taught them (especially her) some one principal of the truth. Think the time
greatly gained / as I have often told you that is spent in the word of the
Lord. Psalm. 1.1.2. Josh. 1.8. Amongst other places of the word wherein I would
have you to be conversant in regard of these times / I pray you to read Mat.
10. Luc. 12. John. 14.15.16. and 17. chapters. Psalm. 37. Isay. 60.61.62.63.
chapters: Mark every day what petitions you make unto the Lord / that you may
have either strenght and comfort of your faith in the inioyng of the things you
ask and so may return thankfulness unto him / or continewance of patience in
expecting and waiting for his mercy / And be not weary in attending upon his
good leisure / for in due time shall we receave if we faint not / for yet a
very little while / and he that shall come will come and will not car^e. Heb.
10.37. Above all things pray that the Lord would restore beauty unto his Church
and so would overthrowe the cursed religion of the Gomaine Antichrist in every
part thereof / observe your own especial infirmeties and wants / and be
earnest with the Lord that he would do them away / and consume them by the
power of his spirit. Remember me also and my brethren now in bonds / that the
Lord would assist us with the strenght and comfort of his spirit to keep a good
conscience and to bear a glorious testimony unto the end: yea be not void of
hope / but I may be restored again unto you by your prayers / and therefore
also be earnest with him for my delivera^ce. If the Lord shall end my days in
this testimony / as blessed be his name howsoever it goes / I am ready and
content with his good pleasure / keep your self my good Helen here with this
pore Church / you may make as good refuge and stay here as any where else for
your outward estate / though you could not / yet I know that you had rather
dwell under the wings of the God of Israel in poverty with godly Ruth / then
to possess kingdoms out of the land of Canaan / and whatsoever shift you make
keep our pore children with you that you may bring them up your self in the
instruction and informatio^ of the Lord Ephesians. 6.4. I leave you and them indeed
nothing in this life / but the blessing of my God and his blessed promyses made
unto me a pore wretched sinner / that my seed / my habitatio^ and family
should be blessed and happy upon the earth / and this my sister I dout not
shall be fownd an ample portion both for you and them / though you know that in
hunger often in could often / in poverty and nakedness we must make an account
to profess the Gospel in this life. And teach them I beseech you even now in
their youth that lesson indeed / which was the last that I taught them in word
/ and that is / that / If they will reign with Christ they must suffer with
him: and acquaynt them now in their youth with the baseness and means of the
Gospel: teach them that they are not to look for great things in this life /
but every day to make account that they are to yield their lyves and
whatsoever they have for the truth. Break their affections betymes while they
are yet green / by instructions out of the word and corrections meet for them
yet you know that parents must not be bitter unto their children. Ephesians. 6.4.
especially smiete not the elder child over hard / because you know the least
word will restrain her / when they are capabell of any handie labor / I
know you will not let them be idell If possiebell you ca^ / let them learn /
both to read and also to write / howsoever it be whether their bringing up be
better or worse under your hand or under the hands of others I their father do
here chardge them when they come to years of discretion as they shall answer
in that great day of judgment that they join themselves with the true
profession and Church of Christ / wherein now I go before them / the which
charge of mine that they may keep / I beseech you my good wife to put them often
in mind of the fame and what a blessing will ensue unto them if they keep it
/ as also what a judgment will surely follow if they neglect it. Ier. 15.18.
And withal be careful in case you should not be able to keep them all with you
that they be brought up with some of the Church with bread and water rather
then be clad with gould with any (how forward soever they seem to profess)
that yield any obedience unto the antichristian ordinances / for with such
they cannot choose but be leveaned with corruptions. I know my good Helen that
the burden which I lay upon thee of. 4. infa^ts whereof the elder is not. 4.
years old will not seem any wise burdensome unto thee / yea thou shall find
that our God willbe a father unto the fatherless and a stay unto the widow.

But here my most dear sister and wife / I agaiene advise you not to be a
widow long after my days / for you know the ordinance of God / that it is
good for a man not to be alone / so is it a great blessing for a woman to have
an head. And although to be married brings care and troble with it outwardly
/ yet is that holy order accompanied with that comfort in this life / as of
all outward things I judge it to be one of the greatest blessings for man or
woman to be married in the Lord if they cannot contain. Only take heed in
your choice / that first he with whom you match be of the same holy faith and
profession with you / next that he be meet to be your h^ad / even such a one as
you think fit to govern you as a head and rule you as a Lord: And in this
choice look not unto wealth or estimation in the world / yet rather choose many
blessings then one if you may but only respect the fear of God and the
meetnes of the party. Thus having hethervnto disburdened my self of my duty
toward you and care over you and your pore children / in some part / now to
come unto my self / I am I thank my God in great comfort in him though under
great trialls of my weaknesses / not for fear of any flesh I thank my God but
in consideration of mine own wants / rebellion / disobedience and
unthankfulness unto his majesty / but in regard of men and in respect of the
cause of my GOD wherein I stand. I fear not any power or strenght of man
whatsoever and I am this hour most willing to lay down my life for the word
of my testimony / and I trust shall be onto the end. I was taken you know at
Ratliffe the 22. of the 3. month March 1592. carried the 24. before M. young
committed by him close unto the Counter Poultry: carried before M. Young again
the 26. of the same month 1593. where was D. ^angham and his brother preachers
both / sent as M. Young said by my Lord Keeper to confer with me. I answered
that I reverenced the authority of my Lord Keeper and the rest of her
Majesty's Counsel / but as for pryvate conference / in as much as my cause was
made publik and that my adversaries had my writtings in there hands / whereby I
moved the Parliament in the cause / I saw no reason why I should yield unto any.
I desired public upon ^quall conditions: hear after great heat uttered by M.
vaugham / and some warmnes on my part I was sent again close whence I came.
The 28. of the same month I was called for by M. Young to confer with M. D.
Balgue of the Temple / where again I desired an equal trial set down 4. of
the special heads / and the conditions / took a copy of them / and so departed
/ after many reasonable words given unto me by M. Young The 2. of the 5. month
April came M. D. Crook. M. Grennham and M. Temple vn^^ the prison to confer
with me, both of christian charity / and also having authority thereunto as
they said: I refused all private intermedling in so publik an action / showed
them the things offered by me unto M. Young and accepted for the time in good
part by him / demanded whether they had authority to condescend unto those
equal conditions / and so I would confer with them or with any: They said no:
and therefore after much needles speech departed / M. Temple very jniuriously
taking away whether I would or not / the copy of that which I gave unto M. Young
/ whereof he sent me a copy the 5. of the same month but retained mine own.
Upon which day I was sent for to the sessions house where was Sir Georg Barnes
as I take it M. Young M. Dale the Deane of westmynster and an other of the
Clargy / they offered me an oath which I refused because it was against
conscience and law: protesting notwithstanding that I heald lawful to take an
oath before a magistrate: then they examined me of my going with Edward Graves
/ I a^swered in deed that I lay at an jnn at Hodsden with him about the time
then spoke / but I would go no f^rther to answer them in this point thus far
but no further I answered he^^^ both because they knew of it before and
especially for some other respects then moving me. After this they dealt with
me about my being in Scotland and / in the midst of which discourse they sent
me away / It was plain with the but especially with M. Young: Herin this is
most memorable that alleging Numb 35. 33. they set it down as an article
against me though I read the very words unto them they are so lamentably
ignorant / and lay wayt for blood so cruelly that certaynlie the Lords hand
is not far of. The Lord show mercy unto us and them / from my har^ I wish it. I
cannot see but that they thirst after my blood: Therefore pray for me and desire
all the Church to do the same.

To draw to an end / salute the whole Church from me especially those in
bunds / and be you all much and heartily saluted in the Lord. Let none of you be
dismayed. The Lord will send a glorious issue to Syons troubles. Yet you must
all be prepared for sufferings / I see no other likelihood: Let not those which
are abroad mysse to frequen^ the holy meetings: Salute my mother and yours in
Wales: my brethren / systers an^ kindered there. And my God knows / yea your
self knows how earnestly and often I have desired that he would voutchsafe
my service in his Gospel among them t^ the winning of there souls for evermore
unto him. Salute your parents and mine i^ Northampthone / with my poor Kinsma^
Ienkin Jones and M. David also / thoug^ I had not thought that any owtward
respects would have made him withdraw hi^ showlders from the Lords ways / but
the Lord will draw him forward in his goo^ time. Salute all ours in Scotland
upon the borders and every way northward / especially M. I^ell / always dear
unto me. Christ Jesus bless thee and them all my beloved even for ever and
ever. Let it not be known unto any save unto the party tha^ shall read this
unto you / that I have written at all as yet / I got means this day t^ writ
thus much whereof no creature lyving knows. The 6. of the 4. month April 1593.
in great haste with many tears and yet in the great spiritual comfort of my
soul

Your husband now for a season / and your beloved brother for evermore Ihon
Penry an unworthy witness of Christ's Testament / against the abominations of
the Roman Antichrist and his souldyers / sure of the victory by the blood of
the lamb.
