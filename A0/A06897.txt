A lord of power.

The Shepherdes. These are news full of all plesaunce
And is Christ, sayste thou, borne in deed,
Surely this is a full good chance
He shall healpe us I trust, in our need.
Uve have ^oked for him full long
For he is our true Messiah,
The Romans have done us great wrong
And holden us in a pyteous case.
But we are glad he is come now
I trust that by him we shall be,
Delivered from all sorrow
And set again at lyberte.
He shall be king and reygne over all
All nations to him shall obaye. Esa ix, Mich, iiii Dan. vii, Psalm, ii,

On h^s head the crown imperial

Thangell. But now one thing
Of this your king
Give you warnyng
I must certes,
Spiritual
Nottemporall Luc, xii, John^, xi,

His Realm royal
Is aye doubtless. John^, xviii,

Not outwardly
But inwardly Psalm, ii, zaeh, ix. Mathe, xxi, Marc, xi, Luc, xix, Iho^, xii.

His Impery
Is appointed,
By his spirit
To rule each wyghte
Is his sole right
Determined. Johan, xiiii, xv, xvi.

If therefore you
Look for rescue
Of your king new
To make you fre, Galat, v,

That you each one
Should reygne alone i, Pet, ii,

And other none
Deceived are ye.

The Shepherdes. UUhy good sir I pray you tell us
Is not this that same Messiah
Uvhiche by his power so wondrous
Shall make us all fre in each case?

Thangell. It is even he
Uvhiche with great gle
Shall make you fre Iho^, viii

From tyrauntes all, John^, viii. Act, xiiii, Galat. v, zach, ix,

Not outwardly
But inwardly
Tryumphantly
This thing be shall.

The Shepherdes. Yet sir all we full well hoped
That b^ the power of this our king,
Uv^ Iew^shulde be delyuir^d
From the ^omans cruel handlyng.
Uve hoped also I tell you plain
That we under our ^essias,
Shu^d great victor^es obtain
And so worthy lyuynges purchase.

Thangell. Your messiah
In every place
From all evil case
Shall you defend,
His servants true
Shall this king new
Ever rescue Mathe, xxvii^.

Unto the end.
Notwithstanding
Mark my saying
This your new king
Is appointed,
Uvithin your breast
To rule with rest John^. xiiii. xv. xvi.

So is it best
Determined.
External power Luck. xii.

In hall or bower
Uvith great honor
Now shall he bear, John^. vi

In spirit and mind John^. xviii.

Favor shall find Psalm.

Uvithout all fear.

You to damage,
Defend you all
Dubtles he shall
Both great and small
In every age. Heb. ii. i John^. iii.


The Shepherdes. If his power be not external
To reygne with great aucthorite,
Nor he a Prince imperial
Uvhat than shall we the better be?
Uvhat enemies shall he subdue
Or of them get the victory?
We se not, what joy shall ensue
Why we should rejoice so greatly.

Thangell. FOr to rejoice
All with one voice
Making sweet noise
Great cause ye have,
Ye were all lorne
In Satanes scorn
But he is borne
Uvhiche shall you save.
Through Adam
All ye became Genesis iii. iiii. Esd. iii, Ose, vi, John^, iii.

In goodness lame
And so damned,
Children of ire
Bond to hell fire Rom, v.

Uvas your certes iiii, Esd iii,

And sin all one,

Broubgte mysery
Generally
To your great moan.
By his great sin
This did ye win Gen,

Never to blynne

Can ye fulfill
In your workyng.
Your powers all
Are now full thrall Ieremi. xvii. Psalm. xiiii, Mathe. xix. ii Cori^thia^s, iii

In goodness small
Without virtue,
Not a good thought
Can ones be wrought
Ye are so naught
And evil ensue.
Bond to Satan
Both now and than
Is every man
Of Adam borne, John^. iii

So that now ye
Are no more fre
But as ye se
Parsonnes all lorne.
The Law again
To your great pain Romans v. Galat. iii. ii Cor, iii

Proves certain
You sinners still,
Seeing that ye Act. xiii.

In no degree
So faithful be
The Law to fulfill. Psalm. xiii.

Fallen carefully, Galat. ii Mathe. xxv. John^. v Roma. i ii. iii. i, Cor, vi
Ephe, v Ose. xiii Heb. ii,

Therefore again
Nothing but pain
To you pertayne
Eternally.
Thus to Satan
Is every man
For ought he can i. John^. v. Psalm. x,

Grievously bond,
So that in hell
Ye must now dwell Mathe. xxv.

With Satan fell
And therein stand.
With God no part Psalm. vi

Have ye in heart
But grievous smarte Esa. xi.

For your merit,
So that now ye
By equite
Damned must be
Of very right.
For ye doubtless Romans vii.

In this distres

C, xliii,

Nothing at all,
Your whole desarte

Into hell smarte
Perpetual.

The Shepherdes. Ah sir a, now well perceive we
That we are in a far worse case
Than we thought our selves for to be
By Adam, say you, is this come to pass?

Thangell. By Adam sure
Sin did allure Gen, iii, Ose, vi, iiii, Esd iii, Rom, v, Johan, iii,

You to endure
In damnacion,
His wyckednes
Is yours certes
Brynggynge endless
Destruction.

The Shepherdes. Seeing that the matter stand so
Uvhat means shall we than invent,
To be delivered from this woe
And to have grace unto us sent?
Ah sir a, Sin, Death, Satan, and hell,
Are they our enemies so grievous
That all other they do excel
And of all are most myscheuous?
It is time with all haste in deed
To hunte after some remedy,
Lest Satan that most wicked sede
Destroy us perpetually.
Tell us therefore thou messenger
If from the high God thou be sent,
How we shall escape this danger
For in great sorrow are we pent.

Thangell. Dowe in sadness
Are ye certes
But great gladness
Shall to you chance,
If that ye wake
And the news take
Uvhiche greatly make
To your pleasaunce.
This your sorrow
Even and morrow
Christ your borowe

With mirth and gle
Replete shall he
All your hearts fre
For ever and aye.
The occasion
Of his descension
At this season

The Shepherdes. All these things please us right well
So ioyefull newee they to us bring,
But we all pray the, us now tell
What shall become of our new king.

If that ye sin i, John, ii,

He will not blynne
You for to win
Again to grace,
Of the father
By his prayer
All this fauer
Shall he purchase,

The Shepherdes. But what, when shall he come again
To us which are his enheritaunce? Psalm ii.

Shall our king there ever remain
And work us than no more pleasaunce?

Thangell. Beturne shall he Ioh, iii, Malache, iii, Math, xxv, John^, v

Uvith high solace,
Neuermore pain S^ph. iii Joel, iii, i Cor. ii. Apoc. xxi.

But all joy plain
Shall ye sustain
In that good place.

The Shepherdes. That should we than now desire more Luc. i, Esa, x. John, i.
i, John^, iii. Esa vii Math i Luc i, ii. John^. ii Ephe ii. Esa, lxi Tit ii,

Of this our king so lyberall,
Seeing he has all things in store
That make to our health eternal?
Our king ye say, is Gods own son
Equal with his father in power,
which from his high throne is come down
To vanquyshe Satan, that is so sour.
Of a Maid pure without man's sede
Is he borne by ghostly inspiracion,
All our deformyties out to wede
which we took of Adams procreation.
He shall not only be our king
But also our good scole master, Esa, xxxv. John^, v John^, xi Mathe, xxvi.
Marc, xv. Luc, xxii Mathe, xii, xv, xvi, xix, xxi, xxii, xxiii,

Truly teaching us every thing
That pertayne to a Christen manner.
His godly doctrine he also shall
Uvith miracles approve and fortyfie.
Declarynge hereby unto all
That he is Messiah unfeignedly.
But the Bishops and priests also
with the Lawers and Pharisees,
Scribes, Sad^ces and many mo
Shall seake all means him to displease.
His sermons they shall callumniate
And his innocence dyffame,
Appliynge nether early nor late
To maintain the honor of his name. Luc. ^^^. xxiii. John^. viii. x. xviii.
Math. xxvi. Marc, xiiii. Luc. xxii Phil. ii, Esa. liii

They shall so increase in fury
That their malice shall never cease,
T^ll they have slain him cruelly
To satisfye their wyckednes.
His own disciple shall they allure
Christ his Master for to betraye,
Gyuynge him gifts to make him sure
That from his purpose he go not away.
False witness also shall they hyre
Against Christ our true lord and king,
To accomplish their wicked desire
That unto death they may him bring.
After diverse kinds of torment Psalm. xv Jonas. i. ii. Ose vi, Rom, iiii. Psalm.
lxviii. Esa. lxiii. Marc, xvi. Act. i, i, John^, ii. Romans viii. Heb. vii Luc.
xxiiii. John^, xvi.

wherewith he shall be greatly vered,
To the cross than shall he be sent
Unto the death to be scurged.
So that the conclusion shall be
That his sweet badye shall be slain.
And his precious blood shed on the tree
To release all our synnefull pain.
But he shall rise again the third day
Like a lord puysaunte and bounteous.
That before God the father we may
Ever appear Just and ryghteous,
Than to the heavens ascend he shall
Both God and man by his divine power,
Sitting on the right hand eternal
Of God the father at each hour.
For us shall he without ceasynge
Pray there unto God his father,
His prayers hereto appliynge
That in grace we may persevere.
Moreover to us shall he send
The holy Ghost from the heavens high,
Uvhiche shall preserve us unto the end
Against Satan our old enemy. Art. ii, x, Psalm. lxviii. Joel iii. Math. xxv.
Phil. iii i. These, iiii, Psalm. L. clv. Psalm. L. xviii,

This holy spirit shall garnyshe
Our minds with virtues aboundante,
And to abstain from works deuylyshe
Grace ever to us shall he grant,
At the last day shall he again
Return unto the great judgment,
The evil shall he commit to pain
The good to glory shall be sent.
O what a glorious king have we
How gentle, how good, how liberal,
Now blyssed might Messiah be
which to such glory does us call.
Feign would we se this our new king
Gladly now would we him visit,
For never was there any thing
wherein we had so great delyghte,
Tell us therefore we pray the all
Uvhyther we shall go for to find,
This our new king a prince royal
whom we all love with heart and mind.

Thangell. If that ye be
Minded to se
Your king so fre
Corporally,
In bethelem sure Math. ii, Luc. ii.

Is he demure
With Mary pure
Unfaynedly.
There shall ye find
Your king so kind
After the mind
Of the prophet, Miche, v.

Which that cite
Of David fre
Confess to be
There unto set.
And that ye may
Now in your way
All your iournaye
The better make
I shall you tell
How ye may well
Of Christ so bell
True knowledge take.
The child swadled
Uilely clothed Luc. ii.

And reposed
In a maunger,
Shall ye there find
Yet let your mind
To him be kind
And soperseuer.
In pouerte
Though ye him se
Yet sure is he i, Tim, vi. Apoc. xvii. xix,

The lord of all
So to be borne
For you all lorne
He thought no scorn
As know ye shall.
He is of Mary
Borne so symply Math. xi.

That ye boldly
Should to him come,
If he did wear
All pryncelyke gear
So would ye fear
This his kingdom.
But poor I wys
Become he is
That you by this
May be rytched,
His pouerte ii, Cor, viii.

Makes you to be
Both rytche and fre
Undaungered.
Be not therefore
Dysmaied the more
Because in store
He has such need,
True zachary
Did prophecy zach. ix.

Of his penury
In very deed.
And that ye may
Know that I say
To be true always
And without lie,
With me that bring
This glad rydyng
Ye shall hear sing
Angels many.
The song of thangels.
Praise and glory
To God on high
And peace truly Luc. ii.

On earth mortal,
To men again
A good will plain
Moughte be certain
Perpetual.

The Shepherdes. O heavenly noise and plesaunte sight
O tidings full of all solace,
To gloryfie God it ^s right
From whom alone proceeds all grace.
The Ang^lles are now from us gone
Into heaven are they ascended, Luc, ii.

Through their tidings is all moan
Utterly from us excluded,
Uvhat than does there yet now remain
But that to Bethlem we make haste,
And with our eyes se the tidings certain
which God has showed us at the last.
Much are we bound undoubtedly
To this our lord omnipotent
Which of his great grace and mercy
Has these tidings unto us sent,
Greatly also before all other
Are we sheph rdes poor and miserable.
Bound to this our lord and maist^r
For these news sweet and confor^able,
He has not openned them to ^^nges
To Bishops, to Priests, to Lawers,
Nor yet to covetous worldlynges Math. xi. Esa. xxix. i, Cor, i, Iac. ii,

But to us simple and poor mysers,
To us to us which are counted
Uery slaves before the worlds sight,
Are these joyful news openned
To confoo^de the wicked worldlynges might,
The wicked worldlynges cannot abide
This our, new king the lord Ihesus,
For they reject and ^^st a side
Both him and his word as venomous.
Herod will persecute doubtless
Christ our king with great violence, Math. ii John^. xi. Act. iiii.

The Bishops, the Priests, the Pharisees,
will surely commytte no less offense.
The poor in spirit are fytte only
To receive Christ and his preaching,
The wise worldlynges count it folly
Any such news abroad to bring. Math, v. Math, xi.

In worldly goods is their delyght
Gorgious howses are their plesaunce
Sumptuousl^ before men's sight
To be decked is their pastaunce
Delicately also to fare
Is all their whole delectacion.
And on the world to cast their care Luc, xvi

Is their whole study and intencion.
These wicked worldlynges therefore
And belly Gods voluptuous.
Cannot away with Christ's lore John^. vii.

Although never so bounteous
For this cause has our lord God sent
To us shepherdes simple and rusticall,
These news so good so excellent.
Which shall bring great joy over all. Luc. ii.

Let us therefore without ^aryaunce
Go and vysite this our new king
That we may enjoy that plesaunte
which the Angel to us did bring.
Let us all with humble reverence
Go unto our true Messiah,
Beholding his royal presence
Although in a vile and homely place.
And though we have no worldly treasure
To offer to this our new king,
Yet let us bring hearts meke and pure
which shall be to him well pleasyng.
Hearts full of faith and charity
To Christ our king let us offer,
Beleuynge truly that this is he
which is our king and Redemer.
In him alone, in him alone
Let us put all our confidence,
Let us scake salvation at none
But only at his divine presence
Let us love him unfeignedly
With a true heart and faithful mind,
Seakyng evermore his glory
which is to us so gentle and kind.
To god the father omnipotent
which of his mere mercy and grace,
Has unto us this treasure sent
Let us live worthy his ayndnes
In all our life and conversation,
And such wise sake him to please
That we may ane the heavenly mansion.

AMEN.
Give the glory to God alone.
