messe^gere I Pray you all give your audyence.
And here this matter with reuerente
By figure a moral play
The somony^g of eueryman called it is
That of our lives and ending shows
How transytory we be all day
This matter is wondrous precious
But the intent of it / is more gracyous
And sweet to bear away
This story says man in the beginning
Look well and take good hode to the ending
Be you never so gaye.
ye think sin in the beginning full sweet
Which in the end causes thy soul to weep
When the body lies in claye
Here shall you se how felawshyp and solyte
Both strength / pleasure / and beauty
Will bade from the as flower in may
For ye shall here / how our heaven kenge
Calls eueryman to a general reckoning
Give audyens and here what he will say

God speaks. God. I perceive here in my majesty
How that all creatures / be to me unkind
Living without dread / in worldely prosperytye
Of ghostly sight / the people be so blind
Drowned in sin / they know me not for there god
In worldely riches is all their mind
They fere not my right wyllenes, that sharp tool
My law that I showed / when I for them dyed
They forgot clean / and sheddynge of my blood so read
I hanged between two thieves / it cannot be denied
To get them life I suffrede to be deed
I heled their fete / with thorns hurt was my heed
I could do no more than I did truly
And now I se the people do clean forsake me
They use the seven deedly sins dampnable
As pride / couetyse / wrath / and lechery
Now in the world be made commendable
And thus they leave of aungeles ye heavenly company
Eueryman lives so after his own pleasure
And yet of their life they be not sure
I se the more that I them forbere
The worse they are from year to year
All that lives apperyth fast
Therefore I will in all the haste
Have a reckoning of every man's person
For and I leave the people thus alone
In their life and wicked tempests
Verily they will be cume much worse than bestes
For now one would by envy another up ere
Charytye they all do clean forgete
I hoped well that eueryman
In my glory should make his mansyon
And thereto I had them all elect
But now I se that like traitors deiecte
They thank me not for the pleasure yt I to the^ me^t
Nor yet for their being that I them have lent
I proffered the people great multitude of mercy
And few there be that asks it hertely
They be so cumbred with worldly riches
That needs on them I must do justice
On eueryman living without fear
Where art thou death ye mighty messengere

Death. Almighty god I am here at your will
your commandment to fulfill

God. Go thou to eueryman
And show him in my name
Apylgrymage / he must on him take
Which he in no wise may escape
And that he bring with him a sure reckoning
Without delay or any taryenge

Death. Lord I will in the world go renouer all
And truly out search both great and small
Eueryman I will be set that lives beestly
Out of gods laws / and dredeth not folly
He that loves riches I will stryke with my darte
His sight to blind / and from heaven depart
Except that alms deeds be his good friend
In hell for to dwell / world without end
Loo / yonder I se eueryman walking
Full little he thinks on my cummynge
His mind is on flesshely lusts / and his treasure
And great pain / it shall cause him to endure
Before the lord heaven king
Eueryman / stand still / whether art yt going
Thus gayly Have thou thy maker forget

Eueryman. Why ask thou
Would thou were

Death. ye sir I will show you
In great have I am send to the
From god out of his majesty

eueryman What / send to me

Death. ye certainly
Though thou have forgete him here
He thinks on the in the heavenly spear
As or we depart thou shall know

every man What desires god of me

Death. That shall I show the
A reckoning he will needs have
Without longer respyte

every man To give a reckoning longer layser I crave
This blind matter trubleth my wit

Death. On the thou must take a long Journey
Therefore thy book of count with the thou bring
For turn again thou can not by no way
And look thou be sure of thy reckoning
For before god shalt thou answer and show
Thy many badde deeds and good but a few
How thou have speed thy life and in what wise
Before the chief lord of paradyse
Have a do that we were in that way
For were you well thou shalt make none attournay

every man Full vneedy I am such reckoning to give
I know the not what messanger art thou

Death. I am death that no man dredeth
For every man I rest and none spares
For it is gods commandment
That all to me should be obedyent

every man O death thou cu^mest what I had ye leeft in mind
In thy power it lies me to save
yet of my good will I give the if ye will be kind
ye a thousand pound shalt thou have
And dyfferre this matter till another day

Death. Every man it may not be by no way
I set not by gold silver nor richesse
Ne by pope / emperor / king / duke / ne princes
For and I would receive geftes great
All the world I might get
All my custom is clean contrary
I give the no respyte come hens and not tarry

every man Alas shall I have no longer respyte
I may say death gives no warning
To think on the it makes my heart secke
For all unready is my book of reckoning
But.xii. year and I might have a bydynge
My countynge book I would make so clear
That my reckoning I should not need to fere
Wherefore death I pray the for gods mercy
Spare me till I be provided of remedy

Death. The avails not to cry weep and pray
But have the lightly that you were gone ye Iournaye
And prove thy friends if thou can
For weTe you well the tide abides no man
And in the world each living creature
For adams sin must dye of nature

eueryman Death if I should this pilgrimage take
And my reckoning surely make
Show me for saint charity
Should I not come again shortly

Death. No eueryman and thou be ones there
Thou must never more come here
Trust me verily

eueryman gracyous god in hye sete celestyall
Have mercy on me in this most need
Shall I have no company fro this vale terestyall

Death. Of mine aqueyntaunce that way me to lead
ye if any be so hardy
That would go with the / and bear the cumpany
Hye the that you were gone to gods magnyfycens
Thy reckoning to give before his presence
What / wenest thou thy life is given the
And thy wordely gooddes also

every man I had wend so verily

Death. Ney nay / it was but lend the
For as soon as thou art go
Another a while shall have it / and than go therfro
Even as thou have done
Eueryman thou art mad / yt have thy wits five
And here on earth / will not amend thy live
For suddenly I do cume.

every man Do / wretched caytyfe whether shall I flee
That I might escape this endless sorrow
Now gentle death spare me till to morrow
That I may amend me
With good aduysemente.

Death. Nay thereto I will not consent
Nor no man will I respyte
But to the heart suddenly I shall smite
Without any aduysement
And now out of sight I will me hye
Se thou make the ready shortly
For thou may say this is the day
That no man living may escape away

every man Alas I may well weep with syghes deep
Now have I no manner of cumpany
To help me in my journey / and me to keep
And also my writing is full unready
Now shall I do now / for to excuse me
I would to god I had never be get
To my soul a great profit it had be
For now I fere pains huge and great
The time passes / lord help that all wrought
For though I mourn it aualeth naught
The day passes / and is almost ago
I wot not well what to do
To whom were I best my complante to make
What and I to felawshyp thereof spoke
And showed him of this sudden chance
For in him is all mine affyaunce
We have in the world so many a day
Be good friends in sport and play
I se him yonder cartaynely
I trust that he will bear me cumpany
Therefore to him will I speak to ease my sorrow
Well met god felawshyp and good morrow.

Felawshyp speaks. Felawe. Eueryman good morrow by this day
Sir why lokest thou so pyteously
If any thing be amys / I pray the me say
That I may help to remedy

every man ye good felawshyp ye

Felawe. My true friend / show to me your mind
I will not forsake the / unto my lives end
In the way of good cumpany

every man That is well spoken and louyngly

Felawe. Sir I must needs know your heaviness.

If any have you wronged ye shall revenged be
Though I on the ground be slain for the
Though that I know before that I should dye

every man Verily felawshyp gramercy

Felawe. Tusshe / be thy thanks I set not a straw
Show me your grefe / and say no more

every man if I my heart should to you break
And than you to turn your mind from me
And would not me comfort / when you here me speak
Than should I ten times soryer be

Felawe. Sir I say as I will do in deed

every man Than be you a good friend at need
I have found you true here before

Felawe. And so ye shall evermore
For in faith and thou go to hell
I will not forsake the by the way

every man ye speak like a good friend / I believe you well
I shall deserve it and I may

Felawe. I speak of no deseruynge / by this day
For he that will say / and nothing do
Is not worthy with good company to go
Therefore show me the grefe of your mind
As to your friend most loving and kind

every man I shall show you how it is
Commanded I am to go a iournaye
A long way / herd and dangerous
And give a strayte count without delay
Before the hye Judge adonay
Wherefore I pray you / bear me company
As ye have promised in this iournaye

Felawe. That is matter in deed / promise is duyte
But and I should take such a vyage on me
I know it well it should be to my pain
Also it makes me aferde certain
But let us take council here as we can
For your words would fear a strong man

every man Why / ye said if I had need
ye would me never forsake / quycke ne deed
Though it were to hell truly

Felawe. So I said certeynly
But such pleasures be set aside / the sothe to say
And also if we took such a iournay
When should we cume again

every man Nay / nyuer again / till the day of dome

Felawe. In faith than will not I cume there
Who has you these tidings brought

every man In deed death was with me here

Felawe. No why god that all has bought
If death were the messengere
For no man that is living to day
I will not go that lothesom iournay
Not for the father that begat me

every man ye promised me other wise parde

Felawe. I wot well I said so truly
And yet / if ye will ete and drink and make good there
Or haunte to women / that lusty cumpany
I would not forsake you / while the day is clear
Trust me verily

every man ye thereto ye would be ready
To go to myrthe / solace / and play
your mind to folly will sooner aply
Than to beat me cumpany in my long journey

Felawe. Nay in good faith / I will not that way
But and thou will murdre / or any man kill
In that I will help the / with a good will

every man O that is a simple advise in deed
Gentle felawe help me in my necessytye
We have loved long and now I need
And now gentle felawshyp remember me

Felawe. Whether ye have loved me or no
By saint John^ I will not with the go

every man yet I pray the take the labor and do so much for me
To bring me forward for saint charity
And comfort me till I come without the town

Felawe. Nay and thou would give me a new gown

But and yt had tarried I would not a left the so
And as now god speed the in thy journey
For from the I will depart as fast as I may

every man. Whether away felawshyp / wylt you forsake me

Felawe. ye by my faye / to god I betake the

every man Farewell good felawshyp for the my heart is sore

Felawe. A dew for I shall never se the no more

every man In faith eueryman farewell now at the end
For you I will remember yt partynge is mourny^ge
A lack shall we thus depart in deed
O lady help without any more comfort
Lo felawshyp forsakes me in my most need
For help in this world whether shall I resort
Felawshyp here before with me would merry make
And now little sorrow for me does he take
It is said in prosperyte men friends may find
Which in aduersytye be full unkind
Now whether for socoure shall I flee
Sith that felawshyp has forsaken me
To my kynnesmen I will truly
Prayenge them to help me in my necessytye
I believe that they will do so
For kind will crepe where it may not go
I will go say / for yender I se them go
Where be ye now my friends and kynnesmen

Kynred. Here be we now at your commandment
Cosyn I pray you show us your intent
In any wise and do not spare

Cosyn. ye eueryman and us to declare
if ye be dysposed to go any whether
For wot ye well / we will live and dye to gyther

For over his kynne a man may be bold

every man Geamercy my friends and kynnesmen kind
Now shall I show you the grefe of my mind
I was commanded by a messengere
That is an hye kings chief offycere
He had me go a pilgrimage to my pain
But I know well I shall never cume again
Also I must give reckoning strayte
For I have a great enemy / that has me in wait
Which intends me for to hyndre

Kynred. What a count is that / which ye must render
That would I know

every man Of all my works I must show
How I have lived / and my days spente
Also of ill deeds / that I have used
In my time / sith life was me lent
And of all virtues / that I have refused
Therefore I pray you / go thither with me
To help to make mine accounte / for saint charytie

Cosyn. What to go thither / is that the matter
Nay eueryman I had lever fast breed and water
All this five year and more

every man Alas that ever I was borne
For now shall I never be merry
if that you forsake me

Kynred. A sir what ye be a merry man
Take good heart to you / and make no moan
But one thing I warn you / by saint Anne
As for me / ye shall go alone

every man My cosyn / will you not with me go

Cosyn. No by our lady / I have the crampe in my to
Trust not to me / for so god me speed
I will deceive you / in your most need

Kynred. It avails not us to tyse

She loves to go to festes / there to be nyce
And to dance / and a broad to sterte
I will give her leave / to help you in that iurnaye
If that you and she may agree

every man Nw show me the very effect of your mind
Will you go with me / or abide behind

Kynred. Abide behind / ye that will I and I may
Therefore farewell / till a another day

eueryman How should I be merry or glad
For fair promyses / men to me do make
But when I have most need / they me forsake
I am deceived that makes me sad

Cosyn. Cosyn eueryman farewell now
For verily I will not go with you
Also of my own / an unready reckoning
I have to accounte / therefore I make taryenge
Now god keep the / for now I go

every man A Jesus is all cume hereto
Loo / fair words makes fools feign
They promise / and nothing will do certain
My kynnesmen promised me faithfully
For to abide with me steadfastly
And now fast away do they flee
Even so felawshyp promised me
What friend were best me of to provide
I lose my time here longer to abide
yet in my mind a thing there is
All my life I have loved riches
If that my good now help me / might
It would make my heart full light
I will speak to him / in this dystresse
Where art thou my goods and riches.

Goods. Who calls me (eueryman) what have you haste
I lie here in corners trussed and pyled so hye
And in chestes I am locked full fast
Also sacked in bags / thou may se with thine eye
I cannot stere / in packes low I lie
what would ye have / lightly mesaye

every man Cume hither good / in all the have thou may
For of council I must desire the

Goods. Sir and ye in the world have trouble or aduersyte
Than can I help you / to remedy shortly

every man It is a another disease that greuyth me
In this world it is not / I tell so
I am send for another way to go
To gyne a strayte accounte general
Before the highest Iupyter of all
And all my life / I have had joy and pleasure in the
Therefore I pray the go with me
For perauenture thou may before god almighty
My reckoning help to clean and puryfye
For it is said ever among
That money makes all right / that is wrong

Goods. Nay eueryman / I sing a another song
I follow no man in such byages
For and I went with the
Thou should fare much the worse for me
For because on me thou did set thy mind
Thy reckoning I have made / blotted and blind
That thine accounte thou cannot make truly
And that haste thou for the love of me

every man That would grieve me full sore
When I should cum to that ferefull answer
Up let us go thither to gyther

Goods. Nay not so I am to bryttell I may not endure
I will follow no man one foot be thou sure

eueryman Alas I have the loved and had great pleasure
All my life days on good and treasure

Goods. That is to thy dampnacyo^ without lesynge
For my love is contrary / to the love everlasting
But if thou had me loved moderately during
As to the poor to give part for me
Than should thou not in this doloure be
Nor in this great sorrow and care

every man Lo now / I was deceived or I was ware
And all I may wit my spending of time

Goods. What wenest thou that I am thine

every man I had went so

Goods. Nay eueryman I say no
As for a while I was lent the
A season thou haste had me in prosperytye
My condycyons is man's soul to kill
if I save one / a thousand I do spyll
Wenest thou that I will follow the
From this world nay verily

every man I had wend otherwise

Goods. Therefore to thy soul good is a thief
For when thou art deed this is my guyse
A another to deceive in the same wise
As I have done the / and al to his souls reprefe

every man O false good cursed thou be
Thou traitor to god / thou have deceived me
And caught me in thy snare

Goods. Mary thou brought thy self in care
Where of I am glad
I must needs laugh / I cannot be sad

every man A good thou have had my heartily love
I gave the that which should be the lords above
But wylt thou not go with me in deed
I pray the truth to say

Goods. No so god me speed
Therefore farewell and have good day

every man O to whom shall I make my moan
For to go with me / in that heavy iournaye
First felawshyp / he said he would with me go
His words were very plesaunte and gaye
But afterward he left me alone
Than spoke I to my kynnysmen all in despair
And also they gave me words fair
They lacked no fair speaking
But all forsake me in the ending
Than went I to my goods that I loved best
In hope to have cumforte / but there had I leest
For my goods sharply did me tell
That he brings many in hell
Than of my self I was a shamed
And so I am worthy told blamed
Thus may I well my self hate
Of whom shall I now council take
I think that I shall never speed
Till that I go to my good deed
But able she is so weke
That she can no there go nor speak

For of the blessed sacraments pure and benynge
He bears the keys and thereof has he cure
For man's redempcyon it is ever sure
Which god for our souls medycyne
Gave us out of his heart with great pyne
Here in this transytory life / for the and me
The blessed sacraments seven there be
Baptym / confyrmacyon / with pryesthode good
And ye sacrament of godds precious flesh and blood
Marriage the holy extreme vnccyon and penance
These.vii. be good to have in remembrance
Gracyous sacraments of hye dyuynyte

every man Feign would I receive that holy body
And mekely to my ghostly father I will go

v. wits. Eueryman that is the best that ye can do
God will you to salvation bring
For good pryesthod excedeth all other thing
To us holy scripture they do teache
And conuerteth man from sin heaven to reche
God has to them more power given
Than to any angel that is in heaven
With.v. words he may consecrate
Gods body in fresshe and blood to make
And handeleth his maker between his hands
The pryest byndeth and unbinds all bands
Both in earth and in heaven
Thou mynysters all the sacrementes seven
Though we kiss thy fete thou were worthy
Thou art surgyon that cures sin deedly
No remedy we find under god
But all only pryesthode
Eueryman god gave pryest that dygnyte
And sets them in his stead among us to be
Thus be they above angels in degree

Knowledge If pryestes be good it is so surely
But when Jesus henge on ye cross with great smarte
There he gave out of his blessed heart
The same sacrament in great tourment
He sold them not to us that lord omnipotent
Therefore saint Peter the apostle does say
That Jesus curse has all they
Which god their savior do bye or sell
Or they for any money do take or tell
Sinful pryestes gives the sinners example bad
Their children sytteth by other me^nes fyres I have herd.
And some haunteth women's company
With unclean life as lusts of lechery
These be with sin made blind

v. wits. I trust to god no such may we find
Therefore let us pryesthode honor
And follow their doctrine for our souls socoure
We be there sheep and they shepeherdes be
By whom we all be kept in suertye
Peace for yender I se eueryman cume
Which has made true satysfaccoon

Good ded Me thinks it is he in deed

every man Now Ihesu christ be your alder speed
I have received the sacrament for my redempcyo^
And thou mine extreme vnccyon
Blessed be all they that counceyled me to take it
And now friends let us go without longer respyte
I thank god that ye have tarried so long
Now set each of you on this rod your hand
And shortly folwe me
I go before there I would be / god be our guide

Strength Eueryman we will not from you go
Till ye have gone this vyage long

Descressio^ I dyscressyon will bide by you also

Eueryman I will be as sure by the
As ever I did by Judas machabe

every man Alas I am so faint I may not stand
My lymmes under me do fold
Friends let us not turn again to this land
Not for all the worlds gold
For into this cave must I crepe
And turn to the earth and there to sleep

Beautye. What into this grave alas

every man ye there shall you consume more and less

Beautye. And what should Ismoder here

every man ye be my faith and never more appear
In this world live no more we shall
But in heaven before the highest lord of all

Beautye. I cross out all this / adewe by faynte John^
I take my cap in my lap and am gone

every man What beautye whether will ye.

Beautye. Peace I am defe / I look not behind me
Not and thou would give me all the gold in thy chest

every man Alas whereto may I trust
Beautye goes fast away and from me
She promised with me to live and dye

Strenght Eueryman I will the also forsake and deny
Thy game lyketh me not at all

every man Why / than ye will for sake me all
Sweet strength tarry a little space

Strength Nay sir by the rode of grace
I will hye me from the fast
Though thou weep till thy heart brast

every man ye would ever bide by me ye said

Strength ye I have you far enough conuayed
ye be old ynought I understand
your pilgrimage to take on hand
I repent me that I hither came

every man Strength you to dysplease I am to blame
Will you break promise / that is debt

Strenght In faith I care not
Thou art but a fool to complain
you spend your speech and waste your brain
Go thryst the into the ground

every man I had wend surer I should you have found
He that trusts in his strenght
She him deceyueth at the length
Both strength and beautye forsakes me
yet they promised me fair and louyngly

Descressio^ Eueryman I will after strength begone
As for me I will leave you alone

every man Why descressyon will ye forsake me

Discressio^ ye in faith I will go from the
For when strength goes before
I follow after evermore

every man yet I pray the for the love of the trynytye
Look in my grave ones pyteously

Descressio^ Nay so nigh I will not cume
Farewell euerychone

every man O all thing fails save god alone
Beautye / strength / and descressyon
For when death blows his blaste
They all run from me full fast

v. wyttis. Eueryman of the now my leave I take
I will follow the other for here I the forsake

every man Alas than may I wayle and weep
For I took you for my best friend

v. wits. I will no longer the keep
Now farewell and there an end

every man O Jesus help all has forsaken me

Good ded Nay eueryman I will bide with the
I will not forsake the in deed
Thou shalt find me a god friend at need

every man Gramercy good ded now may I true friends se
They have forsaken me euerychone
I loved them better then my good deeds alone
Knowledge will ye forsake me also

Knowledge ye eueryman when ye to death do go
But not yet for no manner of daungere

every man Gramercy knowledge with all my heart

Knowledge Nay yet I will not from hens depart
Till I se where ye shall become

every man Me thinks alas that I must be gone
To make may reckoning and my dettes pay
For I se my time is nigh spente away
Take example all ye that this do here or se
How they that I loved best do forsake me
Except my good deeds that bydeth truly

Good ded All ertly thing is but vanyte
Beauty strength and discrecyon do man forsake
Folysshe friends and kynnesmen that fair spoke
All flees save good deeds and that am I

every man Have mercy on me god most mighty
And stand by me thou mother and maid holy Mary

Good ded Fere not I will speak for the

every man Here I cry god mercy

Good ded Short our end and mynysshe our pain
Let us go and never come again

every man In to thy hands lord my soul I commend
Receive it lord that it be not lost
As thou me boughtest so me defend
And save me from the fendes boost
That I may appear with that blessed hooft
That shall be saved at the dome
(In manus tuas) of myghtes most
For ever (commendo spiritum meum)

Knowledge Now has he suffered that we all shall endure
The good deeds shall make all sure
Now has he made ending
Me thinks that I here angels sing
And make great Joy and melodye
Where every man's soul shall received be

Angel. Cume excellent elect spouse to Jesus
Here above thou shall go
By cause of thy synguler virtue
Now thy soul is taken thy body fro
Thy reckoning is crystal clear
Now shall thou into the heavenly spear
Unto the which all ye shall cume
That lives well / before the day of dome.

Doctoure This memoryall men / may have in mind
ye herers take it of worth old and young
And forsake myde / for he deceyueth you in ye end
And remember beautye / five wits / strength / and discressio^
They all at ye last / do eueryman forsake
Save his good deeds / there does he take
But beware / for and they be small
Before god / he has no help at all
None excuse may be there / for eueryman
Alas how shall he do than
For after death / amends may no man make
For than mercy and yet ye does him forsake
If his reckoning be not clear / when he do cume
God will say (ite maledicti in ignem eternam.
And he that has his accounte hole and sound
Hye in heaven / he shall be crounde
Unto the which place / god bring us all thither
That we may live / body and soul to gyther
Thereto help the trynytye
Say ye for saint charytye.
