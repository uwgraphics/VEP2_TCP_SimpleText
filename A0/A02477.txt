Horatius. Aetas parentum peior auis, tulit
Nos nequiores, mox daturos
Progeniem vitiosiorem.
Well get thy goods, and spend them well:

Beware of hoorde, hoorde hate does bring,

To the high and Honorable, and his especial good Lord, Lord Robert Dudley,
Earl of Leycester, Baron of Denbigh, and Knight of the most noble order of the
Garter, high Steward of her Majesty's Burrow of new Windsore, Edw, Hake,
vndersteward there, wishes daily preservation with increase of honor to Gods
glory.
Since grace has graffed in your Noble breast,
Far grater gifts then tipe of mundane gle^:
Since high renown, your Honor, and the rest,
To Virtue yield, and counteruayled be
With great effect of Virtues worthy view:
I make it bold for virtues aid to sew.
And though my gift (as slender to the shoe)
Unworthy seem to shrowde himself as now^
In blessed Bay from force of deadly foe:
Yet Virtue may your Lordships pity bow
To fense the Book beset with deadly hate,
For that the same explanes the present state,
And sets to view the vices of the time
In Novel Verse and Satyrs sharp effect
Still drawn along and pend in playnest rhyme
For sole intent good living to erect:
And sin rescinde which rifely reigns abroad
In peoples hearts full fraught with sinful load,
Since so (I say) therefore your Noble heart
Let grace so guide and bend to Virtues bayte,
That Satirs these (though seeming somewhat tart)
May shielded be from such as lie in wait
The same to shend and bring to foul decay:
To deadly shame, and mortal malice aye.
So shall your Lordship show your self to be
Sole virtues stay, and friend unto the good:
So hate to sin shall men apparaunt see,
And love set forth to save the sinful blood.
And so shall I encouragde in my pain,
Proceed, and set my Pen to Book again.
And ever pray the living God of might
Your Lordship so to guide by gift of grace,
That you may stand accepted in his sight
Whilst here you live, and in the end a place
Receive with such as virtues path have traste:
And live with them that virtue have imbraste.
Your Lordships most humbly at commaundment. Edw. Hake.

To the Gentle Reader.
IT pleases the Printer, (Gentle Reader, as thou seeist) after twelve years
scilence, to hale again into the light, this my little book of english
Satyrs, which else might have soonge unto it self, ^cce nunc in puluere
dormio: what his gain shall be, I know not: and I am persuaded, that gain is
not the only, no nor the chiefest end he respects. But on the other part
what I shall gain that am the Author of the book, none can be so ignorant, but
he may easilye guess. Once, money I gain none at this time, either for
writing altering or correcting of the same: and hereof I stand so clear, that
both I and my book may be bold to exempt our selves from the reach of mine
own Argument which consists in the reproouing of those who (by male engine)
lie in wait for sir Nummus. And thus much be spoken to prevent the obprobry and
reproach that this way might be raised against me.

As for praise and commendation, if the sharpnes of my Satyrs were not matter
sufficient to settle me against the expectation thereof: yet I am not so far
from Judgment I thank God, but that I know (in part) what is lackinge (as well
in the invention as in the verse of the book,) that should carye away
commendation amongst the better sort of english Poets of our time: And
indeed, it is a matter that I strive nothing at all to attain unto:

For if I did, I would frequent the means, which are reading and practice,
neither whereof, I have been acquainted with to any purpose since the first
three years which I spent in the Innes of Chauncery: being now above a dosen
of years passed. And so long is it since these Satyrs were first made and
set forth, even (as I may say) in my childishe years, whereof
notwithstanding very little or nothing I repent me. Only I wish that all
that I have written and published heretofore were by me reuised, and that I
might have lycense and laysure to run them over again, hereby to make them a
little more substanciall if my habilitye served thereto: which being once done
and performed, how forward I would be from thensfoorth in setting forth of
books, should appear unto the world by the continuance of my silence. For
(to speak a truth) it is not meet we should cloye the world with to many
books of weak handling: especially, whiles the learned travails and
profitable labors of worthy writers are feign to keep the door (as I may
term it) or, which is more, to lie buried in silence.

But touching this my book: I have not abridged it of any one Satyr that was
in the first edytion thereof, neither have I added unto it any other whole
Satyr: But I have enlarged here and there one, and have corrected yt whole
book in many places. I confess I could have been wylling to have increased
the number by ij. or iij. Satyrs at the least: Namely of vndershreeues and
Baylliffs one: And of Informers and Sompners or Apparitours other two. Which
officers (if they all so be) how they abuse the Subjects and people of this
Realm at this day, by intolerable Extortions bryberies trecheries and
deceyts, what whole Shier, and in every Shier, what City Town or Uillage, is
not hable haboundauntly to declare? But these, together with the exquisite
handling of mine allowable Argument, I must be contented to omit, as neither
having laysure, nor (through want of laysure) skill sufficient to accomplish
the same: For I tell you, it is no matter of mean ymportaunce, first to
search and syfte owte the wrenches and wyles, shyfts, practices and deceytes
that the lewd sort of this people (which I fear me are the greater number of
them) do use to get money with. And then having so searched and syfted them
owte from nooke to crook, to set forth the same in apt and convenient
discourse:

For which causes (gentle Reader) be contented and afford me thine indyfferent
Judgment in this that I have already done: And if thou find therein any
matter or reprehension more fytte to have been handled by men of grauer Censure
and more agreeable calling: Forasmuch as it reaches no farther then to the
reproving of vice, and the same also written in that age of mine, when as vice
(without the grace of God) might rather have drawn me to her league, then
have had me for her enemy: I think thou may well enoughe (without
endaungeringe of Justice) assent to my request, and so I hope thou wylt do.
Fare well.

QVarit opes hominu^ men's improba, querit honores:
Sed quid diuitiae? quid decus omne valent?
Insidiis quaeruntur opes, quaeruntur honores:
Ista breui fugiunt, and peritura volant.
Perge tuos igitur foelici tramite gressus:
Sistere ne retrahat Zoilus istud opus.
Insidias ostende virum, quos nulla mouere
Heu pietas poterit: queis pador omnis abest.
Sic tu Nestoriae traduces stamina vitae
Hake, tuam famam sydera summa canent.
The same to the City of London.
A Great conquest of sin has made
a Student Edward Hake.
O London learn for to beware,
from sin arise and wake.
Of wanton Maids he did also,
the slights a late detect:
Learn to be wise, and look to them,
the worst always suspect.
He has redusde to vulgar tongue
the Imitation true
And following of our Captain Christ,
good living to renew.
A Touchestone for the present time
he eke set forth of late,
Wherein the ruynes of the Church
with zeal he does debate.
A brief memorial of our Queen
^ and of her blessed reign
He also wrote in dew discourse
first once and then again.
At length these news are now come forth
wherein thy sins he shows.
Repent (therefore) and call for grace
of God each thing that knows.
FINIS.
The Author to the Carping and scornful Sicophant.
AS plated Finne of slender slycing Oar
Wherewith the Seaman cuts the crooked wa^e,
Is scant of force tattaine the happy shore
When check of tide back bears the mighty Naue:
So I (no less) long lodgde on mounting surge,
Was kept aloof by cankerd caytifes gurge.
Though true intent did slyce the stream so swift,
Sea beaten Barck could scantly yet obtain
The shore till now: by subtle Zoyls drift
And Uipers tongue that beat my Boat amain.
What then? perforce, and maugre Momus head,
I skyp on Stroud, as free from dangers dre^d.
Let Sicophaunts and Minotaurus brood.
Let Ciclops Feere, and subtyle Ciren Hagges,
With grinning Jaws and gasping gyddy mood
Go shake their ears, and shut their shameless bags.
I force them not, nor Neutrall, Papist, nor
Uile Janus Jacks: their league do I abhor.
Thou Papist, thou, false hearted to thy Prince,
That wouldste bereave her grace of princely power,
To thee I say that checking, do convince
(As seems thee) my poynaunt poor deuowre:
For that thou deemst me dampened by thy doom,
Stand back sir Brock, let Bandog take thy room.
Shall brockysh Badger bear as now the sway,
Or Shepherdes Dog that brings in the Sheep?
Shall wooluish mates that wont the same to slay,
Rebuke the Whelpe? no, no, take thou no keep.
To my poor power isle barck thee from the fold,
And shepherdes shall rehayte thee to thy hold.
Wherefore, withdraw thy raging spoil by day
And see thou lurck (at least) within thy cave
While Sun to up, for fear of Hunters pray:
What time thy craft is not of force to save.
And eke at night, beware ift be thy hap,
And keep thy foot from slipping Hunters trap.
And now to thee thou double faced drudge,
That plyes thy self so plyaunt unto change,
And under hand dooste bear thy face so Budge:
Thou Time sclaue thou, y^ say my pen does raunge:
To thee I say (for that thou moanst my case)
Restrain thy tongue, least I descry thy face.
Thy hooded head that does two faces bear,
I see how closely underhand it nods,
And triple tongue that byds me ware this gear,
Least change should come. But twene us.ij. be ods,
And therefore (Janus) once again I say,
Go charm your tongue, least I take hood away,
And last of all, I turn my tale to thee,
Thou Nunquam sanus vile reproachful mate
And carping careless cankerd churl, whom he
That writes each where, reproues with worthy hate.
For that thou belkst with belly bursten paunch,
Against them that haps from idle shore to launch.
To thee, to thee my flytting Muse auerres,
And bound by Oathe of Faith, I do auowe
That neither hate nor harbraynd toy inferres
This work of mine which I do publysh now.
Nor meede at all, though where it brings gain,
It pleases some for to requite my pain.
For well thou wotste, if thyrsty were my mind
To bend the same to win by gaynsome trade,
Then would I write the thing that Authors find
A gain within: and whereby Sommes be made,
I mean vain ^estes to stir up filthy game.
But I protest my heart does has the same
And only seeks how to sequester sin,
And Satan's dryfts that drive men down to hell:
My thoughts be clear, my conscience clean within.
Thus knows God, that each ones thought can tell.
Wherefore, beware and let thy carping lie.
Else, sure my pen my gyltlesse heart shall try.
And to conclude, to all that wysh me well,
And love by tongue, do utter to my fate,
I make request that rancour they depell
And let their verdict to the Truth give place.
Else, let them cease to bear of friend the name.
For I refuse to take them for the same.
Once (sure I am) with quipping querks herein,
I have not meant to taunt, or check the good,
Nor (railing bent) I slanders do begin:
Though truth I say, to such as will be wood.
For gyltie man finds each thing to his shame.
Where good men can their own offenses blame.
But well, for fine and final end I say
To all such Snakes as styng by stealing pace
And boughing Curs that barck and wind away,
I hold it best that they no more deface
An open truth: For then, as they deserve,
Enbarckt I lie to launch when time shall serve.

The Novelty of this Book.
SUch Novelty as time does bring,
I yield in meeter here:
Even news that to the Godly heart
may noisome news appear.
But yet what then? such is the state
of this our present time,
That now no day does pass without
some new devised crime.

The Glory of the Honorable, is the fear of God.
The Bear does bear me now in hand

The virtues of thy worthy mind,
shevve forth the gifts of grace.


The first Satyr.
AS late I walked up and down, Auct^or.

in Pawles for my repast,
And there (as many wont to do)
about the Church had traste
Long time alone to view the route,
and great confused noise,
With pleasant that (a world to se^)
at length I heard a voice.
And casting back mine eye, I spyde
a pretty wymble lad,
Who saluing of his mate, did ask
what news were to be had.
His fellow (like a gentle swain,
and to ly headed child)
Conjoined ^andes, and sighing, said
a slave has me beguilde,
But scarcely had he spoken this,
or ear his faithful feere
Fast claspte his arm, and him besought,
to be of better cheere^
And let not chance (quoth he) afright,
nor so molest your mind,
As thus to seem a Wight that has
his woonted joy resygnde.
Tell tell, quoth Bertulph Bertulph.
(so be bight)
By whom you are beguylde
And eke what cause and cruel chance
your comfort has exylde.
O friend (said Paul Paul.
) full soon would I
express to thee my grief,
But so peruersely falls it forth
that I see no relief.
But yet since thou so urgent art
and earnest of the case,
I grant thereto if thou attend
and walk about the place.
Content is pleased, quoth Bertulph tho,
and then they walckte yfeere,
And I perceiving all their talcke, Aucthor.

approc^ed very near:
And joining close unto their side,
I walckt with equal pace
(Without offense as I suppose
their talcke had such a grace.)
Then Paul began with visage pale Paul.

and hands conjoined fast,
To settle forth him self to speak,
and thus be spoke at last.
The highest God that fyttes above
For aye in heavenly Throne,
That Prince of might that rules she hea^uens
and Welkin weeldes alone,
He knows if I do falsely speak,
or (moved through affect)
If I through hate or favor, lie
in any one respect.
But first, before my tale begin,
I Will tell you how the slave
Has many one beguyled erst
that sought the same to have.
His name also I will not stick
to tell you with the rest.
And to be short, He Nummus hight
(a passing proper guest,)
He lodges often with Marchauntmen
and eke with men of Law,
And lightly where he hosteth, there
are people kept in awe.
I Will eke declare how that as he
does often men beguyle,
Even so him self is often caught,
with fraud and filthy wyle.
And how often times by force they wrest
and wring him to their hands
And how from fools he often flies
and breaks his tynsell bands,
Now, whiles y^ Paul was speaking thus, Aucthor

his mate began me espy.
He knew my mind, I gave a beck,
he wynked with his eye
And held his finger on his mouth,
suspecting sore the man:
He thought that fancies fed his brain,
his visage lookte so wan
And word^s so void of woonted sense.
But yet (for that he hight,
And promisde had to hear the end)
his he^t he kept aright.
And forth proceeded Paul at large. Paul.

This Nummus now (quoth he)
Is straightly watchte, and hardly kept
with men of each degree.
He wants none to wait for him,
although he escaped from me.
The Laytie and the Clergy both,
if ^aply him they see:
Will talk with Vobis ear he part,
they will pluck a Crow with him.
They Will shut him up, or send him forth,
seem greater gain to win.
Or else to work their neighbors woe,
by wagin^^ suits at Law,
To bring them selves in prease and price,
and to be had in awe.
But as for Clergy, Clergy.
some of them,
they know his nature well,
They know his false corrupting force,
with him they will not mell,
Except it be where need requires,
and for a just intent.
And surely some, though not the swaye,
right so to gain are bont.
Although that some again do seek
excessiuely the same,
And some do hoorde it up in store,
to their rebuke and shame.
But (if I should uprightly speak)
Their lyuinges are so lopt,
That from the inferior Clergy men,
long since sir Nummus hopt*
I mean not pompous Prelates here,
nor Chaplens of degree.
These flaunting fellows by your ^^^ue,
will haat ift had may be
I mean, I mean poor Ministers,
some plaste and some dispersed*
Whom powling Patrons and such like,
have grievously amerst.
And yet forsoothe our Baldockes bleate,
and say they keep no cheer.
They catch sir Nummus from them still,
and yet would have him here.
But well they are no small fools now*
that rob the Clergies meede.
Wherefore to silence were I best,
such words may rancor breed.
And here you must aduert it well,
that justly men may seek
For Nummus to relieve their need,
if so their fancy leeke.
And also bow that they right well
the same may still retain,
So that they do not ^oord him up
for sole intent to gain.
But such as I shall here recite,
cannot without offense
The same or seek, or keep, or spend
what so be their pretense.
Because their minds are all perverse:
they spend for spyte or gain:
And through the lust of lawless boorde,
the same do they retain.
And what are they that seek it so?
Even most men now a days.
In Country, City and each where
they find sinister ways
T'obtaine the same, and spend it ill,
or else to keep it worse:
And ever aye their minds are bent
to fill their farsed Purse.
But now, for that the scope is large
where we may find them out,
And time but short, I rather mean
to leave the Country rout,
And meddle with our Townish lade
in London sole precinct,
Except (as need) the Suburbs must
be with the City Linckt.
Whereas, when I have reckned up
of them the most estates,
Then tell how many kinds of folcke
ne live within the rates
And bounds of honest seeking store.
of spending well the same,
Of closely couching up their hoord
as bedlem bugs to tame.
Why sir (quoth Bertulph) now me thinks Bertulph.

you talk not of the man
That seru'de you of that sluttish touch
of late I wot near when.
O Friend (quoth Paul) is this the faith Paul.

and this thy late behest?
I stickt not to begin my tale
at thy alone request:
And thou therefore did promise me
thy silent ear to give.
And yet thou interruptst my tale.
How should I thee believe?
Of friendly faith attend a while,
and mark me to the end:
Then shall thou think that I disclose
to thee as to a Friend.
Finis.
The second Satyr.
AS promise presses me to show Pa^^.

my mind to thee at large:
Even so t'obserue due order is,
belonging to my charge.
(...) therefore (first) how Nummus does
beguile each kind of men:
How it through force and vile effect
does noisome humor blen:
His beauty (first) and pregnant show,
and then his mighty force,
Enchaunteth so the peoples hearts:
that (void of all remorse)
They fawue and (...) watch and pry,
they leaze and off for wear,
They work the t^ing that wicked is,
they curse, they ban and tear
The blessed name of great Iehoue,
and all to win the (...)
They put (...) they practice still
to get the golden^ame.
And first behold our men of low:
let them have chiefest place, (...)

Since by the laws (...) comm^n weath
does run his (...)
And for that Laws accoumpted are,
each where the chiefest stay:
Let Lawiers then be principal,
and first within my play.
But as for Judges now to judge, Judges.

my judgment will nor say:
I wot full well, their praise was spread
by me this other day.
And Truth it is, our Judgment seats
such Uyrent beads possess,
As former days for men of choice,
had never such I guess.
What then? no sort, no one degree,
no place, no function so
Uprightly stands, but with the good
some wicked weed does grow.
With virtues league, some vice does lyuk
and form of godly v^w
Often equal makes with men of troth,
some Hypocrites untrue.
I know friend Bertulph, s^we there be
whose hands regard no meede,
Whose hearts Dye no deceypt at all,
from whom no harms proceed.
And sure I am, when cause of troth,
before such men is tryde,
With simple troth, they Justice yield,
and justly do decyde.
But now, although with these there sit
no one that does dissent
Though all of them in publicque place
do sing Amesine lentent
Yet vnderhande perhaps there are
that now and then denoure
The sugared sap that Justice yeeldes:
And where they list to lowre
For spyte or gain, or private wreke,
there Justice course is stayde.
And where they list to smoother troth,
there, right is clean dismayde.
Such such there be (or have bin some)
who when they rule alone,
When scope and course has hoyst them up
and set them chief in Throne
From Censors sight, and private made
their swaye and supreme place:
Then then they wring and wrong the right,
then then they truth deface.
Ah Bertulph, be there not think you,
In place of Justice set
Some fained sorts of fawning Spreetes
that course of Justice letts?
That frame a semblaunce sound and good,
that just and holy seem,
and yet in heart are fraught with guyle,
and often unjustly deem?
I fear I fear me falsehod lurkes
in lappes of learned syse
I fear me Nummus often peruerts
in some that go for wise:
So then, some chief and some besides
so smally ponder me^de,
That where they sit in common swaye,
there, Justice does proceed.
But some again where place has made
their powers distinct, I fear
Of popish wills, through grut^h or gain
with much enorme do bear.
And hence, from hence I fear me come
these cries of common sort
That often lament and often affirm
their Judgment to be ^ort.
One here be wayles his woeful case
and wishes him unborn,
Another cries with wringing hands,
alas, I am forlorn
My suit thus long depended has:
The Law is on my side,
And yet in hard delays I lie
true Judgment to abide.
Another thus: be friended is,
the Judge does love him well
And me (as poor and needy) they
do daily thus depell
Two hundredth miles and more I come:
My Wife at home (alas)
Lies with my Children half forepynde:
(O lamentable case.)
My goods are spent, which labor brought,
through long and careful toil:
The Law has lyckt up all my wealth
for which I did turmoyle.
Oh, I can have no Law nor right,
ne Money have I now:
I must go beg, my goods be gone,
to live I know not how.
These ears of mine abhorred have,
mine eyes have wet my plants.
My heart has ye^nd in Judgment true,
to see such woeful wants.
Tys hard to say, I Will hold my peace.
But if these playnts be true,
Sir Nummus swayeth there with some,
(a worthy cause to rue.)
But unto him that highest syts,
and sees each secret ill,
With prayer I commytte the same,
t'amende it at his will.
And now to Lawiers that do parle, Practisers at the Law.

and plead in cause of right.
To such as for sir Nummus will
turn darkness into light,
And light into obscured sense,
and arsiuersie turn each thing:
To such will I proceed as now,
and to my matter bring.
I will not speak of fine devise,
nor foul deceyptfull clause,
In Leases, wyls, and other like,
but wresting of the Laws
And foding of the Clyent forth:
for though that fraud abound,
And though by falsely framing so,
each where are beggars found:
Yet I as now will blason forth,
and give you well to see,
How these men join in matters false,
retained for a fee.
And so for N^mmus long delays
a poor and needy soul,
To fleese and slay the simple wretch,
to pylfer and to powle:
To shred him clean from all his wealth,
and then perhaps ^elent,
And ware full cold to aid his right,
when Nummus all is spent.
Yea likewise tys in doubt with some,
when Nummus so does fail,
If they through brybe of the other side,
let not the suit to quayle.
A Fee of Forma pauperis^
no no it has no sent.
Such formal Fees find small relief
they buy no land ne rent.
My friend (therefore) if you have naught
wherewith to see me still
But forms and shows, Take forms again
for Counsel if you will.
But what said I? was promise made
to paint such practice here?
No no: If so, I must relent:
Great matter does appear
Therein: and therefore will I leave
them to the worldly vewe:
I mean the false and subtle ones,
I speak not of the true,
Nor such as are affected well
(as many there are such
Although the false in number do
exceed them very much.)
But well, go too* this gotten good
how is it spent I pray?
Forsooth, no poor man must have land:
for so will they assaye
And practice, that in time they will
get all into their hands,
And turn the poor men headlong forth
of all both house and lands.
A shame it were and great reproach
to see a poor man dwell,
Or have a house not far from theirs:
their Noses hate the smell.
And long (no doubt) their Noses be,
right mischeuous of Sent:
For that which once was land demeas^e,
is holden now for rent.
They smell it forth, though far it be:
they have a vengeance hook:
Both Parsuage and ought besides
they will have by hook or crook.
Their Princely Places stately be,
their houses buylt for aye,
Their Turrettes up alo^t are raysde,
foundations deep they lay,
So thus (no doubt) and far more ill,
they let sir Nummus wagge,
Reserving still some mighty Mass
to rust within the bag,
And here you see what wait they lay
and eke what ways they use
To get this pelf: and gotten, see
how they the same abuse,
The next are Petypractisers Ano^^^^ and Petypractisers.

and Petyfogging mates^
Yea, Clerks, Attorneyes, such of them
as live of lewd debates,
Each honest calling toward Law,
so pressed is from Sise,
That hardly can an honest man
with honesty arise.
And twice as hardly may he stand,
to stop each strayned shyfte.
Such force has falsehood, more the^ truth,
so deadly can they lift.
What crewes of greedy griping crows,
what foul infecting rowte.
Good Lord, what store of gleaning Jacks
dispersed are through out?
Can Laws relief be easily got,
or gotten, cannot do ease,
Where such great troops of bribing fists
must first sir Nummus cease?
Of truth such ^^aines, of truthles mates
such heaps of monsters dwell
Tweene playnts and fynall Judgments seat,
that greater woes in hell
If hell were as the Poets write,
I think could not be felt.
Care S^les have end, such chardge, such toil,
as make my heart to melt.
But whence arise these ravening rowtes?
whence spring they? Sure from guyle
And of disdain to vulgar state,
wherein their Parents toil.
Well, these be they, that what for tale
and what for falsehod great,
Do taynt the Realm with stryfes, and stop
the way to Justice seat.
That make the juice of Justice sour,
that turn the Laws to wreake,
That make true Judgeme^t taste like gall,
that naught but falsehod speak.
That live and lustily lashe out
in purchase or in pride
More largely then of Country States
does any State beside.
But here to show what prowling means,
what pranckes this pylfring sort
Do use to get sir Nummus with,
and so hold up their port:
This this to do, were to to hard.
Nay, this were such a woorcke
As if one only man should prease
to fight against the Turcke.
But greater, yea far greater it were
to cleanse this Channel clean.
I think Augaeus Oxestalles were
to this a work but mean.
I know good Judges have begoonne
and waded very far
I know that some, to help these hurtes,
right godly careful are.
But new found Clerckes and Officers
so prease with might and main,
That ( Hydra like) one head cut of,
for eary head springs twain.
Good Lord, and shall these wandering Spreets
aye walcke abroad at will?
Shall Nu^mus no where start, but straight
these Catchpolles catch him still?
Shall no man's eye that lives this day,
behold a better state?
Ah, out alas, and shall this rowte
feed always of debate?
Why then, what man shall live in peace?
whose portion shall be fast?
Whose land and living shall be free
where these men once are plast?
And where almost, or in what Soil
do not these Monsters swarm?
What coast friend Bertulph can you name
where these men do not harm?
I know in thissame calling are
a sort of seemly Wights
That live in peace, and further peace,
that so their Country dights
With sound examples of good life,
with Justice and with truth,
That scarce from any state of men
a better life ensuth.
And in this speech of mine, I mean
and eke do comprehend
Not only Clerckes and Practisers
But also do intend
That Counsaylers have equal praise
and higher praise in deed
By how much they in higher place
and higher things proceed.
But these, all these are now so matched
and ouerswayde with swarms:
That seeld and seldom can they help
to keep the good from harms.
I wish to God some Theseus
might give a choppe or twain
And rather then these heads should stand,
to choppe and choppe again.
Now, whereas Bertulph here perhaps
you look I should declare
How this great Rabble rakes for coin,
and how they Nummus snare:
I tell you as I told you erst,
this is too much for me:
The pens of twenty skillful men
for this would needful be.
In brief, yet thus I dare affirm
that these superfluous traynes
In Lawyers state, use foul deceytes
t'inlarge their private gaynes,
Which gotten once, is lewdly spent
in pomp and proud array,
To whose foul rapine seely wightes
are often and often a pray.
I leave them as I left the rest,
I touch and go my ways.
This short discourse shows well enough
how here sir Nummus swayes.

And let us place them in the cue
amongst this greedy train.

take the second room,
for worthy so they be:
They stately stalcke, and bear a port
in London now we see.
With reverence and worship great,
with cap and eake with knee,
We must beseech his Maistership
our Patient to see,
And what of this? will this suffice?
No: Nummus does the deed,
Vnguentum Aureum or such like
will make him'runne with speed.
Go Simon go, or Gilbert else,
go cast my footecloth on?
No need to bid to Doctor go,
he will be gone anon.
And when he is there, with solemn face
and grave devised port
He frames his talk for to persuade
or else for to dehorte
As lykes him best: he both can do,
and both so finely frame,
That Nummus shall be nymmed straight,
O passing pretty game?
Who would not blushe to see such frawde,
and such fine framed knacks?
Who would not hate the falsehoode vile
of these so pieuish Jackes?
And (soothly if I should affirm)
I hear so much deceat
Of theirs in progging after gain,
as tongue can not repeat.
And (as of course) I do demand
how they do spend the same?
Forsooth, I hear no good they do:
No man can justly blame
Or ought accuse them of good deeds.
But this my self can say,
That most thereof that I see spent,
is on apparel gaye.
For but of late, ene thus I heard
a worthy Doctor say:
My matters frame not as I would,
I Will work some other way.
I see these weeds be not to wear.
I Will henceforth so provide,
That I will have a pretty Nagge
about the Town to ride.
I Will have a footecloath, and each thing
belonging to the same:
My fellow Doctor has the like,
and passing flies his name.
A Gown with graundcape will I have,
a swinging Ueluet Cap,
A Coat according very brave:
and then ift be my hap,
With mighty looks, and learning such
as God has given me,
I Will hook sir Nummus to my hands,
and make the Ruddockes flee
For fear almost into my purse.
I Will leave my simple gate,
I Will rather frame my self to ride
like one of high estate.
And what? were these but scoffing words?
Yes sure, he (earnest bent)
Has so purueyde, that now he has
even all for that intent.
And thus you see with how great care
they seek to enrich their store,
You see the pride that they mayntaine
through this excessive lore.
And (well I wot) none other means
of spence at all I see,
But only such as wicked are:
(if any else there be.)
Wherefore, it seems they hoorde it up
and hyde it from the Sun:
They couer't close, and lock it fast
till more thereto be won,
They give small alms as I can hear,
for beggars barcke apace,
And say that they of all men woorst
relieve their woeful case:
Their pride is great, and high they look
for fear of waxing low:
They Will give no place to any man
where ere they hap to go.
I well record a pretty tale
alluding to a truth:
I force not much to tell it you.
Hark how the same ensuthe?
Once hapt it (through a foul mischance) A Ciuilian, or a Canonist, or both.

that great debate did rise
Between a Doctor in the Law
(for so the example lies)
And Doctor (eke) of Physic, who
should have the upper hand
In each assembly where they met
to walk, to sit or stand.
The Lawyer laid for him self
and said well to the case,
Physician did full wisely to
and with a goodly grace:
Alleging well (even both of them)
like handsome learned men.
But naught could be agreed upon.
So fell the matter then,
That they unto the Praetor would
for to decyde the same.
They made relation of the case
and finely began it frame.
The Praetor when he heard the dolts
contend about a Straw,
Was soon content to judge the same,
and askte the man of Law
Who went unto the Gallows first,
the Hangman or the Thief?
Who foremost was of both them two
and which was there the chief?
The Hangman quoth the Lawyer tho,
for he does kill the man:
The Hangman he must go before,
the Thief must follow* Than
Quoth Praetor hark. This is my mind
and judgment in the case.
Physician he must go before,
and Lawyer give him place.
Why then (quoth Bertulph) by your tale Bertulph.

Physicians men do kill.
And Lawyers live by robbing men,
and so their Cofers fill.
Whereby with pride emboste they swell,
and whereby (raging) they
T'advaunce themselves to honors type

Yea sure (quoth Paul) and so they do Paul.

But as for our Physicians,
their cunning knows how

as to purloyne:

And finest child in casting of

Although he live from that time long,

Heel make him doubt and dread his life,

O Paul, quoth Bertulph, give me leave
to interrupt you here.
For by your patience, isle requite
the tale you told while ere.
Content quoth Paul (and with good will)
I am right well apayde
To hear thy tale: my talk shall cease
till thou thy mind have said.
There dwelt (sometime) where I was born Bertulph.

a perfect cunning man,
A good Physician well beseene:
and so it happed than,
That he should ride abroad to see
a Patient of his.
He had a man that road with him
(a ioly Knave ywis.)
The Doctor drove his Horse apace
and road with merry cheer.
He longed sore to see the place
where Nummus should appear.
But as he pricked forth in haste,
by chance he did epsy
A sort of Felons in a Carte
adjudged there to die.
And musing what y^ prease should mean,
he sent his man with speed.
To know the cause of all the crowde:
his man performde the deed.
And posting, soon he did perceive
the Thieves to hanging pressed.
He turned his Horse at sight thereof:
To fly, he thought it best.
And so he did with sturdie pace,
He gallopt on his way.
And as a man half skarde, he fled
as naught might make him stay.
His Master lowdly askte the cause
why he did ride so fast.
O Master save your self (quoth he)
I vize you make good haste.
The Doctor swallowde up with fear,
spurde Cut and made away.
And till he came within a mile,
his Horse did never stay.
But when he came unto himself,
be called back his man
And him demanding cause of grief,
the fellow thus began.
O Master, thank we God (quoth he)
for this our good escape:
Else surely had we swinged both
within an hempen Tape.
For yonder, where the prease was so,
I saw three handsome men
Which for the death of only one,
were to be hanged then.
But when I saw that they (for one)
were all adiudgde to dye,
No need to bid me haste me thence,
no need to bid me fly:
For well I wist, if you were seen
which have a number slain,
You should have been trust up in haste
and near returnde again.
The Doctor being thus informde,
knew not what best to say.
He thought as chyldish him to take
and lightly him to way.
Wise man you are no doubt, (quoth he)
the Uicar of saint Fools
Go shriue you: for you have been taught
in some well learned schools.
Shrewde fool quoth Paul, I warrant you, Paul

but fools and children often
Do tell the truth: for all men know
their tongues are very soft.
But well, no doubt, yet some there be
in London (whom I know)
That both do get sir Nummus well,
and well the same bestow.
That lead no doubt a virtuous life,
and live in Godly fear:
That goods to get by means perverse
at all times will forbear.
Of those I have not talcked here,
nor of the honest sort.
But such as (galled) seem to kick,
herein I do exhort
To keep their patience when they see
their faults reproved here.
For sure I am that in my tale
against good does naught appear.
And so I leave them to the Lord,
and bid them all adue.
My tongue in order must record
such things as do ensue.

Lets see (I pray) how they turmoyle
and fix their whole intent
To catch sir Nummus by the coat.
Let Us see how they be bent
And sole addicted unto gain.

To Gynnie, Spain, and Calecut: Not the deed but the inte^^ is to be misliked.

As (there although it cost him small)

Yea, ten perhaps, or else they lie
which in such wealth abound.
Another skuds me ore the Seas,
and fully fraught with toys,
He brings them into London, where
a^length he wealth enioyes.
The people are so fondly bent,
they will change their Cheese for chalck.
And for such pelting pienish trashe,
the isle let good chaffare walck.
O foolish, ^ueros pue rilia decent.

oh men deuoyde of wit,
O Capons cramde with barley corn:
how far are stones unfit
For such pyld palting pieuish Cocks?
how ill bestowde is wealth
On such new fangled fondish foltes A Fool will not give his hable for the
Tower of London.

which change the same for pelth?
One bringes me ore a painted Priest,
another bringes a Nun,
And shops are fraught with toys, wherewith
are English people won.
Another grounded well in wealth,
(acquainted with the guyse)
Does bring us in such daynties, as
the man can best devise.
Some else there be, and many such
(chief Marchaunts in the Town)
That for our Peacocks plumes do bring
and sylcks the stream adowne:
They know the Laws do lymit where*
and what such should be worn,
And they such Laws to execute,
have eftsoons office borne.
And yet for that their gain is such
and wealth so great thereby,
They must forbear, and wincking walk.
The Laws must lawless lie:
And Uarlets vaunt about the streate,
like men of high estate:
Their Hosen strowting forth with silcke,
and plumes upon their pate.
The Raskalles now must roame abroad
like men of honest port:
And Strumpets stately in attire
like Ladies must resort
To places where them selves think best
without all kind of doubt:
They customde are about the Town
and shall be borne out.
It seems so undoubtedly:
for nothing is amended.
Although the Laws have sharply set
and punishment extended.
Now, other some vagaries fetch
abroad I wot ner where,
And they bring in most pleasant spice Such as bring them in for intent
aforesaid are to be blamed.

with Hops and other gear:
These make fine mouthed Gentlemen.
For who but Marchaunts now?
Who wallow more in wealth than they
like peers I wot ^er how?
Yea, I speak not of the trade but of the corruption of
who are they but Marchauntmen
that have the costly fare?
Who now in banquets with these men
are able to compare?
For such strange store of diverse meats the trade and abuse of the same.

and dishes finely wrought?
Who has the like? no man besides.
Welnigh it costs them naught.
They sell so dear and take such gain,
that well they may afoorde
To set fine Marchpanes and such like
upon their servant boorde.
Thus may we see these kind of men
how they for Nummus prodde:
A man would think that soothly they
take Nummus for a Godde.
They labor so with might and maine,
they so besturre their stumpes. Although they have money in such price, yet
evil gotten goods shall be ill spent.

They exercise such ackward ways
to bring it in by lumps.
They scratch, they scrape, they mise, they muse
at night when they should rest.
They search their senses and bethink
how to obtain it best.
And ah alas, some do devise
to let it out for gain:
Such gain as at the length will bring
to them infernal pain.
And (not content with foul deceyt
that they in sale do use)
Some of them do in lone alas
their countrymen abuse.
Let Preachers cry and tell them o^t,
but nothing will prevail:
They flock, they floute, and jest at it.
They bid them kiss their tail.
They have no shame, but (brazen fasde)
they stick not it to call A lament^^ble ca^^.

A gainesome Occupation.
And so the people fall
From honest state, to plain banckrowte
through such their Wooluish ways.
The Commons near were so oppressed
as in these woeful days.
They hook, they hawke for Nummus so,
they cogge, they foyst and powle,
They lay such snares by broking means,
that thus they Nummus towle.
A thousand means sinistre, they
account and call exchange,
Although thereby be men undone:
the case is very strange.
And woeful tys no doubt to see
how lightly they do way
The Account which must be made by them
to God another day.
They are right wise in worldly wit:
surpassing is their brain.
But oh, they do apply the same
to nothing else but gain.
And when they haat, how is it spent?
Attend a while, and you
Shall have it laid before your eyes
and set unto the view.
This day, my Lord his special friend
must dyue with him (no nay)
His Partners, Friends and Aldermen:
wherefore he must puruaye
Both Capon, Swan, and Her^shoe good,
fat Bit^ure, Larcke and Quayle?
Right Plouer, S^ype, and Woodcock fine
with Curlew, Wype and Rail:
Stoneti^ets, Teale, and Pecteales good,
with Busterd fat and plum,
Fat Pheasaunt Powt, and Plouer base
for them that after come.
Stent, Stockard, Stampine, Ta^terueale,
and Wigeon of the best:
Puyt, Partrich, Blackbirde and
fat Shoueler with the rest.
Two Warrants eke he must provide
to have some Uenson fat.
And means heel make for red Dear too,
(there is no nay of that.)
And needefully he must provide
(although we speak not o^t)
Both Peacock, Crane, and Turkicock,
and (as such men are wont.)
He must foresee that he ne lack
cold bakemeates in the end:
With Custards, Tarts, and Florentines,
the bancquet to amend.
And (to be short and knit it up)
he must not wanting see
Strange kinds of fysh at second course
to come in their degree.
As Porpesse, Seal and Salmond good
with Sturgeon of the best
And Turbot, Lobster, with the like
to furnish out the feast.
All this they will have, and else much more,
sides Marchpane and green Cheese,
Stewde wardens, Prunes, and sweet conserues
with spiced Wine like Lees.
Greeneginger, Sucket, Sugar Plate,
and Marmaladie fine:
Blauncht Almonds, Pears and Ginger bread.
But Pears should we assign
And place before (as meet it is)
at great men's boordes: for why,
Raw fruits are first in service still,
Else Serving men do lie.
But now me thinks, one quips me up
and spurs a question here.
He says (forsooth) that I mislike
to have men keep good cheer.
In deed, the stomach ouerchardgde
and man full gorgde with meat,
Does make the mind and inward man
unfit for reasons seat.
For change no doubt annoyes the man,
and meat not well indewde,
Does make the same scant half a man
it reason be renewde.
And what of this? should this reformde,
house keeping now depell?
No sure, for hospitality
becomth them very well.
But that this cheer is always such,
I plainly do deny.
Some feast great men for friendship sake,
and let the poor go by.
They rather doot to oppress the poor,
and by such friendship got,
The poor have naught within their hands
which they get to them not.
For what through friendship wealth and force
no one enioyes the thing,
That (if they like) some will not soon
into their clouches bring.
But goods ill got, are evil spent.
And how can they bestow
Their wealth on poor and Preachers true
Which through deceyt did grow?
No f^e, it were shame and foul reprochs
t'aue beggars at their board:
An't seems (some think) all ill bestowde
that is spent t'encrease Gods word.
For (worse then this) some cannot bide
t'aue beggars at their gate,
Nor not repine when Preachers live
in mean and simple state.
O Labirinths of loathsome lust,
O hellish humane hearts,
O beastly belching belly gods
that thus their store conuarts:
O lumpishe Luskes, that lieffer had
to have of Uiands store:
To win the Rytchman, then to feed
the beggar at their door.
O stony hearts, that more esteem
a Monckey tide with chain,
Then their poor brother, for whose sake
Christ Jesus sufferde pain.
O wicked Wights of wooluish kind,
which so the Lambs denowre,
And cra^ckly cram themselves with spoils
of needy souls each hour.
And (more then this:) for how does walck
Sir Nummus day by day?
How trudgeth it to buy the Wife
and Daughter fine arraye?
They must not go as other do.
Wherefore, they must devise
To have them known from common sort
by some newfangled guise.
It Is meet therefore, as they do not
with courtlyke Dames compare,
Even so they should from townish wives
their garments new repair.
And so (forsooth) his wife must have
prepared out of hand,
Gaye garments of the finest stuff
that is within the land.
She must have Partlet, Square and Lace,
with Chain about her neck:
She must have costly kind of change,
and all things at her beck.
Her Daughter also must be clad
well like a Ladies feere,
And all to walcke about the streate
with her true Lover dear.
What tho? Forsooth, she must not wed
but with some wealthy man,
And one that must be grounded rych,
though honest when he can.
And thus I say (as well it is seen)
fair Par^ell must be pranckt
And walcke at will: whereby it haps
often times that she is banckte.
And all through means even of her Sire
which so consumes his good,
And joys therein, more then to give
the hungry wretch his food.
Chance some men see good deeds they do.
But in good sooth not I
(Though many naught) can understand.
It Were sin on them to lie.
And now, as some you see to scrape
by vile sinistre ways:
So may you see them spend as ill
in these our later days.
I mean for so much as they spend,
But well have we to weete,
Their hoording and their Chesting up
is all as far unmeet
As this their spence and filthy trade,
as this their prowling guise,
As this their building all for gain
and profit to arise:
As this their hateful vile contempt
of poor and needy Wights:
As this their robbing and their stealth.
As these their sinful slights.
The poor complain and wanting, cry
through hunger half forepinde:
And some through want, about them have
their fainting breath resignd.
And yet their Cofers farced lie.
Their Bags are filde at full.
But wot you what? it is reseru'de
For Tib his pretty Trull,
And Dick his Boy that dappart ladde:
which for his sake, perchance
Even both of them, when he is gone,
will make sir Nummus dance.
But always this is not the cause
of such their spiteful hoord.
For certs I think they never look
at all to come aboard
In crooked Charons ugly Boat:
Or else perhaps they think
(As long they have) the Pope shall purge
and save them all for think.
And in the mean time ween they best
to couer't close and fine,
And bring more toot, t'encrease the heap.
This judgment is of mine.
Else things amiss, before expressed,
should nere so ill remain,
But soon they would reform them well
and make them straight again.
Which so to do, God grant them grace.
And cleanse their fylthie minds:
That Avarice may once decay
which so their body binds,
And subject makes to vile devise,
to Usurie and deceate,
That naught they are, and will persist
till grace do blow retreat.
I end with them: protesting still
I touch no good man here,
But such as through these words of mine
shall wrathful bent appear.
For sure I am that many just,
and men upright remain,
Exempted from this talk of mine.
Who never yet with stain
Or spot of beastly Usurie
or vile notorious vice,
Were once corrupted or infect.
which are discrete and wise.
And (truth it is) they nill disdain
at this troth telling tale.
And for the rest, let them adue,
my tongue must further vale.

The fifth Satyr.
It Is strange to see what small account
men now a days do make:
How slightly they let slip the pain
of Brimstone burning lake.
How fondly they persuade them selves
(at least how they suppose)
That griesly death shall never strike.
That ey^e shall never close.
O sottish sinful brittle age.
O mad and blockish Mome.
O doltish fool, and wilful wretch
that here do hope for home
And dwelling aye unto thy self.
How art thou wilful blind?
I tell thee, I, thou hence shall flit
like dust blown forth with wind.
Let wearish wimpled age grow on:
let head be hoarie white,
And old be thou: yet at the last
blackwinged death shall smite.
But what is he can promise here
him self to live a day?
No doubt not one. Death unawares
shall take our life away.
And when we think us surest, then
most often does he strike.
O then why do we lyngre on
to sleepie sluggerds like?
O, why should men thus mucker up
such falsely gotten gain?
Or why should they by wicked ways
seek wealth for to obtain?
But soft a while, Banckrowtes.

For lo how Banckrowts ginne for gain

Shall foul Deceyt be gone?
Shall Wily want? No, barcke a while,

and worthy seem

That save, that spend, and bargains make,
that keep their trade at large.
That warte work, and wind to them
good credit in the end.
That get such friends as will not stick
a thousand pound to lend.
Often more often less: almost as much
as they can well demand.
For why, their credit now is such,
that they may men command.
But what of this? Even this forsooth.
They Will shut up door anon,
They Will give up office, trade and all:
farewell, they will be gone.
When they have got the most they can,
they will become banckrowte,
They will no longer styfeled be
amongst the honest rowte.
They can no longer bide the trade
which honest men do use.
They keep at home amongst their bags,
They Will honesty refuse.
They Will lurking lie like Thief in den,
like Drane upon the spoil.
They Will grease their lips, and fat their pau^ch,
with honest Marchaunts toil.
O dreyrie dregs of dampishe cave,
O foul infernal fiendes,
O tryple stinged Uipers brood,
O hagges of hellishe minds.
O Cyctops such as still devour

O brockish beasts with rauine gorgde:

Shall Oreus spare with skalding skortch

Shall yolpe them up, except they yield

Or else to power requite the same,
But this they never thinck:
For marck how they do still bestow

And here I must advertise you
that some besides there be
Which often by means become banckrowte
(as daily we may see.)
For some exceed and so abound
in Epi^ureous fare,
That so at length they banckrowte be
and bring them selves full bare.
And othersome through great excess
and proud surpassing charge,
In brave arraye do bring them selves

O where are Matrones now become?
O where are Husbands grave?
Where are y^ Wives that took such care
their honesty to save?
Would Matrones walcke or Wives discreet
with silver shining brows
From streat to streat? no, rather they
would keep within their house.
Would Matrons skud to common games
and prancke in earl prease?
No, tys to vile, I loath to tell.
I Will therefore hold my peace.
Tys this, tys this, y^ Banckrowts breed.
This brings the wife ill name.
The husband thus is bare through spence,
and wife naught by the same.
And now you see a difference
tweene him that banckrow^e is
Of vile intent, and him that falls
through great excess of his.
But both of these perhaps a like
by fraud have Nummus got,
Though both in care and wanting pine
sing not like doleful note.
And now^, (as to my promise made
at first when I began)
I Will place sir Nummus caught by Foole^ Fools and Roysters.

and Roysters now and than.
A wise man dies, and welthy leaves
his son in goods and lands.
The young man (when he is of age)
takes all into his hands.
And straight to Court, or Innes of Court,
he goes to lead his life)
Where franck he is, and youthful bent
for why, haas Nummus ryfe.
Or else, if not: So he ban land
or ought that is Money worth,
He shall not want of Marchauntmen
fine silcks to set him forth.
Nor Money will they stick at all
to lend him at his need.
As long as ought he does possess,
they will never cease to feed
My yonker and young Master so.
And he (when once he sees
The bridle laid upon his neck)
is loath much time to leese.
For why, he wished it long before:
And since he does epsy
The matter wholly in his hands,
why should he longer lie
Like blunt John Whoball all at home?
No fie, heel haste him now.
Both liberty and Chinck enough
himself he will allow.
And streightway (else the world is hard)
He meets with Copesmates, such
As to exalt and set him forth,
at all will nothing grutch.
And he forsooth must foremost be
in every brave attempt.
Who ear be one, young Master must
at no time he exempt.
Heel be the chief within the Masks
and chief in bancquet: he
Shall sit exalted to the Sun,
Even to the tenth degree.
And now and then (else scapes he well)
heel have a spyrt at Dice.
He wantes no mates to bring him to it
by slight and fine device.
He must have walkinges in the night:
he must be brave and fine.
He must be of the hoygh no doubt.
He never must repine
Although it be to sit it out
all night in costly game.
And (more then this) he must not stick
to pay for all the same.
And when he seemly seems once,
and thinks well of himself,
Then, then no doubt he is stird up
to spend this noisome pelf.
And then (I say) with posting speed
he must be gaylie dect
In colors of his Lady, and
therein not ^ught neglect
That Is incident to every suit:
Of change he must have store,
And frame himself full scatly then
to every lusty lore.
And doubtless then he is so drownde
in pleasure and in pride,
That naught at all may him withdraw:
It has been often tried.
Yea, though at length he feel great smart
through that he made away:
Yet is his mind so hawtie then,
that he can make no stay.
For wo^e you what, use custom brings,
and yong^er thus does say:
Shall I make spare while ought is left
and so live wanting? Nay,
It were a shame and great reproach,
if I that ever have
As yet lyu'de like a Gentleman,
should now live like a slave.
And so my child no chaungling is,
till all be spent and gone:
And till his mates him needy leave
and comfortless alone.
From which time forth if ought he have,
whereof may Nummus rise:
He will live shi^ting til't be gone.
Then forth of Town he flies
And keeps the high way side (perchance)
to live by theft and spoil:
Till Tyborne twitch him by the neck
and Hangman give the foil.
So that is the end of all his wealth
and ending of the man.
But goods perhaps were evil got:
and who can marvel than
Though that the same were all consumde
in filthy vain exspence?
And who will doubt that gallows should
such Dingthrifts recompense?
But one thing I do here lament
and tys most wicked sure,
Tys noisome, vile and beastly trade,
yet most of all in ure.
A Gentleman his child does send
t'apply his studies here,
With hope to have him do the same
as daily does appear.
The youth often times declyneth straight
as apt to youthly guise:
And sets his mind to make him brave
with all he may devise.
The Citizen when that he sees
the brute so bravely bent,
Does closely search the young man's state,
and learnes the whole extent
Of all his possibility,
which known, he will not spare
For friendship sake unto the same
of loan to let his ware.
The young man having wealth at will
and all things at request,
Byds book adue, and cuts it out
as bravely as the best.
How vile this is, let all men judge.
how often it comes to pass,
The yongmen brought to naught thereby,
are witnesses alas.
Oh, where is love or fear of God?
Where Is faith for to be found?
Where Is friendship, truth and honesty?
Where does not Fame resound
The beastly pranckes of wicked men?
Where Is one that thinks of God?
Where Is one that doubts or fears ought
the sharpness of his rod?
How few be there that tread the paths
or trace Dame virtues steps?
How many rather be there now
that quite from virtue leps?
O woeful case: the best almost
do much account it now
If they from vile notorious faults
at any time do bow.
How talk our tatlers of the truth
and Scripture still discuss?
How live they quite contrary yet
for all their talking thus?
How earnest bent are men as now
to hear the word of God?
(I mean professors of the truth.)
How far yet live they od?
They cry Lord Lord, and God be praysde:
but straight within an hour,
That heat of theirs is cold as stone.
Such heat has made them sour.
O thou good God and Father kind:
were not thy mercies great,
Thou would destroy these men with fire
from thy supernall seat.
O heavenly Prince of glory: and
O thou alone Iehoue,
Thou God of grace, oh loving Christ,
yond whom we can not roaue
Or raunge aright: yond whom no man
can perfect bliss attain:
Thou only one, and all in one,
yond whom does naught remain:
Give grace unto thy wandering sheep.
Fetch home the same again,
Since blood of thine has them redeemde
from sharp infernal pain.
Grant grant (O God) thy holy spreete
to guide, defend and keep
All such as in most loathsome sin,
are yet not fallen sleep.
Save thine elect from noisome trade
of worldly minded men:
Let not the custom of the world
their life with vices blen.
From place to place, from streat to streat,
from house to house, alas:
Yea, and well nigh from man to man
does sinful living pass.
Not words prevail, nor preaching ought,
can turn the peoples hearts:
No kind of thing can move their minds.
O, death is their deserts,
O, Hell their hire, and burning flame,
is guerdon of their deeds:
No one almost in heart does bear
the true repentaunt seeds.
O, horror does possess my head,
And while through town I trace,
Deep cutting cares annoy my heart.
to see such want of grace.
No sparckle, jot or small remain,
no sign of godly fear,
No badge at all of christen men
does any person wear
Or keep almost throughout the Town,
O, what a case is this,
Not one to find that fears God,
but all to do amiss?
And all to wander from good life
(full few alas exempt)
And all to work that wicked is
and beastly vile attempt?
O God, how often do I wish
to be divided clean
From all the dealings in the world,
and to God only lean?
How often do I seek some trade,
and solitary life.
How feign would I depart the place
where sins be now so ryfe.
The world does tempt, and naught remains
in his due practice now:
Each kind of trade corrupted is,
alas, I know not how.
Nothing almost is exercisde
without some vile deceyt:
Fraud, falsehood, theft and pilfring, often
in matters are of weight.
The worldings ween and think no doubt
there is none other place
But ground and grave, and so they run
and keep their woonted race.
What helpen tears or wayling grief?
what ought at all preuayles
Gods word sincere? They keep their course:
they have set up their sails
Of deadly sins and hateful hellish life.
They run and will not stay.
They keep themselves in darksom holes.
They hate to see the day.
Look look throughout their dealings all,
and you shall nothing find
But couen, craft, and fylthy lore.
They have good life resignde.
Lets sift and search our selves throughout.
Lets rippe our inward man:
Let Us way our selves eue^ with our selves.
And we shall see us than,
And find our selves but dross and death
and foul infected Swine.
Most vgsome snapes, and creatures, such
as I can not define,
What faith in bargains can be found?
What store of oaths must be
In each compact? And yet in end
what falsehod do we see?
Not Merchant uses only fraud:
nor men of greatest meede.
But each one now that bargain makes,
has falsehod in his deed.
How often and daily haps it now
that children do begin
Where Parents ended, and do end
where Parents did begin?
The parents beggars first began,
They end great men of wealth,
The son begins a welthy man:
and ends his life by stealth,
Or woeful wanting simple state.
How often comes this to pass?
Tys daily seen of common course.
it happ^^^ still alas.
Shall wealth that is woonne by fraud, be kept?
shall riches such descend
From heir to heir? No no, such wealth
shall quickly have an end.
It cannot bide, nor prosper well.
But who does that regard?
Who yet for wealth most vile deceyt
at any time has sparde?
No one well nighe: (the world is such.)
And here does come to mind
The passing pride in common sort
which now each where we find.
Such is their rage, and foul affect,
that though their bellies want:
Their backs must bravely clothed be:
apparel nothing scant.
For what cause else they do reserve
each where the Saboth day,
But for to iette about the streates
in passing brave array?
The welthy sort exceed their state,
and mean degree the same:
The common sort will do the like.
So all goes out of frame:
And Roysters ruffle all about
and toss the Bylbow blade,
And to maintain such vile excess,
behold what shifts be made?
Such cogging, foysting, cossening:
such fylching, theft and guile:
Such pelting, pylfring, pieuish drifts,
as are almost to vile
And beastly to be named once.
I Will therefore silent be:
For sure I am such life of theirs
all men may plainly see.
There Is brothel baytes, and whoring de^nes:
There Is lurcking strumpets lodge:
There Is stuff each where for lusty Swash
for Simkin, Dick, and Hodge.
Look look the Lanes about the Town,
and search each corner through:
And you shall find I doubt not I
of broken ware enough:
Corrupt at least much seems to be:
so brightly shine the brows,
So pricked and pranckt, so lyckt and trimde
is Banckrowtes pretty spowse.
Search Tauernes through, and typling bowres,
each Saboth day at morn:
And you shall think this gear to be
ene too too much forborne.
Take care a while to view the Skowtes,
and wanton walking trulles:
And you shall see how suffraunce now
good life awayward pulles.
What should I say? Mark each where well,
and you shall understand
And plainly see how sin is sparde
and cloked under hand.
What else but gain and Money gots Bear bayting^on the Saboth day.

maintains each Saboth day
The bayting of the Bear and Bull?
What brings this brutish play?
What is the cause that it is borne,
and not controlled ought,
Although the same of custom be,
on holy Saboth wrought?
Now sure I think tys gain or spite,
against good and godly life:
It seems it is t'ynuegle men,
whiles Gods word is so ryfe:
I cannot any where perceive
where gain is gotten well:
I can not see where well tys spent.
I think no man can tell
Or justly say, here goes one
(for most part now I mean)
That justly lives and leads his life:
that does to virtue lean.
But well, to God I leave this gear.
I have been somewhat long:
I Will turn my tale to other talk:
I Will sing some other song.
Finis.
The syxt Satyr.
WHat think you ( Bertulph) of this place Powles Church abused.

(this Church of Powles I mean)
How think you of th'abuses here,
In talk and tales unclean,
In fearful oaths and vile compacts,
in vain expense of wind,
In vilely spending time therein,
in idle chat to find
Men occupyde at prayer time,
and other times unmeet,
In toys, and diverse noisome trades?
(As thou thy self do weete.)
And soothly tell me, what thou deemst,
and how it seems to thee,
In place reseru'de to hear Gods word,
such Chaos vile to see?
Of truth, Bertulph.
to show my mind therein
(at least what I have seen)
The time (as now) will not permit:
tys to far spent I ween.
Again, since you have well begone
of Nummus to entreat,
It Were pity (sure) that want of time
should let you to repeat
Such things again with brief discourse,
of well proposed Theme:
Return therefore, and make some end
of this thy faithful dream.
And I at else appointed time
(for time it does demand)
Will nothing fail, in each respect,
wherein you shall command.
Well, well (quoth Paul so shall it be. Paul.

I Will end my tale begone.
I Will not be long: give silent ear,
the same shall soon be done.
And now, besides the great abuse
that I whileare did name,
Here in this Temple (day by day)
themselves do likewise frame
A number of our foraine Feeres Gentlemen.

and men of grounded wealth,
Our cawtie country Gentlemen
to win this noisome pelth.
The fertile soil that foyson bringes
of goodly sheaued grain,
The Meadow ground that plenty yeeldes
of Hay through little pain,
And ranckly springing pasture, which
does fat the fleesed sheep,
Will not suffice their greedy minds,
nor them contented keep.
Not gain enough by gainsome trade,
to them will now arise,
Nor wealth enough can quench their thirst:
too much will not suffice
Or stay their lust: still lust they more.
Not highly raised rents
Not lofty fines can humors purge,
nor extreme whole extents
Can fill their hungry gaping gulles,
nor staunch their foul desire.
They are so fell, that more they have,
the more they do require.
Their Grau^dsires great, of long time since,
their Ancestors of yore,
With sole revenues of their lands,
have maintainde evermore
Right worthy ports, forgetting naught
the stay of their good name:
Well got they wealth, in bounty, and
well spent they still the same.
They never (most of them I mean)
encrocht on neighbors ground,
Nor ere inclosde unjustly ought,
They lyu'd within the bound
Of Charity and reasons law,
contented with their own.
They fed within their Tedure still:
foul fraud was then unknown.
At least the fraud that is now in ure.
They near enhaunst their rentes,
Nor found such beastly practices
as this vile age inuents.
Their own suffisde: they sought no more,
they lyu'de well of the same:
Yet lyu'de they not unto themselves,
as their successors frame.
They well could bide that beggars should
have comfort at their gate:
They were content, though that they dwelt
by men of mean estate.
But now not so. That Age is spent,
and Charity withal:
These men are not contented now:
to spoil each one does fall.
They racking stretch their living so:
such wooluish ways they frame,
That through fine force, and pilfring shifts,
twice doubled are the same.
And double twice decayed yet
howsekeping is no doubt.
They live like Misers to them selves.
Their neighbors round about
Of poor estate may not approach
nor come within their gates:
Sometimes perhaps for fashion sake
they do inuit their Mates,
And such as do the like to them:
or else by whom does rise
Some hope of gain or getting ought.
And thus their bounty lies.
But this not all: for wot you what?
They shame not now to say
That beggars do so eat them up,
that they no longer may
Be able to keep open their doors,
nor howsekeping maintain.
Perhaps they see some other trade
where lies some greater gain.
And so they do, for when they have
once gotten to their hands
By purchase, fraud, and subtle mean
their needy neighbors lands
About them round (whereby of truth
they come to great decay)
Then shut they doors and howsehold break
they turn their men away.
And hither come they tag and ragge:
here must the gain be had:
Here be their charges very slight:
yet pelting twice as bad
As ear it was. The Country house
is broken up through charge,
The lands are let, and fines are raysde:
whereby comes in at large
Graund su^mes of Coin: which gotten once
is straight to London brought Userers are Caterpillars in a common weelth

To bring increase. (O hellish trade)
and thus the means are wrought.
In bancke is laid the mighty Masses
the gain whereof may be
Enough to maintain them at ease,
Nay thalfe thereof we see
Does well suffice: for but one man
or two at most they have.
And they themselves do Tables haunt,
and so sir Nummus save.
And at a mean and slender price,
themselves, their men and all,
Have meat and drink even of the best
well served at their call:
And with revenues of the stock,
right richly are they clad.
And so from thence their brauing state
and all the rest is had.
The ste^ke as whole reserved still.
and often (such is the trade)
That from the graunde stock flows so much
as petie stocks are made.
And here the caterpillars haunt.
In Powles forsooth they use
To spend the day to make their mart
and hearken after news.
Was ever seen such state confusde,
such monstrous kind of men,
Such vomit, reffize, Dunghill dross?
what man can tell me when
such watch, such ward, such winking wiles
were ever put in vrs
In time to fore, or such foul fraud
sir Nummus to procure?
In faith, and by my saving health,
full hardly can I find
A man amongst a number now
of uncorrupted mind,
And such a one as hope of gain
will not procure to sin.
I think full few be living now
whom meede may nothing win:
Or whom that wealth may never wind
from Gods prescribed law.
O earth, O sin, Oh Satan's thralles:
How do we still withdraw
The grace and love of God from us?
O how do we regard
More, noisome coin, then health of soul
or hope of good reward?
I think if I could perseuers
one Month in this my tale,
I scantly should the half discrie
Of fraud, (for why) in sale
And each compact, the sole regard
of gain is always had:
And thirst of score, each where almost
does make the people mad.
O where are bits to bring them in,
and laws to lay their rage?
O where is faith, or fear of God
in this presumptuous age?
Each one does live as lykes him best,
the laws do lie for gain.
Besides deceit and vile devise,
does nothing now remain
Within the hearts of English men,
far fled is all remorse:
All love of God, all fear of plague,
and Keysers mighty force.
How prodde our Papists privily? Papists.

How do these men puruaye?
How prowle the Caytiues now about,
for Nummus day by day?
Here, in this Church a walck there is
where Papists do frequent The Papists walk in Powles.

To talk of news among themselves:
and often the time is spent
In glad recounting of their state:
which though not at the best,
Yet joy they still to see how men
in aid thereof be pressed.
And now comes one and cheeres them up, The walk is in the south I Will.

he tells them with great joy,
That Pope and Spaniard joined be,
Gods people to annoy.
By solemn protestation comes
an other by and by
He tells how that in Flaunders still,
the Gospellers do dye
For sole professing of the truth:
and with a cheerful face,
He shows how fast the Sheep are slain,
abroad in eary place.
And what great towns are now bes^egde
and Cities round about.
And how Gods word decays apace,
even all the world throughout.
Another new fond fellow comes,
and he begins to tell
How Popish Champions landed are,
and Irish men rebel.
How holy fathers blessing brought
in Bishops sacred bres^e,
Has made the land before profane,
now holy as the rest.
And how that Stukeley lost his life,
among Barbariens late,
A Marquess of the Romish mark,
O too untimely fate:
His part (alas) was yet to play
in places nearer hand.
He meant and bent his forces he,
against the Irish lands
But what this Marquess left undone,
Mack Morice he contryu^d:
And hotly began pursue the charge,
But ah, it never thryu'd.
For Martyrlyke* he lost his head,
a loss (in deed) to wayle:
Sith holy Father, through this loss,
of his intent does fail. Have you not seen the knacke to know knaves by.
compiled by many kanues?

Great Sacks of news are poured forth
in that same worthy walk.
And knauish knackes are there de^nsde
whilst that they stately stalck
About the place like honest men,
and subjects true of heart.
From that same place do rumors rise
Gods truth to overthwart.
From that same place do slanders come
and vile reprochful lies
Against Gods word and Preachers true.
From that same corner flies
Lewd skoffing testes and taunting tales:
there do these Rebels coin
Their subtle drifts and noisome tales.
Yea, there do they conioyne.
And cleave like burres with solemn vow
the truth for to resist.
And doubt there is none, for why? I think
that they will so persist.
Until that Satan snatch them hence,
the Graundsire great of lies:
And till through want of vital breath,
they may no more devise.
What kind of men be these (I pray) Bertulph.

that thus themselves in ure?
What, are they open foes professed
that by these means procure
The slander of the certain truth
and teachers of the same,
Or Ipocrites that covertly
the Gospel do diffame?
Once, Bertulph, tys well known to thee Paul.

that small restraint there is
For papists tongues that proudly prate,
(how ere they gabbe amiss.)
They talk from fear of check at large.
But yet of them there be
That prease amongst professors true,
and well with them agree.
For why, their lyuings so do lie,
that but they seemed such,
They never could aspire so high,
nor yet obtain so much
As now they do. O Ianus Jacks
and double faced Dogs?
O wily wincking wyzard Woolues,
O grunting groyning Hogs?
These men (I say) forswear them selves
(As periurde Papists do.)
They grant the Queen is supreme head
and murmr at it to.
But what of that, fine fled heads
well fraught with trim devise
And civil sleights, without remorse,
such scruples count unwise.
And so through sharp and wily wits,
And through far fetching brains,
They mount aloft to honors tipe,
and come by greatest gains.
And these be they that under hand
the truth do still annoy,
And let the working of the word
in such as might enjoy
The sweetest salve of saving health.
Such lay the loathsome snares,
And when good seed is sown, forthwith
such men sow noisome fares.
Yea, such I say (as to my tale)
lay wait by wily ways
For Nummus: and to get the same,
are pressed at all assayes.
These be supporting purueyors
for Papists now suppressed
These ranckly feed the pamperd Swyne
vpstalled in their nest.
These foyson bring, and brokers set
through bend of popish crew,
And these men foster Balamites
To whom revenge is dew.
These men are sale abettors of
the cursed Priests of Baall:
And these men shauelings do suffulse,
which else would have a fall.
Is It marvel though they cranckly crow
well lodged in their cage?
With prouen pricked, yst marvel now,
That thus the Tigars rage?
What need have they to yield themselves
unto their lawful Queen?
For what intent should subjects they
at any time be seen?
They want nothing, no pleasant lodge:
of viands they abound,
Both Uenion, Wine, and finest cates.
almost that may be sound
They do enjoy: yea, and such store
as true report does say,
That (rather than the poor should haat)
they cast their scraps away.
And in good sooth, their wealth is such
and dainty fare so ryfe,
That worldlings will not blame their wit
to lead such captive life.
And fools they were if they would not
be persecuted so:
Yea some of them so sore be hurt
that broad they ride and go.
They walk and wallow at their will:
they hawke and hunt yfeere
With such as have the charge of them:
they quat^e and make good cheer,
Set Cock on hoope, with hoape that once,
a dare shall pay for all:
Mean time they will not die through care
nor from their treason fall.
Why Pawle (quoth Bertulph) mercy will Bertulph.

perhaps so pierce their heart,
That through the mercy of the Prince
they will to truth conuart.
Nay Bertulph, tys so far that they Paul.

with mercy should be won,
That vauntingly they brag and say
bound duty will have done
All that is done: and (thus) they crake
that if the Queen by law
Or conscience could them gyltie dampne,
she would not stand in awe
To send them to their doom: nor to
restrain their tongues so loose.
Thus bleate the Popish Balamites,
thus creakes the Romish goose.
And what, should mercy here be shewde,
or can the sante prevail?
No no, as long as mercy is,
their tongues shall never quail,
Nor heart obdured once relent:
nor common state be sound.
For how can gentle salve do good
or cure the festred wound?
How can the body be in health,
that is with Biles infect? I mean those of the only that have been distained
with the blood of the Lords Saints.

Or Tree spri^g well that has dead spraies
unless you do resect
The branches of? What man so mad
will show himself to be,
As ought to hope for leaves or fruit
to come from rotten Tree?
How can the state of Christ his flock,
be fenced from decay:
Unless the higher powers do cast
the stumbling stocks away?
How can the Lord of truth be pleased,
when such false Prophets live?
How will he like to have them kept
his siely Lambs to grieve?
And doubt the Tiraunts now to say
that time shall come again
Wherein the blessed Saints of God
by them shall suffer pain?
No no, they fear not to protest,
that where they put to death
Of late but few, for earye such
shall twenty loose their breath
In time to come. O bloody beasts
and foul infected Swine?
But these be they for whom (no doubt)
men scrape and so purloine:
For whom these factors have such care
and passing great regard:
For whom they powle the Preachers true
these Monsters to reward.
And hate of theirs so heinous is,
their ^ancor has such force
Against the Gospel of the Lord,
that (void of all remorse)
They eft procure Pluralities
For vile disguised Jacks.
They glad and joy, to see the Church
sustain such woeful lacks.
And they again, a Priesting sort,
attyred in their kind:
Do creep into Cathedral Celles.
their charge they have assignde,
To be dischargde per auters mains,
themselves will live at ease,
They force not what become of flock,
so they sir Nummus sease,
And Nummus do they seize in deed,
which seized buyldes no Schools:
Nor makes no stocks for men decade,
no Bertulph so plays fools.
But here you may not take me so
as if I did defase
Without respect, the good with badde
in each Cathedral place.
Much less that I depraved have
all Preachers so attyrde
In Priestish weeds, as Popelings were,
and as their state requyrde.
No: far and far, be this from me,
for why I know right well:
That in these Priestish weeds there are,
full many that excel.
Nay Bertulph nay, then blame have I
if so my words be meante:
For some of these attyred thus,
in peaceful wise are bent:
And brawle not with their brethren, who
neglecte or clean refuse:
And therefore great injustice it were,
such Preachers to accuse.
Although I wish (that is all I may,)
that Preachers might be known
From Popish Jacks in weeds and words
a thing confused grown.
But hushed, I Will haste me to the shore:
I Will shonne such mounting waves.
I Will leave this Sea for to be swomme
of tryple tongued Naues.
FINIS.
The seventh Satyr.
NOw harken Bertulph to the end Paul.

of this my present tale.
I am enforst my floting Boat
to shore from course to hale.
The time runs on, the day is spent,
The night awayward pulles,
And endless scope of my pretense,
down pressed palate dulles.
O endless power, O welspring, whence
all wisdom wisely flows:
O God, whose grace does guide the good,
in whom all bounty grows:
Thou know the hearts, and see the raynes
yea, thinwarde thoughts of men
Do open lie before thy face:
Thou know how, where and when
Each thing has, is, or shall be done
or else committed: thou
Haste perfect vewe and insight good
which way man's heart does bow.
Thou, thou, I say, sole God of might,
beholdst the hearts of men,
What they pretend, what ill they work:
so justly judge me then,
And shut thy mercy from my soul,
if slaundrously my lyps
Do open at all: or if my tongue
of vain presumption skyps
From this to that, or rashly run
more then the truth does urge,
Or more then that through extreme rage
and force of sinful surge
I am constrainde with deep remorse
and moaning plaint to tell.
O, oh, how many brothell Bawdes
within the town do dwell?
How many filthy scudding scowtes,
besturre their crooked stumpes?
For gain, for gain, old mother B
how she still lymping lumps,
And proddes about with ackwarde pace
unto her beastly haunt?
How do these subtle groyning Sowes
poor siely girls enchaunt,
And often abet the loved spouse
to start from husbands bed?
Behold I say, how by these Bawdes,
are women captive led
And simple maids unto the spoil.
Behold and see their trade,
See, see, what wyly winking shifts,
by cliffe browde beasts are made.
Of course and custom, common Innes
they watch with wary eye
If that at any time they may
(as often they do) espy
The country maids that come from far,
as strangers to the town:
Whom still the Trottes do tittle so,
that straight all shame laid down.
They yield the^ selves as captive queanes,
unto some whorish cave:
Where trotting Jade for filthye gain
does urge them to behave
Full soon themselves vile strumpet like
to live by whorishe trade:
And she her self does let them forth
that gain by them be made.
But (out alas) the Maidens minds
and coming was tobtaine
Some service where to spend their times
as servant to remain.
O ardent force of flaming sin.
O rage, O riot, O
That ever such should be sustainde
or once on ground should go?
Behold behold how good men's wives
Inuegled are by them?
Behold how servant they support?
Behold how they do hem
And hook to them through crooked guile
And vndereating craft,
Great store of Truls? Behold I say
how often is beraft
By them alas the fruitful wife,
of her most loving mate:
And husband bearing honest port,
of wife in that same rate.
Behold also how honest Maids
and servant they entyce
To whoredom, theft, and filching by
their diuilish vile device.
But where are these? how should we know
where such lewd Lossels lodge?
Where is their haunt, and where are they
accustomde thus to dodge?
Round, round about the City walls.
Within and eke without.
The Alleys, Lanes* yea open streates,
and places all about
Are now replenisht with such stuff,
and filthy broken ware.
And (woe begone) the Officers
thereof do take no care.
For if they did, how durst the Drabs
and Callets be so bold
As limpe about in lawless times
or take into their hold
Young fillock Iylles, and bawdie Jacks
at inconvenient tides:
And still retain for storeware some
within their house besides?
How durst the Dunghils dance about
with blind vagaries so,
And with close colors lead their trulls
where that they list to go?
Behold, behold, how camoysed queen
and crafty crooked crib
Does under vile and lewd pretense,
(most like a subtle gib)
Pretend to place in service still
young maidens here and there.
And maidens having refuge such,
behold how they ne fear.
To pilfer, filch, and to purloyne
from Master and from Dame,
And in the end to give the slip
and serve no more the same.
Which all does spring from wimpled B:
and old deceitful Bawd,
And how to her the gain does rise,
which she by theft so drawde
Besides revenues of the tail,
and foreign filched good:
Behold how thus like carrein Crow,
she lives by filthy food.
An other sort of them aduert
some old, some young yfeere,
That walk about with Brushes, Pins,
with Tape and other geere.
But well, since that the camps be wide,
wherein as now I walck:
I leave them here, entending once,
at large therein to stalck
And sever places by themselves,
with styles and parting stakes:
And as I can, to my poor skill,
rescind the noisome brakes.
For treating now of broking Bawdes,
and filthy Panders, I
Have cause therein full many such
vile persons to descrie.
For why the husband now is pressed,
to put his wife for gain
Unto her choice to be an whore,
or honest still remain.
And so it is: else how could they
thus strumpet like attire
And set them out? tys too too true,
they let their wives to hire.
O great excess, how long could I
retain your ears herein,
If I but briefly should discourse?
(So great a scope has sin.)
But as I said, so shall it be:
I leave it to my pen,
Which (granting God) hereafter shall
at large dilate it: when
Both time shall yield her self thereto
and mind (as only bent
Upon the same) shall beat at full,
with perfect true intent.
Mean time, with one thing more, I e^
which (since the day is past)
I Will comprehend in briefest words:
and this shall be the last.
Whereas before, of broking Bawdes
my former tale was told,
Of Brokers likewise now to tell Brokers.

my Pen shall be so bold.
For why, their deeds be damnable:
and they in number so
Do still increase, that day by day
by them deceyts do grow
In such abundance, that (alas)
I fear, I fear as now,
All dread of plagues clean set apart,
to fraud men's minds do bow:
Sequestered clean from Godly love,
and so from Godly fear,
That rich to poor, where gain does lie,
will rauine naught forbear.
And (out alas) where heretofore,
(pricked forth by thirst of gain)
Within the Town, of Brokers, they
did thirty such ordain,
Or thereabouts, shrewde wylye Mates
and witty wincking Colts
(Although in wisdom sure I think,
they showde them selves but dolts)
To use the trade of broking, and
discreetly so the same,
That if the world should vewe the Act,
they might be void of blame:
Whereas (I say) of late this act
decreed was for intent,
That Broking trade might practizd be
by men so well ybent,
That reason ruling them therein,
(though Gods word does forbid,
And clean condemn all loan for gain)
their fact might so lie hid.
Now now alas, I speak of the intent as it has fallen out since such order
made.
(O sinful fact)
the Magistrates, herein,
Not so content for to dispense
with such an heinous sin,
Do altogether clean neglect
by them such order made:
Whereby whole hundreds now do live
by beastly broking trade.
And in such sort do they demean
themselves, and so devise,
That horrible it is to tell
which way their gain does rise.
Our gentlemen in these our days
(as soothly goes report)
In time of need, to Marchantmen
are woonted to resort
Gentlemen, when they can get no Money of loan, are glad to take, wares
whereof Money may be made.
And take of loan such wares, as they
best like of: yielding theare
Themselves to bands, and suraunce good
to pay for all the ware,
Which when they have with thirsting hope
once taken to their hands, Note the subtlety of the Merchant which utters
his wares in such sort, and that also for v^une

For ware, scant half may they obtain
for to discharge their bands:
And so perforce constramed are
to sue for brokers aid,
By whom they think to save themselves:
And so the goods are laid
In brokers hands: who handle them
so handsomely I trow,
That all the gain that may be had,
does to the Broker grow.
For (at the least) one part thereof
he keeps unto his share:
And yet unto the gentleman
he yields for his ware
Perhaps much more then he himself
could have obtainde therefore.
He nicks him, and besides he takes
a crown in earie score
For payment of his pains therein.
O execrable crime?
Were ever seen such subtle shifts
in any former time,
As are in this our present age?
what should I think therein?
No doubt, no doubt, that men as now
do snorting sleep in sin.
The Lethargy or some such ill
does rifely reign abroad.
They are down pressed with monstrous sins
and yet sustain the load.
What craft is coined day by day?
what fraud affresh is found?
What new devise and strange deceyte
does in this age abound?
I fear, I fear, true dealing now
deryded is with men.
I fear me they do practice Faith
and Truth but now and then.
But (as unto my former tale.)
Is this the worst they use?
Will Broker use this only theft
and other fraud refuse?
No no, the varlet vengeablye
can coin more noisome drifts:
He has his bouget fraught with fraud,
and Foxie knauish shifts.
Well scapes the dettor, if he do
three parts thereof obtain.
Nay, oftentimes he is glad to take
one only part again.
For broker when he has the goods,
at laysure will repay
The same by peecemeale: and perhaps
for all his foul delay,
The detter shall be glad to take
on quarter of the same.
If this be well, (as true it is)
then nothing's out of frame:
And all may be right well forborne,
as it has been full long.
But hapt the same to Magistrates,
they would redress the wrong,
And not set light by such deceyt:
nor wincking, let it lie.
Had they such loss, they would I say
redress full soon espy.
But who cares ought, so gain be had,
and wares be made away?
They utter by such means their wares.
Why then, what hurt have they?
They shall be paid, who ear do leese,
and gain shall they by lene.
Although the detter loose the half,
yet they will take heed to one.
And oftentimes (such is the faith
of these vile broaking knaves)
When they have got the dettors goods,
they will like roging slaves
Some of them show a pair of heels:
the Rakehells will be gone.
They Will run away with goods and all,
though life lie thereupon.
And doubtless, many of them do
so practice now a days,
That they come up and rise to wealth,
by such ungodly ways.
Some of them use such privy shifts,
and such close couched wyles,
That they come up and bear good port
And only live by guyles.
And other some so slauishe be
and cutthroate cullion leeke,
That when they have a booty got,
they will straight way give the gleeke,
And pack away. As, now and then
is brought into their hands
A Chain of Gold, a Tablet or
some bracelet golden bands
By Gentlemen to lay to pawn
For Nummus when they need:
Which, when they have once in their hands,
they will pack away with speed.
I tell you Bertulph, on my faith,
if I should now dilate
The vile deceit of Brokers, and
so set to view their state,
You scantly could abide to heer't,
so horrible it is.
But thus we must consider ont,
and so I ends with this.
Where that the state corrupted is
by them that bear the swaye,
There meaner people will pervert
and bring it to decay.
If Maiestrate do win with fraud,
the commons will the same.
If Magistrate must winck for fear,
then all goes out of frame.
And so I end till time renew
this tale of mine begone.
I tell you truth, there rests yet
much more ere it be done.
But here you have unto my hest,
declared (as I can)
How Nummus is awayted for
by most men now and than:
And how the same is put to use
most wicked now a days:
And how it is by men abusde
in spending many ways.
You eke have heard expressed here,
how often times it is
For hoorde kept close and cofferd up.
I have delated this.
Now rests that I do declare
how he has harmed me.
But this (as I intend) hereafter
shall dilated he:
For (doubtless) herein does consist
a thing importing wait,
To show how Nummus does deceive
by Satan's subtle slight.
And sith I do entende at large
of this (God granting grace)
To write hereafter, now I end:
and (with erected face)
Unto my God great thanks I yield,
that so has been his will
To guide my tongue the thing to speak
wherein does rest such ill.
And pray we heartily unto him
to mitigate the pain
And plague which for our monstrous life
as due does now remain.
Amen.
The. viii. and last Satyr.
The Author.
THough Muse have made his final end,
and Pen have run his race,
Yet careful custom causes me
to wail the want of grace.
And quaking quill renewes the plaint
that lurckes in pensive breast
Commixt with cares that flow from head
full fraught with great unrest.
The time back beats mine idle brain
that labor ginnes to leave:
And rage of sin returns the grief
my silent pawse to reaue.
How shall I safely seek the shore?
How may I shun the seas,
Until that Triton blow retreat
and mounting wave appeas?
The dawning day does keep aloof,
and Loades man loses aim:
The ryffie rock does lie in wait
my beaten bark to maime.
And yet when day shall once discrye
the danger of the surge,
Then shall my puppe due course observe
and glide through crooked gurge.
Mean time betost with great turmoyle,
and tempests bitter flawe,
I Will keep my self amid the stream:
and yet a while withdraw
My Pen from port of quiet pawse.
For time does urge me so:
The time alas infect with sin.
Yea time wherein does grow
The rage of sin and ryots force,
the raumping Serpents guile,
With all deceyt that may be found:
yea sin almost to vile
To be expressed or set to vewe.
But such is Satan's force:
Such are the hearts of vanquished thralles,
clean frustrate of remorce.
Call call to mind you careless crewe:
Lay custom now a side:
And let your faith with faithless fruits
herein a while be tried.
Confirm the life that you do lead
And ratify the same.
And then lets see how wilfully
you wander worthy blame.
First Avarice, what force it has,
what cursed cancre it is, The canker ^f couetous^es is cause ^f all evil.

What running rot and curelesse wound,
to men apparaunt is.
What great enorm this sin has wrought
What thirsting has procurde,
The block, the tree, the beggars bag
such sequeale has inurde:
And yet how ryfely now it reigns,
how graft in greedy minds,
How grounded it is in peoples hearts,
a proof our living finds.
No one abandons beastly trade,
nor makes stay at all
To practice fraud and fliching lore
so gain thereby may fall.
The rich does lay his goods for gain,
and gapeth still to get
The substance of the needy soul
that got the same by swett.
The needy (not unlike) devise
and seek by subtle drifts
To scrape for coin, and gain to win,
do seek ungodly shifts.
So charity excluded is:
and love is kept aloof.
And right is wronged through reward,
as falls still in proof:
And Userie about the Town
is maintaind as a trade:
And equity to ease the wrong,
in matters dares not wade.
But well, the Sin shall not be hid
nor cloked from the view.
I will explane the practice here
in words that do ensew.
The Cormoraunt that coucheth ^vp
and crams his cankerd bags,
Does give to hoord his gotten coin:
and bowte the town he lags.
To Broker does he bend his course:
or happly unto him
The Broker bannes and weanes a mate
for purpose very trim.
And twene them two are crafts conveyed
and foxy falshoode wrought.
Twene them are traps so framed, that
thereby is Nummus caught.
O God, what gain does guilefull gnuffe
by loan of Nummus raise?
How does he nick the debtor now
by hault exacting ways?
Ten powndes in hundred, nothing is*
and twenty is but small.
For half in half full oftentimes
in loan among does fall.
A siely man constraind of late
to borowe for his need,
Repaird unto a Merchant man
to borowe on his deed
The Merchant (as it is of course)
had Money none to lend:
But wares he proferd willingly.
and Dettor in the end
The same became: and took to loan
as much as did amount
To thirty pounds of current coin
by Marchantmans account.
Which wares so taken up to loan,
to Broker are they brought:
The Broker to the Merchant he
(of whom the same were bought)
Full falsely does return them straight:
who now twice gaynes thereby:
For first he soulde and now eftsoons
the same again does buy.
So that when this our siely soul
should raise thereof the sum:
Above the price of twenty pound,
the credit will not come.
For ten in thirty could vouchsafe,
the Creditor to have
For recompense in Usurie.
O careless cankerd slave,
O cawty cutthroate, cullion, wretch,
O Caterpyllers Feere,
O miserable Murderer,
Can thou abide this gear?
The time is now at hand wherein
thou straight account shall make:
Wherein thou shall Hell fire gain
for gain that thou did take.
O Userer, thou Satan's thrall,
and Butcher of the Fiende,
Thy Gold shall be transformde to muck:
thy plagues shall never end.
But as thou do thy Ocker use
to oppress thy neighbor here:
Even so the scorching flames of Hell
thy caytyfe corpse shall dear.
Thy rusty hoorde ascendes the sky:
thy dettors harm does mount
Unto the high supernall seat
to call thee to account.
Thou greedy Gleade, thou hu^gry Hawke,
thou starueling Uultures mate,
How darste thou thus by rauine seek
to maintain thine estate?
I see how thou can soar aloft
like hungry Hawke tespye
And catching Kite, when pray shall spring,
for best game bent to fly.
I see thy subtle lagging pace,
and crafty colourde guile:
I see thy false dissembling slight:
I see thy playted wile.
Thou have devised by the Month,
for gain to let thy ware:
Thy money eke from month to month,
thou can right well forbear.
But for each shilling (Caytife thou)
in surplysage wilt take
A penie: and of twenty shillings,
twenty pennies make:
And (in that rate) for forty pound,
so lent out: in a year,
Thou will receive twice forty pounds
of lawful Money clear.
Thou weenst to welter here for aye,
and wallowe in thy wealth:
Thou never think to see the day
to part from this thy pelth.
But I will tell thee Cormorant,
thou fell and egre droane:
Each penny shall accountaunt be
which thou have let in loan.
And though as now the law be thine
to lay beneath thy foot:
Yet then the furyes by decree
shall rende thy heart at root:
When as the libell of thy lust
and bayliwick abusde,
Shall thee condemn to Limboe pit
and scalding lake confusde.
FINIS.
The Aucthor upon the Book, in the defense of the government of the City.
TWo sorts of men repair unto this Book.
The one to carpe and cauell at my words:
The other through delyght, thereon does look:
And reading it, true judgment well afordes.
He deemeth straight (when happily I reprove)
That mine intent is vices to remove.
But now, tappease and satisfy the mind
Of such as rashly run with open mouth
At my reproof which often here they find,
I thus much say to them in my behoue.
I mean, I touch, I quip no private man
For hate, ne spite since first my work began,
Nor yet do I (with chyldish rage stird up)
Seek to deface a worthy common state
Of such as seldom drink of sinful Cup
By matter such as I do here debate.
For I protest, I know no matter why
I should so do: since no man can deny
That in the Town are diverse sorts of men
By whom the virtuous are supported still:
With whom the wicked may at no time blen
Their noisome drifts, nor work the thing that's ill:
By whom the poor and needy are sustainde:
And eke with whom true zeal has still remainde.
I mean both Judge, Phistion, Lawyer and
The Merchant (whom even all I must commend)
With other else which in my Book do stand.
I say, of them there be whom to defend
I need not here. Their lives avoid the blame,
And through good life, they wyn immortal fame.
FINIS.
Gentle Reader, for the fillinge up of empty pages, this letter written by the
Author to his friend lying at the point of death is inserted.
SIr, how and in what wise every man should bear him self toward his
friend in time of health, in time of prosperity and strength, most men
know: yea, such is the vntruste that is in man, more men can speak plausibly
in time of good hap, as we term it, then in time of siknes judge uprightly.
Alas, in time of sickness and in assaults of death (wherein the body is not
more grievously oppressed then the mind diversely distracted and the soul
mightelye assaulted) how few do consider, or at the leastwise, do apply them
selves to the relief of the poor afflicted soul, to the strengthening of the
feeble mind, and to the repelling of those bitter temptations and assaults of
the common enemies of man kind, the old Serpente, the vain, wicked and
unconstant world, and the frail, perverse and rebellious flesh which always
do attend and attempt the sick enfeebled and oppressed person? Surely, were
it not that God in time of such extremity does mightelie comfort and
confirm such as be his in the promises of his mercy, in the death of his
dear Jesus, and in the merytes of his passion: it is not possible but that
sickness should be intolerable, death horrible, Hell wictorious, the body
living, to be a terror to the mind, and the mind so terrified and brought to
desperation, to be the perpetual dampnatioun of the body and soul.

Which thing considered, and from my very heart remembered, I cannot choose but
in this blessed battle, and I trust (though somewhat sharp and egre) yet
most happy conflycte whereunto (as a fellow souldyer, and adopted brother) you
are called for your trial, I cannot choose I say, but, to the increase of
your courage, endeavor to make plain unto you in all that I may, the fruit
of affliction and the commoditye of death: imparting with you such weapons as
for mine own store, the Lord our Captain has alloted unto me, to the end,
that being conveniently appointed, you may resist and avoid at all assayes,
and become bold, valiant, constant and perseuerable to the death. Touching
which death, notwithstanding it be grievous to the frail flesh, yet is it
most ioyfullye to be received as an undoubted end of all grief, for why? it
is the beginning of Joye and perpetual triumph whereupon a certain godly man
writes. If thou had a good conscience, thou would not fly death. And
again, why haste thou pleasure in that wretched body, whose fellowship does
nothing else but violentlye withdraw and deteine thee from the king* come of
everlasting glory? O cosen: what else but a place of exile is the miserable
body to the Soul? And to what thing else may this our life more aptlye be
compared, then to an horswaie or stage play where men do assemble to behoulde
sondrye feats, and where every man labors in all that he may, to win
praise, promotion and authority after the end of his tragical part: God
only is permanent immortal and ever lasting: All things else are
transitorye and subject to corruption. They be constituted corruptible and
mortal, and must be consumed of time, and ha^ their ends by corruption. The
S^^e shall pass, for it was made but for man's use. The Moon, and the stars
shall perish, for they were created but for the necessitye of man. Heaven and
earth shall decay, for they contain but a place of exile and prison for the
body of man: yea, the body of man also shall perish, for it is but as an enemy
to exercise the soul, and to make it apt to apprehend by faith, the Joys of
heaven and crown of immortalytie. Most certain (I say) it is that the
frail body shall be resolved to earth, and there shall sleep till the soul
return unto it, and till the members be restored to their right places.
Wherefore, sith earth and corruption is the end of the body: yea, the end of
all things that were made and created, and that the same end of the body is
the beginning of life, wish for death, wish for a peaceable departure, and
finding the same, embrace it: saying in your heart: Come Lord, come Jesus, make
haste and tarry not: Come Lord that I may be one with thee and coheyre of the
kingdom purchased with thy precious blood. Dear Cosen and beloved in the
Lord, let not long sickness discourage you, neither be you in anywise
perplexed or grieved with the low state and constitution of your body: And in
and above all things, let not hyndraunce in worldly affairs disquyet you. As
you have begone, so further the will of the Lord, and be ready to receive
whatsoever he will lay upon you. For the gretest affliction and misery that man
may or does suffer in this life, is not worthy the least of those treasures
which God will bestow upon him in the life to come, which is durable,
permanent, glorious and altogether full of blessedness. And assure your self
(for so God has promised, and will not go one jot from his word) that he
will lay no more upon you, then by his grace and strength you shall be able to
hear, although he seem somewhat sharply to correct you, and somewhat
severely to deal with you: for who is he whom the Lord chasteneth not?
Surely, surely, whom he loves, the same does he chasten, and in him is he
delighted as the father in his son, offering himself unto him as a dear father
to his son: whereas if we refuse chastycement, we are no sons, but
bastards, and not inheritable by any right. Joseph was afficted and delivered
by y^ Lord. David was chastised, and he acknowledged the Lord and found
relief in his Soul. Tobias was corrected, and he found health. Job was tried
and was made perfect. What should I say, even all the Appostles, all the
Prophets: yea, and all the good men that ever were, have bine tried by
affliction, chosen by persecuto^, and crowned by patience, abydinge the will
and pleasure of God. Wherefore, be strong in the Lord, and desire of him in
your heart ye his will may be wrought in you, and that you may with a glad heart
receive whatsoever his Majesty shall lay upon you. Assure your self that this
your present sickness is either for punishment of sin, for exercise of your
faith, or to yt death. And therefore, if it be for punishment, beseech him to
give you patienceand assure your self upon repentance, to have free and full
remission in Christ: If it be for trial, give him thanks: and if it be to the
death, reioise in it, and think it is y^ greatest gift that ever he gave you
in this world, being the very passage to the heavenly and Angelical Paradise.
And pray even from the bottom of your heart, that neither the love of the
world, nor the fear of the same death, may distracte you from the desire of
it. Be not careful to leave your kinsfolckes, friends, and acquaintance, let
it not grieve you to part from your goods, nor have any love depending upon any
earthly thing whatsoever. As for your Kinsfolks and worldly friends, at your
Grave they will leave you, and within a while after forget you: and shortly
after that, shall dye themselves, and be forgotten themselves also. Your goods
will be fawning upon other men, as soon as the breath shall be out of your body:
and even as they served you, so are they ready to scrue an other, and perhaps
to his perdition, without the special grace of God. To conclude, lift up your
heart, and call together your wits, which are dispersed and diuersely affected
to things which are corruptible, and fall not from God, for things that are so
deceytfull and vain. A battle must be, no question: No triumph is obtained
without fight, neither any Garlande given, but to him that manfully stands
in the Lord. If any sorrow be found in death, it arises but of our own
infyrme or desperate fear: for death is but a swyfte flyghte or passage of the
soul from the corruptible body, rather to be desired then to be fled from of
men. God is the rewarder of this conflict, and heaven is the eternal stipend.
Wherefore, let these gifts provoke you to esteem this battle the lighter:
for cheerfully shall you pass after death, into y^ pleasant Camps of heaven,
which place is convenient for those y^ have minded heavenly things. The saints
of heaven will receive you as a friendly co^panio^ of theirs into y^ portalles
of cleerenes, whereas you shall find very glorious abiding. Thus shall you (at
the last) come from grievous cares and from large continuing troubles into a
peceable rest and mansion of quietness. In the Paradise above or like place of
pleasure among the departed Saints, shall be your continuance, having all the
heavens at your pleasure. A celestial song will be uttered at those recreations,
and so sweet melodies as are able to move the Stars. With the Saints, I say,
departed hence shall you live, and with them shall you reign in heaven with
your Redeemer: so much glory hereafter shall you have, and so much heavenly
honor. What should I say? In that place is eternal pleasure, and a life
replenished with perpetual felicytie: yea, in that place shall the glory of
the Godhead be revealed unto you, and seen with your very eyes: even with
those your eyes of flesh, which from the foundations of the world has bine
hidden from mankind in this his mortalitye. Fynallye, there shall you wait
upon the Lamb, your Savior Jesus, who surely loves you and reioyseth that he
has saved you. God Cosen, assure your self that in this blessed place you
must needs be.

And that as surely as your Savior lived here upon the earth, so surely you
must and shall reign with him in the heavens. For there is he, there is that
Savior your head who can not nor will not be separated from any of his
members. As for the weight of Sin, how heavy, how heinous, how huige and
burdensome soever it be, cast it all upon him, for therefore he dyed, and not
for small sins only, but for all the sins that mankind has committed,
does or shall commit from the beginning of the world to the end of the
same. It is his only and great glory to be a Savior. And for that cause is
he ascended to the heavens in our flesh, and will in no wise deceive those
poor seely ones upon the earth that cling unto him for help and salvation.
And whereas (happily) you may fear, because of the weakness of your faith, which
now in your extreme and last battle (if so to be the Lord have appointed
it unto you) is diversely assailed and assaulted: Be of good comfort and
pluck up your courage, for that meek Savior will not cast you of: no, he
will not cast of his seelye creature though he be hable to touch but the
hemme of his vesture. It is toulde us in the sacred scriptures that he will not
quench the smoking flax nor break the bruised Reed. O, he is gentle, and
will make all perfect that in the poor soul of man is imperfect. He knows
and has felt how hard a thing it is for poor man, to stand upon his legs,
when he has to deal with those ghostly and ghastly emmies: Satan, the world,
and the flesh: but especially in the Agonye of death. O how well acquaiuted, is
he with those conflicts? Fear not Cowse^, fear not: If your faith be but as a
grain of Musterdseede, you shall be saved. That Savior has said it. And as for
those wounds and skarres that these bloody enemies have made or shall make in
your feeble soul, that heavenly Samaritane shall bind them up again, and
shall supple them with the oil of his grace, so that they shall not hinder you
a whit. He will in no wise disdain you, no: although you were as foul as a
Leaper. For what are they but sins? what are they (I say) but soul and
loathsome sins that his precious blood has washed and shall wash away in
mankind, so long as mankind shall have place and abiding in the Tabernacle
of sinful flesh? He knows, yea, he knows and that thoroughly, what poor man
is and whereof he is made. And as he knows him, so he pittieth him, and
thereof has given him a a sure and everlasting Testimony: For he has dyed for
him: he has dyed, (I say) for man, that man might live with him for ever be
saved. In him therefore be comforted, and upon him only repose your whole
confidence, to the last gasp of your life: say unto him, if not with a loud
and strong voice, yet softly in your sick soul. Lord Jesu receive my spirit.
Come Lord and make haste. Into thy hands Lord I commend my spirit. etc. And so
saying, weight patiently when he shall come unto you, and put a final end to
your happy conflycte. To the same Lord, being God in Trinitye, with the father
and the holy Ghost, be all honor praise and glory eternally.

Amen.
